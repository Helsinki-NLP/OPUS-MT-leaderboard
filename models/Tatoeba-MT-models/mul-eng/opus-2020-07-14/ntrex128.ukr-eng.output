Members of the Welsh Assembly are worried that they're going to be "cooperating with maps"
Some CHAs are afraid to change the name of their position to the "Member of the Welsh Parliament" (MWP).
This recommendation was made through the plan to change the name of the Assembly to the House of Wales.
THE whole political spectrum is worried that this can make fun of smiles.
A CHA from the labyrinth claimed that his group was worried about Twp and Pwp.
For readers beyond Wales: twp in English means "uncompressed", and pwp means a failure action.
WHO from the Wales Party said that his group was "not satisfied" and offered alternatives.
One of the Welsh conservators said his group was "unpredicted" about the change of name, but pointed out that MWP could quickly become "mappet".
In this context, the word 'w' is similar to the English word 'u' in Greek.
The Committee of the Assembly, which is currently developing legislation to amend the names, noted: “The remaining decision on the new name of the Assembly will undoubtedly be taken by its own members. ”
The 2017 Wales Self - Control Act gives the Assembly the right to change its name.
In June the Committee published the results of the public debate on the proposals, and the conversion of the Assembly to the Parliament of Wales was widely supported.
As for what is called CHA, the Commission proposes to call them "members of the Welsh Parliament", the WMP, but the MWP option has received the highest public support.
Of course, it is suggested that alternatives be offered, but efforts to reach agreement may lead to problems with leading Elena Jones, who should be given a bill on change over the course of a few weeks.
The reform legislation will include other changes to the work of the Assembly, including the rules for the separation of the CA and the structure of the committee system.
THAT will be the final vote on their new name when the law is discussed.
Macedonians will vote in the referendum on the change in the country's name
On Sundays, elections are being held about whether to change the name of the country to the Republic of Northern Macedonia.
The vote was organized to resolve a multi-year dispute with neighbor Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Affini have long claimed that the name of their northern neighbour is a claim in Greece, and they have repeatedly opposed Macedonian membership in the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President George Ivanov, who is opposed to the referendum on the change of name, stated that the results of the vote would be ignored.
However, the rapporteurs among which Prime Minister Zoran Zeev claims that the change in the name is simply a price that must be paid after accession to the EU and NATO.
Saint Martin's calls to speak because the churches of Harlem survive difficult times
"The old people I've met say there was a bar and church in every box before," says Mr. Adams.
Now there is nothing else. ”
He thinks that the disappearing of the leaves can be understood:
"In our time people are socializing with each other.
Bari is no longer the local health centre where they go on a regular basis.’
As for the churches, Adam fears that the money from the sale of assets will not last as long as the leaders are expected, and “they will find it early or later where they started. ”
The churches, he added, can replace homes with condominiums, and there will be people who will not help the saints who have stayed close to them.
“Most people who buy condominiums in these houses will be white, ” Adams explained,“so it will be the day when all these churches are closed, because it is unlikely that most of those who move to condominiums will become their guests.”
Both churches were built by white towns before Harlem became a black Metropolis: the Metropolis church was built in 1870, and St. Martin was built ten years later.
The crown was a white methodical graffiti from the 1930s.
The black village, which was just a short distance away, was entitled to property on the building.
St. Martin moved to the black town under the direction of a similar John Howard Johnson, who led the fight of dealers in 125 Street, the main Harlem street. These traders did not want to take the blacks and raise them to service.
In 1939 a fire badly damaged the building, but Johnson’s father’s paraffins wanted to restore it and set it up as a carillion.
A beautiful David Johnson, the son and successor of Johnson's father in St. Martini, proudly called Carillion "the call of the poor."
The expert who played the carillion in July called it another "cultural treasure" and "unchanged historical tool".
This expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the first in the world to play a black artist, Dionysio A. Lind, who spent 18 years in a larger career in the Riverside Church.
According to Mr. Merrivezer, there was no replacement in St. Martin.
What's happening in St. Martin over the last few months is a complex story of architects and contractors, some of whom were connected by church leaders, others by the Episcopal Episcopal Episcopals.
The Council, the governing body of the parafia composed of the leaders of the Mirjans, wrote in July that it was worried that the Europeans would be “suspending on spending” the joy of not taking part in the smallest architects and contractors sent by the Europeans.
Some paraffins have been relieved of the lack of hearings on the part of the European Union.
Acula was raped by a 13-year-old boy who was kidnapped by the Lobsters in California
According to official figures, on Saturday, the shark attacked a 13-year-old boy and abused him, and he was beaten by the Lobsters in California on the day of the opening of the Lobster season.
An attack took place about 7: 00 a.m. near the beach of Bikon in Ensinitas.
Chad Hammel told the KSWB-TV channel in San Diego that he had already spent about half an hour with his friends in the morning when he heard that the boy wanted help, and together with a group of people came to him to get out of the water.
At first Hammel thought that it was just a trap for a saved lobbyer, but then he realized that the boy was screaming, "I'm in a hurry!
They tried me!"
As soon as he got to the boy, he saw that his key was completely broken.
"I called everyone to get out of the water, "In the water of the eagle!" Hammel added.
The boy was taken to the gintocryl of the Child Hospital in San Diego, where he is in critical condition.
The type of shark that attacked is unknown.
Captain Larry Jayles told me that a couple of weeks ago, in this area, he noticed the shark, but it was established that it did not refer to dangerous shark species.
Jailz added that the victim received traumatized damage from the top of the tube.
In an effort to investigate and protect the government for 48 hours, access to the beach from the Ponto beach in Casabladi to Swam in Ensinitas.
Jailz noted that there are more than 135 species of sharks in this area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to go to the British cosmetic market
Sainsbury's is going to compete with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams through space-like islands like those in the universe.
As a result of a forced outlet on the British cosmetic market, the price of 2.8 billion pounds of Sterling (increased when the volume of clothing and household goods is reduced) increases in cosmetics will be protested in 11 stores across the country. The next year, if the idea appears successful, the islands will appear in other stores.
Investments in cosmetics are related to the fact that supermarkets are looking for ways to use the polynomial space that was previously used under television, microwave ovens and household goods.
In Sainsbury's, they say that they double their cosmetics and offer up to 3,000 goods, among which there are brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The existing assortment of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees has more space: there are brand-new zones, like those that are in the shops of the Boots.
Supermarket also updates the assortment of Boutique cosmetics: most of the goods presented will not now be protested on animals, which are increasingly demanded by young buyers.
In addition, the trader Fragrance Shop protests his flights in two Sainsbury's stores: the first flight was opened in Croatia, north London last week, and the second was opened in Selly-Ouk, Burma, later this year.
Internet shopping and shopping for small amounts of food each day in small shops enables supermarkets to make additional efforts to connect visitors.
Mike Kuppe, executive director of Sainsbury's, said that their stores will become more like the university, as the supermarket network is trying to resist the Aldi and Lidl disconents through more services and non-food goods.
Sainsbury's are opening up the Argos divisions in hundreds of their shops, as well as a number of Habits.
The previous attempt by the supermarket to update cosmetics and pharmaceutical products was unsuccessful.
Sainsbury's was tested with Boots at the beginning of 2000, but she ended up after arguing about how to divide the proceeds from the appetite in the supermarkets.
The new strategy came after Sainsbury's sold its patent business (281) Celesio, owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy network, 125 million pounds three years ago.
They agreed that Lloyds would help to add an enlarged assortment of luxury brands for skin care, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hix, the commercial director of Sainsbury, said: "We have changed the appearance of our space islands to make the atmosphere more pleasant for buyers.
We also invested in special-educated consultants who can give advice.
We are presented with a brandy approach called to meet any needs, and the pleasant situation and the comfortable location of the place means that we are now a pleasant place to buy cosmetics, which will become an old way of buying".
Peter Jones was "dissolved" because Holly Willowby came out of the 11 million pounds of styrling
The “Ligvo Dragon” star Peter Johns is “dissolved” because TV broadcaster Holly Willowby came out of his life-sale store (value of the deal is 11 million pounds) to focus on new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV
Willowby doesn't have time for the domestic clothing brand and Truly's accessories.
The money business was linked to the Goop Gwent Peltro brand.
The 37-year-old program leader This Morning announced his entrance to Instagram.
Holly Willowby brought the "Ligvo Dragon" star, Peter Jones, when she finally left their profit business for life to focus on new successful contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Gerella reports that Johns "soldiers", when a gold girl from the television came out during a forced meeting at John's business headquarters in Marlow, Bakingemshire, that her new deal with 1.5 million pounds of streling means that she no longer has enough time to devote her to their joint store of home clothes and accessories.
This business was linked to the Goop Gwent Peltro's brand and had to double the Willowby article, which is estimated at 11 million pounds of stelling.
When 37-year-old Willowby told Instagram that he was leaving Truly, Johns flew from Great Britain to one of his homes to rest.
Geraldo reported: “Truly, no doubt, was Holly’s main priority.
He had to be her long - term future for the next few decades.
Willowby’s decision to leave the business got all the interested parties involved.
No one could believe what happened on Friday, almost in advance.
At the headquarters in Marlow, I've got a full set of things ready for sale.
Experts believe that this morning’s arrival, one of the highest - paying stars in Britain, could cost millions of companies through large investment in goods (from shower and candle to clothing and household clothing) and create further delays.
It can also mean the end of a long friendship.
The mother of three children, Willowby and her husband, Dan Baldwin, were close to Jones and his wife, Tarry Kapp for ten years.
Willowby and Kapp created Truly in 2016, and 52-year-old Jones joined as the head of the government in March.
Together, Johns presides over 40 percent of the shares of the Bolivian companies, which are involved in television production.
Willowby will be an ambassador to the M&S brand and will replace Anthony Macpartetlin as a visiting I'm A Celebrity on the ITV.
Geraldo, who approached Johns, said last night, "We won't comment on his business."
"And then we fell in love"
He complained about the criticism received from news media about a comment that would be considered “unpresiding, ” as well as a very positive attitude toward North Korea’s leader.
“Why did President Trump go to such great proceedings?,
said Trip, embodying the voice of the visiting news. —
I'm not going anywhere."
He noted that Kim was interested in the second meeting after Trap called their first meeting in Singapore in the red step toward the denuclearization of North Korea.
But the negotiations on denuclearization took place in an empty corner.
More than three months after the red summit in Singapore, a leading diplomat in North Korea, Riy Young Ho, told world leaders at the UN General Assembly that North Korea does not see the "response" reaction from the United States to its first phase of disarmament.
Rather, he noted that the United States continues to receive sanctions aimed at supporting pressure.
In speaking on his own behalf, Trump was much more optimistic.
"We have a good relationship with North Korea," he said.
We were going to fight in North Korea.
Millions of people would be killed.
We now have such a wonderful relationship. ”
He said that his efforts to improve his relationship with Kim resulted in positive results: the end of rocket tests, the release of prisoners, and the return of the rest of American military personnel to their homes.
He also protected his unusual approach when he spoke of his relationship with Kim.
"It's easy to behave as presidential, but instead of 10,000 people on the streets trying to get into this hit stage, we have about 200 people standing right there," Trup said, pointing to the crowd directly before him.
The tsunamis and earthquakes in Indonesia destroyed hundreds of islands
In particular, after the earthquake in Lombo, it was said that international nonprofit organizations did not need their help.
Although more than 10 percent of the Lombo people have suffered, the national disaster has not been declared, and it is a prelude to international aid.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they clearly understood that they were not looking for international assistance, so it was difficult," said Mrs. Sumbong.
Although the “Let the Children Go ” collects a commission to travel to Paul, we do not know whether foreign personnel can work in the area.
Mr. Sutopo, a representative of the National Agency for Disaster Relief, said that the Indonesian government is assessing the situation in Paul to determine whether to allow international organizations to provide assistance.
Considering that earthquakes continue to occur in Indonesia, the country remains extremely unsatisfying in nature.
In the province of Ache, there are wells built from tsunamis, but they are not characteristic of other coastal areas.
There was apparently no siren warning about the tsunamis in Paul’s day, even though warnings were effective, likely to cause death.
Moving between numerous Indonesian islands is not just the best time.
Stoic damage is becoming more and more complex.
A medical vessel that lived in Lombo for the treatment of the victims of earthquakes moves to Paul, but reaching a new disaster can be at least three days away.
President Joko Wiidodo has improved Indonesia’s infrastructure through his election campaign and has increased the cost of roads and trains.
But the lack of funding has created problems for the administration of Mr. Joe, who plans to reopen next year.
Ms. Joko also notes the existence of an interconfessian enemy in those parts of Indonesia, where members of the majority of Muslims chose a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people have died, tens of thousands have been displaced from their homes as a result of opposition to Christian and Muslim gangs on streets using swords, spears, arrows, and other attractive weapons.

The state of Cromwell near Parliament becomes a new reminder that suffers from "recording history"
The removal of the statue would be due to the destruction in the Taliban style of many of England's cultural and religious artifacts, which led to its fantastic Puritans followers.
But Cremwell's team called the proposal by Mr. Cricka "the door" and "the attempt to re-write the story".
John Goldsmith, head of the Cromville Society, said: “In view of the current debate on the removal of the status, the fact that Oliver Cromvel's status at the Westminster Palace has become a movement has been a thing of the past. ”
The iconography during the English civil war did not occur either at Cromwell himself or at his command.
It is unlikely that Cromwell would be sacrificed for the actions of his predecessor Thomas in the first century.
The great statue of Cromwell's sculptor William Hamo Torneicroft is the testimony of the 19th century’s setting and part of the history of becoming, which many think is still worth considering.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Many people, probably more at the end of the 19th century than now, consider Cromwell as a guardian of parliament from outside the press, in his case, of course, monarchy.
Whether that is correct is the subject of historical debates that persist.
There is no doubt that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century has identified the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is one of the most famous articles that represent one side of this conflict.
His achievement as the Lord-protector should also be marked and respected."
The pig-killer destroyed the Chinese farmer until he died
According to local media reports, the farmer was attacked and killed by a pig on the market in southern China.
The man, identified only by the name of Yuan, was found dead in the blood with a broken artery near the market in Lippanshu, the province of Guchiu, reported the South China Morning Post on Sunday.
In China, China, China, on May 30, 2005, a pig is slaughtered in a pigyard.
It is reported that in the middle he went out with his twin brother from the neighboring province of June to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, the brother found his dead brother and saw the door open.
The brother said there was a big box of blood in the kitchen.
A medical expert confirmed that 249 kilograms of copper destroyed the farm until death.
“ My twin brother’s legs were in the blood and were turned into blood, ” said a two - year - old brother with the name Vu, quoted by Guiyang Evening News.
The record of the security cameras showed that John entered the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to provide his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The creature that killed a man did not belong to Yuan or his twin brother.
The chief of the market told Evening News that when the police collected evidence at the scene, the pig was closed to prevent her attack on people.
It turns out that seven of us, Juan and the market administration, are discussing compensation for his death.
Although it is rare, the incidents of a swine attack on people were more serious than ever.
In 2016 the pigs attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, U.S.A., and killed a man with critical injuries.
Ten years before that pig, 295 kg of fermented eggs were pressed into tractors until the farmer’s wife was pregnant.
After a farmer from Oregon ate his own pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba declared CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive, but blood can be a "trigger".
"They're just playing.
They're like children, very curious... they don't want to hurt you.
You should just treat them with proper respect," he said.
Rosa’s remains will bring widespread floods to the south west of the United States
As it has been predicted, the hurricane of Rosa weakens by moving over the more cold waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
But in the near future, Rose will bring rain and rain to the north of Mexico and the south-west of the United States.
Rosa had a wind speed of 137 km per hour (this category 1) at 5 a.m. in the morning after sunrise on Sunday and was 620 km south-west from Punta Evgenia, Mexico.
It's supposed to be going north on Sunday.
At that time over the Pacific, it begins to form an inlet that moves east to the western coast of the United States. When on Monday, when Rose is approaching the south of Lower California in the face of a tropical storm, it begins to push a strong tropical wind north to the south coast of the United States.
On Monday, Rosa brings up to 25.4 cm of rain in some parts of Mexico.
In the next few days, the tropical wind that connects with the nearby volcano creates powerful waves in the south.
In this area, from 2,54 to 10,2 inches [2,54 - 10.2 cm], the water causes dangerous evaporation, evaporation, and potential in the desert.
A strong tropical wind will result in an increase in the number of places up to 5 to 7.6 cm per hour, especially in some parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
5-10.2 cm of rain is expected in some parts of the south-west, especially in the great territory of Arizona.
The leftovers are possible when the conditions are severed by the spread of tropical rainwater.
We are very happy not to go to the sandy desert, as possible tropical floods.
A strong rain can cause canyons to bulging rivers, and the money will bring here the destruction of winds and billows.
In some parts of northern California’s northern coast, the approach causes heavy rains.
The number of accidents can exceed 1,27 cm, resulting in an insatiable flow of dirt and narrow roads.
It's going to be the first left in the region in the rain season.
Some scattered tropical waves begin to approach Arizona late in the afternoon and in the afternoon, and in the evenings, the rain will become even larger.
A strong rain will go over For Corners from the middle.
In the autumn, intense temperatures can be observed in all parts of the United States, as the Arctic is colder, but the tropics remain warm enough.
This sometimes results in a variety of changes in temperature in short distances.
A wonderful example of a variety of temperatures in the central part of the United States will be observed on Sunday.
It's almost 7 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omah, the state of Nebraska, as well as between St. Louis and De-Mions, the state of Iowa.
During the next few days, the summer heat tries to return and grow again.
It is expected that in a large area of the center and the east of the United States, temperatures will rise from the south to some of the north-west will be 27 degrees Celsius.
The temperature in New York can reach 27 degrees Celsius per second, about 12 degrees Celsius above average temperature.
According to our long-term forecast, there is a high probability of an increase in average temperatures in the east of the United States in the first half of October.
More than 20 million people were watched listening to Bretta Cavano
Four times more than 20 million people on six television networks were watching the impressive testimony of a candidate at the post of Supreme Court of Brett Cavano and Christine Blaise Ford, a woman who accused him of sexual violence, which was likely happening in the 1980s.
The political opposition continued, the canals interrupted planned programs to report on the last new Friday: agreement prepared by Senator Arisoni Jeff Fleek, to conduct a joint investigation by the FBI on charges.
Ford told the Senate's Court Committee that she was 100 percent convinced that Cavano had made her drink and tried to take off her clothes for dinner at the senior school.
In her emotional testimony, Cavano said that he was 100 percent convinced that it was not.
It's pretty likely that on Friday, more than 20.4 million people were watching what Nielsen's research company reported.
The company counted CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Could not get numbers on other networks that also showed listening, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
In Nielsen, too, problems arise with measuring the number of people watching television in the offices.
For comparison, such an audience size is similar to an audience that looks at the top of the play-off series or the Oscar premium.
Fox News Channel, whose audiences strongly supported Kavano’s appointment, was the leader of all the channels during the day - long service, with an average number of 5.69 million viewers in Nielsen.
ABC was another 3.26 million spectators.
According to the representatives of Nielsen, CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million, CNN 2.52 million.
The interest remained high after listening.
Flyk became the center of the fifth play.
The office of this moderate republican has published a statement that he will vote for Cavano. After that Friday morning, CNN and CBS cameras identified how protestors screamed at Flyk when he tried to go to the elevator to listen to the Court Committee.
He stood with his eyes closed for a few minutes during which he was lying, passing through a direct flow of CNN.
“ I am standing right before you, ” said one woman.
Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?
They said, “You have authority over us, and you have no authority over us.”
Flyk reported that his office had published a statement and, before closing the letter, added what he would say more to the committee’s hearing.
All cables and broadband channels were directly transpired hours later, when the Court’s committee had to vote on the application of the Kavan candidate to the Senate to vote in full.
Flyk said he'd do this only if he knew that the FBI was considering charges against the candidate next week, which required democratic minority.
Flyk was partially convinced by the dissidents with his friend, Senator-Democrat Chris Kuns.
After talking to Kunsa and then with several other senators, Flyk made a decision.
Flyk’s choice had an effect, since it was evident that the Republicans would not have votes to appoint Cavano’s candidate without investigation.
President Trump initiated an investigation by the FBI on charges against Cavano.

Who shot in Wayda Sims: Police arrested Dayton Simpson for suspecting the death of a player at the University of Louisiana
The police arrested the suspect in the shooting, which led to the death of Wayda Sims, a 20-year-old basketballist from the University of Louisiana.
The 20-year-old Dayton Simpson was arrested and sent to prison for murder at the second stage, reported to the Baton Rouge Police Department.
The authorities published a video of opposition between Simms and Simpson, and the police reported that Sims lost eyeglasses during the war.
According to the affiliated WAFB CBS, the police removed the scene of the crime and noted that they had found the Simpson DNA.
After questioning Simpson, the police reported that he had found out that he had shot Wade.
According to the lawyer, he was awarded a loan of $350,000.
The East Baton Rouge office has highlighted the previous story on Friday, which indicates that the cause of death is a fire wound to the head and neck.
The Department expresses its appreciation for the search of police fugitives in the state of Louisiana, the state's criminal police lab, the South University police, and local citizens for the help of the investigation that led to the arrest.
The sports director of the University of Louisiana, Joe Alleva, thanked local law enforcement authorities for “the age and desire for justice”.
Simsu was 20 years old.
Forvard grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball at the University of Louisiana.
In the last season, the average result was 5.6 balls and 2.6 teams.
On Friday morning, a basketball coach at the University of Louisiana, Will Wayed, said that the command was "destroyed" and "shocked" to the death of Wade.
"That's what worries you all the time," said Wade.
volcanic eruptions in Mexico
The populace, which excavates the Popacapetel volcano, reaches the southern regions of the capital of Mexico.
The National Center for the Prevention of Natural Disasters on Saturday called on Mexicans to stay away from the volcano, since the crater began to work and 183 gas and fuel emissions were registered for 24 hours.
The center was following a number of woods and posts.
Photo by social networks shows a thin layer of smoke on the labyrinth of cars in Mexico, such as Hochimilko.
The geophysics noted the increase in the activity of the volcano, which is 45 miles (72 km) south of the capital, after the earthquake hit 7.1 blocks in central Mexico in September 2017.
Vulcan, known as Don Goo, has been active since 1994.
The police met with Catalan separatists before the vote for independence
Six men were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after the protestors, who acted independently, joined the police department. Thousands of people joined in protest demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of the Catalan vote on division.
The proseparatist group in the masks, which the specialists were holding, broke them with eggs and a purple color, which created dark bubbles on streets where tourists were usually completely familiar with them.
The riots took place and later that day, the police used the police to stop the aggression.
A few hours later, a group of independent asylum seekers who complained, “We won’t forget, we won’t forgive!”
According to the local press report, fourteen people were helped by the relief of the wounds suffered during the protests.
A year after the referendum on October 1, which was recognized by Madrid as illegal, it is marked by Catholic separatists, the tension in the region that longs for independence remains high.
The voters made a major decision about independence, but it seemed to be low, since most who opposed the division were afraid of voting.
According to the Catholic government, almost 1,000 people were injured in violent encounters last year as a result of police efforts to stop voting in electoral departments throughout the region.
The independent groups spent the night on Friday night in the halls to avoid demonstrations in support of the national police.
The demonstration took place but had to go on another route.
68-year-old Narciss Termes, an electric who participated in a separatist protest with his wife, said that he no longer had any hope that Catalan could get independent.
"In the past year we survived one of our best moments.
I watched my parents cry out for joy that they can vote, but now we’re in the middle of the corner, ” he said.
Despite the vital importance of life, but very complex victory over regional elections in December last year, the Catholic parties that are acting independently failed to keep the momentum of this year, as many of their most prominent leaders are in voluntary expulsion or in awaiting court for their participation in the referendum and further declared independence.
Hoan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who took a stand for the police on the phone, said that the conflict was caused by politicians on both sides.
“ Marriage is strengthening, ” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Hunkers, one of nine Catalan leaders, who are in the follow-up isolate from last year, announced that he would fight to the European Parliament next year.
"The status of the candidate in the European elections is the best way to judge the regression of democratic values and repressions we observe from the Spanish government," he said.
Londoners: The men were arrested after the car entered the house
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 were arrested after a couple of times in London's house.
The incident took place in Balingard-Crescent at 4:30 p.m. at the British standard time.
Detective Bob Bloomings noted that the storm was damaged and the house itself.
It's quite possible that at some point on the car, they were shot off the plane.
Mangy's hit provided Lvivingstone victory over Rangers with account 1-0
The first valley of Downhill Mangy in the Levingstone complex became a victory
The class in Lvivingston won the Reddingers and brought Steven Gerard a second match to 18 games as the director of the Ibros Club.
The Dolly Mangy strike was decisive: command Gary Holt in a second went up one level from Hibernate.
Commander Gerard won't win any victory on his way to Premier League this season, and the next week he's playing with Harts' leaders, from which she's left eight eyes.
Before that, in the fourth "Ringers" will accept "Rapid Vidente" within the European League.
At that time, Livingstone continued to move to six games in the district, and the chief coach Holt had not been able to take any chances since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
"Livegston" offers the opportunities that give the unsatisfied guests.
The Holt's command was to be ahead long before they were killed, because their directness creates all the problems of the Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke through the defense, but hit a long door, and then Alan Litgo broke the door after he had opposed and accepted Craig Halket's attack, which he had made with his head.
The gentlemen were pleased that they had allowed the Rangers to play before them, and they knew that they could pose problems for guests from standard positions.
So it was a decisive hole.
The Rangers missed a free strike, and Levengston discovered that Declan Galler and Robinson had taken over Mango, who had taken the sword and killed from the capital.
At this stage, the Rangers were dominated by the ruling sword, but the protection of the field was shown to them as an inexhaustible and the conquerors of Liam Kelly were no longer concerned.
This trend continued in another team, although Alfredo Morelos was able to strike in the direction of Kelly.
Scott Pittman's hit on the leg of the Rangers Major.
Navies were constantly flying into the Lvivingstone and were continually neutralized, and two applications were rejected after the attack of Halket on Glenna Medellon, who was replaced by the hand.
"Livegstone" phenomenon: analysis
Assador Lamont from BBC Scotland on the "Toni Macaroni Arena" stadium
The Finnish game and the result "Lovingstone".
They all played each other, they continued to raise their expectations on this eastern trajectory.
Their style of play and composition has not changed in practice after returning to the highest level, but should be given the appropriate Holt for how he mobilized the command after his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett played a great, well-organized defense, and Menga forced Connor Goldson and Joe Warral to remain vigilant.
The Rangers, however, had no inspiration.
They used to play very well under the leadership of Gerard, but now they do not really adhere to those standards.
They didn't have the last sword -- they just broke the defense of the fields -- and that was something like a wake-up for the Rangers, which was found in the middle of the table.
Erdogan was warmly welcomed in Kelney
On Saturday (September 29th), when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met in Berlin, there was a smile and a blue sky.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany to renew relations between NATO allies.
Among them were some contradictions on issues such as human rights, freedom of press and access to the EU.
Then Erdogan moved to Kelna to open a large new tower.
The city has the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police didn't allow 25,000 people to meet in front of the meeting, but many of the president's guests still appeared close to see him.
Hundreds of protestors against Erdotan — among them a number of traitors — have also forced themselves to hear — Judge Erdogan’s policy and the German government’s decision to ask him to go to the country.
Bilateral protests testify to the inconsistencies of the guest, some German Turks called the hero, and others are dictators.
A road accident in Depford: A driver died in a car crash
A passenger died in a car crash in London.
The accident took place near the crossing of Bejjed Street and Evelyn Street on the narrow road in the Deptford region in the south-west of the city about 10:15 a.m. after the British standard time.
The water stopped, and the paramedics came to the scene, but the man died.
This accident occurred a few months after the other driver died after running from the crash site at the Chailders Street, about 1.6 km from the weekend.
The London police said that they were working on the establishment of a man to inform his closest relatives.
The traffic has been banned and bus routes have been changed, and car drivers are advised to avoid this area.
Long-Larten Prison: Six prisoners were tortured in an accident
Six prisoners were injured as a result of a man-in-law incident, reported to the prison administration.
The breach in her Long-Larth Prison in Woostershire began about 9:30 a.m. after the British standard time on Sunday and still continues.
In order to stop the disturbance, the eight of them started in jail and located in one wing, a special section called "Tornado".
The officers provided medical assistance in connection with the simple facial injuries received at the scene.
The prison service representative commented: "In order to resolve an incident that continues in the prison of her Majesty Long-Larten, a specially prepared prison staff have been arrested.
Six employees received medical assistance in connection with injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and we clearly understand that those responsible for the police and the fear of their stay behind the camps can be compounded."
In the prison of Her Majesty Long-Larton, more than 500 prisoners, among whom the most dangerous criminals in the country are.
It was reported in June that the prison chief was sent to the hospital after the arrest.
In October last year, a police specialty was called to stop the serious harassment in which the prisoners were attacked by billiards.
Uragan Rosa is threatening Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with left-handed waves (this may be useful in nearby areas)
Tropical depression rarely strikes Arizona, but that can happen at the beginning of the next week, since the rest of Rose’s hurricane are heading south through the deserts, creating a risk of left - handed movements.
The National Weather Service has already issued a warning on the left-hand side on Mondays and Fridays in the territory of West Arizona to the south and east of Nevada, Southern California and Yuta, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaf, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It is expected that Rosa will walk straight through Phoenix on Friday, and tonight will be rain.
The national emergency service in Phoenix has indicated in Twitter that only ten tropical cycles have saved the status of tropical storm or depression in 200 miles (322 km) from Phoenix since 1950,
Catherine (1967) was a hurricane of 40 miles (64.4 km) from the Arizona border.
According to the latest projections of the National Centre of hurricanes, in the Mogollon-Rôme region in Arizona, it is estimated to be 5.08 to 10.16 cm, and places up to 15.24 cm below sea level.
Other areas of the south-west desert, including the central part of the Skelest Mountains and the Great Basin, are probably from 2,54 to 5,08 cm of land, possibly up to 10,16 cm.
Where there is no risk of leftovers, Rosie’s rain can be a blessing because the region suffers from drought.
Although the floods are a very serious problem, some of these diseases are likely to be beneficial, since the south-west is now experiencing drought.
According to the U.S. Forest Monitoring Center, some 40 percent of Arizona’s areas suffer at least from extreme drought, which is the second highest drought category, reports weather.com.
First of all, the route of the Rosa era leads to the drought on the Mexican peninsula of Lower California.
Rosa, still in power on Sunday morning with a maximum wind speed of 137 km per hour, is 620 km south of Punta Evgenia, Mexico, and moves north at 19.3 km per hour.
The temperature is getting worse by the colder water in the Pacific.
Thus, it is expected that the greenhouse gas emissions from the greenhouse are caused by hurricanes in Mexico or by hurricanes in the morning or in the evening.
The number of accidents in some parts of Mexico may be significant, creating a significant risk of injury.
“It is expected that the total number of floods from Lower California to north-west Sonor will be from 7.62 to 15.24 cm, possibly up to 25.4 cm,” reports weather.com.
Next Rosa goes north through Mexico as a tropical storm, gets around Arizona early in the morning as a tropical depression that goes on through Arizona, and then later in the winter comes south of Yutsu.
"The main danger expected by Rosie or her remnants is the very strong floods in Lower California, north-west Sonor and in the southwestern part of the U.S. desert," the National Centre of Urgans reports.
It is expected that these rivers will lead to life - threatening floods and flooding in the deserts, as well as droughts in the mountainous region.
Midsomer-Norton attack: arrested by four persons who committed murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested under suspicion of murder after they found a 16-year-old boy with a knife wound in Summerset.
An early teenager was found in the Excelsier-Terras region in Midsomer-Norton about 04:00 after the British standard time on Saturday.
He was brought to a hospital where he remained in a stable.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and 20-year-old men were arrested last night in Radstok's area, reported by the police to Eivona and Somerset.
The police are asking to respond to everyone who can have any video of these events on the phone.
Tramp says Kavano's "patriots of subordination and anger" of the Democratic Party
"Cavano's vote is a vote against the unwarranted and disgusting tactics of the Democratic Party," said Trip on Wednesday, West Virginia.
Tramp said that Cavano was “patience and anger ” of the Democratic Party during the entire dedication process.
Cavano witnessed before the Congress in four, inconsequential and emotionally opposed to Christine Blaise Ford’s accusation that he had committed sexual violence for several decades when they were teenagers.
Ford also gave a witness on the hearing of the charges brought against her.
On Saturday, the president said that on that day “the American people saw the closeness, character and courage” in Cavano.
"Cavano's vote is one of the most perfect lawyers of our time, a lawyer with an unexplained experience of state service," he said to a group of guests in the West Virginia.
The president made a frank statement about the independence of Cavano when he spoke of the importance of the role of the republicans in the medium-term elections.
"Five weeks will be one of the most important choices in our life.
I'm not running, but I'm really running,' he said.
That's why I'm fighting for great candidates everywhere."
The Tempp claimed that the democratic mission is “to resist and oppose. ”
It is expected that the first key procedural vote in the Senate on the Candace will take place not later than Friday, the CNN assistant told one of the leaders of the Republicans.
Hundreds of people died from earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia, and the number of victims increased
At least 384 people were killed, many fell into the ocean when giant moments fell on the beach as a result of intense earthquakes and tsunamis on the Indonesian island of Solavesi, declared the country’s government on Saturday.
Hundreds of people stayed at the beach festival in Paula on Friday, when they stood up to six feet (18 feet) high in the morning, swung the mountain, killing many at death and destroying everything on their way.
After the earthquake, the tsunami struck 7.5 miles [2.5 km].
"When the tsunamis came up yesterday, people were still busy on the beach and they didn't start running immediately, and they became victims," said a briefing at Jakarti Sutopo First Nugroho, a representative of the Indonesian agency for disaster relief (BNPB).
"It wasn't just tsunamis, it moved cars, trees, houses, it hit everything on the ground," Nugroho said, adding that before hitting the coastal line, the tsunamis passed through the open sea at 800 km per year (497 miles per year).
To save from the tsunamis, some people walked on the tree and survived, adding it.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Paul.
Aerophotosms published by the disaster relief agency show that many buildings and shops have been destroyed, bridges destroyed and destroyed, and water contaminated.
Posts in the coastal town continued on Saturday.
A group of earthquakes were felt in the area where 2.4 million people live.
The Indonesian Agency for Technology Assessment and Application (BPPT) stated that the energy generated by a strong earthquake on Friday was 200 times more than the energy of an atomic bomb fired at Hiroshima during World War II.
The geographical location of the city, which was at the end of a long, narrow bow, could have been a source of energy for the tsunamis, said the agency.
Nugroho called the “wide - scale ” slaughter and noted that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centers, and hotels have been destroyed.
The bodies of some victims were found under the walls of destroyed buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 lost without news.
Nugroho noted that victims and injuries could be more than 300 miles (190 km) along the coastal line north of Paul in the region called Donggal, which is located near the earthquake.
"The lines of communication were completely damaged, and we received no information," said Nogroho from Dongali.
More than 300,000 people live there, reports the Red Cross report, and it is also reported that its personnel and volunteers have moved to the affected areas.
"It is already a tragedy, but it can become much more," said the report.
On Saturday, the agency was criticized for not reporting that the tsunami had hit Paul, even though the officials said that the minutes had arrived at the time marked as a warning.
The amateurs, which people shared in social networks, are seen as a man on the top of the house echoes a shocking warning about the approaching tsunamis on the street under the building.
A few minutes later, the wall of the water came to the shore, taking with it the building and the car.
Reuters could not verify the authenticity of the frames immediately.
The earthquake and tsunamis have caused a serious depletion of power, which has broken the link around Paul, which has complicated the coordination of the movement.
Military personnel began sending emergency flights with the help of Jakarta and other cities, reports the government, but refugees still need food and other necessities.
The city airport has been opened only for help, and it will be closed until October.
President Jack Wiedado had to visit the evacuation centers in Paul on Sunday.
The number of tsunamis lost in Indonesia exceeds 800.
That's very bad.
The workers of the World Vision organization from Dongali came to the city of Paul, where they were hiding in the fireplaces set up at their office, but on the way they saw the demolition scene, said Mr. Doseb.
"They told me they saw many destroyed houses," he said.
That's very bad.
Even when relief teams began to take decisive action to alleviate the effects of disasters, some complained that international humanitarian workers with great experience would not be allowed to go to Paul.
According to Indonesian rules, funding, provision and provision of staff from the border may only begin if the place of injury is declared by the national disaster zone.
This hasn't happened yet.
“It is still a disaster at the level of the province, ” noted Auliya Ariani, representative of the Indonesian Red Cross. —
As the government says, "Well, it's a national disaster," we can accept international assistance, but this status is not given."
The second night, after a fifth earthquake and tsunami, Paul and his friends and family who had not yet been found, were still hoping that the appearance of their neighbor would become a miracle that would ensue these floods of natural disasters.
On Saturday, the little boy got out of the canal.
On Sunday, the rescuers found a woman lying in bed with her mother’s body for two days.
Hendon Subandano, a trainer of the Indonesian national team with parallelism, trained two missing parapelners to participate in the Asian games that had been held earlier this month in Indonesia.
Other parallelists who found themselves in the cave of Roa Roa Roa, including Mr. Mandage, were his disciples.
"As an elder in the field of parapolarism, I have my emotional burden," he said.
Mr. Hendon relates how a few hours after the news of the destruction of the Roa Roa Roa hotel spread among the parapolanists, he unexpectedly sent a message to Paul's opponents who participated in the beach festival.
However, his message was marked only by a single horn, not by a two - horned, horned horn.
"I think this means that the message was not delivered," he said.

Canya West: Reper changes its name to E
Reper Cany West changes its name to E.
On Saturday, announcing the change in Twitter, he wrote: “A former official known as Kanya West. ”
41-year-old Westa was sometimes called J, and he used this shortcut as a name for his album released in June.
The change occurred before his appearance at the Saturday Night Live show, where he is expected to present his new Yandhi album.
On the show, he replaces the singer Ariane Grande, who has lost his share for “emotional reasons, ” says the author of the show.
It's not just the shortness of the current professional name, West said earlier that this word has a religious meaning for him.
"I believe that "yes" is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means "you"," said West at the beginning of this year, discussing his album's name with the radio newsman Big Boy.
So I'm you, I'm us, I'm us.
Canya, which means "one", was short to just yes, it's just a picture of our good, our bad, our crazy, everything.
The album is more than a picture of who we are. ”
Kanya is one of several famous reperers who changed their name.
Shawn Combs, formerly known as Puff Daddy, P.D. and Diddy, announced this year that he had chosen the names of Lava and Brasser Lava.
The colleague of Westa, J.J.A., also experimented with defies and great letters.
President Andres Manuel Lopez of Mexico promises not to use the army against civilians
The newly elected president of Mexico, Andrés Manuel Lopez, promised never to use the army against civilians. Soon the country will mark the 50th anniversary of the charge against students.
On Saturday at Tlateloloko, Lopes Obrador promised: “Never use the army to provoke the Mexican people.”
On October 2, 1968, the military launched a peaceful demonstration in the area, killing about 300 people, and then, throughout Latin America, they started to set up a left student spirit.
Lopes Abrador promised to support young Mexicans by providing monthly grants to the learner and by opening up more expensive public universities.
He noted that the lack of employment and the lack of access to education lead young people to criminal groups.
The United States must double funding in the field of artificial intelligence
As China grows active in the field of artificial intelligence, the United States has to double the amount they spend on research in this galaxy, considers the investor and practice in the area of the Shi-Fu Lee, which was working on Google, Microsoft and Apple.
These comments were given after various parts of the U.S. government made statements about the UN, although there is no formal strategy in the United States.
Meanwhile, China has presented its last year's plan: it's looking forward to becoming No1 for innovation in the area of China by 2030.
"The double budget for the study of the SI would be a good start, considering that all other countries are too far away from the United States, and we are preparing for the next break in the SI area," said Lee.
The double funding can double the probability that the next major achievement in the area of the U.S. will be made in the United States, told Lee in the CBC interview this week.
Lee, who was published in the book "Syllon Valley: China, the New World Order" this month, Hughton Mifflin Harcourt, is the director-general of the Synovation Ventures Foundation, who invested in Face++, one of the most famous Chinese companies in China.
In the 1980s, he worked at Carnegie Mellon University, which played the best American player in Otello, and later was the executive director of Microsoft Research and the president of the Chinese company Google.
He noted the previous advances in technology carried out by the U.S. government, such as the Robotics Challenge Agency for Advanced Armed Research (DARPA), and asked when to help identify the following prospective participants.
Researchers in the United States often have to work hard to win the national flag, says Lee.
"It's not China taking academic leaders, it's corporations," he said.
Facebook, Google, and other technological companies in recent years have picked up light from universities to work on the SI.
According to Lee, changes in immigration policy can also help the United States to increase its efforts in the area of China.
"I think that Green Card should automatically offer scientists in the field of science in the SI," he said.
The National Council of China published its Plan for the Development of the Art of the New Generation in July 2017.
China's National Institute of Natural Sciences provides funding to persons working in academic institutions, such as the National Scientific Foundation and other U.S. government organizations, while the quality of academic work in China is lower, says Lee.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Ministry of Defence has established a Joint Centre for Medical Intelligence, which aims to bind business and academic partners, and the White House announced the establishment of a Special Committee on Medical Intelligence.
Also this month in the DARPA announced an investment of $2 billion in the AI Next initiative.
With regard to the National Science Fund, it now invests more than $100 million in research for the first year.
Meanwhile, the U.S. law firm, who wanted to create the Commission from national security of artificial intelligence, has not taken any steps over the past few months.
Macedonians vote on the referendum on the change in the country's name
On Sunday, the people of Macedonia voted in the referendum on whether to change the name of the country to the Republic of Northern Macedonia, which will allow for a multi-year dispute with Greece, which has blocked Macedonia's membership in the Euro-Mediterranean and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims that the name of the northern neighbor is a claim on its territory, and has launched a campaign to enter Macedonia to NATO and the EU.
In June, two governments signed the agreement on the basis of the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents of the agreement claim that this change undermines the ethnic identity of the majority of the Slovenian people in Macedonia.
President George Ivanov said that there would be no vote on the referendums, and the boycott campaign raises doubts as to whether the 50 per cent minimum voter will be able to be considered as a referendum.
The question in the Bulletin sounds like, "Do you support NATO and the EC membership under the terms of agreement with Greece?"
The authors of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zeev, claim that this is the price Macedonia, one of the countries created after the collapse of Yugoslavia, is worth paying for accession to such bodies as the EU and NATO.
"I have come today to vote for the future country, for Macedonia's young people, so that it can live freely under the auspices of the European Union, because this means a safer life for all of us," said 79-year-old Oliver Georgievski in Skopje.
Although the vote does not have legal obligations, enough Members of Parliament have said that they support it to make it decisive.
Two thirds of the votes in Parliament will be required to change the name.
The National Electoral Commission stated that no reports of violations had been received by 1 p.m.
However, the phenomenon was only 16% compared to 34% of the last parliamentary elections in 2016 when 66% of registered voters threw their ballots into the corner.
"I have come to vote for my children, our place in Europe," 62-year-old José Tanevsky of Skopje said.
On 30 September 2018 in Strumica, Macedonia, Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife, Zorika and his son Dusko gave their voice at the referendum on the change in the country's name, which opens the way to entering NATO and the European Union.
In front of Parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Volodimir Kavardarkov prepared a small scene and placed a table in front of the premises organized by those who are going to fight the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to come there with a proud head, not through the service door," Kavardarkov said.
We are poor countries, but we have dignity.
If they don't want to take us as Macedonia, we can turn to others, for example China and Russia, and become part of European-Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev believes that NATO membership will bring much needed investment to Macedonia, where unemployment is more than 20%.
"I believe that the majority vote mainly because more than 80% of our citizens are voting for the EU and NATO," Zaev said after the vote.
He noted that the result will be a confirmation of their future.
According to a survey published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute of Political Research, 30 to 43 percent of the voters will participate in the referendum, and this will be a necessary step down.
According to another study conducted by the Macedonian Telecom, 57% of respondents are scheduled to vote on Sunday.
70 percent said they'd vote for.
In order for the referendum to be recognized as effective, the vote should be 50% plus one vote.
The example of the referendum will be the first serious attack on the policies of the Western Government since its beginning in May last year.
See: Serhio Aguero from Manchester City runs all the defense of Briton and kills the head
Serhio Aguero and Rahim Sterling went to Briton's defense and won the Manchester City account with a 2-0 account on Saturday at the Ethihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Gol Aguero, at 65 minutes of matty, looked like a ridiculous excuse.
An Argentina attacker got a dog in the center of the field at the beginning of the chase.
He ran between the three Britons and found himself in the open field.
Agboiro continued to realize that he was surrounded by four greens.
He wore one guard, then stopped a few more on the edge of the Bridge.
Next he made a walk left, seeing Sterling.
The English Forvard made the first touch on the script to give Aguero's sword, which his right boots launched him on the right side of the door, by wearing the crowns of the Great Briton's cross by Matthew Ryan.
"Aguero has some foot problems," said journalist Pep Gvardiola.
We thought he'd play 55 or 60 minutes.
That's right.
We are lucky that he killed the head at this moment."
But the initial preference in this matter of the Premier League provided Sterling.
It happened at 29 o'clock.
Aguero got a sword deep in the Briton area.
He sent a beautiful walking dog along the left bank of Leroy Sane.
Leroy made a couple of cakes and continued to make the trip to Sterling on the way to the next stage.
Forvard of the sky-blockers has put a sword in his mouth like once before he jumped across the border.
Siti will meet with Hofffenheim in the group stage of the League of Championships at 12:55 on Friday at the Reyn-Nekkar-Arena Stadium in Zinsaghm, Germany.
Sherner wants to take her eyes off Rokis
Since the Washington Nassionals team came out of playoff, there was no real reason to wait for the circuit start.
But thanks to the opposition of Sherzer, he is expected to go out on Friday in the fight against Colorado Rokis, provided that Rokis is still having difficulties with the departure of the playoff. Now Rokis is on a game ahead of Los Angeles Dogers in the National West League.
"Rokes" have at least a Wi-Fi card to win with account 5-2 over "Nasionals" on Friday night, but they still want to cover the title of the first division.
"In spite of what we're playing neither because at least we can leave the sword, knowing how to drive the viewers here in Denver, and the other team will probably play at the highest level I've seen this year.
Why would I not want to take part in this struggle?
Nasiols still announces who's going to be an early Peter on Sunday, but it's reported that they're looking at what it's going to be, Sherzer.
Chercher, for which it will be the 34th start, had a pitching session on Thursday and could play on Sunday, his usual way out.
Washington's right is 18-7 out of 2,53 ERA and 300 trucks in 220 2/3 innining this season.
Indignities of the Trompa in West Virginia
The president made a quick reference to the situation around his candidate to the Supreme Court of Brett Cavano when he spoke of the importance of the role of the representatives of the Republicans in the medium-term elections.
“All we have done will be placed on the map in November.
Five weeks later, one of the most important choices in our life will be made.
It's one of the big, big ones, I'm not running, but I'm really running, so I'm everywhere I can fight for the great candidates," he said.
Tramp continued: “You see this terrible, terrible radical group of democracies, you see that is happening right now.
And they're firmly set to return power using any means, you see subordination, greed.
They are concerned about those who suffer from them who have to commit a sin in order to gain power and control, they want power and control, and we are not going to give them to them."
The mission of Democrats, he said, "stop and stop."
"And you see it in the last four days," he said, calling the democracies "wicked, arrogant, hypocritical and lying."
He referred to the Senate's Court Committee, calling Senator Diane Finstein on behalf of the audience for a voice of discontent.
"Do you remember her answer?
Did you get a document?
It's what.
No, no, no, no, I'm waiting for it to be the really bad language of the bodies -- the worst language of the bodies I've ever seen."
The Liberian Party is no longer a large church.
It does not belong to man who is walking even to direct his step. ”
When the Momentum activists in my local party voted to condemn me, that was hardly unexpected.
Finally, I'm the last of those lobbyists in Parliament who have said they're not happy, and that's all because we're expressing our opinion.
To my colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan was almost the same because she was determined to resist anti-Semitism.
I was condemned for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbin.
With regard to the importance of responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, these issues are ironically similar to those of Jeremy’s former leaders.
"We want the meetings to be inclusive and productive," says a report on the meeting of the Nottingham East on Friday.
Most of the Friday evening meetings of the General Committee in my eight years as a local member of Parliament of the liborists were the same.
Unfortunately, many today have a completely different tone, and the promise of a "more kinder, softer" policy has long been forgotten if it has ever been implemented.
It becomes even more evident that there are no different views in the Leiborist Party, and every thought is evaluated from the position of whether it is acceptable for the party’s leadership.
It started soon after Jeremy became a leader, and the colleagues with whom I once seemed to have had similar political views began to expect me to turn to 180 degrees and adopt a position I would never have agreed with, whether national security or the single EU market.
Every time I express myself publicly — and it doesn’t matter what I say — there’s a need for an attack on social networks with a call to protest, a central policy, I’m told that I shouldn’t be in the Leborist party.
And that's not just my experience.
I know that I have benefited more than some of my colleagues, because I have been targeted by political commentators.
I'm in the grip of professionalism and the determination of my colleagues who encounter the flows of sexist or racist attacks every day, but they never refuse.
One of the most disturbing aspects of this political era is that equal abuses have become a norm.
Jeremy Corbin said last week that the Leiborist Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer such a large church, and with every movement of "unbelievers" or change of party membership rules are considered.
For the last two years, I have received much advice, and I have been invited not to give up, not to say so loud, so that everything was going well with me.
But I didn't get involved in politics.
I joined the Liberians 32 years ago in school because because of the lack of attention from the government of Tetcher, my class in high school was literally disbanded, and since then I wish to improve the quality of government services for those who need them most, whether the local councillor or the government minister.
I never kept my policy, including the last elections.
No one in Nottingham East had been disturbed by my political views and differences with today’s leadership.
For those who have contributed to Friday events, I just want to say one thing: under the circumstances when the country moves to Bressit, which is damaging to households, businesses and public services, I don't understand the desire to spend time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Liberian Party.
I really have another message, but not for the Noting Momentum, but for my voters, both members of the Leiborist Party, and not: I swear that I serve you, and I promise that no threats to me and no political advantage will make me act in accordance with what I consider to be the best interests of all of you.

"Eir" 38 - 17 "Melrous": Unmovable "Eir" climbs up
The last two attempts may have resulted in some of the final results, but, of course, Air has earned a triumph in today's great entertainment match of the Prime Minister of Scotland.
Now they're building the table, that's the only unimplemented ten command.
In the end, the wonderful defense and the enhanced ability to use the opportunity gives husbands and trainer Peter Merche the right to be satisfied.
"We've been trying our games, and we're still not able, so I have to be content," he said.
Robin Cristy of Melrous commented: "I'm giving the right Air," they used the chances better than we did."
Grant Anderson's attempt at the 14th minute, carried out by Frasie Climo, led to "Eir" ahead, but a yellow map for Scottish Captain Rory Guza, seen "Verriors", allowed "Merrous" to show the figures, and Jason Baggott used an unrealistic attempt.
Climo sent Eir's leadership through the panel and immediately made and implemented the solo test, which gave an account of 17-5 for "Eir"
But Melrous well started the second time, and Patrick Anderson's attempt, realized by Baggot, reduced the gap to five.
Then there was a long silence from the serious trauma of Ruarid Knott, who was taken from the field on his feet, and from the Eir Restaford McDowell, who was realized by the climate.
Captain "Eir" Blair McFerson then had a yellow card, and Melrous again forced another player to pay for an unrealized test by Bruce Colwin under the pressure.
The gentlemen came back, but when Struan Hatchenson received a yellow card to capture the climate without a sword from the line of the string of the striker, Mcferson made a tacdown behind the "Eir".
Climo realized what he did almost immediately after the restoration, then Kyle Roy got David Armstrong's hit into the box and sent Gregor Henry to the fifth attempt of the master's team.
Looks like the star of the "All Other Game" series set up on a new career in the restaurant
It seems that Ford Kiran has set up a new career in the field of hospitality. This conclusion can be made after it became known that he is the director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in the BBC popular teleserate, the scenario he writes and he's taking off with an old comedy partner, Greg Hemfil.
Duet announced that the future nine series would be the last in the series, and it seems that Kirnan is planning his life after Creigleng.
According to the official record, he is the director of the Afförmorn Limited company.
The actor refused to comment on this story, even though the Scottish Sun source indicated that Kirnan wanted to enter the "increasing restaurant business" of Glazgo.
"The Sea Ours": Inland Bolivia is expected to open its way to the Pacific
The seamen are patrolling the fleet headquarters in La Pasi.
The municipality buildings are building an ocean-block bridge.
The sea base from Lake Titicaca to Amazonia is framed by a vision: "We are on the right.
We must return it."
In Bolivia, which has no access to the sea, still lives in memory of the loss of a coastal line that left Chile in the bloody conflict of the 19th century through natural resources, and it is also the desire to refish into the Pacific.
These hopes are probably the strongest in recent decades, because Bolivia is waiting for the decision of the International Court of Justice on October 1, after five years of consideration.
"In Bolivia there is an impulse, a spirit of unity and peace and, of course, it expects a positive outcome," commented Roberto Calsaria, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many of the patients will observe the announcement of the ICU decision on large screens across the country, and they hope that the Gaza Tribunal will decide for the benefit of Bolivia, which, after decades of interlocutory talks, will lead to negotiations on Bolivia's surrender of sovereignty to the sea.
Evo Morales, a charismatic root president of Bolivia, who has faced opposition to his review next year, also puts great hope in a decision that will be announced on Monday.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific," he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that the court will either decide for Bolivia’s benefit, and if that happens, it will change little.
The United Nations, based in the Netherlands, has not fully condemned the Czech territory and has noted that there will be no possible negotiations.
What ICU's decision is just six months after the last arguments were made, indicates that the matter was "not difficult," said Pas Zarate, Czech expert on international law.
Bolivia’s rights were not applied, and the last four years could have helped to resurface.
"The request for access to the sea has been used by the current Bolivian administration," Zarate said.
Morales, the military commander of the Morales, threw away the rest of the Chilean kindnesses, she admitted.
Bolivia and Chile will continue the dialogue at some point, but then it will be very difficult to discuss.
Since 1962, two countries have not changed.
Coalition President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltz, Bolivia’s representative in Gaza, did not agree that the court’s decision was unusual.
On Monday, Bolivia will have “the extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile and the opportunity to end 139 years of separation, having a mutual benefit, ” he said.
Calsania also denied that Morales, one of the most popular presidents in Latin America, used the sea issue as a political militia.
“ The disease will never deny its right to access the Pacific, ” he added.
This is the opportunity to see that we must leave the past behind. ”
North Korea says there's no nuclear disarmament if she can't trust the United States
North Korea's prime minister, Riy Young Ho, says his country will never give up its nuclear weapons for the first time until he can trust Washington.
Ri appeared on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the United States to fulfill the promises made during the summit in Singapore by the leaders of the opposing countries.
His comments appeared when U.S. Secretary Mike Pompeo seems to be on the way to the start of nuclear diplomacy, which took place in an empty corner more than three months after Singapore's summit with Kim Chen Inn.
Ri says that the belief that the continuation of sanctions and the United States' declaration of the end of the Korean War once puts North Korea on its knees is “unreal dream. ”
Washington is afraid to accept the declaration of how Phoenan will take significant steps to deal with the problem.
Who and American President Donald Trump want a second meeting.
But there is widespread scepticism that Phoenician is seriously concerned with rejecting his arsenal, which the country may consider to be the only way to guarantee its safety.
Pompeo plans to visit Pinian next month to prepare for the second summit between Kim and Trump.
The last trend of massive peaks, which is already heading to the main streets of your city, was presented at the Paris fashion exhibitions
If you want to increase your collection of hats or completely hide from the sun, you have found what you need.
The designers Valentino and Tom Brown demonstrated a number of eccentric top-level overses in the 2019 spring collection on the occasion of a close Paris week of fashion.
This summer’s Instagram was filled with a very unpredictable hat, and the so - called designers had already sent their amazing creations across the globe.
Valentino has seen an extravagance flight hat with a wide-opened pair of fields that covered the heads of models.
Among the other accessories are decorated with precious stones of coffee, hats of chocolate and even capillaries of pineapples, but they are not to keep their head warm.
Tom Brown also demonstrated the assortment of original masks — very early before Helwin.
Many of these colorful masks were protected and remembered by Hannival Lattera more than the tallest fashion.
One of the creatures mentioned the arrangements for underwater swimming with the dust and the eyelids, another looked like a morose line that had broken down.
And if you support this serious fashion application, you're lucky.
Stylists say that large hats can go to the main streets of your city.
The Overseas Capillas entered the mode through La Bomby, a salted hat with a width of six inches, which they saw on all sides: from Rianni to Emily Ratakovski.
A cultural brand, standing behind a very unpredictable cape, which could be seen everywhere on social networks, offered peace another creation: a salty beach bag of size almost like the model in the buyer she brought.
The sum of the yellow-red raffle raffle with raffia and white skin skin was the central element of the La Riviera collection in the spring of 2019 brand Jacquemus in the Paris weekly fashion.
The fashionist Luke Armitage told the F.D.: “In the coming summer, I expect to see big hats and beach bags on the main streets of the city, as the designer is so powerful that it will be difficult to ignore the demand on the Overseas-Assessors.”
John Edward: Knowledge of languages is mandatory for citizens of the world
Independent schools in Scotland uphold high standards of education, and in 2018 there has been a resurgence of research that is complemented by individual and collective success in sports, art, music, and other fields.
These schools, which teach more than 30,000 students throughout Scotland, are presented by the Scottish School of Independent Schools (USD), are eager to provide the best level of service for students and their parents.
Independent schools are designed to prepare students for the further and higher education they choose as careers, as well as to make them their citizens in the world.
As a education sector that can develop and implement an individual school program, we see that modern languages continue to be popular and desirable in school.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you talk to a person who knows the language she understands, she understands it.
If you talk to her in her native language, she will accept it with her heart.
It is a powerful reminder that we cannot use only English if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
As a result of this year’s examination, we see that in independent schools, language is leading to the ratings of the best - estimateed subjects.
In general, 68 percent of the students who were learning foreign languages received a higher rate of A.
The data gathered at 74 SRN schools showed that 72% of the students received a higher rate of A from China, and 72% of those studying German, 69% of those studying French, and 63% of those studying Spanish, also received A.
This suggests that independent schools in Scotland view foreign languages as vital lessons that children and young people will no doubt need in the future.
The language is now spoken as an object in the selection, as are the subjects of the NTIM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics), in the context of independent school programs and other institutions.
A survey conducted by the British Employment and Training Commission in 2014 showed that 17% of the reasons why workers cannot close their vacations due to the lack of language skills.
That's why language skills become more and more necessary in preparing young people for future careers.
Since more and more perspectives require knowledge of languages, these skills are needed in a globalized world.
Regardless of the chosen career, if someone learns another language, he'll have a real advantage in the future, because it's a habit for all life.
The possibility of direct contact with people from other countries automatically gives a person who is mastering a number of languages a preference over competitors.
According to YouGov, a survey of over 4,000 adults in Britain in 2013, 75 percent could not speak a foreign language enough to support a conversation, whereas French is the only language spoken by a double percentage (15 percent).
That is why investment in education is now important for children today.
Learning a number of languages, especially the languages of the developing world, gives children more opportunities to find a full - time job.
In each school in Scotland, they will learn their language.
A number of schools focus on more classical modern languages, while others will speak languages that are most important to Britain from the 2020 perspective, such as Chinese or Japanese.
Depending on your child’s interest in independent schools, you can always choose a few languages to study them with qualified translators.
Scotlandn independent schools are trying to create a educational environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills needed to achieve success regardless of what is expected of them in the future.
It is now impossible to deny that in the international business environment, languages continue to play a vital role in the future, so this should be reflected in education.
Modern languages must truly be viewed as “the traditions of international communication. ”
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, variety, and perfection to the young Scottish.
You have to do it.
John Edward is director of the Scotland School for Independents
Libron argues with Lakers in San Diego.
The fans who wanted to see the first start of Libron James for Los Angeles Lakes were almost waiting.
Lakers' coach Luke Walton announced that James will be playing on Sunday in the first pre-trial match against "Denver Naggets" in San Diego.
He'll be playing for a minute, not yet determined.
"It will be more than one and less 48," said Walton on Lakers' official website.
The Lakers report Mike Truddle reported that James will play a limited number of minutes.
After training earlier this week, James asked about his plan for six games of the Leicers.
"At this stage of my career, I don't need any pre-suspension games," he replied.
Middle-East Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Tramp is today starting a series of premier migratings from the city of Wiling, West Virginia.
It's the first of five planned for the next week of the Trampa match, including a match in the neighboring states between Tennessee and Mississippi.
The remaining vote on the candidate proposed to the Supreme Court was dismissed, and the Tempp intends to form support for the upcoming mid-term elections, as the Republicans are at risk of losing control of the Congress after the vote in November.
What time will this evening’s Eve’s Eve be seen in the West Virginia, and how will it be viewed on the Internet?
Ming Trampa in Wiling, West Virginia, scheduled for 19 hours after sunrise today, on Saturday, September 29, 2018
You can watch the tramping in the West Virginia online below in the direct YouTube ephemeral.
The trauma probably refers to the forced obedience that took place this week from the conduct of the candidate to the Supreme Court of Britta Cavan, which is accused of sexual harassment, and the postponement of the Senate's vote for a week while the FBI continues to investigate.
But the main objective of this series of migratings is to help the republics to collect popularity before the elections in November.
President Trampa said that these five migratings were directed to "activation of volunteers and guests, as the Republicans are trying to preserve and expand the majority of the representatives' Senate and Palace," Reuters reports.
"The control over Congress is so critical for its agenda that the president will go to as many states as possible, as it is nearing the busy season of the pre-commissioning campaign," said Reuters, a representative of the Trampa company who did not want to name himself.
At the Vesbanka Arena Stadium in Willing City today, visitors from Ohio and Pennsylvania, as well as the Pittsburgh media, reports West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday's visit will be the next month's trip to the West Virginia, in which he collected more than 40% of the votes in 2016.
The tramp is trying to help the candidate from the Republicans to the Senate of the West Virgin of Patrick Morris, a rating that stands out as a result of the trials.
“ It’s not good for Morris, the president is coming to pick up his ratings in trials, ” commented Reuters Simon Heder, a politician from the University of West Virginia.
Reuters 2018: US command set up for the fight and fulfilled the hope of previous Sundays
After three sessions, which ended with a unilateral victory, the late Saturday forums could become the only thing that had missed this Rayder Cup.
The Chinese amputationist is a well - known sports concept in which players really believe, especially in similar conflicts.
So when do they say the impulse works?
"They were ahead on six eyes, and now on four, so I think we'll take it a little bit like impulse," said Jordan Spite when he left.
Europe, of course, has the advantage of four fronts and twelve other games.
The Americans, as Spit says, feel a little wind in their winds, as well as a lot of encouragement to them, not in the last row of spitas and Justin Thomas, who played all day, and each had three eyes with four eyes.
The spout with his killer shots from the thi-mechanical to the green shows an example.
These gruesome cries of celebration became more loud when he continued his round and compared the account to the fourth match after he and Thomas left two eyes.
His path, which allowed them to win a match for 15 moons, met with a similar call, which tells you that the U.S. command doesn't appear.
"You really should just try very hard and worry about your own match," said Spyt.
That's all each of these players left right now.
18 moons to become famous.
The only players with more eyes than Spit and Thomas in the last two days — France’s Molinary and Tommy Flytwood — are the story of Cuba’s Rayder.
It is unusual, but a wonderful couple from Europe have four or four and cannot make mistakes.
"Molwood" was the only couple who didn't make gods on the Sabbath after dinner, they were also able to avoid the gods on the Sabbath and after dinner on the Friday and on the last nine moons on the Friday morning.
This escape and their energy seems to go beyond this gruesome crowd and back, to believe that they win Sunday and that there will be no more popular players, except Flytwood or Molinary, to capture the potential victory of the Europeans when the sun goes over Le Golf National.
We need to try at the same time on different moons.
However, talk about the European triumph until it is too late.
Bob Watson and Webb Simpson argued with Sergio Garcia, a hero of the morning football team when he was in a fight with Alex Norren.
One god and two gods on the first nine moons brought the Spanish and the Swedish to the moon from which they could never choose.
On Sunday, however, no one will help you to get out of the jungle.
The forums and forums are very interesting to observe closely the relationship between the participants of money, the advice they give, the advice they do not give, and the interest in observing how the strategy can change in one minute.
Europe as long as it plays better than a team and has a significant priority in the last day, but this forum also showed that the U.S. team is going to fight, in which some, especially Americans, are skeptical.
Europe is headed by account 10-6 on the last day of the Reuters Cuba
At the end of the day, Kubka Raider Europe will have a positive advantage, because after Saturdays and forums, it runs the United States with account 10-6.
The inspired couple Tommy Flytwood and French Molinary have won two victories over the distant Tiger Woods, and now they have four sons at Le Golf National.
European team Thomas Burna, who is trying to get back the trophies they lost two years ago in Hazeltine, was running over an American team in the morning forbolts with account 3-1.
The U.S. had made more resistance in the forums and had won two matches, but they could not speed up the divorce.
Commander Jim Furrick needs eight eyes in 12 seconds to keep the trophies.
Flytwood is the first European novelist to have four shots of sleep while he and Mollinari (with Mollywood) are only the second pair that took four shots in the first four matches in the history of Kubka Ryder.
When Woods and Patrick Reid broke into the Forbols, they joined to defeat the South Woods and American novelist Brison Deshambo with even more effective 5t4.
The Woods, who pulled out two mats on Saturday, demonstrated an accidental burial of the genius, but now he lost 19 of his 29 mats in forbolts and Forsoms and seven mats in the basement.
Justin Rose, who did not participate in the morning Forbalts, returned to Henry Stanson's partner in the forums to get a copy of account 2 to 1 from Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepki, who is the first and third in the world ranking.
Europe couldn't do anything more for this nice fresh day on the south-west of Paris.
The three principal winners of Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas set a standard for Americans on Saturday with their two eyes.
They made a decision to win 2t1 over the Spanish John Ram and John Poulter in the Forbola and later beat Poulter and Rory McLroy with account 4ta3 in the Forsoms, losing two first moons.
Only two times in the history of Kubka Ryder's team returned with a weakness in four eyes in a single, although the Fury's team needed only nothing.
However, after a second two - day period, the contract in the week seems to be as if it were not in their power.
North Korea says "no way" won't be thrown in a unilateral order without trust
The North Korean Minister of Coordinating Affairs said on Saturday that the continuation of sanctions undermines trust in the United States, and that under such circumstances the country will never be able to refuse its nuclear weapons.
Ri Young Ho told the UN General Assembly that in the past year, North Korea has used "sustainary acts of good will", such as the cessation of nuclear and rocket tests, the demolition of a nuclear-tested host and the obligation not to distribute nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we don't see the appropriate response from the United States," he said.
"There will be no confidence in our national security without confidence in the United States, and in such circumstances we will not be the first to be confused in a unilateral order".
And while Ri has repeated the known charges of North Korea against Washington "potent" approach to decoleration, according to which North Korea will be rewarded for further steps, his statement has proved important because it did not ignore the unilateral decoleration of what Phenyan has done in the past.
Ri was sent to a joint statement by Kim Chen Ina and Donald Tramp on the first in history between the real president of the United States and the leader of North Korea in Singapore on June 12, when Kim called for work on the "Deuklarization of the South Korean Islands", and the Tempp promised security assurance of North Korea.
North Korea wants a formal end to the Korean war of 1950-53, but the United States stated that Phinenan must first refuse nuclear weapons.
Washington also opposes the call for the reduction of severe international sanctions on North Korea.
"ALLS are putting their hands on the "denocraticization of the beginning" and raising pressure through sanctions to achieve their goals violently, and they even oppose the "declaration of the end of the war," Ri said.
"In the sense that sanctions can put us on the knees, "the incredible dream of those who don't know us.
But the problem is that continuing sanctions undermines our confidence."
Ri didn't mention the second summit between Kim and Trump, where the U.S. leader voted at the UN in the beginning of the week.
Instead, the minister drew attention to the three-year meeting of Kim and South Korean leader Mun Jai in the last five months and added: "If South Korea were to be a party to this question, not the United States, the South Korean decolonization would not have entered this silent corner."
Despite this, Rey's speech was quite different from that of the Turkish, when he told the General Assembly that the targeting of North Korea's rocket on the United States materiel was inevitable after the "Mr. Green President" Trip called Kim "human rocket", which wanted to commit suicide.
This year in the UN Trip, which threatened to “complete the destruction” of North Korea, commended Kim for her courage in the use of weapons, but said that much more is needed to be done and sanctions must remain in force for the denuclearization of North Korea.
In the middle of Trip, he noted that he does not set up a framework for this period: "It's two years, three years or five months, it doesn't matter."
China and Russia claim that the UN Security Council should reward Phanyan for the steps taken.
However, U.S. Secretary-General Mike Pompeo declared the UN Security Council on Thursday: “The implementation of the Security Council sanctions should continue to be energetic and inexhaustible until we see the complete, final, confirmed denuclearization”.
The Security Council unanimously increased the sanctions against North Korea in 2006 with a view to blocking the financing of nuclear programmes and ballistic missiles in Beijing.
Pompeo met Ri at the UN General Assembly Colurus and then said that the next month he would visit Pyongyan again to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo had visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip was unsuccessful.
He left Phinyan in July and commented that progress had been made, but for several hours North Korea condemned him for the “Gangster Requirements”.
During the meeting with Monon this month, North Korea promised to select a rocket complex and a nuclear complex if the United States uses the “relevant measures”.
He told me that, as Kim said, his "relevant efforts" are the security guarantees that Trump promised in Singapore and the steps to normalise relations with Washington.
Harvard students have a course on how to relax enough
A new course at Harvard University this year gave all his students more sleep, and it's an attempt to fight the growing culture of credence to learn all night after coffee.
The lecturer found that students at the university are often neglected when it comes to self - care.
Charles Chesler, a professor of sleep at Harvard Medical School and a professor at the Women’s Hospital Briggam, developed a course that, in his opinion, is the first such course in the United States.
He decided to start a course after he gave his lecture on the effects of sleep loss on learning.
Finally, one girl approached him and said, “Why are you telling me this right now, at the last course? ”
"She told me that no one had ever told her about the importance of a dream that surprised me," said the translator from The Telegraph.
In the course that was introduced this year, students explain the basis for good sleep habits to help achieve academic and sports results and to improve overall well - being.
Paul Barreyra, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and the executive director of the university's medical services, said that the university had decided to take a course after it had been shown that students had been seriously let down during the week.
The time course includes a number of interactive tasks.
In one section there are images of rooms in the garden where students click on coffee, teas, coaches and books to learn about the influence of coffee and light, the impact of sleep deficits on sports shows, and the importance of routines related to sleep.
The second section explains how persistent sleep loss can increase the risk of heart attacks, stroke, depression, and cancer.
The accompanying map with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
"We know it won't change the behavior of the students mentally.
But we think they have the right to know, just as you have the right to know about the consequences of cigarette smoking for health," added Professor Chesler.
The culture of pride for “suddenness all night” still exists, he added, as well as noted that modern technology and constant pressure on students mean that the problem of sleep loss is growing.
A good enough sleep should be a “secret weapon ” for a student to fight stress, stress, and anxiety, even with a set of stress, as sleep deprivation translates the brain into hunger, causing constant physical hunger, he said.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old caliph, studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Chesler develop a course after writing to one of his other courses last year during the first year in Harvard.
He said that the course opened his eyes and encouraged him to create a new course for the entire camp.
The next step, he hopes, will turn to all the printers, asking for a similar program of learning to come into a competitive setting.
Professor Chesler recommends that students be reminded of the need to sleep, as well as of setting up a building and being in a cycle of harmful effects of light, which is produced by electronic screens and light bulbs, and can damage the circumcise rhythm that leads to sleep problems.
"Levengston" 1 - 0 "Ringers": Hol Mangy's boys are upset by Gerard
The Rangers survived a round-up attack on the exit: the attack by Dolli Mangy brought by various team Steven Gerard against account 1-0 from Levengstone.
The Airbros command wanted to win his first victory on the train after the summer triumph over St. John's account with account 4.1, but Commander Gary Holt gave Gerard a second chance as manager of 18 games. Gerard's command was left behind behind the leader of the Scottish Premiership Harts.
Manga was killed in seven minutes before the explosion, and Rangers, who lacked inspiration, didn't seem to be able to compare the account.
Now the Rangers are down to sixth position, and the Livingstone is up to the third, and the bears are only known as Hibernate.
In addition, Rangers may experience another set of setbacks, since the Lensman Kalum Spence was forced to make a head wound after being thrown from the guest sector into it.
Gerard made eight changes in his team, which had once changed to Air in the Southern Quebec of Scotland.
And Holt released the same version of "Live 11", which took one look at Harts" last week, and was in the grip of how his trained boys pressed the opponents on every step.
Maybe the Rangers were running the dominant sword, but Levengston was working more with the captured sword.
They were supposed to kill everything in two minutes when the first Mangy's flight in the free zone allowed Scott Pittman to strike on the side of God's MacGregor, but the semi-protector took this great chance by sending a sword over the door.
The deep free strike by Keagan Jacobs reached the captain of Craig Halkett, but his defense partner Alan Litgo was hit in the backyard
The Rangers were actually controlled, but at the end of the third, there was more hope than faith in their game.
Alfredo Morelos, of course, felt that he had to get the right to a pen on the mark four hours after meeting Steven Lawles, but the reference to Steven Thompson refused to turn the ball.
The Rangers was able to do only two rounds in the first team, but the former leader of the Ibrox, Liam Kelly, attacked the head of Lassani Kulibali and the peaceful attack of this Ejaria.
And although the last hall "Livingstone" for 34 minutes may have been opposed to the game, no one can deny that they earned it only for their hard work.
The Rangers couldn't cope with Jacobs' supply.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Galler sent a sword to Scott Robinson, who quietly chose Mengo for a simple end.
In the bush, Gerard replaced Kulibali with Ryan Kent, and this change was almost immediately worked when the hijacker broke down to Morelos, but the impressive Kelly picked up his line to block it.
Livingstone, however, continued to force guests to play the same game that they like when Litgo and Halket take one long step after another.
The Holta team could have improved the results at the last stages, but McGregor had successfully opposed Jacobs before Liggio hit the corner.
Glenn Medlton, a replacement in the Rangers, made another application for the script when he met Jacobs, but Tomson returned to see it again.
Almanah: Judge of Geiger's number
And now the page from our Sunday morning album: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago this day, and the time is coming... in Germany, a future physicist, Joganes Willel Geiger, was born.
Geiger developed a method of detecting and measuring radioactivity, a product that in time evolved into a device known as Geiger’s computer.
One of the key elements of science, as well as one of the key elements of popular culture, such as the 1950 film "Call Coronado" with Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, who have doubts about the appearance of cowboy scientists.
The man said, "What is that?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger computer used to search for radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you look at these particles, you can really feel the effects of radioactivity on the atoms in the minerals."
Evans says, "Come on, it's really going to grow."
"Gans" Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the vincid, who bears his name, continues to live.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to see harmful cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to see and kill harmful cells
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize harmful cells that are part of the treatment
The method for removing lymph nodes in the patient and their transformation in the laboratory
Then these cells are able to see a protein that is common to many species of cancer. These cells will then re-enter the patient.
The test vaccine shows many promising results in patients with various cancers.
In one woman who received a vaccine that teaches the immune system to identify harmful cells, the cancer of the eggs has disappeared for more than 18 months.
The method includes removing the immune cells in the patient, modifying them in the laboratory so that these cells can "see" together for many types of protein cancer (HER2), and continue to re-insert these cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Institute of Cancer, Maryland, noted: “Our results show that we have received a very promising vaccine. ”
" HER2 "instimulates the growth of several species of cancer", including breast cancer, ovaries, lungs and colorectal cancer," he explained.
A similar approach, based on the removal of lymphatic cells in patients and the “intellectuals ” to target cancer cells, has been developed in the treatment of one of the types of leukemia.
After attending the SNL show in the MAGA Canyya West, he gave a lot of speech in support of President Trampa,
the negative response of the viewer
The viewers at the SNL show (Saturday Night in the Direct Efrey) discovered Kanya after his funeral, during which he congratulated President Donald Trampa and said he would fight in the presidential position in 2020.
After performing a third song called Ghost Town in the baseball with the title "Let's Return America to the Former Glory" he fired a tweet that criticised Democrats, and once again declared his support for the Trip.
"When the whites speak, they ask me, "How do you like the Trump? He's a racist."
Well, if I was worried about racism, I'd have left America a long time ago," he said.
Shoe SNL began with a plot by Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star gave a witness to Brett Cavano, who gave a speech to the Legal Committee of the Senate in connection with the call of Christine Blaise Ford on sexual violence.
Although Westa’s speech did not go directly into the ephemeral, a video with his girlfriend appeared on the social network of Chris Rock’s comic book.
It remains unclear whether Rock wanted to shake the West by wearing this post.
West also told the observers that a bad situation was happening through the main church.
As Washington Examiner reports, West said, "When I was behind bars, I got really mad.
I was told, "Don't go to the viewers in this baseball game."
They broke up with me!
And then I'm told that I'm in a place where the oppressed talk."
The news continued, "You want to see where the oppressed speak? I'll wear my baseball superman because no one can tell me what to do.
Then try to treat each other with love."
According to the Week of Variety, his comments were at least two times the negative reaction of the viewers in the hall, and the SNL actors seemed lost. One of the viewers said, "The study suggested a death of silence."
In the last minute, guests were asked to replace the singer Arian Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, Reper Mac Miller, died a few days before the fair.
The news called for a lot of surprises by performing a song I Love it (I love it) in the costume of Perrier's waters.
Vesta supported the head of the TPUSA Kendes Terner Conservative Organization, who wrote in Twitter: "One of the most courageous: thank you for what you've done."
Instead, the leader of Tok-choo Karen Hunter wrote in Twitter that the West "is who he is, and that's just wonderful."
"I'm not going to reward this (by buying his music or clothing or by supporting his "city") who, I think, tells and utters an ideology that damages my communities.
He's a free man.
Like us," she added.
Before the show, Reper announced on Twitter what changed his name: now he's "the one who used to know as Kanya West."
The news is not the first performer who changed his name, and he follows the example of Daddy, also known as Puff Dad, Puffy, and Pie Diddy.
Colonel Snup Dogg earlier called Snup Lion, and, of course, the music legend of the last decades has changed the name to symbol, and then became an Artist, known as Prince.
Indicted in a conspiracy on suicide after a knife attack at Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man accused himself of a suicide murder after he had another man's knife wound in one of the restaurants in East Belfast on Friday.
The police reported that the incident took place in the Bellygecomor restaurant.
It is expected that the accused will be brought before the court of the magistrates of Belfast on Monday.
The prosecutor is looking at the charges.
Kit Herington's star of the "Game of the Throne" series condemns the idealization of generosity.
Kit Herington became famous because of the role of war with John Snow's sword in the brutal medium-term fusion series "The Game of Casts" of HBO's production.
However, a 31-year-old actor who was convicted of a heroist stereotype, asserting that because of such heroes on the screen, young boys often seem to be cruel to others.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture Kit, he said that, in his opinion, "something went wrong," and asked how to solve the problem of the idealization of generosity in the era of #Meto's popularity.
Kit, who recently married his colleague on the "Gree Prestolives", a 31-year-old actor named Rose Lesley, noted that he was "very determined" to fight this problem.
"I'm at this point set up quite a decision. When did we get on the narrow path of the idealization of generosity?" he asked.
"Why do we teach future men to look at their growing up through the noise of the problems we see now?"
Kitt believes that television is partly responsible for the popularization of Braille through the image of very brave heroes.
He continued, "What is natural, and what are we planted?
Why does television and the street teach young men that they feel pressured to be the same men?
I think today's really important question is, How can we change it?
'Cause it's obvious that young boys have fallen out of the right way.'
In the interview, he also noted that it will not be removed in any quarter or season after the end of the series of the next summer, because "he's already finished with battle and horses."
From November Kitt will play in the "Real West" game of Sema Shepard, the story of the filmmaker and his brother-in-law.
As the actor was recently released, he considered meeting with his wife, Rose, the best that he had ever received from the "The Game of Shooting" series.
"When I got caught up in this series I met my wife, so he gave me a future family and determined my future," said Kitt.
In a fancy series that won the "Emmy", Rose played the game of Herrington John Snow's hero's love.
The couple arrived in June 2018, and the ceremony took place in the territory of the Lesley family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: In China, 14% of new cases of disease are reported to be related
In China, 14 percent of people with HIV and AIDS are reported to have had an increase in the number of people with HIV and AIDS.
According to health authorities, more than 820,000 patients are reported in the country.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, 40,000 new cases of illness have been reported.
In most cases, the disease was transmitted by an article indicating a change in the past trend.
For a long time, in some regions of China, HIV was rapidly spreading through infected blood during transfusion.
However, as the official representatives of health-protection bodies said during a conference in the province of June, the number of people who were infected with HIV in this way was almost zero.
However, compared with the previous year, the number of HIV - AIDS patients in China increased by 100,000.
The transfer of VIL in a tangible way at the time is a serious problem for the Chinese LGBT community.
The decriminalization of homosexuality in China occurred in 1997 but the LGBT community often suffers from discrimination.
According to the study, between 70 and 90% of men who have sexual relations with other men are further married to women by marrying in a country of conservative values.
In most cases, the transmission of disease is due to the improper use of protective equipment during sexual contact.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised to provide free access to HIV medicines, thus making it possible to address the problem in part.
Max Wutters counters the corruption of senators' data on the network of her state worker and makes a series of criticisms about "the safest lie" and "the theory of fate."
On Saturday, a member of the US Chamber of Representatives, Maxyn Watters made a vote on the fact that one of her state employees contained personal data from three US senators on their websites in Wikipedia.
Democrats from Los Angeles claim that these statements are spreading the ultra-rights of political viewers and websites.
"False, lies, and then even more hateful lies," said Wutters in Twitter.
According to the reports, published information contained home addresses and phone numbers of U.S. senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrina Hetcha from Yuti.
Data appeared on the network at 4:00. They were posted by an unknown person from Capitol during a hearing in the Senate Commission on charges of sexual misconduct against Brett Kavano, a candidate in the office of the U.S. Supreme Court.
The flight took place some time after the three senators asked Kavano.
The Hill report reported that on such conservative websites as Gateway Pundit and RedState, there was information about the IP address of the source of the exit associated with Watters office and was able to find the data of her permanent coworker.
"These irrefutable claims are absolutely false, they don't answer the facts," Wutters continued.
"The staff of my office whose personal data and security have been threatened by these counterfeit and false claims has nothing to do with the outcome of this information.
These irrefutable claims are absolutely false, they do not answer the facts."
The Wutters claim was quickly publicized on the network, among others was also the former White House Press Secretary Ari Flecher.
"This opposition is full of anger," Fleisher wrote.
"It suggests that she cannot be a member of Congress with such a nature.
When someone is accused of something he has not done, he does not need to be angry.
The accused should not behave in a manner that is not acceptable.
He should not question the motives of the one accused.
He must remain calm and steadfast."
Apparently, Flyshire had a parallel between Watters’ reaction and the criticism of the Democrats to the Kawano judge, who was accused of being too upset during the fourth hearing.
Omar Navarro, a candidate from the Republican Party, who is on his way to take up Waters because of inter-elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
"This is the news if it's true," he wrote.
In his statement, Walters noted that her office had already reported "the relevant government and law bodies on these false statements."
"We will do everything we can to find the guilty," she continued, "and they have responded to the law for their actions which are harmful and dangerous to all my employees."
View of the film "Agent Johnny English: New Mission" – a past parade of spies with Rovena Atkinson
It has already become a good tradition to look for every new British film of ideas, founded by Brexit. They are also in the new series of comedy parades on the battle of Johnny English. The first film called "Johnny English" went on screen in 2003 and later replayed in 2011 by calling it "Johnny English: Back".
Will it become a ridiculous and ironic self-sustainment for what we are short-lived, new export potential of the nation?
Or else, Johnny England with his moving face and the eyes of the other person were given the opportunity to make trouble, and his name is more than anything else that indicates that this comical character was created for viewers in non-English countries.
As we know, Johnny is an extremely happy secret agent in which, despite his extraordinary effort to be a gallant and wonderful, he is a little bit from Inspector Clousee, a bit from Mr. Bina and a lot of something - from a guy who played a note of the film of the "Fairy Cars" at the Olympic Games ceremony in London in 2012.
As a person, he is also a commander and a command of an international scale that has always been left behind by the weakness that Atkinson once played in a long - forgotten television commercial by Barclaycard.
The last film on Johnny England has a few good moments.
I liked the scene when Johnny England was near the helicopter, and the thieves were hanging around his neck.
In the film, Atkinson's talent is well-opened to adjust the buffonade, but humour is passing, and at some point it's too much, especially when compared to "serious" coins, such as "Agent 007" and "Missa impossible", one of the "ingredients" which is also a comedy.
It's an impression that the jokes calculated more quickly on children than on adults, and I don't think of the stupid attacks that take place with Johnny England, do not appear to be as vindictive and clever as those of Atkinson in their movies about Bina.
As always, the film begins with a serious threat to Britain.
In the British supersecret network of spies, hacker opens up and reveals the names of all field agents who have become completely desperate for an active agent. ( Sadly, Kevin Eldon has only played the role of the film.)
This proved to be the last step for Prime Minister – a bad person who has already faced a devastating criticism and is in deep depression because of the loss of popularity (Emma Thompson tried to convey the image of Teresa May, but the scenario did not fully reveal it).
The divorce service staff informed her that all the active agents had been compromised, and she had to arrest someone from the other side.
The choice is made by untidy Johnny England, who is now working as a teacher in some super-moded facility and is not officially teaching children how to operate undercover (in this part with the Spanish "school year" English for young people there were a few extra games).
English quickly gets to Witgol at a terminal briefing, where he meets again with his many - suffering friend, Buff, who is playing Ben Miller on the cross.
Buff is now married to the captain of a submarine.
So when everything in her Majesty's Secret Service went to the Schereberte, Betman and Robin are back in the closet and unexpectedly meet the fetal woman of Ophelia Pistoletov, who plays Olga Curylenko.
And at this time, the prime minister is under the care of a charismatic billionaire who has made his article in the field of technology and technology and asserts that it can solve the problem with the British network, the poor Jason Walt, who played by Jake Lacey.
The English and Baf are sent on their journey and they are again able to make their way back to their smiles: they are led by officials to fire in a French skirmish restaurant; they continue to hunt chaos, illegally passing through the corner on the loose Volt's ice; England is setting up a real famine when trying to use a glass of virtual reality to find out about the planning of the Volt's house.
All the obstacles lead us to the final episode, but his kindness and jealousy remind us of a movie for children.
Previous movie.
As I was looking at other artists about Johnny England, I asked myself the same question: can't the British cinema actually offer Rowen Atkinson a role that really corresponds to his talent?
The liborists refuse to prepare a plan that the British will work for four days a week, but they will receive a salary in five days.
The Liberian party, Jeremy Corbin, has to discuss a radical plan that the British will work four days a week, but they will be paid in five days.
It turns out that the party wants to force the company's managers to transfer the costs that have been saved by the revolution of artificial intelligence, by providing them with additional exits.
In this way, workers will have a third - day exit and will bring home the same wage.
According to the sources, this idea will correspond to the party’s economic program and direct the country’s resources to support the working class.
The four-day work week was approved at the British Congress of the Third Union, and it is shown that workers can thus benefit from changing the overall economic situation.
Geraldo of the Leiborist Party reported in The Sunday Times: "The political review will be announced at the end of the year.
It will not change in one night, but the idea of a four-day working week corresponds to the party's approach to changing economic balance in the interests of the workers, as well as the overall thinking strategy of the party."
The liborists did not first accept this idea, as the Green Party promised to hold a four-day working week still during the 2017 preliminary campaign.
However, not all members of the Leiborist Party at that time agree.
"The party's political programme is not scheduled to launch a four-day working week, so we don't consider this idea right now."
"Tinian" Chancellor John McDonnell introduced his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy on the pre-war of the Leborist Party last week.
Mr. McDonnell said that he was prepared to take back power from "the poor directors" of municipal enterprises and "visitors".
The plan also means that the shareholders of the water supply company may not get their full share of the capital if the Liberian government initiates "renumbering" on the basis of the alleged infringements.
He also confirmed the intention to include employees in corporate governance and to create an inclusive share fund to transfer 10% of the normal shares to the private sector's companies, which are expected to meet annual dividends of up to 500 pounds of stellings.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy are talking at the show 60 Minutes (60 minutes), whether it is possible to examine the affairs of Cavano, who is leading the FBI, to change their mind
In connection with the investigation of the prosecution against Judge Brett Kavano, who is head of the FBI, the final vote for his appointment as Judge of the Supreme Court is postponed at least every week.
In the Sunday show, 60 Minutes correspondent Scott Pelley asked Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find something that would change their mind.
Kennedy appeared more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
"Yes, of course," said Kennedy.
During the hearing, I told him that I had a discussion with Judge Kavano.
I telephoned him after all the charges had been made and I asked him, "Did you really do this?"
He was determined, consistent, uncompromising."
It seems that the concept of Graham no longer changes.
"I think the removal of the Kavan accused is a provocation," he said.
"Doctor Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett decided to deny everything," added Graham, turning to Christine Blaise Ford.
And everyone she calls can't confirm it under her oath.
It was 36 years ago.
I don't understand what might change."
What is the Global Citizen Festival, and how can it affect poverty reduction?
This Saturday, New York will host the Festival of Global Citizen Festival (World Festival), an annual event in the music world with a huge number of star players and at least an exciting mission, to fight poverty in all the world.
During the seventh global Citizen Festival, tens of thousands of people will go to the headquarters of the Central Park, not only to celebrate the events of Janet Jackson, Cardi B, and Sean Mendez, but also to pay attention to the real goal of the festival — the organizers want to overcome the extreme form of poverty by 2030.
The Festival of Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is the continuation of the Global Poverty Project, the international public organization, which is expected to eradicate poverty by increasing the number of people who are actively fighting it.
In order to get a free ticket on the event (if you just don't want to pay a VIP ticket), visitors must perform a low job or "acts", such as to learn on a volunteer project, write an electronic letter to the world leader, make a phone call or anything else to help pay attention to the organization's objective – poverty eradication.
So have there been any results since the Global Citizen organizers were 12 years behind?
Is it really the idea to win for a free concert -- the general way to convince people to ask for action, or is it just another case called "clicitism", when people feel that they really change something by signing an electronic petition or by making a publication on Twitter?
According to Global Citizen, in 2011, they have set up 19 million "actions" for their clients aimed at achieving various objectives.
The organization claims that these actions have moved world leaders to claim financial organizations and programs for more than $37 billion, which will help to change lives by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group set out as an example of its 390 financial commitments and public statements, and at least 10 billion had already been collected and spent.
According to estimates, the estimated cost of living has already affected some 649 million people around the world.
Among the main financial commitments are the Fund The Power of Nutrition, which is territorially related to Britain. In the project, investors and realists took on the obligation to "help children grow" and promised to provide Rwanda with $35 million to deal with the problem of malnutrition after they received more than 4700 messages from the Global Citizens organization in Twitter.
"For the support of the British government, the coins, the governments of other countries and the citizens of the world, such as you, we can make a social problem of not having a significant historical fact," said the representative of The Power of Nutrition Tracy Walman, speaking in front of the audience during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The organization also stated that after 5000 "actions", which called for better food for mothers and children, the British government announced the cost allocation for the project The Power of Nutrition aimed at improving the consumption of 5 million mothers and children.
In response to one of the common questions on your website, "Why do you think you can fight the extreme level of poverty?"
Global Citizen's representatives wrote: "This is a long and difficult way, so sometimes we will fall and we will suffer failure.
But like the participants in civil rights and anti-parity movement, we will succeed, because together we are stronger."
Janet Jackson, a daughter of The Weekend, Sean Mendez, Cardi B, Janell Mona, is just a part of the star performances that will be held this year at the New York Festival, and will be held by Debor Lee Fernes and Guy Jackman.
The Interior Minister said that the United States could use military and maritime forces for blockades to prevent the export of Russian energy resources
According to U.S. Interior Minister Ryan Zinke's statement at Washington Examiner, "for the sake of necessity" Washington can turn to military and maritime forces to prevent Russian energy flows on the market, including the Middle East markets.
Zinka stated that Russia’s participation in the conflict in Syria, especially where it acts at the request of the legal government, is a way to find new energy.
"I think they're living in the Middle East because they want to be the center of the energy trade, as they're already doing in Eastern and South Europe," he said.
According to the owner, there are ways and means to solve the problem.
"Because of the US military and maritime forces, it can provide free access to the maritime routes and, as necessary, block them so that Russian energy resources do not reach the market," he said.
The sign was addressed to the members of the host organization Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit organization that represents itself as "the voice of every consumer" in the United States.
He further compared trade approaches with Russia and Iran, noting that they are actually similar.
"The economic strategy for Iran and Russia is generally based on the fact that we use energy effectively and contain alternative resources," he said, calling Russia "one-timely developed", because its economy is dependent on energy sources of mineral origin.
During the month of these statements, the Trapa administration aimed at increasing exports of natural gas to Europe, requiring the energy market of Russia’s origin, a significant option for Europeans.
To this end, the residents of the Tramp administration and President Donald Tramp himself are trying to convince the German government to reject the "independence" project of the "Northern Flight 2", which, according to Trampa, makes Berlin the prisoner of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the "Northern Flight 2" gas is worth 11 billion dollars and doubles the passing capacity of the existing gas to 110 billion cubic meters, except an economic project.
The Kremlin is convinced that Washington has a slow response to the project only for economic reasons, which is an example of unfair competition.
"In my view, we share the view that energy resources cannot be an instrument of pressure and consumer choice," said Russian Minister of Energy Alexander Novak after a meeting with the US Minister of Energy, Rick Perry, who took place in Moscow in September.
The United States had a negative reaction from Germany, which confirmed its support for the project.
The German Glue Organisation of the Federal Federation of German Industry (BDI) has urged the United States not to intervene in EU energy policy and bilateral reconciliation between Berlin and Moscow.
"I don't like it when a third country comes into our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federal Federation of German Industry, after the last meeting of German Chancellor Angeli Merkel with Russian President Putin.
Senator of Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren "seriously Thinks" about the president's vote in 2020
Senator of Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that "he's seriously thinking" about the president's vote after the inter-election.
During a civil meeting in Goliok, Massachusetts, Vorren confirmed that she was considering the possibility of submitting her application.
According to The Hill Warren magazine, "How many women go to Washington and prepare for the government's work, and for this, there must be a woman in his head."
"After the 6th of November, I think seriously about the removal of my candidate to the president's post."
During a meeting with the citizens, Warren expressed his assessment of the presidential status of Donald Trump, saying that he "will lead his country not in that direction.
"I'm extremely worried about what Donald Trump is doing with our democracy," she said.
Vorren was open and criticised by Trampa and proposed a candidate for the position of Judge of the Supreme Court, Brett Kavano.
In Vorren's fifth tweet, it said, "... Of course, the FBI has to investigate before the vote."
However, according to the survey conducted on Friday, most Varrens don't think they should fight in 2020.
According to the results of a survey jointly conducted by the Political Research Centre of the University of Saffolk and the publication The Boston Globe, fifty-eight percent of the state's potential voters in Massachusetts spoke against the removal of their candidate.
Thirty-two percent supported the challenge.
The results of the survey showed that the former Governor of Deval Patrick used more support.
During the discussion of the candidates of other prominent democracies who can fight in 2020, former vice president Joe Baiden and Senator from Vermont Bernie Sanders.
According to the Associated Press, Bayden stated that he would decide to marry.
Sara Peelin mentions the PTSR of the Peelin River during the battle in support of Donald Tramp
26-year-old Trek Pellin spent the year in Iraq after entering military service in September.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence.
"What my son is going through now, because he's coming back, can only be understood by other families who are experiencing the consequences of PTSD and other health problems that our soldiers are returning home," she said in front of the supporters of Donald Trump's support in Talsa, Oklahoma.
Peelin called Trik's arrest "a problem no one pays attention to," and said her son and other veterans of war "return home to those who were more violent than before, and want to know if they respect what their brothers, pilots and other military officers have done here for this country."
According to a spokesman from the police department of Vasilla, Den Bennetta, Trek was arrested on Monday in the city of Vasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence and assault on the woman, as well as that he banned a report on violence and had a weapon in the state of alcohol storage.
18 states and the region of Colombia support the policy of contributing
Eighty - eight states and areas of Colombia support the prosecution of a new U.S. policy, according to which the victims of Banditish persecution and domestic violence are denied refugee status.
According to the NBC News, representatives of 18 states and districts sent an analytical report to the Washington court consultant to support a petition that needed an attachment and made it clear in the court order of the policy.
The full name of the call for Grace vs. Seans, called the American Union for the Protection of Civil Rights, in which federal policy is being violated and which was submitted in August is not disclosed.
The caller said her partner "and her cruel son-in-law" was her, but the U.S. deputys rejected her when she asked for the 20th anniversary.
She was illegally detained in Texas.
State prosecutors who support Grace's calls have said that the inhabitants of El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala (the refugees who often apply for asylum in the United States) are often faced with serious problems such as banditism and domestic violence.
The new refugee status policy reflects the decision of the 2014 Appeals Council on immigration, according to which immigrants without documents fled from domestic violence could apply.
In his speech on Friday, General Prosecutor General Carl Reisin of Colombia stated that the new policy "ignores the decades of state, federal and international laws".
"Federal law requires that the decision on the application for refugee status be based on the facts and circumstances described in the statement and the prohibition violates this principle," the court's analytical record says.
In the analysis, the prosecutors continue to argue that the policy prohibiting immigrants from entering the United States would damage the economies of the country, as they could potentially become entrepreneurs and "fill the required labour resources."
Dr. Jeff Seschens gave orders to immigration judges in June that they could no longer provide refugee status to those who run from domestic violence and bantism.
"Privacy is granted to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear of persecution in connection with racial ownership, religion, nationalism, membership in certain civil groups or political views," Seschens said during the presentation of the policy on 11 June.
It was never intended to solve all the problems that people around the world face every day.
Rescuers desperately try to find those who are left alive, while the number of those who died in Paul’s city grew twice as many as possible
For those who remain alive, the situation continues to deteriorate.
"Situation is very tense," says a 35-year-old mother, comforting her little boy with a lyhomanko in the evacuation center of the city of Paula.
"Every minute the quick help will bring the body.
The clean water is not enough."
Some residents return to their ruined homes, taking over the accumulated benefits, trying to destroy what they have found.
Hundreds of people have been injured, and doctors who have been injured by earthquakes, the force of which has weighed 7.5 pounds [7.5 kg] on Richter’s scale, have been exhausted.
Some of the wounded, including the two Geres with their backs and shoulders, rest near the military hospital, where the patients receive help from the sky through constant repeated mail.
His eyes were filled with tears when he remembered how a strong mailman pushed a hotel on the fifth floor where he lived with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time for a break.
I think I've been hit in the middle of the walls," said Geres Correspondent Associated Press, adding that he and his family had come to the city on Christmas.
"I heard my wife crying for help and then panicked quietly.
I don't know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they're safe."
The US Ambassador accuses China of "real psychological pressure" through "progressive advertising"
A week after the Chinese state newspaper published on four pages of the US daily advertising material on the mutual benefit of trade between the United States and China, the US ambassador in China accused Beijing of using the US press to preach.
The president of the United States Donald Tramp of the past sent a payment supplement to China Daily in Des Moines Register, the most popular newspaper of the state of Iowa after the Chinese prosecution, to try to influence the elections to the Congress, which will be held on 6 November. China rejects these charges.
According to the U.S. official Reuters agency, Trampa, in which he accuses Beijing of being involved in American elections, means a new phase of isolation from Washington, China.
While foreign governments may include advertising for the activation of trade, there is a time when the ejaculation of the trade war, which they have already raised to import fraud.
In the minds of experts from China and the United States, at the beginning of this war, the imposition of a repressive myth in China was aimed at attacking exporters from countries such as Ieva, who supported the Republican Party of Trip.
Terry Brensted, a US Ambassador to China and former governor of the state of Iowa, the largest exporter of agricultural production to China, stated that China had caused damage to American workers, farmers and companies.
China, as Brensted wrote in the column of the immediate release of Des Moines Register, "enforces the pressure by publishing a promotion, in our independent press."
"The Chinese government uses the way for the American people's tradition of freedom of speech and the independence of the press, including a tax advertising campaign in Des Moines Register," wrote Brensted.
"On the contrary, on the street maps here in Beijing, you will only look for a single voice of the opposite. Here you will not see the real picture of what the Chinese people really think about the direct development of the Chinese economy, which is causing anxiety, which can lead to the conclusion that the Chinese people are living under the trustworthy control of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He also added that "one of the important Chinese publications offered to publish" his article, but didn't call it what it was.
Analyticals warn that the failure of the Republican Republicans will set up against themselves women-electors before the inter-elections
Since many prominent Republicans support and protect the candidate for the post of Supreme Court of Bretta Cavano after several sexual charges have been brought against him, analysts warn that this could lead to an unwanted reaction to the previous inter-elections, especially in women.
Around this situation, the majority of the Republicans say that they would like to vote.
Such things can't just be played back then," said the lecture The Hill, published on Saturday, Grant Riger, professor of politics at the School of Maxwell of the University of Syracuse.
Riger expressed doubts that the FBI's investigation, at which last minute Senator Jeff Fleck (Republic of Arizona), would be enough to calm down the angry voters.
According to Washington, D.C., the leading consultant and spokesman for the progressive group of MoveOn (Ruhay) Katrin Jean-Perry said on Friday: "Women will not forget what happened yesterday: they will not forget about it either tomorrow or in November."
According to Mic, protestors sang "The West is approaching!" on Friday morning during a demonstration at the Legal Committee, when the Republicans decided to proceed to the Cavano candidate's approval, despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blaise Ford.
In an interview with a news website by Steve Rottenberg, a post-political observer, said, "People will be very interesting and motivated."
"They say that it is now, and that's the truth.
However, motivation can be related, especially in women 18 to 29 years of age who have not yet determined and often do not vote if they do not like the president."
Even before the Ford gave a witness in connection with the complainant's allegations on the position of the Supreme Court judge in sexual crime, the analysts predicted the negative reaction of the electors if the Republicans were to insist.
According to NBC News, earlier this week the head of the National Committee of the Republican Party Michael Steel said, "This is an unpleasant story for the Republican Party."
As the director of the U.S. Priorities, director of the U.S. News Channel, Guy Cecil, said, "not right to vote on the committee, the final vote, or the fact that Cavano appeared on the left of the judges, but on how they responded to the situation and how they went on to act."
However, the American view of what to believe, Ford or Cavanath, has been divided, and there is little more support for Ford.
As a result of a new study by YouGov 41% of respondents believe or believe in Ford, while Kawano believes or believes 35% of the respondents.
In addition, 38 percent of the respondents noted that, in their view, Cavano gave or gave false testimony at all, while 30 percent of the respondents said it about Ford.
According to The Guardian magazine, after the Flyk FBR has been arrested by the accused, the Ford and another caller, Debore Ramirez.
Last week, Ford gave a witness to the Senate's Legal Committee on how Cavano attacked her, living in a state of alcoholic sleep when she was 17 years old.
Ramires stated that a candidate in the position of the Supreme Court showed her his generality at night during their studies at the University of Ellis in the 1980s.
The Internet Internet portal plans to launch a "new Internet" to create Google and Facebook competition
Tim Berners-Lei, the founder of the global Internet, starts a new start to create a competition for Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest world technology legend project, Inrupt, is developing a platform with an open source code of Solid, which belongs to Berners-Lei.
With a Solid platform, users can choose where to store data and give access to this or other information.
In an exclusive interview, Fast Company Berners-Ley suggested that the goal of Inrupt is "world domination".
"We should do this now," he said about the start.
It's a historic moment."
Solid technology is used to enable users to create "personal data storage" or POD.
It can contain contact lists, current lists, calendars, audio recordings, and other tools for personal use and work.
It's like using Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify at the same time in one browser.
The unique feature of this personal online repository is that it fully meets the needs of a user who can access any information.
The company calls it "increasing personal opportunities through data."
According to Director General Inrupt John Bruce, the company aims to operate resources, processes and corresponding skills to make the Solid platform accessible to everyone.
At this time, the company is composed of Berners-Lei, Bruce, the security platform for IBM, a number of state developers, dedicated to the project, and the volunteer community of programmers.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their own autonomous applications using tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lei said that he and his team will not negotiate with Facebook and Google about whether to make a full exchange when all their business models are experiencing a sudden change over a short period of time.
"We don't ask for their permission."
In a press release on the Media Berners-Lei, the Inrupt mission "to provide commercial energy and ecosystem and to help protect the integrity and quality of the new network created on a solid platform".
In 1994, Berners Lee transformed the Internet, establishing the Consortium of World Heritage in the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In the last month, Berners-Lie is an influential figure in the debate on network neutrality.
Even at the start of Inrupt Berners-Lie, he remained the founder and director of the World Heritage Consortium, The Web Foundation and the Institute of Open Data.
"I'm very optimistic about the next Euro of Network Development," added Berners Lee.
Bernard Van: Celebration of the Church of the Cross of Victoria in World War I · Global Voices
The only representative of the Church of England who received the Order of the Cross of Victoria to participate in the war during World War I is in his home town 100 years ago.
Former Colonel Bernard Vann was awarded an award for his involvement in the attack under the Belgian and Leukor on September 29, 1918.
He died four days later, however, and he never realized that he had received the highest military award in Britain.
On Saturday, two of his grandsons discovered a memorial stone during a parade in the town of Raschen, Nortgemptonshire.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, called it "very symbolic" what happened to the discovery of a monumental stone over 100 years after his grandfather made a victory for which he was rewarded.
According to London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Colonel Van moved his battalion through the San Kate channel "through a very thick tunnel and under the thick fire of the fields of heat and heat."
Then he rushed to the fireplace, and with the "excessive hobbling" he pulled the arrow forward, then one went to the field and destroyed three of the enemy's shells.
Colonel Vanna shot a German gun on October 4, 1918 — a little more than a month before the end of the war.
72-year-old Michael Vann said his grandfather did what he could never do, and he deserves respect.
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, took the lead in the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that "he feels very proud of taking part in this advice" and added that "the reputation of a real hero demonstrates the chance that so many people show him."
The MMA fans didn't sleep all night to see the Bellator 206 tournament, but instead they showed them the "Pep's Swink"
Imagine that you don't sleep all night just to see the events of the Bellator 206 tournament, and you're denied the chance to see the main event.
There were 13 wars in San Jose, including six of the basic program units that were operating at night in Britain on 5 channels.
About 6 o'clock in the morning, just before Gregor Moses and Rory McDonald were ready to go to the unit, the British televisions died from a vision when the war was on the screen instead of a bomb.
Some observers were not aware of this because they did not sleep until the very morning, waiting for the war to take place.
One of the fans wrote on Twitter that the switch to a child's multifilm seemed to him "a little bit of a joke."
"According to a government decree that had been transferred on the 6th morning, it was inappropriate, so they were forced to leave a child transmission," said Dave Schwarz, the senior vice president of the marketing and connections to the city of Bellator when he was asked about a television transmitter,
"Skinka Poppa," yes.
The president of Bellator Scott Kocker promised to work on a traffic schedule to cover future coverage and viewers in Britain.
"I think that if we talk about retranslation, we can adjust it," Kouker said.
"Now it's Sunday, 6th morning, and we can't do anything until we have a Sunday, and it's Monday.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the transmission was turned off, we received a lot of messages that we answered, and the text of these messages was not very friendly.
We thought it was a technical misunderstanding, and we tried to remove it.
However, this proved to be an incompatibility to government signatures.
I can promise you no more of that.
We're speeding up a tournament to five games instead of six, as usual, and we're trying to make a signal for the fans, but before they're done.
It's a really unpleasant situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daily felt "best" for others because of his sexual orientation
The Olympics in Water Tom Daily reports that he grew up feeling worse than others because of his sexual orientation, but this motivated him to succeed.
A 24-year-old sportsman said he didn't understand that "not all like him," until he went to high school.
After participating in the transfer of the Desert Island Discs to Radio 4, which led by Lauren Lavern, he noted that he was openly referring to the rights of gays to give others hope.
He also stated that because of parenting, the victory over the Olympics was less than a victory.
However, the long time that this program has been running, Kirsty Young, went to the hospital for a few months.
When he came as a couple at Lavern's first program, Dale said he felt "best" for others in childhood because "the society didn't accept when people liked boys and girls."
He said, "So far the feeling of minorityness and differentity has been the only thing that has given me the strength and strength to achieve success."
He said he wanted to know that something was worth not to surprise all those who finally learned about his orientation.
A two-year-old Olympic champion became famous for the rights of LBGT society and used a picture of the annual Games of the Society in Australia to call for more countries to dedreminerate homosexuality.
He said he was openly speaking about his views because he felt happy that he could live openly without any consequences, and wanted to give others this "hope."
The three - year world champion realized that his feelings toward a man, American filmmaker Dustin Lannsa Black, whom he met in 2013, had become a real surprise to him.
Délie met with an Oskar prize winner, 20 years older than he, last year, but, as he said, the difference in age was never a problem.
"If you're going through so much in such a young age" (in the first Olympic games he was 14 years old, and in three years his father died of cancer), it's hard to find someone of his age who would also have survived the likes of flying and falling.
There was a son named Robert Black Daily in June, and since then, according to Daily, his "world acceptance" has changed.
"If you asked me last year, I'd just think about what to get gold," he said.
"You know, things are much more important than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold is Robbie."
His son was named after his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after he was diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daily, he said that his father could not die before he died, and he asked if they had brought flowers to the London Olympics 2012 because he wanted to sit in the first row.
"I couldn't tell him, "You won't sit in the first row, because you won't be next," said Dale.
"I held him by the hand when he stopped breathing, and only after he actually stopped breathing and dying, I finally realized that he was not immortal," he said.
The following year, Delilah took part in the Olympic Games in 2012 and won a prize.
"I knew it was the dream of my whole life: to throw myself in front of my fellow pastors at the Olympic Games, and there was no feeling better about it," said Dale.
This feeling also encouraged him to choose his first song, Proud (Goldy), in the performance of Güser Smoll, who resonated with him during the preparation of the Olympic Games and continues to cry out for fear.
The Desert Island Discs program is released on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11.15 in English during the summer.
On Saturday with a tourmate for "Rayder's Cube" they took Michaelson, who was not in the shape
American Phil Michaelson will set up a record on Sunday playing his 47th game in the tournament for "Cuboc Ryder", but he has to renew his form so that this event didn't happen to him unhappy.
Michaelson, who took part in a tournament that takes place two years ago, released Captain Jim Furrick at the time of the forums and forums.
Instead of staying at the center of events, as he often did, playing in the United States, a five-year-old winner encouraged the team and trained the side, hoping to cope with emotions.
Since Michaelson didn't get the credit for his career, 48-year-old sportsman didn't fit for a hard field for the Le Golf National golf course, where the riff usually beats with a bloc.
And if it's not that way, at the ninth floor of Michaelson on Sunday, you'll have to meet with the champion of the Open Championship and the master of the exact hit of Franks Molinary, who in exchange with novelty Tommy Flytwood won all his matches this week.
If the Americans who leave their three eyes after 12 single mats begin well, Michaelson’s match can be decisive.
Furic expressed confidence in his sport, and he probably had nothing to add.
"He finally realized his role today, threw me in the back, fought and said he'd be ready tomorrow," said Furic.
"He doesn't doubt in his strength.
Michaelson, a member of the Hall of Glory, has done so much for the team last week.
I guess I didn't figure he'd play in two matches.
I predicted more matches, but it came out, and we decided to do so.
He wants to be there, in the field, like anyone else."
If Michaelson goes out on the field on Saturday, he's gonna kill Nick Faldo, who played the largest number of matches in the "Rayder Cup" tournament.
He may finish his career in the "Cuboc Ryder" tournament, which never responded to his individual achievement.
Michaelson's account of 18 victories, 20 examples, and 7 zeros, but Furic said that his presence could play a decisive role for the team.
"He's funny, funny, gentle, he likes to chat with others, he's a guy who's good at his command," explained Furic.
"I think the young players had a good look at it and this week, and it was interesting to observe.
He's more than just a player."
The captain of the European team, Thomas Byron, knows that the big deal is not going to be resolved
Thomas Bionn, the captain of the European team, knows from experience that the emotional gap in front of the unique matches of the last day of the tournament for the "Cuboc Ryder" does not guarantee victory.
The date was debated in 1997 in the field of the Valderram Club, where the command on the head of Sevo Balleteros was handed over to the Americans in five eyes, but she won in the match with a small difference with the result of 1411⁄2:131/2.
"You remind yourself that we had a great break in the Valderram field; a big one in Brooklyn where we won, and in the Valderram field where we won violence," said Bourne after reviewing the winning games of Class 2018 with the result of 5:3 on Friday and the teacher at the Le Golf National Stadium, after which the break was 10.6.
So history teaches me and every player of the team that there's no choice yet.
I need to play with the maximum performance tomorrow.
Get out of the field and do everything you need.
The game will be finished only after the result appears on the table.
We have the goal of getting this trophies, and that's what we want.
As I said earlier, I focus on the 12 players of our team, but we are well aware of those who oppose us -- the best players in the world."
Satisfied with the expression of his players in the complex field, Bion added: "I will never run forward.
It's all going to be different tomorrow.
Tomorrow we're expected to have personal matters, and that's something else.
It's nice to play in the field with a partner when everything's going well, but just when you're standing there, and you can check what you're worth as a golfer.
Here's how players should be configured to do tomorrow: at the limit of possibilities.
You leave your partner without support, and now he has to show you what's going on."
By contrast, the opposite number, Jim Furic, expects his partners to play better on an individual level, except Jordan Spita and Justin Thomas, who had three shots of four.
To the very end of the last day, Furikka returned to different parties: he was among the winners in Brooklyn, but he was disappointed when a European team created a "Water in Midian".
"I remember every single word," he said in response to the question of how Ben Krenshu, captain of the 1999 team, organized players before the last day of the fight.
"We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but we need to get started successfully as it was in Brooklyn and Midian.
When the initiative moves somewhere, players in the middle of the distance experience special pressure.
We were properly placed by the players in the team, so we're going to go, guy, do something incredible tomorrow."
Tomasus was ordered to try to put an end to the rebellion against Rory McKilroy, and the first half of the European teams were listed by Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Ram, Tommy Flytwood and Ian Potter.
"Only these partners and in this order I chose because I want to share the effort equally throughout the game," Byron recommended his choice of players on individual matches.
The introduction of a new German warship was repeated
The latest flag of the German Navy fleet was to be launched in 2014 instead of the old war courts of the Cold War. However, according to local media, this will not occur until the next year due to the unjust system and the increasing cost.
According to the newspaper Die Zeit, obtained from the military-reinforcement speaker, the introduction of the Reynland-Pfalz ship, the main ship of the latest class frigates Baden-Wurtemberg, was launched by the first half of 2019.
The ship was to join the rest of the fleet in 2014, but the problems that arose after the shipment had damaged the implementation of the ambitious project.
Four Baden-Wurtemberg class ships, which were ordered by the U.S. Navy in 2007, have to replace the old Bremen class frigates.
Understandably, they will be supplied with a strong host, a host of anti-aircraft and protoralytic rockets, as well as with some technologies to reduce awareness, including radiological, infracher and acoustic.
Another important feature is the long-term technical security period, which is expected to be able not to return to the base port for about two years.
Journalists Die Zeit, however, cautions that, as a result of the constant suspension of the current military ships that had to force Germany’s military forces into the sea, they are also slowing down at the moment of their entry into operation.
A massive F125 strike took place in the headline of the Turkish newspaper, when the German army forces officially refused to enter the ship and returned it to the Blohm + Voss summit in Hamburg.
This is the first case of the return of the military ship to the shipbuilding company after delivery.
The reason for the return was little, but the German media mentioned significant "software and equipment" due to which the warship was unable to carry out military operations.
The lack of software is particularly significant, since the Baden-Wurtemberg class crew is about 120 seafarers, only half of the soldiers who served on the old Bremen class frigates.
It has also been shown that the ship has a great deal of weight that weakens its operational characteristics and limits its potential for further modernization.
It is thought that the Rhineland-Paltz flag is twice as heavy (7,000 tons) as the same class used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to mismanagement, the overall value of the project has become an issue, which also includes the cost of equipment preparation.
An estimated 2.2 billion euros have turned into 3.1 billion euros (3.6 billion dollars).
The problems of getting new frigates have been particularly important in the light of recent warnings about the collapse of German military-morrow forces.
At the beginning of the year, Bundestag, a member of the Ghans-Peter Bartles, said that the WMS had "a small number of ships capable of carrying out military tasks".
The officer said that the situation had deteriorated dramatically over a period of time, since the old ship had been released from operation and the new had not arrived.
He was deeply sorry for the fact that none of the Baden-Wurtemberg class frigates couldn't complete the military-morrow fleet.
A National Trait to Be Watchful for the Secret of Life
A new survey carried out on the territory of land management in the Scotland Summit aims to establish how the said landshaft is used in food search.
Scientists hope that the data obtained will help to shed light on the behavior of these unique flight crews so that they can proceed with their preservation in the future.
In the gardens of Inver, Western Russia, the scientists of the National Forest of Scotland will observe such kinds as non-pearl and non-petroleum, as well as regular and watery nights.
Special registers will be placed in strategic locations in the field of land management to observe what has been said during the season.
Workers and volunteers from Scotland’s National Heritage will also conduct mobile research using hand detectors.
An expert analysis of all recorded sounds will help to establish the frequency and relevance of the voices.
Then it is planned to draw up a report on animal survival and prepare reports to link animal behavior with the environment.
Rob Duar, a natural protection counselor in Scotland's National Loss, is expected to help determine which areas of life are the most important and how they are used in each species.
This information will help to assess the efficiency of the environment's environment management (e.g. the layout of the holes) and determine the optimal methods of forest storage for spoken and other related species.
During the last century, what has been said has been significantly reduced in Scotland and in Britain.
They are threatened with active construction and development of areas that leave them vulnerable to pollution.
Among other negative factors are wind installations and lighting, ice - cream paper, chemical processing of building materials, as well as household kitchens.
They're actually not blind.
However, by swimming during the night, the ears are more effective than the eyes.
They use a complex ecosystem method to detect comets and obstacles to flight trajectory.
More than 270 historical buildings, 38 buildings of special value, and 76,000 acres [76,000 ha] of land throughout the country are seriously affected by the problem.
Ten special trained experts regularly do research, research, and sometimes even rescue operations.
The organization's rape was even the first and only commander in Scotland, and it's located in the territory of Triv in the Dampris-end-Gallway area, where eight of the ten species of sayers live in Scotland.
David Thompson's manager says it's an ideal place for them.
"In the territory there are three wonderful conditions for speakers," he says.
"It's old buildings, many giant trees and other friendly living conditions.
But we still need to learn a lot about what we're talking about, and with the research we're doing here and elsewhere, we can learn more about what they need to grow."
He insists that it is very important to verify the presence of the territory before any technical work is carried out, as by the indiscriminate destruction of one place of pregnancy for the release of a young person, it can kill up to 400 children alone, which is likely to cause the destruction of all the local population.
They are said to be protected by the law, and animals are prohibited from killing, torture or concern.
Elizabeth Ferrell, a member of the Scottish Conservative Center, urged the community to join the organization’s efforts.
She said, "We still have much to learn about what we're talking about, and we haven't yet discovered the characteristics of the population of many species."
Ronalda rejects the charges of rape and his lawyers prepare calls against the German press
Cristian Ronald called charges of rape "indiscriminately" and said that people "were trying to draw attention to themselves", using his name.
His lawyer was ready to appeal to the German newspaper Der Spiegel, where he was published on suspicion.
American Catherine Mayorg accused a group of Portugal and a football club "Juventus" of rape, which took place in 2009 in a hotel number in Las Vegas.
According to Der Spiegel's magazine on Friday, Ronald seemed to pay her $375,000 for her speech.
A few hours after the 33-year-old Ronald was excommunicated, he turned to 142 million of his followers in a video broadcast in Instagram, calling the corresponding messages "accompaniment".
"No, no, no, no, no!
Today's charges are a joke," said the five-year-old Golden Dog in the camera.
"They want to draw attention to themselves using my name.
It's natural.
These people want to feed me, but similar situations are part of my work.
I'm a happy man and I'm all right," added a football player, laughing.
According to the Reuters intelligence agency, Ronald's lawyers are preparing calls against Der Spiegel for published accusations that they have called "an unacceptable message of suspicion in the field of private life".
Lawyer Christian Sherc said that a football player would require compensation for "a moral damage in terms of the seriousness of the breach which is probably one of the most serious cases of personal rights violations in recent years."
It is claimed that the incident took place in June 2009 at the Palms Casino Hotel in Las Vegas.
It is reported that after a meeting in the night club, Ronald and Maiorga returned to the player’s number where they seemed to have raped her, such testimony was handed to the district court in Clark, Nevada.
Major says that after Ronald's incident, he fell in front of him on his knees and said he was "99 percent of a good guy", which led to "one percent."
As noted in the documents, Ronaldo confirmed that he had sex with the model, but in general.
Myrga also claims that she turned to the police and then to the hospital where her injuries were photographed, but later she agreed to a post-trial settlement because she was "dangerous" and threatened "public humiliation".
Now a 34-year-old woman wants to cancel the previous marriage, because she continues to suffer from an incident that she says had a place.
At the time of Ronald's incident, he was preparing to move to the Real Madrid FC from the Manchester United FC this summer, he became the player of the Italian football team, the Uventus team, for 100 million euros.
Brexit: Great Britain "will permanently damage" the loss of car manufacturers
Great Britain "will be permanently damaged" if it loses the status of the world leader in the wake of Brexit. This is what the Minister of Economics of Greg Clark warns.
He added that he welcomed the statement by representatives of Toyota UK who told BBC journalists that in the case of Britain's absence from the EU, the company would have to stop its production and work in Bernaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese author said that the effects of the cut-off on the Brexit line could cost jobs without agreement.
In Bernaston, where the Toyota models Auris and Aventis are manufactured, nearly 150,000 cars, 90 percent of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"In my view, if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, production will be stopped on our farm," said Marvin Cook, Director General Toyota in Bernaston.
Other car manufacturers, such as Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, are also worried about how Britain's exit from the EU without agreement on international trade.
For example, BMW stated that the Mini model factory in Oxford would be closed within a month after Brexit.
The main concerns of car manufacturers are that Brexit could cause risks to supply chains without agreement.
The Toyota line manufacturer works in the mode of the operational supply of details and materials, as required, the details are available every 37 minutes from suppliers in Britain and the EU for car rentals.
If, on March 29, Great Britain leaves the EU without agreement, there can be a breach in the supply of details that will lead to arrests and lack of material.
As noted in the company, Toyota can contain no more details than one day, so the production will have to stop.
Greg Clark pointed out that the organization's plan is to associate with the EU, prepared by the Chess Plan, "except for schemes to avoid problems on the horizon".
"We need an agreement. We need to make an optimal agreement which, in my view, will enable us not only to achieve success at the moment but also to use the prospects that have occurred," he said during today's program for BBC Radio 4.
"In view of the testimony of the representatives of Toyota company, as well as other car manufacturers, we need to finally keep up-to-date high-efficiency supply chains."
The Toyota company could not tell how long the production would be stopped, but in a long-term perspective it is expected that the cost increase would reduce the competitiveness of the company and, as a result, have to cut down the jobs.
Peter Cavalaris, head of the U.S. Professional Association for Business, who worked here for 24 years, said that other participants were extremely worried: "I can tell from experience that the short-term jobs are not renewed."
The representative of the government noted: "We have issued a precise and reliable plan for forming our future relations with the EU."
Trip and Rosenstein’s meeting can be relocated, marked in the White House
As the representatives of the White House reported on Sunday, a meeting of Donald Tramp with the deputy general of Dr. Rod Rozenstein could be "even a week" until they held discussions on the removal of Brett Cavano's application to the Supreme Court.
Rosenstein controls the work of Special Prosecutor Robert Muller, who is investigating Russia's involvement in the election, the links between the supporters of Trump and Russia and the potential obstacle to justice by the president.
For a few months in Washington, they have discussed the possibility of releasing the prosecutor-general, who poses a threat to Mueller’s independence.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had made use of the microphones to record talks with the tramp and the possibility of a direct cessation of the president's completely under the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein did not confirm this information.
But on Monday, he visited the White House on the back of the news that the officer was about to leave.
Instead of this meeting with Trump, who was then at the UN headquarters in New York, was appointed on Thursday.
The tramp said that "I don't want to" release Rosenstein, but then the meeting was dismissed to avoid a run for time with a meeting of the Legal Committee of the Senate to witness to Kavano and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment, Dr. Christine Blaise Ford.
On Friday, Trump was scheduled to conduct a weekly FBI investigation on charges against Cavano, which further eliminated the vote in Senate.
Press Secretary Trampa, Sarah Sanders, spoke on the TV show Fox News Sunday.
The question of meeting with Rosenstein was, "The date of the meeting is not assigned, maybe it's going to happen this week, and I'm waiting for it to be postponed for a week, considering all the events related to the Supreme Court.
But let's see, I'm constantly on track to have the last information in the press."
Some journalists did not agree with this: Sanders did not have a BRIPS briefing at the White House on September 10.
Leader Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders replied, "I can't deny that they're playing in public."
Then she agreed that Trump himself would communicate with the press more.
"The president answers the question more frequently than any president to him," she said and added, not referring to the source: "Statistics speak for themselves."
Sanders said the briefings would be all the same, but "if there's a chance to ask the president of the United States, it's better than talking to me."
We're often trying to communicate with the press, which should be particularly noticeable over the last few weeks. The opportunity to talk to the president of the United States is not worse than the press conference."
The tram is regularly answered to questions during the entrances of the White House, open meetings or press conferences for the participation of senior guests.
Special press conferences are rarely held.
In New York this week, the president may have shown why this is so, in front of journalists, angry and sometimes surprised.
The State Secretary for Health Protection of Scotland turned to EU workers in relation to threats through Brexit
The State Secretary for Health Protection addressed to citizens of other EU countries working in the National Health Protection Service of Scotland in order to express appreciation for their work and ask them to continue after Brexit.
Jean Freeman, a member of the parliament of Scotland, sent a letter less than six months before the UK left the EU.
The Government of Scotland has already assumed its obligation to cover the value of an application for the status of a permanent residence for EU citizens working in autonomous government services.
In her letter, Mrs. Freeman said: "Over the course of the summer negotiations between Britain and the EU on the issue of exits have been held.
But the United Kingdom government strengthens the preparation for possible exits without agreement.
I know that this period can be very anxious for you.
That is why I would like to emphasize again how I value the contribution of every worker, regardless of nationality.
Fellows from all over the European Union and the countries within it share valuable experience and skills, strengthening and improving the work of health-care services for the benefit of the patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is your home, we really want you to stay."
Cristion Ebercromby passed a terminal operation after head injuries
Tennessy State Tigers Commander Christion Ebercrombie transferred a terminal operation after a head injury to Wanderbilt Komodores, which his team had lost with account 31:27.
The chief coach of Tennisi State Tigers told reporters that the player was injured shortly before the crash.
"He went up to the side line where he got hurt," said Reed.
On the side line, trainers and medical personnel gave Ebercrombie a oxygen before taking it on their legs to carry further care.
The official representative of the Tennissi State Tigers team told Chris Harris from the WSMV (Nashville, Tennessee) that Ebercrombie was operating at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center.
Harris added that "as long as there's no evidence of type and severity of trauma," the Tennese State Tigers command is trying to find out when the player got the trauma.
Ebercrombie, a friend of mine, spent his first season at Tennesse State Tigers after the Ilinos command.
He did five games a week before he got out of the game.
Foreign buyers will pay more government bribes in the wake of the war in Britain
Foreign buyers will pay more rent in the event of the collapse in Britain. In accordance with the new Tori plans, additional costs will be spent on the homeless.
This background neutralizes all Corbin's attempts to connect young voters
More government fraud will rise from those who do not pay taxes in Britain
In the Ministry of Finance, additional 120 million pounds per year are expected to be spent on homeless people
As Teresa May announced today, foreigners who buy in Britain will pay more rent, and additional costs will be spent on homeless people.
This step can be assessed as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbin’s efforts to convince young voters to make promises to make more available to high - paying workers.
The rise of fraud will apply to natural and legal persons who do not pay taxes in Britain.
An additional myth, leading to the rise of the double age to the second life and immortality of the order, may be three percent.
In the Ministry of Finance, additional 120 million pounds of styrling per year are expected to be spent.
According to experts, 13% of the new unemployment in London is found in the property of foreign citizens, and this leads to a higher price and a better job for those who only dream of their own lives.
Many eligible areas of the country, especially in the capital, are deserting, since the vast number of foreign buyers spend most of their time living within the borders of the country.
The new plan of action appeared only a few weeks after Boris Johnson called down a government myth to make life more accessible for young people.
He accused large construction companies of maintaining high prices of non-smokers by the way the land was bought without further use of it. He called on Teresa Me to refuse the quota for available non-smokers to correct the "failure situation on the market of living" in Britain.
Mr. Corbin announced a low number of important reforms in the area of non-responsibility, including the control of cash flow and the inability to move without valid reasons.
He also proposes to extend local councils in the area of the construction of a new home.
Teresa May said, "Tork, I promised that I would dedicate my leadership to the restoration of the British dream – for every new generation of life should be better.
This requires a change in our imperfect life market.
Britain will always remain open to those who desire to live, work, and build their future here.
However, it cannot be said that individuals who do not live in Britain, as well as foreign companies, buy living under the same conditions as British citizens.
For too many people, dreams of their own lives have become inadequate, and the problem of living under the open heavens remains very painful."
Jack Ross: "I'm still going to want to be the chief trainer of the congregation in Scotland."
The main FC's "Sanderland" coach Jack Ross claims that "more than anything" will ever gather in Scotland.
The 42-year-old Scottish took over the club from the north-east of the country, who now owns a third place in the First Football League, on three o'clocks from the leader.
Ross moved to the Stadium of Late this summer, returning to the former St. Mary's FC season in the Premier League of Scotland.
"I wanted to represent my country as a player.
I got to the second congregation in Scotland, but it all ended," Ross said during the Sports Sound program in the BBC Scotland radio station.
"When I was a child, my father and I often watched the game of a congregation in Scotland at the Hampden Park Stadium." It always impressed me.
The only hope for me is to be successful in the position of the head coach of the club."
The Russian presidents at the Sanderland F.C., in particular, were Dick Advocat, David Moyes, Sam Ellandides, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keen, Gustavo Poet and Paolo Di Canio.
The former head coach of the FC, Alloa Atletik, claims that he did not feel any pressure from the transition to the major follow-up club on such authoritative names, prior to dismissing the proposals from the FC "Barnsley" and "Ipswich Town".
"At the present stage, I'll think it's been a success if the club comes back to the Premier League.
As a result of its structure and the material-technical provision of this club, there is no doubt the level of Premier Law," he noted.
"It's going to be a difficult task, but another result I'll either think I'm successful for myself."
Ross's only three-year-old trainer, and he worked with another trainer at the Damparton F.C., and he spent 15 months at the F.C. Garts train station.
Then he helped Alloa to complain after the FK hit the third division, and in the next season from St. Mary's, he walked from the flight stage to get the title of the winner of the first division.
According to Rossa, he now feels more comfortable than ever during his game career at the FC "Clide", "Gartpol", "Folkerk", "St. Maryren" and "Hamilton Academy".
"I'm on my way," he says, talking about going to the Allo's FC.
"I sincerely believed that training was more appropriate to me than a game.
This sounds amazing, since I was successful, despite my achievements and the achievement of certain heights.
But playing is very easy.
There are many challenges that each week will have to overcome.
I am still with them, coping with stress and stress, but as a primary instructor, I feel at home.
I've always been interested in training, and I've never felt so comfortable about my entire adult life as when I chose this profession."
You'll be able to listen to the full interview during the Sports Sound transfer on Sunday, September 30, on the radio station Radio Scotland from 12:00 to 13:00 at the British summer time.
Research: 17:30 a.m. - ideal time for beer
The summer rains helped to increase the production of British bread, which survives not the best time, but sent pressure on the restaurant’s network.
According to the sales calculations in beans and bars in July, 2.7% increased, while the income of restaurants decreased by 4.8%.
The author of Peter Martin's calculations from the CGA, which is being consulted on business development issues, noted: "Since the sun is much longer and longer than expected, England's participation in the Championship world has gone through the same scheme as in the previous month when the pope's release grew by 2.8%, and it's still worse in the restaurants.
Red drop by 1.8% in July.
Babies and bars, based on drinking, while having the best shows, increase their income is equivalent to the loss of restaurants.
Pabes, in which food is served, also suffered from spores, but not as strong as restaurants.
It seems that visitors are just interested in drinking.
In subspecies and barges, the monthly consumption increased by 6.6%, and food was reduced by 3%".
Paul Newman, an analysis of the division of voluntary and hotel business in RSM, said, "We've been watching similar trends since the end of April.
Time and mass social or sports events remain the main factors that affect sales on the internal market.
Not surprisingly, the groups of restaurants continue to lose income. Annual sales drop by 4.8% raises special concerns about the need to cut costs.
The long summer of summer was not the best time for food supplies, and let's see if we can measure the temperature we've observed in August to give them the necessary rest."
The overall increase in sales in beans and restaurants, including new stocks, was 2.7% in July, reflecting the release of new brands.
The Galluse indicator of the Coffer Peach Tracker sales in the papacy, bar and restaurants of Great Britain is a picture of the combined and analysed production of 47 working groups, a total of over nine billion pounds of steriling.
Every five children have their parents' accounts on the social network.
According to the results of the survey, every five children, sometimes not 11 years of age, have been covered by parents and teachers on social networks.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed an increase in the number of active pages in Instagram
This news caused concern about the possible location of sexual content
20% of the students reported that they have a "main account record" showing parents.
Every five children, sometimes under the age of 11, create an account on social networks that covers adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed an increase in the number of active pages in Instagram — a social network for the exchange of photos.
This news caused concern about the possible location of the content of sexual activity.
20% of the students reported that they have a clear "primary" account that shows parents as well as one or more private ones.
The mother, who accidentally found her 13-year-old daughter's secret page, saw the call, "Take me out."
A study conducted by digital Awareness UK and Headmasters' and Headmasters' Conference (HMC) in private schools showed that 40% of children between the ages of 11 and 18 have two social networks. Half of these children admitted that an additional account is confidential.
The head of HMC Mike Bukenen's Association noted: "We are very concerned that many teenagers feel a desire to create an online space where parents and teachers can't find them."
Eilede Doyle will be "a representative of the interests of the athletes" on the Scottish Athletics radio
Eilede Doyle is elected in the Scottish Athletics Council as an independent director during the annual general elections of government members.
Doyle is the most popular Scottish easy-to-reader. The head of Yen Beatty has called this step a great opportunity for those who drive a sport, to use it with a wide experience gained at the international level over the last decade.
"Eilida is used with great respect among the Scottish, British and World athletes. We are convinced that, by joining her to the radio, the athletic sport in Scotland will be of great benefit," said Beatty.
Doyle said, "I am inspired by the role of an athlete's representative, and I hope that I can really benefit and contribute to the development of sport in Scotland."
An American, a four - story Olympic champion, who won 200 and 400 yards [200 and 400 m] in the 1996 Games in Atlanta, and now a BBC sports viewer, lost the ability to walk through a transhisit attack.
He wrote in Twitter: "That's why I became an insult.
I couldn't go.
The doctors said that only time would show me how much I could recover.
I have learned to walk, and today I have learned to do dynamic exercises!
Thank you for the words of support!"
Women’s milk products were compared to cows – Internet users ’ thoughts were divided
The dairy producer was confronted with an unusual reaction of Internet users to advertising, where young mothers are compared to active dogs.
In recognition of the release of a product called "the world's first silent milk producer", Elvie, a technology company producing consumer goods, released the advertising in the form of a humoristic music video to demonstrate the freedom that provides the mother of a new decomposer.
The four real mothers dance in a full-time symphony with the song that contains the words, "Yes, I do, but I don't have the balls" and, "How you see me, it's not my nose, but my breasts."
And then he sings: "Smooth out, relax to make the children feel better, relax to keep the baby from dying."
However, the advertising role published on the company’s Facebook page led to a disturbing discussion on the Internet.
The video received 77,000 views and hundreds of comments. However, the reaction of the Internet users has been remarkable. Many have noted that in advertising, the production of milk in the industry is undeterred.
"It's not very wise to use cows for advertising this product.
Like us, they need to be worried and born to give milk, but their children are buried under their feet for a few days after birth," wrote one of the users.
Elvie’s molecular coder can easily be hidden in the touchbox (Elvie/Mother)
Here's another comment: "It's clear that it's traumatic for both mother and child.
But why don't you arrest them for a milk-smoker for women who need to feed their babies?"
And someone added, "It's very far from reality."
Other users spoke for the advertising role. One of the women appeared to be very happy.
"I think it's a great idea.
It would be extraordinary if she were still pregnant.
When I was milking, I really felt like a cow.
The announcement was something crazy, but I wasn't looking for a hidden content.
It's a great product," someone wrote.
Here's another comment: "A single advertisement, directed to mothers who are breastfeeding (often in the workplace or in the toilet) and feel proud of themselves.
This announcement is not directed at the disclosure of the advantages and disadvantages of milk industry."
At the end of the video, women show milk - based babies hidden in their buttocks.
The concept of a advertising company is based on information that many women who use the same products feel inferior.
However, Elvie's decomposer works absolutely quiet, without a stick or a rope, and is easily kept in a boxer for play, which allows women to move freely, keep the children and even go out the street.
Anna Balarin, a partner and executive director of the advertising agency Mother, commented on the situation: "Elvie's triggerer is such a revolutionary product that he called for a clear and provocative presentation.
When we had a parallel between women who love milk and genuine cows, we wanted to pay attention to the particulars of breast - feeding, in a fascinating and interesting way by demonstrating the incredible sense of freedom that the new nurse will bring.
Elvie is not the first to get into the headlines.
Within the second fashion in London, the mother of two children appeared on the occasion of this product while displaying a dress from the model of Martha Jacobs.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly moved to their native city on the Tehao border
The number of detained migrant children has increased dramatically, although the number of monthly crossings in the province remained relatively unchanged, often because the harsh rhetoric and policies of the administration of the Trappa have complicated the process of placing children in the carers.
Traditionally, in most cases, refugees themselves were excluded from the documents. Now they are afraid to risk their own ability to remain in the country, offering to take responsibility for the child.
The risk increased in June when the federal authorities announced that potential caregivers and other adult members of their households would be obliged to provide fingerprints and that these data would be transmitted to immigration services.
Last week, Matthew Albens, a senior representative of the Bureau on immigration and forced control, testified before the Congress that the Bureau’s staff arrested ten people who had applied for care of minors without a follow-up.
The Bureau later confirmed that 70 percent of the detainees had no criminal record.
"About 80% of the people who are caregivers or members of their home countries are living in an illegal country. Many of them are foreigners who have committed crimes.
So we continue to persecute these people," said Mr. Albens.
According to the appellants, in order to speed up the children's affairs, the officials introduced new rules that would require some of the children to appear in court within a month of detention, not after 60 days, as previously.
Many of them can use videoconferencing instead of going to court personally to bring their legal status to immigration courts.
Those who do not have the right to access the app before the court decision will be deported quickly.
According to the plugin staff and official data from the responsible staff in the last months, as long as children remain under the charge, they may be more likely to experience anxiety or depression.
Lawyers claim that these problems are increasing in stocks such as Tornillo, where it is more difficult to monitor children’s psychological status.
They added that by moving children to a designated city and not spending enough time preparing them emotionally or spending time with friends, we are at risk of living up to the trauma that many of them have already experienced.
Syria ordered the US, France and Turkey to immediately release the army
In addition, when speaking to the United Nations General Assembly, Mr. Valid al-Mulam called on Syrian refugees to return home, although the war lasted for eight years in the country.
Muala, who also works as Prime Minister's deputy minister, said that the foreign forces were living on the Syrian territory illegally under the influence of the fight against terrorism, so "their attitude would be appropriate."
"They should go immediately and not put conditions," he said to the assembly.
Mualem insisted that "war against terrorism was actually over" in Syria, where in 2011, more than 360 000 men were killed, and millions of people left their homes.
He said that Damascus would continue "this sacred battle until we clear all Syrian territory" from terrorist groups and "any illegal foreign presence."
The United States had approximately 2000 military officers in Syria, mainly teaching and consulting Kurdish and Syrian Arab forces against President Basar al-Assad.
In a failed war country, France sent more than 1,000 soldiers.
As for the refugees, Mualem assured that the country was created with the right conditions for their return, and he also accused "some Western countries" because they "are spreading unfounded fears", because refugees do not want to return.
"We have called on international cooperation and humanitarian organizations to help people come back," he said.
"We're looking at an effort to solve a very humanitarian problem."
The United States and the European Union have warned that Syria will not be able to provide assistance in rehabilitate countries until a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to the end of the war is established.
The UN diplomats report that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the establishment of buffer zones around Idlib, the last great wave of rebels, created an opportunity for political negotiations to continue.
The Russian-Turkey agreement has helped to prevent the large rise of Syrian forces supported by Russia in a province where three million people live.
However, Mualem stressed that the agreement has "silent terms", and expressed the hope that military action would be directed against the dissidents, including the soldiers associated with Al-Qaida Front of the Nurser, who will be "to be destroyed".
UN Secretary Stefan de Mister is expected to attend the first meeting of the new committee, which will be held by government and opposition representatives to develop a post-constitution constitution for Syria and create conditions for elections.
Mualem removed the conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the committee, stating that his work should be limited to "a review of the articles of the actual constitution", and warned against interference.
Why the Trampa will be re-examined
This logo might be revised in 2020 if, as many liberal viewers are expected, it does not form the completion immediately after the scandal and the pressure.
This would certainly be the most dramatic end of the presidency all the time!
At present, viewers do not give a sign of loneliness.
Since 2014, the number of viewers in prime time more than doubled (up to 1.05 million) to CNN channels and actually dropped (up to 1.6 million) to MSNBC channels.
According to Nelson, Fox News, the average 2.4 million viewers in prime time, compared to 1.7 million four years ago, and The Rachel Maddow Show on the cable channel was based on a rating of 3.5 million viewers in the evening when the main news was discussed.
"It's a fire that attracts people because it's beyond our understanding," said Nil Ber, performing the drama "Last candidate" on the ABC channel on the state secretary who becomes president after a devastating attack on the capital.
Nell Scowell, an experienced humorist writer and author of the book "Spiritary moments: and a few serious facts about the discovery of Hollywood men's clubs," suggests another theory.
She recalled a trip to Boston before the 2016 elections.
The water told her to vote for Trampa.
"Why?" she asked.
'Cause he's making me laugh,' he said, 'and that's what Mrs. Scowell told me.
Haos is enjoying it.
Of course, unlike any other content on the TV, history from Washington is able to determine the future of Roy against Wayda, the possibility of bringing immigrant families together and the state of the world economy.
By contrast, it is a delight that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet you can't say that you're just trying to stay informed by the citizens when you've been watching for six hours as a group of experts discuss the use of Bob Woodward by the "well-known" source for his book "Strates", a piece of Paul Manafort's stickers for $15,000 -- so it was written in The Washington Post, and the results of the amazing anatomical descriptions of Mr. Trampa, published by Daniels.
For me, for example, Super Mario will never be an ex-boyfriend.
"The sense of reality is partly related to the fact that you're getting something new every night," said Brent Montgomery, the chief executive director of the Wheelhouse Entertainment company and the author of the Lombar Star TV program, about rotation in the actor's warehouse and the daily accompanying traffic in the "Trap" show (the conflict with the NFL, support by Kim Chen Ina).
If you allow yourself to miss out on a single episode, you can leave without hope.
This week I was able to meet Mr. Fleiss at his house on the northern coast of the island of Kauai, and there was a warm sundial (27 degrees below Celsius), but he sat at home looking at MSNBC and writing CNN.
He could not get away from the television — not when Brett Kavano was presenting the Legal Committee to the Senate, and the future Supreme Court came to a hearing.
"I remember how we created all those crazy shows in our time, and people said it was the beginning of Western civilization," said Mr. Fleis.
"I accepted it as a joke, but it seems they were right."

External effects of costs in the worst inter-stellar elections in Congress
It is no wonder that in the 17th district of Pennsylvania, additional financial impact has been directed, as two actual conventions are being held at a single stage through the review of the electoral districts.
In the struggle for this urban area of Pittsburgh, which had recently been changed, is a democracy, a member of the House of Representatives of the Conor Lemb, who won the victory in another round on the additional elections of the past century.
Lemb is against another real congressman, the Republic of Kit Rotfs, who is now represented by the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, which has a significant impact on the new 17th.
The Charter was revised after the decision of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania in January was made that the old borders of the regions were focused on the benefit of the Republicans of the Constitution.
In the new 17th round, the pre-emptive forces called for a strong opposition between the financial disciplines of the main parties, the United States Democratic Party Committee on Elections at the Congress (DCCC) and the National Committee of the Republican Party (NCRC).
In addition, Lemba became well-known in Pennsylvania after winning the minimum prize in the 18th round during the additional elections in the Congress in March, which were widely used by the public.
This place belonged to the Republicans for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the victory in this area with a 20-pound victory.
Political experts have given little priority to democracy.
In the United States, El Salvador was considered to be a support to China, but it was thought
The diplomats recalled the weak opposition from Washington to the actions of the Dominican Republic and Panama, who had previously supported Beijing’s position.
In June 2017, Trump held a warm meeting with the President of Panama Juan Carlos Varela. Before long, Trump also had a hotel in Panama, until partners had produced staff from the Trump Organization.
The State Department officials decided to reject the leaders of the United States diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama through "a recent decision on Taiwan's ignorance", said press secretary of the Department of Justice Geser Noyert at the beginning of this month.
But the sanctions were considered only against El Salvador, which received approximately 140 million dollars of US assistance in 2017, particularly in the area of drug control, as well as in support of social and economic development.
The proposed fines, which were intended to reduce financial aid and target tax restrictions, would be painful for the country of Central America with its high level of unemployment and murder.
As a result of the internal challenges of the North and Central American countries, the conference was held at a high level, dedicated to security and economic prosperity.
But by mid-September, the senior representatives of the administration had come to understand what they wanted the conference to take place. In fact, the issue of sanctions against El Salvador had ceased.
According to diplomats, Vice President Mike Pines is now planning to attend a conference scheduled for mid-October, in a sign that the administration considers this West to be very important.
At that, three American envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic, as there were no new news or complaints from Washington.
The representative of Mr. Bolton, in the White House, refused to comment on the details of the internal discussions reported by three American officials, two of whom were diplomats, under anonymity.
The information provided was confirmed by a side analysis, closely related to the administration, which also referred to the conditions of anonymity.
Learn History
The following concern may be the report by Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller on possible violations of justice by the Trap, which is why it can be found in the public information available now.
It's reported that in the context of his investigation, Mueller is checking the possible link between the tramp campaign and the attack on our voting system from Russia.
If the effect of the convention is to be seen in other parts of the world, it is necessary to report to the conventioners, as well as to the electoral and, finally, to the parties.
That's a lot of "like" in this case, and I don't mean that the fall of Trump is going on, like his fellow in Europe.
All of us on both sides of the Atlantic must make a choice that determines the duration of the war.
In 1938 the German officials were ready to adjust the coup against Hitler if only the West began to oppose him and supported the Czech Republic in Munich.
We have experienced failures and have lost the ability to avoid bloodguilt.
History’s heat is defined by such extreme moments, and the inexhaustible movement of democracy is speeding up or slowing down.
The Americans are waiting for a couple of such extremes.
What will we do if the Trump release the deputy of General Prosecutor Roda Rosenstein, a man from whom Mr. Mueller's share depends?
Rosenstein was still in the lobby, as this newspaper reported on the fact that he proposed a secret record of talks with the president and shared his concerns about the invalidity of Trip's position.
Rosenstein called the information in The Times wrong.
"How do we react if the investigation against Brett Kavano, who recently started the FBI, appears to be not sound enough or honest, or if the Kawanan candidate in office in the Supreme Court is confirmed, despite convincing charges in sexual harassment and the commission of false witnesses?
And, first of all, will we in the medium term vote for those members of the Congress who will be able to draw up the responsibilities of the Trap?
If we pass these tests, there will be bad times for democracy.
But I believe we will not be led by the lesson I've learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czech Jew who was deported to the Osvent by the same Nazi regime that had once occupied my missionary home.
She survived, immigrated to America, and 60 years later, she sent me to burn Sunday candles on the table with a swastika.
Having such a legacy, can I not see with optimism in the future?"

The game Dorrans with the Rangers with optimism is waiting to meet with the giant Rapids.
The Redgers FK will receive the "Rapid" in the fourth. After an impressive game in Spain with the "Vilerreal" at the beginning of this month of victory, the Scottish club will provide a good chance to get out of the G League of Europe.
Because of the trauma of the semiconductor Graham Dorrans, he was able to play for the first time in the season only in terms of "Vierreal", which ended with account 2:2. However, he believes that the FC "renders" can use this result as a tramplin to achieve more.
"It was a good result for us, because "Vierreal" is a strong command," said a 31-year-old player.
"We went out to the game with the hope of getting the ball something and got one eye.
Perhaps at the end of the conversation, we could go ahead, but at the end of the conversation, nothing is likely to be viewed as a fair outcome.
At first, the opponent was better, but after the break we corrected the situation for our benefit.
The fourth will be another major opposition in Lisie Europe.
I hope we can get three shots, but it's not easy, and our future opponents have shown good results in our last game, but we can count on the support of patients, and I'm sure we can win the battle and get the positive results.
The last year, of course, was very difficult, starting with my injuries and ending in the same club, but now the situation was normal.
We have a great team, and all the boys are satisfied.
I hope we can move on, leave behind the last season and succeed."
Women lose their dream of retirement after retirement
Despite the fact that the investigators had a clear understanding of how they would want to organize care for themselves, few spoke of it with members of their family.
Nearly half of the people who participated in the study of the Nationwide company said that they were talking to their husband or wife about the value of long - term care.
Only 10% of the students talked about it with the kids.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they don't rush to talk about it," said Holly Snaider, vice president of the Nationalside firm for life insurance.
That's what we need to start.
Talk to your husband or wife and children: Your family will not be able to provide you with the care you need if you do not tell your parents your wishes away.
Consult your consultant and your family to determine where and how to take care of it, since this choice can be an important factor when determining the value.
Contact a financial adviser: He can advise you how to cover your expenses.
The long-term supervision sources include traditional insurance policies, hybrid life insurance policies, or self-sustainment (under the condition that you have money).
Prepare legally valid documents carefully: this will allow you to avoid legal tension far away.
Prepare your representative’s confidence, which will control your health and keep you from doing your will if you are unable to do so personally.
In addition, we are happy to build trust in the budget.

Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died as a result of a powerful earthquake and tsunami in the Indonesian city of Paul on Friday, reports government officials, but the number of victims may increase.
Because of the lack of access to the services of officials involved in humanitarian aid, no information can be obtained from the Donghal Regent, a region north of Paul, located close to the planetary epicenter of 7.5 bacon.
After Paul’s disaster, 16,000 people were evacuated.
Consider a few basic facts about the location of the island of Solavesi, the city of Paul and the Regent of Donegal.
Paula is the capital of the province of Central Sulavesi, located at the end of a narrow river on the western coast of the island of Solavesi, with an average population of 379,800, according to the 2017 census.
When the earthquake struck, the city celebrated its 40th year.
Dongala is a regent that extends more than 300 miles [300 km] (180 km) along the coastal line on the north coast of the island of Solavesi.
According to the 2017 census, about 299,200 people live in the Administrative Region, located in the lower part of the province.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main gaps in the economy of the Province of Central Solaves, especially in the coastal region of Donghal.
The production of nickel also plays an important role in the province, but mainly focused in Morovaly, on the opposite coast of Sulvaes.
According to the Indonesian agency's data on the effects of natural disasters in the last 100 years, Paul and Donghal suffered from tsunamis several times.
In 1938, the tsunami in Donghal killed more than 200 men and destroyed hundreds of homes.
In 1996, the tsunami also struck the western part of Dongal, and nine men were killed.
Indonesia is located in a seismic Pacific fireplace and suffers from earthquakes regularly.
Below are some of the largest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years.
2004: On December 26, a strong earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Sumari, north of Sumatra, struck 14 countries, resulting in the death of 226,000 men, more than half of whom were in the province of Acheg.
At the end of March, at the beginning of the April harvest, a series of powerful earthquakes broke out in the western coast of Sumatra.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Neas near the coast of Sumatra.
2006: The earthquake struck southern Java, the most fertile island of Indonesia, and caused tsunamis on the southern coast, resulting in the death of about 700 people.

Over 1,100 men were killed.
2010: The earthquake struck 7.5 baobabs on one of the islands of Manitoba, located near Sumatra, and caused tsunamis up to 10 feet [10 m] high, resulting in the destruction of ten villages and the death toll of about 300 men.
2016: A weak earthquake broke into the Paigeha Regent in the province of Ache, calling for destruction and panic related to the fact that people have not yet managed to forget the devastating earthquake and tsunamis in 2004.
This time, there were no tsunamis, but over 100 people died under the walls of the building.
2018: strong earthquakes hit the tourist island of Lombok in Indonesia, resulting in the death of more than 500 people, mainly in the northern part of the island.

The oldest son of Sari Peelin was arrested on charges of domestic violence
The flight of Peelin, the oldest son of former Governor Alaski and the candidate in the position of Vice President Sari Peylin, was arrested for being accused of assault.
According to a report published on Saturday by the state police in Alaska of the 29-year-old Paelin of Vasili, Alaska, they were arrested for suspected domestic violence and accused of violating the report on violence and protesting during the arrest.
According to a police report, when a woman was trying to contact the police to report a possible crime, she picked up her phone.
According to KTUU, Peelin lives under a currency in the next Isle of Matanuska-Susitna with the right of deposit in the amount of 500 dollars.
He stood before the court on Saturday, where he declared himself innocent, when he was asked if he confessed his guilt, they reported it online.
Peelin is accused of three Class A crimes, which presupposes an arrest for one year and a fine of $250,000.
He's also accused of class B crimes, and that's due to the day of imprisonment and the fine of $2,000.
Not for the first time have they been charged with criminal charges.
In December 2017 he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Pellin.
His mother, Sarah Pailin, called the police and reported on a possible attack.
The case is now under the view of the Alaski Veterans Court.
In January 2016 he was accused of domestic violence, as well as of the fact that he had banned a report on domestic violence and had a weapon in the state of alcohol abuse when this incident occurred.
His girlfriend said he hit her face.
In 2016, Saru Peelin was criticized by a group of veterans for justifying her son’s violent behavior as a post - traumatic stress disorder after serving in Iraq.
In Indonesia, earthquakes caused tsunamis: hundreds of people died
At least 384 people died after the earthquake on the Indonesian island of Solavesi on Friday.
The earth’s magnetic field of 7.5 ballast called for tsunamis and destroyed hundreds of homes.
The network of connections and power supply has gone out of control, and the number of victims can grow in the next few days.
The earthquake took place near the center of the island of Sulaves, located in the northeastern part of the capital of the Indonesian city of Jakarta.
The video that expands in social networks shows the moment when the sentence has been hit.
Hundreds of people gathered at the festival on Paul’s beach when the tsunami broke out in the mountains.
Federal prosecutors demand a rare death penalty for suspects in New York City
In New York, federal prosecutors demand the death penalty of Saifulo Sayipov, suspected of being a terrorist in New York City, resulting in the death of eight people, a rare punishment that has not been applied in the state for federal crimes since 1953.
According to them, in October 30-year-old Saipov, behind the wheel held at Home Depot, the pickup went on a bicycle trip along the six-way in West Side, Lower Mangetten, and started killing the passengers and passengers who were on his way.
According to the report on the plan to help the victims in the South of New York State to justify the death penalty, the accused must bear in mind that Saipov killed eight persons "indiscriminately" and committed serious physical injuries.
According to judicial material, each of these charges presupposes the possibility of a death penalty.
A few weeks after the attack, the Federal Court of Prisons dismissed Saipou's conviction by 22 points, in particular eight charges of murder with the aim of ordering that federal prosecutors usually refer to cases of organized crime, as well as charges of violence and car destruction.
According to the prosecutors who described the so-called Saipan crimes as "a cruel, cruel and vicious attack", this attack is the result of "a real planning and a far-reaching thought".
Victims who were injured, injured or killed by Saifula Habibullaević Saipov became Diego Enrique Andgelini, Nicolas Cleves, Ann-Lor Dekadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlich, Ernan Ferruči, Ernan Diego Mendos and Alejandro Damian Pagnukko, as described in the report on the purpose.
Five lost were tourists from Argentina.
It's been ten years since the last time in the South of New York, a crime was committed by a death penalty.
The judge, Halida Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug suppliers, and eventually sentenced to eternal imprisonment in September 2009.
Last time the federal death penalty was brought to effect in New York in 1953, a couple of Julius and Ethel Rosenbergs were executed after they had been sentenced to a trial for the benefit of the Soviet Union during the cold war two years before.
Both Rosenbergs were shot at the electric table on June 19, 1953.
According to the case - law case, the son of Uzbekistan’s cousin Saipov did not demonstrate his conscience during the next few days and months after the attack.
According to the police, he told his followers that he was not harmful about snow.
According to the prosecutor’s act, the authorities told him that he was excited about the attack on the IDUL video he was watching on his phone.
The police report that he also requested an IDUD proposal in his hospital room.
He did not confess himself to the charge of 22 points.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Cyprus, said that they were "very disappointed" by the decision of the prosecutor.
"We think that the decision to get a death sentence instead of accepting the confession of guilt and to be sentenced to eternal imprisonment without the possibility of release will only send the psychological trauma of all the victims," said Patton.
The Saipan Security Department also asked the prosecutors not to seek a death sentence.
Parliamentarian of the Conservative Party believes that the NIGHT FARAGE should be appointed responsible for the Brexit negotiations
Today, during the protest on the Conservative Party's march, Nigel Farage promised to "mobilize the people's army".
The former Head of the United Kingdom's Independence Party stated that politicians should "feel pressure" on the Eurosceptics, because one of the Members of Parliament, Teresa May, proposed their candidate for negotiations with the EU.
A member of the Conservative Party, Peter Bowen, announced on March in Birmingham that the United Kingdom would "have already gone", if Mr. Faraj was Secretary Brexit.
In view of the problems May faced, trying to calm his deep - rooted lines, it became even more evident that the Conservative Party's delegates were joining a special protest campaign in the city against Brexit.
The Premier is trying to get rid of the compromise plan of Chequers, despite attacks by Brexit's supporters, those who oppose the exit, and the EU.
The allies insist that she doesn't try to talk to Brussels, despite the negative reaction, and let the Europeans and the lobbyists choose between what she offers and the chaos.
In the middle of Leave Means Leave in Solikhali, Mr. Bowen said he wanted to "speak from Chequers".
He invited Mr. Faraj to leave the dark and take responsibility for his negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had answered for it, we would've already gone," he said.
Parliamentarian Vellingbo added, "I will support Brexit, but we must refuse Chequers."
Speaking against the EU, he said: "We fought in the world wars not to be ordered.
We want our own laws in our own country."
Mr. Bowen rejected the assumption that after the 2016 vote, the public opinion changed: "The idea that the British have changed their mind and they don't want to go is absolutely not true."
A member of the Conservative Party and Brexit Andrea Jenkins, who was also on March, told reporters, "I'm just saying, "Minister Prime Minister, listen to people.
The Chequers plan is not popular among the general population, the opposition is not going to vote for it, it does not support our party and our activities, which actually go along the streets and fight for the vote of the voters.
Please reject the Chequers and begin to listen to them."
In her address to Teresa May, she added, "Ministers are keeping their jobs when they make promises."
Mr. Faraj said that politicians should "feel pressure" if they are going to refuse a decision adopted at the 2016 referendum.
"Now this is a question of trust between us, people and our political elite," he said.
"They're trying to hurt Brexit, and we're here today to tell them it won't come out of their hands."
In a message to the complete enthusiasm of the group, he added, "I want our political elite, who plans to harm Brexit's idea, felt pressure on himself.
We mobilize the national army of this country, which will lead us to victory in Brexit and will never rest until we become independent, independent, proud, proud United Kingdom."
At that time, opposition to the work took place in Birmingham, a two - year - old meeting in the city center.
A number of activists were shocked by the banners "Conservatives against Brexit" after the group started with these exits.
Leborist Lord Adonis laughed at the conservators because after the conference was opened through their party program, security problems arose.
"These people who tell us that they can use IT systems and technologies that are necessary for Canada-plus, well organized, free trade with Ireland," he said.
"It's a complete fascist.
There's nothing good in Brexit," he added.
Vorren plans to "think seriously" about the president's vote
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren stated that after the elections in November, she "thinks seriously about the president's vote".
The Boston Globe reports that on Saturday, during the general meetings of the Western Massachusetts Democratic Party, the representative of Massachusetts spoke about his future.
Vorren, who is often criticised by President Donald Trampa, is fighting in November in a second term against a member of the Republican Party, Jeff Dela, who was a co-founder of the Trampa Company in Massachusetts in 2016.
They consider it to be a major candidate, which can be fought with Trump in 2020.
On Saturday, her 36th meeting with the voters in the form of the general congregations since the start of Trump's stay.
The participant asked her if she was planning to participate in the presidential election.
Vorren replied that "the time for women to go to Washington and arrange for government work, and that's why she's supposed to be a woman."
They arrested a suspect in the murder of a fire gun bomber called the LSY Tigers.
The Baton Rouge police, Louisiana state, reported on Saturday that the suspect was arrested on Friday by a fire-fighting basketball player "LSU Tigers" Weed Sims.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Diton Simpson at a press conference in 11 o'clock in the morning.
On Friday, they published a video of the shooting with a request to help you identify the man on it.
The 20-year-old Sims was shot at the University of Southern on Friday morning.
"Wide Sims got a fire wound in his head and died," said 247sports police chief Murphy J. Paul on Saturday.
Weide got in for his friend, and Simpson shot him.
As a result, they found that Simpson was in a crime scene, had a gun, and was shot at Wayda Sims.
Simpson was arrested without an incident and taken to the police station in East Baton.
Simms, who grew up in six feet and six inches and who grew up in the youth bed, grew up in Baton-Rug. He played 32 games with 10 stars in the past season and played in the middle of the game on field 17.4 minutes, collected 5.6 eyes and 2.9 collections.
Granny in Russia: Luis Hemelton's short leave in the battle for the World Championship after the team decided to give him victory over Sebastian Fattel
Since Walter Botts left behind Louis Gemelton on Saturday, it has become clear that the Mersese command will play a significant role in the race.
Bottas had a bad start with a half-pound and almost got Gemelton, who tried to keep his position on the first two rounds and gave Fettel the chance to attack his partner on the team.
Fate was sent to the fifth floor first and left Gemelton on the track at the edge of the race, which had to be resolved.
The pilot of the Mercedes team walked out one more round and went behind the Fatetele, but Gemilton went to the leader after a certain manoeuvre to the wheel, resulting that Ferrari was reluctant to leave the inner space because of the risk that he would press it, after the double manoeuvre had been able to jump forward on the third turn.
On the 21st day of his birth, Max Frostapen started from the back of a series of networks and stayed in the seventh place until the end of the first circle.
After that, he led most of the race because he did not change the race so that he could quickly get to the finish line and get Kim Raccoon out of fourth place.
In sum, he stopped at the foot of the 44th wheel, but he couldn't raise the pace to the last eight, so the Ryekkonen took the fourth place.
"It's a hard day, because Walter was fully exposed to all the exits and was very kind when he gave me the opportunity to walk.
The command was doing an extraordinary job to sit first and second," Gemelton said.
The Body’s Language Has Not Affected
On Wednesday, President Donald Tramp expressed his firm position by Senator Diane Feinstein that she did not announce the content of the list of Christine Blaise Ford, who accuses a candidate to the Supreme Court of Brett Kawano in sexual violence.
During a meeting in the West Virginia, the President did not direct his attention to the statement made by the Forum before the Legal Committee of the Senate, but instead expressed his opinion on the events in the Senate, which, he said, showed the human "divorce, ambiguity and falsehood."
"The only thing that could happen, and all the wonderful things that happen in the last few days in the Senate, are anger, you see the wicked people who show their humility, hypocrisy and lies," he said.
"You look at the published and published information, and then they say, "Oh, I didn't.
It's not me."
Do You Remember?
Diane Fynstein, did you publish information?
Remember her answer... did you publish the contents of the documents? – “Why?
Oh, no.
I did not make a statement."
Wait a minute.
No, we didn't." He added, copying the senator's behavior.
In July, Finstein received a letter with a report of the accused against Cavano, and his content was published in early September, but Finstein denied that the release of information had taken place in her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's accusation, I didn't publish the information received from her," said the Finnish Committee, reports The Hill.
"She asked me to keep it secret, and I didn't break my promises."
But her opposition seems to be not pleased with the president who commented during the weekend: "I'm telling you, her body's language has not been impressed at all.
Maybe she didn't do it, but I haven't seen anyone else get worse."
Continuing to defend the candidate to the Supreme Court, which three women were accused of sexual violence, the president admitted that the Democrats used the charges for their own purposes.
"They are determined to return power in any necessary way.
You see the subterraneanness, ambiguity, they all know who is to blame for the abuse of power and control," – Mediaite quotes the president.
Elite League: "Dandy Stars" - "Belfast Janets", 5:3
The player "Jiants" Patrick Duyer left two hats in the fight against "Dandy"
"Dandy Stars" was rebuffed for a five-week break in the summer bed by Belfast Janets, winning on Saturday the match-up to account 5:3.
"Jiants" got an early preference in two chesss thanks to the poets Patrick Duyer and Francis Bowley.
Mike Sallyvan and Jordan Kouny compared the account to the housemate, and then Duyer re-emerged the "Jiants" ahead.
The "Dandy" player of France Bush compared the account, and two of Lucas Lundwald Nilsen's balls provided their victory.
It's the third in the season of the annual legion of the command of Adam Kifa, who received a voluntary victory over Dandi with account 2:1 at Friday night in Belfast.
This is the fourth command in the session. The first three matches were won by the Jaiants.
The first was dueier left in the fourth minute (3:35) after Kendall McFollah was transferred, and after four minutes, Boulie, who received the check from David Reserford, doubled the account.
After the first period of forced labor in the fourteenth minute (13:10) Sallivan returned the owners of the field in the game, and at the sixteenth minute (15:16) Kouni, receiving a check from Matt Markward, compared the account.
The Duyer gave the Jaiants the advantage before the first break, leaving his second hat at the end of the first period.
The owners of the field were regrouped, and the Busher, at twenty-eight minutes (27:37), reassessed the account, shutting down the hat when his command was numerically over.
Thanks to the efforts of Connie and Charles Corcoran Nilsen at the end of the second period, he first released Danny and gave his team victory in the fifth half of the last period.
In the fifth command, "Jiants", which has already won four of the last five matches, is playing the lead match against "Millton-Kines."
Aeroplane killed hundreds of people on the plane to avoid earthquakes
An avidist in Indonesia announced to the hero after he saved his own life by flying with hundreds of people.
Over 800 people were killed and many lost after a powerful earthquake that caused tsunamis on the island of Solavesi on Friday.
Strong underground mails continue to strike this area, and many people are trapped in the ruins of Paul’s city.
However, unlike their colleagues who fled to save their lives, 21-year-old Antonius Gunavan Agung refused to leave his post in the dyspeptic district, which was strongly engaged at the airport of Mutirar SIS Al-Juffrey in Paul.
He stayed there to make sure that the 6321 Batik Air race, which at the time was on the air, was safe.
Then he broke out of the dyspeptic ward when he thought it was going to be destroyed.
Then he died in the hospital.
The representative of the Indonesian air navigation service provider Johannes Siritt stated that this decision could save hundreds of lives, reports the Australian agency ABC News.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan, where he had to be transferred to a more hospital in another town.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the vertigo reached Paul.
"We're very sorry to hear about this," he added.
At the time, the government is afraid that the number of victims could reach a thousand, because the agency has declared that access to the cities of Donegal, Sigi and Butong is limited.
"The number of victims can grow, as many bodies are still under attack, and many of them cannot be reached," said the representative of the Sutopo First Nugroho Agency.
The heights that reached six feet [6 m] were reduced to the city of Paul, where the mass burials would take place on Sunday.
Military and passenger planes provide help and food.
Russa Kusuma, 35-year-old mom, told Sky News: "Every minute of the quick help will bring the body.
Clean water is not enough.
Mini-markets are everywhere buried."
The head of the International Committee of the Red Cross in Indonesia, John Helfand told CNN: "The Red Cross of Indonesia is speeding up helping people who have experienced this tragedy, but we don't know they'll be there.
It's already a tragedy, but it can be much worse."
Indonesian President Joe Vidodo came to Paul on Sunday and said to the military officers of the country: "I ask you all to work yesterday and night to perform all the evacuation-related tasks.
You're ready?" says CNN.
Early this year Indonesia suffered earthquakes on the island of Lombok, resulting in over 550 deaths.
A plane crash in Micronesia: reported in Air Niugini, after a plane crash in a camp, one man lost his temper
The airline, who had taken a trip to the Pacific Coast of Micronesia, now reports that one person lost consciousness, although it was reported earlier that all 47 passengers and crew had successfully evacuated from the plane to the airport.
Air Niugini reported that on Saturday, one passenger could not be found.
The airline reports that her representatives are trying to find a man and cooperate with local authorities, doctors, and followers.
The airline did not respond immediately to a request for more information about passengers, such as their age and nationality.
The local ships helped save other passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water when it was attempting to land on the island of Chuuk.
On Friday, officials reported that seven men were brought to the hospital.
The airline reported that six passengers stayed in the hospital on Saturday, and they all stayed in a stable.
The cause of disasters and the exact sequence of events is unknown.
The U.S. airline and the U.S. U.S. reported that the plane landed in the cabin shortly after the crash.
Some witnesses believe that the plane flew into the airport.
U.S. passenger Bill Jones said that the plane was very low on the ground.
"That's very good," said Janes.
Jens explained that he and others had been able to get to the emergency exits on a thin plane by swimming in the water.
He told me that the Stoards were panicking and screaming, and that he had a slight headache.
In the United States, U.S.A. reported that seafarers who worked near the modernization of the story also assisted in rescue operations by delivering people to the shore by means of a steaming boat before the plane hit a 30 - foot [30 m] deep (100 ft) water.
According to the Aviation Safety Network data in the last two decades 111 people died in plane crashs associated with PNG-registered planes, but this list does not include Air Niugini.
Analytics restored the chronology of the night in which the woman was burned alive
On Saturday, the charges were filed against a man accused of burning a woman from Mississippi alive in 2014.
Analytic of the U.S. Ministry of Justice Paul Rowlett testified as an expert in the field of operational development for a few hours.
He told the jury how he used the phone records to play a 29-year-old accused Quinton Tellis and a 19-year-old victim of Jessica Chambers on the night of the murder.
Roulette, according to The Clarion Ledger, said that he had received information about the location from several mobile phones that showed that Tellis was from Chambers that night when she died, which was contrary to his previous claim.
When the data showed that his cell phone was in line with Chambers, although he said that he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to the last.
On Saturday, Sandford gave a witness and declared that he was not in the city that day.
When the prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth, when he said that night was in the Singapore pike, he said, "That's good because my pike was in Nesswell."
Another misunderstanding was that Tellis claimed that he knew Chambers about two weeks before her death.
The phone records indicated that they knew only one week.
Robert explained that some time after the death of Chambers Tellis, Chemberg had delivered a text message, calls, and contact information from his phone.
"He stared her from her life," said Gail.
The protection should set out its final arguments on Sunday.
The judge expects the trial to be handed over in court later that day.
The High Breed: What's a famous hip-hop?
Trio hip-hop-winners want to stop the challenge of a negative view of the genre by filling their music with constructive messages.
The High Breed Group from Bristol claims that hip-hop has changed its nature – leaving political ideas and fighting to solve social problems.
They want to go back to the exits and make a famous hip-hop popular again.
Artists such as The Refugees and Commons recently became witnesses of this direct birth in the United Kingdom through such groups as Akala and Lowkey.
Another darker?
In New York Sunday she called on a couple to release, receiving a "ristocrat" message.
In New York Sunday, she called on a couple for a divorce after receiving a misdirected message from a mother with a charge that she was "one more darker."
The couple deny that they're racist, comparing the call to "the challenge".
Linsi Plasco-Flaxman, mother of two children, expressed concern when she saw that the new Monday, Jigel Morris, who came to her first working day in 2016, was darker.
"No, another themewriter," wrote Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman to her husband in a report.
Instead of sending him to his husband, however, she twice sent his mission to Morris.
As New York Post reports, realizing his mistake, Mrs. Plaxon-Flaxman felt "unhandled" and released Mrs. Morris. She said that their previous nephew, who was an American, had done his job badly and that instead she was expecting her from the Philippines.
Miss Morris was paid one day for work and then sent home to Uber.
Now, Morris is in court, hoping to get compensation for her release in the amount of pay she would have received for six months working with her husband, who was first hired, even without a contract, to pay her $350 a day.
"I want to show them that they don't have to do that," she said Post on Friday and added, "I know it's discrimination."
In response to the accusation that they were racist, the couple said that the release of Morris was a wise decision, since they feared that they would not be able to trust her after they had seen it.
"My wife didn't mean what she sent her.
She's not racist.
We're not racist," said Post to her husband, Joel Plasco.
"But would you leave your children with the man with whom you were being rude, even if it wasn't reasonable?
Your baby?
NURSE."
Comparing the call to "victory", Plasco said that his wife had given birth to a child just two months ago and that "she didn't complain."
"Would you mind somebody after that?
It's a bad thing," added the investment banker.
While judicial review continues to take place, the court of public opinion quickly condemned this couple on social networks by criticising their conduct and logic.
As told in the new letter, Padington’s readers were afraid that readers would not understand the idea of a nurse who could speak.
The daughter of Bonda Karen Jankel, who was born almost immediately after the book was agreed to be printed, said about the letter: "Every time you put yourself in the place of someone who reads the book first before it was published.
Now that's funny, because we know about the great success that the story of Padington has achieved."
Speaking of her father, who was working for the BBC operator, before a little playmate urged him to write a child book, he became optimistic about what his work had been abandoned, and she shared how at the 60th anniversary of the book's release he felt at the same time "fare and sadness," because his father died a year ago.
So far Padington, whom she describes as "a very important member of our family," Karen added that her father was silent about the fact that the book became so popular.
"He was quite a humble man and he didn't like to hang," she said.
"But Padington was so real to him, not his own child! Because when the children reach something, we write to them, even though it's not theirs, not our victory.
I think he looked at Padington's success just like that.
Although Padington is the creation of his imagination, he has always recorded his success."
My daughter died, and I had to make a phone call
After her daughter was born, she was sent to a hospital named Louis Pastera in Nice, where doctors tried to save her life.
"When he called regularly, he said it was really bad that she shouldn't have done it," said Mrs. Ednan Laperus.
"And then Nad phoned me and said she'd die for the next two minutes and I'd have to talk to her.
And I did.
I said, "Dad, love, I love you very much.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you."
Doctors who gave her a heart attack gradually stopped acting and leaving her body.
She died for a while before everything was turned off.
I just had to sit and wait, knowing what was going on right now.
I couldn't complain, scream or cry because my family and people were watching me.
I should really have kept myself in my hands."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperus, who was angry at the loss of her daughter, was on the plane with other passengers, not paying attention to the severe trials she had to endure.
"No one knew," she said.
"I let down my head and couldn't hold my tongue.
It was hard to explain, but during the flight, I began to feel a deep sense of hope.
He needed my love and support.
I knew how much he loved her."
Two women who have suffered from a heart attack are left with leaves to avoid the loss of their lives on the bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones in death work hard not to give up on themselves.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Gamphris remain at the Wall Street Bridge with telephone numbers that people can access for support as well as the messages they would like to deliver.
The son of Miss Davis Tyler was 13, when he began to suffer from depression, and at the age of 18, he laid his hands on him.
"I don't want other parents to feel the same as I do every day," she said.
45-year-old Mrs. Davis, who lives in Ledny, said her son was a prospective chef with a lovely smile.
"Everyone knew him for a joke.
They always said that this smile made any room light."
But he quit his job before he died because he was "not in the dark."
In 2014, Brother Tyler, who was then 11, found his brother’s body after he laid his hands on him.
Miss Davis says, "I'm always afraid it'll have consequences."
Miss Davis created the letters, "for people knew that they were the ones to whom they could turn and speak, even if it was just a friend.
Do not hide in yourselves, you must speak."
Mrs. Humphris, who has been married to Miss Davis for many years, lost her husband, Mark, who lived with him for 15 years, shortly after his mother died.
"He didn't say that he felt upset that he had depression or something," she said.
"For a few days to Christmas we noticed that he changed."
And he was in the Spirit on the day of Pentecost: and when the children were gathered together, he saw no man any more, no, not so much as a man:
She said that his death had become a great tragedy for them, but they should have survived it: "It caused a disaster.
I've got a family.
But we must continue to live and fight."

The future of Brett Kavano depends on the vote: the FBI is starting the investigation
"I thought that if we could get what we asked -- limited time and the nature of the investigation -- we might have reached a certain agreement -- Mr. Fleke said on Saturday, and added that he was afraid that the committee would be "resolved" on the basis of an excessive loss of political party loyalty.
Why didn't Mr. Kavano and his Republicans want the FBI to investigate?
Their lack of time.
The inter-elections will take place in five weeks, November 6, if there are expected problems in the Republicans, it will be seriously complicated by the choice of their own person in the Supreme Court of the country.
George V. Bush telephoned the senators with a request to support Mr. Kavano, who worked at the White House under Mr. Bush and through whom he met his wife, Ashley, who worked as a private secretary of Mr. Bush.
What happens after the FBI prepares its report?
There will be a vote in Senate, where 51 republics and 49 Democrats will now sit.
It still doesn't understand if Mr. Kavano could get at least 50 votes at the Senate meeting, which would enable Vice President Mike Pens to solve the problem with the same number of votes and thank his candidate for the position of the Supreme Court judge.
During Kim's reign, the number of refugees from North Korea was "short"
After Kim Chen Inn arrived in power seven years ago, the number of refugees from North Korea was reduced to South Korea.
Again, Pion Seug, referring to the Ministry of the Union of South Korea's data, stated that in the past year, the number of refugees was 1127 compared to 2706 in 2011.
Mr. Pack said that the key factors were strengthening coordination between North Korea and China, as well as the fact that law enforcement contractors now require more money.
In Pennsylvania, public comments were received.
The vast majority of refugees from North Korea finally offer South Korea's citizenship.
In Seoul, more than 30,000 North Koreans were declared illegal after the Korean war ended in 1953.
Most run through China, which has the longest border with North Korea. It is easier to cross than a well-protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between two Koreas.
China considers refugees to be illegal migrants, not refugees, and often forced to repatriate them.
The relationship between North and South Korea, which is still in the state of war, has improved significantly in recent months.
Early this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Phoenicia and discussed the question of denuclearization, which was discussed in the booklet.
This happened after the United States President Donald Tramp and Kim Chen Ina in Singapore, where they in general agreed to cooperate on the nuclear disarmament of the Korean peninsula.
However, on Saturday, North Korea's Prime Minister, Ray Yoon-Ho, on the basis of the sanctions received, accused the United States of not making progress.
"With no confidence in the United States, we can't be confident in the security of our country, so there can't be any talk about unilateral disarmament," Ri Yoon-Ho said in his statement at the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosy calls Brett Cavano "stirious" and says he's not going to work in the Supreme Court.
The leader of the minority in the Chamber of Representatives of Nancy Pelosi called the candidate in the position of Judge of the Supreme Court of Brett Cavano "extreme" and said that he was not suitable for work in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi expressed his thoughts in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I've always thought that if a woman had ever acted like this, she would be called "stirious," said Pelosi in his reaction to the witness to Cavano to the Legal Committee of Senate on Thursday.
Cavano was emotionally opposed to charges of sexual violence against Dr. Christine Blaise Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening speech, Cavano was very emotional, occasionally screaming and screaming, talking to his family and school years.
He also openly condemned the democracies in the committee, calling charges against him "absorbing and coordinated destruction of reputation," organized by liberals that highlighted the fact that Gillary Clinton won the presidential elections in 2016.
In Pelosi’s view, the testimony of Cavano showed that he could not work in the Supreme Court because it showed his prejudice toward democracy.
"I think these statements, as well as his statement against Clinton and the Democrats, will lead to his candidate," she said.
When she was asked if she was trying to announce the Cavano Empire, if her wine was confirmed, and if most of the Democrats were received in the House of Representatives.
"I'll say so: if he doesn't speak the truth to Congress or the FBI, he's not only willing to work in the Supreme Court, but also in the court where he's working now," said Pelos.
In the meantime, Cavano is serving as a judge of the U.S. Appeal Court in the province of Colombia.
Pelosi added that as a democracy she is troubled by the possible decisions of Cavano against the law "For access to medical services" or "Roo vs. Veda" because he is considered a conservative judge.
In his hearing the question of confirmation at Kawano’s position, he asked the party if he would cancel any decisions of the Supreme Court.
"It's not the time when the court becomes a strong, opposed person and we'll tell you how wonderful it is," said Pelosi.
Women should be armed with this weapon.
These are just words that have been in it for months and years, and she could not say them without a smile.
"We cry when we're in the mood," said Mrs. Steine to me 45 years ago.
"I don't think it's unusual, do you?"
She continued: "A woman who was working with the executive director and who was very helpful to me said that she was also crying when she was angry, but she had her own method. When she got angry and started crying, she said to the co-rapporteur: "You may think I'm sad and I'm crying because of it.
And I am evil."
And then she just kept going.
I thought it was incredible."
The tears are considered to be a allowable result of anger partly because they are accepted by others.
One of my favorite memories of my first job in the office where most men worked was that when I once cried out in a rage, and the older woman — the unfriendly manager I was always a little afraid — grabbed me by the room and walked into the back of the cell.
"Never let them see how you cry," she said to me.
"They don't know you're hearty.
They'll think you're sad, and they'll be happy that they got to you."
Patricia Schreder, then a congressman from the Democratic Republic of Colorado, worked with Harry Garrett on presidential elections.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was arrested on a private ship called Monkey Business, after he left the race, deeply disappointed Mrs. Shreder decided that there was no reason why she could not fight at the president's post.
"It wasn't a very thought decision," she said to me with a smile 30 years ago.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race, and another candidate is the last thing they needed."
Someone called the "Bilson and Seven Crimes" situation.
Since it was at the end of the campaign, she left for the cost congregation, so she promised not to take part in the race unless she got $2 million.
It was a hopeless fight.
She found that some of her clients, who did not charge $1,000 for support from men, only gave her $250.
"They think I'm going to get down?" she wondered.
When she spoke out and announced that she would not be conducting an official campaign, she was touched by the emotions — the gratitude of the people who supported her, the disappointment of the system that made money collection very difficult and moved to focus on the voters, not on the members of the parliamentarians, but on the violence of the sexist.
"You'd think I'm nervous," said Mrs. Shreder's reaction to the press.
You'd think Klenex is my corporate sponsor.
I was still thinking about what they'd write on my cover?
"She cried?"
How a trade war between the United States and China can lead to Beijing
Experts believe that the first steps to trade between the United States and China were disappointing, and, while far from its completion, long - term prospects can lead to Beijing’s benefit.
U.S. President Donald Tramp made the first warning shot at the beginning of this year, covering the taxes of major Chinese exports, including solar batteries, steel and aluminium.
This week’s biggest problem was that of a new trade rate of $200 billion (150 billion), which actually accounts for half of all goods coming into the United States with China.
Pekin paid the same coin every time, recently putting a coin in the size of five to ten percent on American goods at $60 billion.
China has been forced to use similar U.S. resources, and the second most important in the world of economics is either in the near future or in the near future, the possibility of living up to this promise.
To force Washington to give up means to meet his requirements, but for President of China, the public worship of the U.S.
However, according to experts, if Beijing is using the situation correctly, the pressure in the US war can lead China to a long-term perspective by reducing the link between two economies.
"A quick political decision in Washington or Beijing can create conditions that will lead to a variety of economic downturns in any country. And this is actually more dangerous than observers recognized before," said analyst Abigail Grace, who deals with Asia's issues in the Center for New American Security.
The Minister of Order stated that Syria was "ready" to return refugees
In Syria, refugees are declared ready for voluntary return and return to their homeland, a war - torn country that lasted more than seven years.
In a speech to the General Assembly of the United Nations, Mr. Valid al-Mullam said that conditions in the country would improve.
"Today's real situation has become more stable and safer because of the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to renew the area’s destroyed terrorists so that people can return to normal lives.
All conditions for voluntary return to a country where refugees had to be abandoned by terrorism, as well as unilateral economic measures that affected their daily lives and limited their livelihoods, are now being created.
According to UN estimates, more than 5.5 million Syrians fled the country from the start of the war in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Mullam stated that the Syrian government would be pleased to receive assistance in restoring the ruined country of war.
But he stressed that they would not receive any help or help from countries that support the environment.
Europe's behind the victory at the "Cubque Raider" in Paris
The European team held the "Cuboc Ryder" in 2018 when it won the US team with a suspect account 16.5:10.5 at Le Golf National in Paris, France.
The U.S. Army has already seized a six-time mission in Europe and has not won the 1993 Kubok Raider tournament here.
Europe returned to its homeland when the Danish captain Thomas Biorna’s command took 14,5 glasses they needed in order to win over the United States.
The American star Phil Michaelson, who, from all forces, tried most of the tournaments, struck his first further hit on the 16th moon par-3 in the water and became the French Molinary.
The Italian golfer Molinari won all his rounds and became one of the four players who ever took account of the five to 0 to 0 from the start of the tournament in modern form in 1979.
American Jordan Spit caught up with account 5:4 from a player with the lowest rating in the European team of Turberna Olesena from Denmark.
Dustin Johnson, who takes the first step in the world ratings, came with account 2:1 of Jan Polter from England, who may have participated in the "Cuboc Ryder" tournament last.
The Spanish Serhio Garcia, a veteran "Cubca Ryder" who has already participated in the tournament eight times, has become a European who has played the most in the tournaments all the time, carried out his career of 25.5 eyes.
"Of course I don't cry, but today I can't do anything.
That was a difficult year.
Thanks to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so happy, so happy to return the cube.
It's a service of the team, and I'm glad it's been able to help," he said, without maintaining his emotions, Garcia after winning Europe.
He gives the estapheth to his associate John Remo, who won the U.S. legend of the Gulf of Tiger Woods on Sunday in a unique game with account 2:1.
"I feel incredible pride for victory over Tiger Woods, I grow up watching these guys," said 23-year-old Ram.
In France Woods won all four matches and now has a career record on the "Cuboc Ryder" tournament 13-21-3.
A great statistics for one of the most visible players of all time who won 14 Major tournaments, only Jack Nicholus.
The U.S. Assembly during all the exits tried to reach the farm area, except Patrick Rida, Justin Thomas, and Tony Finau, who showed a high quality golf course throughout the entire tournament.
The U.S. Captain Jim Furrick said about his command after an unfortunate statement: "I'm writing these guys, they're fighting.
This morning, we were soon ruling over Europe.
We fought.
I'm taking my hat off to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We're going to regroup, I'm going to work with the Association of Professional Players in the U.S. Gulf and the Tournament Committee, and we're going to move forward.
I love these 12 boys and I'm drunk because I'm their captain.
We can't thank them.
We lost."
Current information on the red effect: reduction of concentration in the areas of Penellas, Manat and Sarasota
The last report of Florida’s fisheries and wildlife commission shows a general decline in the coloring of the microorganisms in some parts of the Tampa River.
According to Florida’s fisheries and wildlife commissions, the conditions of a variety of flowers reported in certain areas of Penellas, Manat, Sarasota, Charlotte, and Collier testify to a decrease in concentration.
The flowering of the red - color microorganisms spreads about 130 miles [130 km] of the coastal line from the north of Pinellas to the southern regions of Le.
Plums can be found about 10 miles from the shore of Gillsboro, but less than last week.
The red tide was also observed in the area of Pasco.
Last week, the average concentration was reported in the Pinellas area and in its coastal area, the low concentration in the Gillsboro area, the high concentration in the Manat area, the high concentration in the Sarasto area and its coastal zone, the average concentration in the Charlotte area, the high concentration in Lea and its coastal zone, and the low concentration in the Collier area.
In the areas of Penellas, Manat, Sarasota, Lee, and Collier, there continue to be reports of the separation of breathing organs.
Such messages were not recorded in the north west of Florida last week.
