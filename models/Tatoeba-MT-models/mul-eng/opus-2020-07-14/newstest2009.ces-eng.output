Prussian bursa to the end of trade to the minimum
After an early spring fall, the Prussian bridge was repaired by the loss.
Transactions with ČEZ shares reached almost half of the ordinary daily trade.
The Prague bourgeois immediately pointed out that since the start of yesterday's trade on its southern decline, it's costing about six per cent.
This time, there's a loss of stock on Wall Street.
We also see market reactions as a result of the vote of the American Snow Representative, who refused to support the stabilisation plan of the dark financial sector.
Debt of shares in Asia
The dramatic fall in the afternoon led to an action in the cities of Asia, even though the indexes, but during part of the day, finally disappeared.
In Hong Kong, the index of Hong Kong bridge was about four per cent, but later some lost and the decline reduced by 2.5 per cent.
The index Hang Seng China Enterprises, which monitors the movement of Chinese shares at the Hong Kong bridge, was estimated at 3.8 per cent, in Shanghai markets were closed.
The stock on the Sydney bridge lost more than five per cent, but the loss finally decreased to 4.3 per cent.
The price on Chaj-wan according to the dark index is 3.6 per cent.
"The timing of saved action in the United States is uncertain and affects the financial markets worldwide," remarked Hong Kong's mayor Joseph Yam.
Hong Kong, although it is part of China, the change policy is determined on its own, without any dependence on the Chinese Central Bank.
The U.S. has Hong Kong at the same level as the United States.
According to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudda, U.S. lawmakers should immediately return to the meeting and propose support for the financial system.
Otherwise, it's too dangerous that the consequences will be felt by other countries.
Blood vessels of the American shares
The U.S. Snömovna representatives rejected the financial system support plan on Monday, which would amount to $700 billion (about 12 billion Kč).
The legislators therefore ignored President George Bush's call to support the plan.
According to Bush, the plan would solve the underlying causes of the financial crisis and help stabilize the whole economy.
The American shares in the afternoon lived in a blood vessel and the main stock indexes recorded the largest wage for more than 20 years.
Down Jones's index was about seven per cent and a similar decrease was recorded last year in 1987.
The index was already in motion before the vote, but as soon as it was shown that the proposal did not go smoothly, the index appeared in a free fall.
Congress concluded: The U.S. government can pump $700 billion to the bank
The highest representatives of the American Congress and the government of President George W. Bush agreed on a broader form of financial assistance agreement for the American financial system.
He'll be voted for next week.
The U.S. legislators conducted half of their discussions on the approval of a rescue plan in the form of financial assistance for the US financial system in the amount of $700 billion (about $12 billion).
But it's not yet won.
The congressmen must also complete some details of the agreement before they can publish the final form of the law and vote on it.
The financial system support plan will be implemented on the basis of the shadow representatives in the afternoon.
On Sunday, Agent Reuters said it was the chairman of the Committee for Banking and Financial Services, Snow Barney Frank.
According to sources in the Senate, it could vote for a plan first in the middle.
According to the economies, it should be announced that the adoption of the saved plan would be the first major psychological factor for the recovery of financial markets.
Then, however, it comes to "extreme" thanks to the complexity of mechanisms that help markets reach even in practice.
Paulson: The plan must be effective
"We've made great progress.
We have resolved our different views on how to look like a package to stabilise the market," said Mrs. Bloomberg Democrat Nancy Pelosie.
According to her, the final vote could be held on Sunday.
Representatives of lawmakers met with the US Finance Minister Henry Paulson on Sunday to provide a definitive basis for the government fund.
This should buy non-producing mortgage assets from financial companies that are in serious losses and threaten the stability of the whole system.
"We are in the process of defining the plan that will work and must also be effective on the market.
It must still be in a healthy plan, but I think we're there," said Paulson.
A signal for Asian trade
The global financial crisis is clearly linked to the stock markets that corrupts.
According to German democratic Senator Harry Reida, legislators are trying to reach a final agreement on Sunday in Congress.
They also want to comfort investors before trading on Asian financial markets, which are in the first instance in time, where the decision of the Congress could have an impact on trade.
However, it is still not clear when both of the members of the United States Congress will vote on the law, even if they can't hold a meeting at the last minute.
Lawyers hope he'll be approved in the next few days.
However, the law still knows a number of changes.
The total amount assigned to the aid system shall be divided into two parts.
The original 350 billion dollars should be available as soon as possible, as President George Bush requested.
But the Congress can block the release of remaining amounts if it has the idea that the program does not complete its function, followed by the next 100 billion dollars and the latest 350 billion dollars.
Bush assessed progress in meetings
The President of the Network may direct this decision, but Congress may vote against it.
However, despite these changes, the basic idea of the programme, which was to obtain funding for the recovery of bad mortgage securities, whose value had fallen because hundreds of thousands of Americans were not able to pay their mortgages.
"We've done everything.
The shadow representatives should be able to vote on the law on Sunday and the Senate on Monday," said Republican Senator Judd Gregg.
The President of the United States is also pleased with the progress in the negotiations.
His speech, Tony Fratto, said that Bush is calm with Saturday progress and appreciates "the mutual effort to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy."
Restriction of gold deposits
The President of the Banking Committee of Senat Christopher Dodd, the executive director, said that the legislators agreed to take responsibility for the money programme, the protection of taxpayers from loss, the closure of the funds, the timing of the financing of the plan.
The new law should also limit the fines of gold to the directors of the company participating in the programme and establish a committee that will have oversight over the Fund.
This should be led by the Ministry of Finance.
"We have worked very hard on this and have made great progress towards the agreement that will work and be useful for the market and for all Americans," Paulson said.
The plan is also calculated with the help of home owners who have problems with payment.
The government should make new payments to the mortgage that it purchases, with the aim of reducing monthly payments for the employees and allowing them to leave their homes.
Marek: Psychological Help
The planned plan is based on the main economy of Patricia Finance David Mark with a good idea, but it will be very difficult to achieve it.
"And because you don't know what mechanism and what price the problem assets will buy.
This will determine how the financial sector and government will divide the losses," said the iHNed.cz Marek server this week.
If the plan is approved now, or at the beginning of the next week, it's not according to Mark as essential.
"It is much more important that the congressmen agree this week to support this plan and that its mission will be first.
This psychological significance of the agreement that it comes to approval is now most important," Marek emphasized.
Soap on sharp knife: MP3 player against mobiles.
We'll find out how to choose.
While almost every cell can play MP3 files, no MP3 player is able to call.
It seems clear that it's better to buy just a phone.
There are still enough reasons for man to set up a personal player.
The choice will depend entirely on the way in which the future owner is used and money.
You'll probably find it hard to manage your house with a spicy expensive gramophone so you can listen to the latest album Maxim Turbulenc.
However, such music products do not appear on the LP discs and there is no objective reason for this.
If, however, in your rules, you are bound by art rock, jazem or blues, probably with such a gramphone at least.
It's the same with music on the streets, so it's complicated, simplified - music in MP3.
And here there are price and quality categories.
For someone it may be unacceptable to lose for the player eight thousand crowns, just like the Pink Floyd fan, it's probably a hard-tested fan for twenty crowns from the market.
Two extremes between which there's enough space for everyone.
The choice is wide.
Determines and maintains the battery
Some Spike Music Players control much more than just playing music, but most mobiles don't find it.
No modern device is as universal as the phone.
According to primary functions, the phone and the event, he can play music and videos, both play, he has a better camera here, and he should be able to navigate.
And if we take the smartphones and the transmitter, you'll have a small computer in your pocket.
It's a small surprise, because no refrigerator can watch and no TV can photograph anything.
The universality of the mobile is also the result.
The more you use your cell phone, the more your display indicator will be sent to the supplier.
And replaying music is one of the greatest energy sources.
A small mobile can play music longer than ten hours, most of which is much less.
In this direction, musical players (especially the simplest) are significantly more efficient.
So in the left cell phone, count with the fact that you won't be playing for a couple of hours.
If you still call here and call there, come to work for security, another offer - it pays for expensive devices.
You will not have this problem with MP3 players, and the worse will last at least 9 hours of uninterrupted drive on one track.
Another problem arises when recording music to the cell.
However, only limited parts of devices are available to the universal USB connector, and not all of them can directly connect to computers without special software.
Of course, music can be played directly on the memory card, but only a smaller card reader will consult with the miniature memory cards that are used in mobile phones.
You do not need any special software from Players to iPod exceptions.
It's enough to fill up the music via USB from the computer.
Most mobiles and players are already creating a music library based on the name of the interpreter, the name of the album, the genre or the user should be evaluated.
Some devices display only a tree structure of the addressees like a Windows Explorer and some are both capable (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smart phones with the operating system).
Players can play, mobiles can do more
When selecting a particular device, you will be especially interested in the maintenance of the battery, memory capacity, the quality and type of sound output and of course also the comfort of control.
If the music is first used and if you listen to it every day just a short time in the trauma, you will have any mobile that's playing MP3.
What's really going to happen is almost any cell phone.
You don't have to watch too much what music formats mobile or player can do.
MP3 will control all and the most of the songs that you get will be in this format.
He looks at the largest and, besides him, the vast majority of the instruments of government and music in the form of WMA.
AAC is less available (formerly used by Apple and its iPods).
Better mobiles also allow, for example, to buy songs online.
It is enough to visit the operator’s (or other provider’s) appropriate website via the mobile Internet and buy a song or album.
This service could already be a valid argument for the provision of a music cell.
Unfortunately, the offer of operators is boring and limited to most of the fast-paced radio.
Prices are not the lowest either.
However, it is generally assumed that this is the way to sell music (whether via GSM, the Internet or wireless internet) into the future.
Most people still carry their cell phones.
Whenever you get to listen to something, you find a cell phone in your pocket, while the MP3 player lies in the house.
Still, it depends on whether you also wear a headphone or at least a hand-free.
If not, you can use an integrated player that has almost every cell, but only at least MP3 players.
Probably the greatest benefit of musical phones will be for many prices.
The lowest are usually less than three thousand.
In three and four thousand rounds, you'll already run a very obedient walkman.
Most of the time, however, you will be limited by the absence of an appearance on a regular speaker.
The best and most affordable telephones and with 3.5 mm screen for regular hearing aids are up to fifteen thousand.
The performance of players is also easy to use.
You are the easiest - no matter how easy (see our choice) - the player can really control each other.
The minimum function, the equivalent of control with the former regular indicator or the need for a gramphone is apparent.
There is no danger of a car crash in the form of an error on the mobile Internet and then a bad account for data transfer.
Which device to use
And the most cheap mobiles (e.g. Vadaphone 527) have slots on alternate memory cards (type M2, microSD, etc.).
And with the purchase of the appropriate cards, you'll get to two thousand crowns.
But take care.
Only cards with a maximum capacity of 2 GB are supported in the basic models.
Except for the most expensive advice with 8 GB memories.
If you already have your cell phone and you still want to buy a cheap MP3 player, you can download it by Cowon, Creativu, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or iriver.
According to capacity (max. 2 GB) you must not lose more than 1,100 kroner.
If you look at the more advanced audiences, you will be more inclined to follow specialized mobiles - walkmanes (sony Ericsson, some Nokie and Samsungy).
These devices have self-control buttons for MP3 and service comfort is so close to the private MP3 player.
Most recently, Sony Ericsson, whose mobiles from a series of walkmans have a certain user interface as a self-sustained MP3 player.
The same service and in the same price category up to four thousand kroner, but with a greater memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and a battery (usually 15 hours, up to 35 hours), will lead you to the MP3 player from the above mentioned characters.
The first virtual operator comes to Czech for the year.
Maybe
The mobile market in Czech is relatively successful and our operators offer practically all services as their partners in Western Europe.
Still, there's something missing here - a virtual operator that would make you classically slow down.
Maybe it won't be long.
As many operators are the most expensive in Europe, we have already written on Mobile.cz many times.
Finally, he confirmed the fact that the price of SMS is higher than in the rest of the Union.
After the last steps of the European Commission on the regulation of roaming charges, it is possible to come to a paradox situation - for some customers of Czech mobile operators, SMS will be easier from abroad than home.
How is it possible that prices in Czechs are so high in comparison with Europe?
The answer is simple, missing competition, which would really want to go to war.
Maybe it sounds paradoxically, but we have three mobile networks and a pentration of over 100%.
On the contrary, mobile operators are glad that the Czech market is extremely competitive.
In this way, they are often called by the President of the Czech Telecommunications Office (STU), Paul Dvorák, who in the past said that there was no place for another operator in Czech.
It's probably true that the classic operator with its own network has no more chance (lastly, he's probably just looking for frequency).
But there is another possibility - a virtual operator.
The entry of virtual operators into the mobile market resulted in a significant reduction in prices that the operators also had to react to.
At the same time before the entry of a check like Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile on the market, there were similar voices in Great Britain like us.
But it turned out that the place for such operators is and can be really successful.
Finally, we don't have to go too far for examples.
During the year, we informed you about the launch of the virtual Mobilking operator in Poland.
In just half a year, this operator was allowed to acquire more than 100 thousand customers and become the fifth largest operator in the country.
At the same time, Mobilking is a financial group of Penta, which in Czech is owned by another U:fona.
The outcome of virtual operators is an opportunity to focus on a much more specific target group.
In order to function effectively, they also have a lot less customers than classical operators.
They do not bring relatively high costs to the building, operation and maintenance of the mobile network.
In the world, virtual operators usually profile themselves as low-cost - offer cheap calls and SMS, which is often carried out by offering services.
So Tesco Mobile in Great Britain should offer SMS at least half cheaper than its competitors.
But as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, it can be quite good at home and a set of undisputed target groups.
This operator is also concerned with men's specifics.
"The right guys love Mobileking - an operator they like and they can trust," says David Seibertz CEO Mobile Entertainment Company, conducting this virtual operator.
It's hard to say if a concept like that could be taken from us in Poland.
The Czech market is relatively small for the segmental approach on which most virtual operators are based.
In addition, the service offers are relatively saturated."
In Czech without a chance, they call mobile operators
But it seems almost certain that if there is a virtual mobile operator in Czech, it won't be Mobiling.
"We are talking about the expansion of this successful project, but in Czech, meetings do not look too promising.
Soon he will be leaving Mobilking in other countries of our region," said Jana Studničková, a press spokesman of the Penta financial group.
She also confirmed that the existing mobile operators in Czech had not been strongly influenced by this opinion.
Rather, he tries to do everything so that no potential competitor will fail.
I am interested in the launch of a virtual mobile operator for a longer time by the GTS Novera group, which would therefore like to take another step towards becoming a real competitor of the O2 telephone to the company customers' pool.
"We have great interest in offering our customers not only strong but also mobile telecommunications services.
And as before, that's better.
This opportunity was repeatedly discussed with all Czech mobile operators.
With some of them we have already made progress in the meetings," says the press group Paul Kaidl.
Well, maybe it's a better time.
From informal information it seems that the first virtual operator should be expected to wait until the end of the year.
In the meantime, however, his reputation carries out an inexhaustible spell of torture.
"At this moment we are not convinced that there is a place in the Czech market for the reputation of a fully-fledged virtual operator.
The Czech market is very specific to other markets.
After all, no entity has spoken to us with a complex and serial project in this area," he added in his statement for Mobile.cz Vlastimil Sršön from the Press Committee Phone O2.
Other operators are also calling for the specificity of the Czech market.
T-Mobile Martin Kemrova adds in a friendly manner with the expression O2: "We have not yet recorded any life-threatening and extremely valuable business project, which could be further developed."
And he adds: "In the T-Mobile network, at the end of the year, some virtual operator appears very hard.
At this moment we should have a specific agreement on the table so that it can be considered in this short horizon."
Vodafone draws more attention to the fulfilment of its own 3G license requirements.
Miroslav Čepicý says: "We are open to meeting potential virtual operators, especially in the area of sharing costs and infrastructure.
That's exactly what we're looking at customers as the most important.
The main strategy of Vodafon in this area is to find a partner to build a shared network for quick mobile internet."
Responsible authorities - with operators one hand
The process of mobile operators can easily be understood, the entry of another operator would mean an increase in competition, a decrease in prices and a decrease in their profits.
Why, then, facilitate access to such competitors?
That when it comes to something, the operators will be able to take the lead for one operation, witness and alarm around the U:fon.
Probably the biggest pressure towards ČTU went to U:fona from T-Mobile company in time.
It provides publicly available information on ČTU websites.
But now it's just U:phone is being used as an argument why the virtual operator doesn't give up.
Martin Kemrov pointed out: "The competitive environment of the mobile market has recently been strengthened by the entry of a fourth mobile operator into the market.
With regard to the character of the mobile market in the PRC, it is clear that the entry of another player to it and in particular to his services would meet high requirements."
In view of this access by mobile operators, however, it is directly disturbing that the Czech regulatory authorities are not interested.
It is not just about the status of the ČTU, which he claimed in Czech - unlike Great Britain and other developed countries - that he has no right to commit to economic competition.
They belong exclusively to the Agency for the Protection of Economic Competition (EAFRD).
But this guy's got his typical position on the whole problem.
"The entry of a virtual operator into the mobile market would be possible after the conclusion of a contract between a mobile operator and a virtual operator for the purchase of the necessary infrastructure.
No such contract was recently concluded because the offer of potential stakeholders was probably not sufficiently interesting for classical operators," said Kristián Chalupa of the Committee on External Relations of the UOHS.
It is likely that such a formal statement will not be interrupted by the representatives of operators.
The Authority which has to represent consumer interests and other duties and to avoid abuse of its position on the market is more than considered.
In particular, when Kristián Chalupa adds: "In a foreign country where virtual operators are often driven, we can note that their market access has contributed to a reduction in mobile telephone service prices."
Obviously, however, the pressure on the proper functioning of the market environment and the decrease in prices does not affect the interests of the EAGGF.
In fact, it is quite shocking to see three mobile operators who are affected by their reactions.
The question, if it's really just a coincidence, it's all about itself.
Just like the exact same gas price in the railway stations, it is certainly only part of the deal and a strong competitive fight.
"The Authority has not looked for signs of anti-competitive conduct in this regard, and therefore has no reason to do so in any way.
None of the operators have a dominant position, since they do not have an increased responsibility for their market dealings.
The necessary tools for opening the mobile market for virtual operators are most likely also available to the telecommunications regulator," Chalupa said in his statement.
The interpretation of a dominant position on the market is one of many points of contention.
There is a comprehensive analysis of the relevant markets developed by ČTU, according to which telecommunications from the point of view of economic competition is the single market.
Of course, none of the Czech operators have a dominant position on this market.
Some legal experts, however, offer a different view - the presence of a virtual operator requires always a network operator's consent.
And the mobile operator - he has all logic - on his monopol network.
So there must be a need to be dominant in a particular segment.
Even if we do not agree with this argument, the EAGGF should be minimally careful that three mobile operators act in a similar manner.
At the same time, the difficulty of a number of stakeholders (including the mentioned company GTS Novara) indicates that all operators are exposed to very similar obstacles.
The recognition of ČTU responsibility is then a relatively common trick, which the EAGGF pays from the full involvement of the hands away.
We've met him in a few similar cases.
However, until recently adopted new telecoms law, the extension of the power of the CTU in the field of economic competition in telecommunications has not been possible until a number of experts have agreed to improve the situation.
This must be better than good, but obviously their interests are different.
That's what happens when no one sees
At the same time, the operation of any pseudovirtual operators currently exists in Czech mobile networks.
These are companies that issue their own prices of mobile telephone services, which are only partially public.
Usually it's about a multilevel marketing company.
Your own mobile phone services offer Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and a number of others.
The prices of these companies will usually only be paid to the approved company.
Kuzlo is pleased that the company against the operators is acting as a classic company customer, which orders a large amount of SIM card.
As an important customer, you will receive special prices (and other) offers.
The problem is that the commercial conditions of all Czech mobile operators prohibit a similar resale.
"If the cases you're talking about could be dealt with by breaking the terms of the contract that we'd like to have and could end up working with that company," Martin Kemrov answered our question on this issue.
However, it is unlikely that similar activities would have been done to responsible people from mobile operators.
In particular, in the case of three mentioned companies, thousands of customers may be involved.
None of the operators will be shielded by such a procedure.
As a result of the activities of these companies, they also have outstanding profits and, unlike the actual virtual operators, they never threaten their own official marketing.
Miroslav Čepicý cautions on possible problems: "The law allows similar speculation, however, the services of these companies use only an insignificant percentage of customers.
They must also accept that SIM cards on their phone are not listed on their name, so they cannot be fully available as regular customers of mobile operators."
But that should be at least weird.
In addition, further questions will be raised for the EAGGF.
If mobile operators are involved in a similar procedure, why are they blocking the performance of the virtual operator?
It is necessary to add that the EAGGF has a relatively strong power to identify such activities, and if it does not wish, it must not rest with the operators explaining that they have no such concerns and their commercial conditions are prohibited.
When We Are Not the Best
As the text has fallen several times, the entry of virtual operators into the mobile market has brought a significant decline in service prices.
At the same time, in all countries where virtual operators appeared, classical operators tried to protect their performance more or less.
The arguments used by them were practically accurate - too small, possibly too complicated, problems with quality services, etc.
In developed countries, however, the regulatory authorities, which have never challenged the interests of mobile operators, but their customers, have acted immediately at this time.
Whether formal measures or non-formal pressures have already resulted in the formation of the first virtual operator and the subsequent recovery.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulatory authorities are taking over the whole case as a hot hamburger.
From our experience, we cannot help but conclude that incompatibility in these cases is more than a matter of time.
But let's not get a flint into the ice.
If the backup information is correct and the virtual operator is really soon to show up, the Czech mobile market may be re-examined.
If one of the operators has allowed the appearance of a virtual mobile operator, the power of the UOHS will only be difficult to resist (discrimination) other stakeholders.
And we need to stop calling more noise than in the rest of Europe.
A new Czech himna has four new versions.
Choose the best here
Listen to four new versions of Czech state himms.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek, on the occasion of the Czech state Day, presented a new record of state himnya Where my home.
Hymnu played a new orchestra of the National Festival under the direction of Jiří Bēlöhlövka.
There are four versions - with male or female solo music, in congregational presentation and instrumentation.
The song was taken by the Caterina Church and Adam Plachetka.
The authors of the repair of the hemna are Father Jeremiah and Jaroslav Krček.
You can listen to all four versions on the iHNed.cz server.
The white man thinks the Czech national song is one of the most beautiful hymns.
In the Czech Republic, he had previously said that he had deliberately chosen to sing solo variants with young representative voices that are expressive and popular.
"From the beginning, I was in both, and then the congregation tried to do the same, so that they could have a clear dirge, so that the text would be well understood to be accepted," he said.
The Czech state himma will celebrate the 175th anniversary next year.
The song Where my home was first introduced in 1834 to the pieces of the Stavovské divall in the original Czech game Fidlovačka Joseph Kajetana Tila added to the song Františka Šcroupa.
She's got a popularity, and people take her spontaneously.
The first song was then sung after the appearance of Československa in 1918 and became a natural part of the state himm.
One of the seven national symbols remained after the appearance of the independent Czech Republic.
How's the "new" hymna?
Prague MHD in the middle of the first link and on the chip
Wednesday 1 October 2008 shall be registered in the event of the Prague Transport Company as the date when the buses enter the subway, trams and buses enter the first passenger who will have the place of the paper trucks in the pocket of an electronic coupon.
At the moment, he can arrange for hundreds of thousands of people who own the Opencard chip card.
Travellers can buy and also have their driver's ticket in infocentres and workshops of the Transport Company in the Museum, Museum, Museums, Nárží Holešovice, Angel, Rostyly, Latvia, Kobylisy, Rajská garden, Kacherov and Luka.
The purchases can also be bought from yesterday on the website of the Transport Company www.dpp.cz.
The service in the afternoon was used over four customers.
Those who start using the Internet trade can definitely forget the exit window in the stations, where they had to stand regularly in the long fronts on paper trains.
The buyer buys it over the Internet and on the Opencard card they play it in one of the thirty districts of the City Library.
"In these places, there is a break with a trained service that will help the interested parties to buy the internet and also play a purchased coupon on their card," said the speaker of the project Martin Opatarny.
According to the book, it will also be possible to play electronic shopping on Opencard in self-service cars that are mounted in several windmills.
How do those cars look?
They are red, they remember the landmarks of the train and may already be seen in the stations Roztyly, Budějoviká, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská.
"They are not in town five, but they should be 80 by the end of the year," added the Watchman.
The coupon controls the driver's position automatically
The function of the machines that start working tomorrow is simple.
It's enough to insert an Opencard chip card and the previously paid coupon is on its own.
Electronic purchases from the morning are paid not only in the capital but also in its surroundings.
Thus, in the city streets and bus lines, from 300 to 499, the city is mainly inhabited by middle-class citizens.
"In the trains listed in the Prague Integrated Transports, the driver is equipped with a card, which enables them to find time and sand payout," Filip Drapal explained the control of the train from the Ropid organisation, which consists of the railway lines of the Prague Group Transport.
Local buses have a card set up according to the driver.
At login, therefore, it is necessary to show not only the driver's chip card, but also to add OpenCard to a particular location on the side of the trailer.
The driver controls the value of the purchased coupons.
"If a traveler needs to verify the value of the purchased coupons, it is nothing more than asking for the driver for this information," Drapal added.
Travellers who don't drive direct buses and will not remember when they end up paying for the purchase can go back to self-service cars where the purchases are being stored on the card.
Here they will see information about the availability of their documents on the display of the device.
The Courts wanted the United States referendum
In 1945, the Germans called for the integration of the Shumavi into the United States.
It is from a letter that is included in the collection of the South American scientific books.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Rakouska, at least we want to live under the patronage of the United States of America.
With such an invitation, in 1945 some groups of South Germans visited the president of the United States.
This is evident from the other writing that was kept in a private archive and is now included in the collections of the Jewish scientific literature.
The Germans from the Czech Krumlov are asking in a letter from the American President not to allow the return of the "shumuvish soup" - banned by Hitler on the basis of the minority agreement - back to Czechoslovakia.
"We understood the situation correctly and we want to be truly sure that the American units will never come to Germany as persecutors and enemies, even as freemen," says a letter signed by the words "People who are judged by the Shumavy on their hearts."
The accession to Czechoslovakia is clearly granted to the Germans - with the knowledge of Czech national attitudes - hope only for brutality, indifference, misunderstanding, attacks and childishness, please the author of the American president's letter to take over the protection of the present and eternal times.
"We cannot believe that without considering the opinion of a quarter of a million citizens, you would recognize this territory to a foreign country that is undermining and destroying minorities and nothing, but that nothing could have contributed to the victory of the United Nations," says the letter.
For reasons why authors cannot sign, there is a particular concern about the substantiation of the "speech of Czech enthusiasts".
If the President of the United States had any doubts about the thinking of the Smuggling Germans, it would have been sufficient to set up a referendum on whether its citizens wanted to become part of the United States or to live under the auspices of the United States.
While the text of the letter may seem somewhat naive to today’s known holiday events, according to some scholars, it is appropriate to confirm the expectation of the so-called Germans.
Even though many Germans had to at least dream that they would be expelled from the Republic, only a few of them had given themselves such an opportunity.
Some expected that the United States and Great Britain would agree with the Court of Justice on some sort of autonomy.
Others believed that they would just stay in Czechoslovakia.
This is confirmed by the famous Russian journalist Gustav Chalupa, born in Czech Buddhists.
He was in the war as a Buddhist German based on the Baltic Sea.
When he was taken by the British at the end of the war and placed him in a concentration camp in the Netherlands, dozens of other Czech Germans followed him to teach him Czech.
"They believed that when they returned home, they would be honored," said Chalupa.
None of the German prisoners who lived before the war in Czechoslovakia, according to him, did not count it to be based on the Beneš Decrees to withdraw from the Republic.
You don't think you're paying!
The emotional campaign depends on the driver
The most expensive action is aimed at safety on the roads in the Czech Republic.
It would also be possible to characterise the emotional media campaign, which aims to launch the Ministry of Transport in the middle.
The Authority of Minister Alese Ребика undertakes to draw out the driver from the dangerous behavior behind the volunteer.
The 150 million campaign will appear on television, radio, cinema, on the Internet, and even on airplanes.
The driver should make a quick ride and alcohol after the volunteer.
And also remind them that they should be gathered before they go out.
He wants to get to know the young drivers, the motorists, the passengers and, in the final order, the professional drivers too.
And what's going on?
Especially human stories that affect emotions.
And that's what the "blood" team of the entire campaign says:
You don't think you're paying!
The word "unthinkable" is written with great letters on the spy.
And the word "you're paying" is in the blood bag.
It's a symbol that a person can pay for his own life for a moment.
The monsters will meet "fear" by 2010.
The ministry continued to inspire similar campaigns in the Anglo-Saxian countries, where images with dramatic images of victims can often be seen.
It's a promise that this will reduce the instability and number of dead people on the Czech roads.
Spots prepared the agency Euro RSCG.
Sugar and beer on the driver's side
"He pays for the driver's sugar and beer system.
The sugar for them is that, for example, when they go to red, they save time.
It's a threat of temptation or accident.
The driver must be at risk," says a transport psychologist at the Homelce Martin Kořán.
And that's why there's a need for an information campaign in the press and mainly negative ads, my psychologist.
They are less effective, according to him, tables that warn drivers of danger.
"If a static safety guard table is installed, it is likely soon to collapse with the environment and its drivers will not be able to blame it," Koran warned.
Olmert would return almost all the occupied territories to peace
The President of the Interim Israeli Government, Ehud Olmert, spoke for the return of practically all the territories occupied in 1967, as well as for the East Jerusalem and the Golan Mountains, to replace Palestine and Syria.
That's what he did in a conversation that afternoon he went to the D.J. A.A.A.
"We have to get to the agreement with Palestine, which means that it will be necessary to return almost all (purchased) lands, if not all," said Olmert deniske.
"We will leave a certain percentage of these lands, but the Palestinians will have to add a similar percentage (the Israeli territory), because there will be no peace without it," he added.
He assumed that any return would also include the east Jerusalem.
"Whoever wants security in Jerusalem, and especially does not want tractors or buldozers to cross his legs, as it came to one of my best friends, will have to give up part of Jerusalem," said Olmert in an attack on two Russian attacks in the city where several people were killed and dozens of people were wounded.
According to the Prime Minister, it will be necessary to find "a special solution for the Temple Mountain, a sacred and historical place", which lies within the Old City.
"The one who wants to keep the Israeli sovereign over the whole city will have to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
It won't work," he added.
Out of the Golan Mountains
Olmert also spoke about Israel's departure from the Golan Mountains, which he said is an unacceptable condition for the conclusion of the peace agreement with Syria.
But it would also require certain efforts from Damascus.
"I do not propose to close the peace with Syria only on the basis of the departure from Golan," he warned.
"The hearted know what they'll have to give to get the Golans.
They will have to be given their current relationship with Iran; they will have to be given their relationship to (Sweden) Hizballah; they will have to be given sustained support to terrorism (Shiiish Hungwa) Hamas, Al-Qaedy and Jihad (Holy War) in Iraq," the Prime Minister stressed.
Question by accident: Are the drivers illegal in the bus?
The law is unknown, walking in a remote bus.
In relation to the tragic bus of the Student Agency near the Italian Padows, the question arose whether drivers and passengers could travel by bus.
"If we would like to adhere strictly and formally to the law, the activities of the fortress are in conflict with the law on road transport," says Karel Hanzelka, a spokesman for the Ministry of Transport.
The accident that left the two-year-old trailer last week, apparently caused the driver of the cost vehicle, which the bus had crossed the road.
The girl sat next to the driver at least safe in the car right now, although she won two more seats.
However, the bus can be dangerous, or the dust can be blown away, even when the driver breaks a coffee or a newspaper.
The role of the bus is whether the bus is equipped with seats according to the technical procedure.
If not approved in the bus, the passenger must sit.
Remote buses Student Agencys do not have seats; what is currently confirmed by the director of Radim Jancura.
"We resolved this with the ministry and did not allow the first movement of passengers.
Then we called and we made it to the point that the passengers can walk to the toilet if they have their seats," he said.
The Law of the House of Commons doesn't know
"There is no single legal explanation of the role of the chairman - no legal provisions will address this role.
However, no legal regulation does not prohibit the provision of services to the carrier.
The road transport law knows only the terms of the vehicle's driver; its rights and obligations are not defined," Hanzelka adds less individually.
On the contrary, the director of the Transport Transport Vehicles Committee, Josef Pokorny, points out that the problem is sufficiently addressed by the law.
"It depends on whether the bus has an approved position.
It's over," she says.
Buses work on the city, where there are seats on the station and limited maximum speed, the city with seats on the seat with the highest speed and the distance without the seating with the highest permitted speed and the seating of the safety belts.
As in the plane, says expert
The expert BESIP on transport safety Jaroslav Horín in the movement of drivers on the bus is not facing a major problem.
"When flying is dangerously dangerous, the situation can be compared to service in airports.
Even here it's not sure when turbulence comes and the plane can fit into the head."
"If, however, the bus driver is in a hurry, he's obviously paying for physical laws.
Just like in a city bus or tram.
The safety of drivers has to be resolved by internal regulations," he says, too, because of the law, the problem is not solved.
Jancura is willing to cancel services
A student agency offers driver services as a single bus driver.
She employs two hundred of them.
The director does not consider their calls for risk even after the accident.
"But as soon as I get the idea that calling the guards is risky, I'll break them down.
Coffee and newspapers can be obtained on arrival.
It would save the costs," he says.
As a matter of interest in security, the absence of drivers in their cars led by Asian director Alexei Litvin, who carries out a line break compared to SA.
"We don't have any shoes, we've been standing against that since the beginning.
Before or later it ends at some deadly rate," said a few years ago for Tiden.cz.
Stela is a tragedy that doesn't matter.
At the end of the line connection to Naples, a young man from Plzeńska who worked for the company for two years disappeared.
The Slovenian truck probably broke off without using the directions from the remote bridge and blocked the bus.
His driver tried to avoid the foolish manoeuvre, but he took the right front part.
To sell two places rewarded for the rest of the guards, Jancura refused.
"This place is not possible to book, it's blocked."
The company's gonna complain about the truck driver.
With the punishment of the girl's family, the agency will not wait for the court's court, but the financial reward is expected by the guilty party.
- The law?
Invisible
The clarification of the driver's movement on the bus could bring about a revision of the law on which the thirty-third expert group of the Ministry of Transport works over the year.
"No specific conclusion has yet been reached.
The bus doesn't even work out, you're going to hit the bottom system, the maximum speed on the drive and the use of the mobile when driving," said expert Horín.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activities of drivers to be a major threat to road safety," Hanzelka concludes with saying that road safety control is in the power of the police and work safety authorities.
Hope Düsseldorf is Frankfurt
There is no shortage of words in the letter of the WestLB Presidency to the employees of this bank.
The association of this Diesseldorf money institution with the dekfurtsk Deka-Bank will form "the central financial institution of the financial group responsible for the sale of capital markets", we will read in a letter received in the afternoon.
WestLB, according to the letter to this transaction, introduces "sud of competence" ensuring long-term results.
And such connections can actually be encouraging to other associations in the banking sector.
Such texts arise if they want the presentation in the challenging period to demonstrate the ability to agree.
The unstable WestLB is still under significant pressure.
Not only by the European Commission, but also by the Company's Office for the Monitoring of Financial Services, which the Government of the Republic of North-Westfalsk report that it is time to find a solution for the future is still pure.
The connection between the Deka-Bank, which customers share for its investment funds, and WestLB, whatever it may be, is still longer - even on the French side.
Chief Deka-Bank Franz Waas, when presenting the semi-annual economic results at the end of August, had heard that in his bankhouse in Mainzer Landstraße with some of the banks, such as the Helaba bank or WestLB, there was no sense.
The Deca-Bank Governing Council, which consists of one half of the Land Bank and one half of its partners, has, however, entrusted the Presidency with conducting talks with WestLB on joint business activities.
There could be trade on the capital market or their share.
However, the discussions began first, and the financial partners were involved.
Deka-Bank, whose 3000 employees belong to the most important employees on the financial market in Frankfurt, does not speak first in terms of consolidation in the business sector.
In 2003, it seemed that it would be possible to come to Deka-Bank's forum with Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz and Helaba's bank.
There was nothing at all from this triangle.
A short time after the Fuze's plans were publicized, the Hebala bank was represented by the Helaba Land Government.
Neither of the remaining banks agreed.
Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz will receive Landesbank Baden-Württemberg from Stuttgart instead.
And yet again, speculations about Deka-Bank's connection with the country's banks appeared again.
In recent times, however, Günther Merl, President of the Helaba Bank, has expressed negative thoughts about the speculation of his financial home.
It appears, however, that it does not depend on this assurance that the proximity of the various banks of the public sector is necessary.
Now, after the elections to the country's dream in Bavaria, BayernLB could start to develop its connection with the Landesbank Baden-Württemberg.
That's not the good news for Helabu.
If he should be forced to grow up, he will gradually come up with potential partners for such a connection.
In the south it would only play other voices, although the financial crisis is far better than the bank houses in Munich and Stuttgart.
The proposal with WestLB was again banned by Svaz from the Hessen-Thüringen railway and railway banks, which has a 50-percent share in Helabė.
In the light of this, it would be the new North LB.
The geostrategic perceptions of this kind are only one strange problem.
On the other hand, it is a question of how the trade models of individual institutions are very closely linked.
In June Merl stated that the question of which commercial model should be guaranteed by the future competitiveness of the Land Banks, Germany's competitor and iron banks did not answer at all.
It could also end with the distribution of WestLB, which of course nobody in this institution would expect.
It is therefore also discussed in the letter of the Danish Presidency that it is an "complex solution" for the entire bank house.
Yeah, and how it's possible to connect each single ingredient to Deka-Bank, it shows time.
The second weekend of October is known as "the weekend with Italy"
It's for Ellen first, for Luke's sake, or fourth.
But this time Elena will be his friend, and then everything will be different, she says.
After them, in the five-litre court of Kaiser's mark, there is a stronger driver and two tourist towers on the Oktoberfest show how deep tones can blow his throat.
Elena Lucu first dances and then he likes it.
They came to Verona from Bolon.
From here, from the bus park next to the port of Nuova, four buses will go out this evening at 23.45 a.m. with the name "Destinazione Monaco, festival della Birra", scheduled entry 6.30.
Three buses contain mainly Italy, one bus runs exclusively from Brazil.
In one corner of the park, these Jihoam Americans are already singing their flag, and they're celebrating the night.
And so loud, says Marco Guard, it's nothing for Italy.
Mark, who has a long cup of coffee with a face with a similar skin and glasses with a wide strip of silver, these three buses belong.
He's been traveling with them for five years to October, but he's only scheduled three exercises in the year.
In the night, in the middle of the room with a beer, at 22.30 a.m.
Nighting would mean just the rest of the cost, Marco says.
The road consists of 75 euros, including a welcome invitation to a beer Kaiser, which was made directly under the Bavarian law on the purity of beer, health insurance and German-speaking translators - Marco went to Frankfurt for a language course.
The bus leaves by night, on the road to Brennero.
The beer doesn't give up. Not yet.
The bus is fast dark, traveling asleep.
They're doing well, they'll still need their strength.
It is located in Brixena and Holzkirchen, where the number 8 points before Minichov on the street makes another stop and a lot of other buses with an Italian identification mark.
When Markova's group finally reaches the park near Theresienwiese, there are about 50 other buses from all over Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others gather, Marco has the last revelation, explains the plan of the attack.
First: Set up a yellow hat.
On the left is "Octoberfest", by the internet address of Marco's travel office: "konscersiviggiondo.it".
The other one says, "When they open the door to the living room, run!" Marco calls in the morning air.
"Run!" run and have seats in the last part of the apartment.
"Not before you don't break up, but not all the yellow hats on the same laveries, move around the space!"
It's 8 euros, 25 cents.
And don't forget the loss.
"Show the secretaries that we're being obedient.
As soon as you leave your homes, they are gone."
He will say, "This evening, just in half an hour, stay here again!" Do you understand?
And upstairs on Wiesn, the blue-state space.
On the road, one member of the group extends green hats as signs on trees, cedulas and even on the voluntary crying of one large bavor page.
You need to get ready for the exit.
I know the second weekend of October.
The exact details of the number of visitors are not available; they are talking about tens of thousands of people who travel across the Alps and fall into the blue states, ten percent of all visitors this week came from Italy.
The order of the minority police strengthens seven police officers from south Tyrol, Italy volunteers support the Bavarian Red Cross, which leads to national statistics in which Italy before Britain (about 60 reasons) and Rakushani (cca 80) have approximately 200 medical treatments.
Especially the favorite is Hofbra's apartment in Italy.
Nights of Peace for believers in Hippo Real Estate
Last week's Minister of Finance, Peer Steinbrück, stressed that the German banking system is relatively stable.
It is good that this policy used the word "relatively" and also included the fact that the German banking sector will not remain exposed to crisis developments.
'Cause it's about last weekend.
The index of Dax's monitored financial house specialising in the financing of the property of Hippo Real Estate (HRE) will receive from the German bank’s consolidated loan of several billion in the protection of turbulence on the market.
The person in charge of the situation on Monday told Reuters that the change in credit aid would go up to EUR 35 billion.
You will have to pay Hypo Real Estate (HRE) only from the actual amount.
Money comes from private and public banks.
In the back are the losses of the Dept's daughter company.
According to a recent report on long-term projects on which money was borrowed, this national finance provider has been extremely short-term refinanced, which is now impossible because of the lack of confidence in the markets.
In the first half of 2008, the Bank's reserve grew by 95 % to EUR 2.37 million, and the share of its own capital decreased by 1.6 per cent.
The normal and net profit from the financial transactions of the previous year was zero, the increased value of the search and certain securities, and the reduction of reserves for credit trading amounted to more than 70 per cent of EUR 5 million.
Only because of the higher returns from the subsequent accounting costs for the restructuring of the existing Depfa group and from the remuneration of interest under the tax regime and for the mediation of trade for the group companies, the interest rate on the side of the profit was still moderate.
The former state financer, after his privatization in 1990, slept on mortgages for farmers who were then excluded from the Aareal Bank service portfolio.
Because the classic state funding was too small, Deepfa was increasingly involved in infrastructure projects and co-financing of private investors and state-owned projects (Private-Public-Partnership, PPP) and was internationally differentiated.
From the value of its daughter company, Hippo Real Estate must now give up something and these reviews will have a "principal weight effect" to calculate the profit and loss of the entire group, as some have been left unscathed to hear.
The fact is, there's no division.
It has already been completed by two-thirds in 2007.
Hypo Real Estate has been a major financial asset for state and infrastructure projects since Depfa took over.
More than other institutions depend on refinancing on the interbank market, as there is no customer input.
After the fall of the American Investment Bank Lehman Brothers, two weeks ago, the Bank's loan was practically exhausted, because the banks are losing liquidity.
Hypo Real Estate needs a portion of the Depfa credit portfolio - about 50 billion euros - short-term refinancing funds.
According to the Hippo Real Estate Communication, the financial needs of this credit group for the period under review and the company is protected "before the impact of international monetary markets at the moment on significant levels of non-compliant functions".
Other sources have been allowed to hear that these funds have been refinancing by the end of 2009.
The Chairman of the HRE Georg Funke Presidency announced instead that the Hippo Real Estate Group will not have to use the money markets at that time.
The Bank and the Financial Services Supervisory Authority (BAFin) assume that the competitiveness of the Hippo Real Estate Group is now on the market.
This trusts shareholders and banks.
But with regard to the dynamics and uncertainty of the crisis, there is probably no certainty.
In fact, it's not even entirely excluded that the credit should not be completely broken.
But they can't get out of the way.
After the bank is late Monday afternoon, according to all the circumstances prior to the insolvency, it cannot be expected to be forward-saving, saved to rest with you.
The share rate fell by 75 per cent at EUR 3.30.
On the contrary, they were well held by compulsory courses.
While prioritial debts have not been fully understood, they have lost the ranks of secondary bonds more clearly.
This applies in particular to the existing Württemberg Hypo subsidiaries and to the logical bonding period after 2009.
The obligations of Hippo-Real-States originally seemed to be an alternative investment opportunity for speculants, but their stability is needed after the Bank’s crisis and the crisis of the institution itself which led it to the transfer of Depfa, depending on the stability of the international financial system.
As long as the issuers, governments and less qualified trading banks are willing to support the system, it is possible to calculate the cost of securities in their long term.
However, it can also come to what no one is currently expecting - the financial crisis will be overrun in the next 15 months.
However, in view of the report currently coming with this partial report, the likelihood of a barrier with certainty has now become only legitimate hope.
In particular, long-term creditors will certainly prepare a series of working nights when they decide whether to discharge their obligations.
Short-term investors may at least use the threshold to create a transfer of losses from previous accounting periods to the profit of the course years later for the purpose of future tax from capital benefits.
Sylvana and the secrets of the krabic bento
When the sixteen-year-old Sylvan Hiltrop's first day at the secondary school in Tacibana, girls begin to cry: this Germany is completely "kawai"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana already knows this word from a man, and on her new blog about the changeover, she tells about Japan.
"The first day in Japan.
Sir, I was nervous.
I've already been taken off the road to school.
I live in Tokyo on the way to Kawasaki and drive 40 minutes train to the central city of Tacibana.
I had to find my way alone, and luckily, I didn't lose.
It seems that the start of the tuition on Taciban is not as precise as our home in the Lower Saxony.
The students start meeting after eight hours and 20 minutes before the ninth starts a short stay with the teacher, i.e. 'home room'.
But before the study started, I had to introduce myself.
I'm not the kind of person who likes to talk to people, and then I'm a class of 40 students.
Because I haven't had a school uniform yet, I've taken an old dress of my host's moms, to that blouse, blue sweaters and black-haired boots.
So I put myself in front of a fight and tried to express myself correctly, 'Sajónara Wo still Sylvana...' - my name is Sylvana, I'm from Germany, and I'm born a week ago.
At that point, I was very happy that I had started learning the language two years ago.
All 31 halls in the class were shuffled, chicotola and mavala, and I still heard the word 'kawaii'.
I already knew that from my own minds.
She's looking for the basic vocabulary of Japanese girls needed for survival and means 'stomal, sweet'.
Then I'm going to jump fast to my place.
The Holka was very friendly with me, and she considered it a privilege to have a foreign student sit next to her.
The rest of the watch was relatively quiet, but when he called me a gong, I was completely asleep.
They talked to each other and chichotate themselves and asked me about possible and impossible -- and then it's very difficult to understand Japanese English.
Then all of them took off their belts.
My host mother also made me such a cake for dinner - and that's something else than a nice German wedding.
I had rice with bees, small vegetables, salad with corn and rice, fruit and something like fish in a tofu bag.
Most of the time, I don't know exactly what I'm doing here in Japan.
These things look special and taste quite new.
I'm sure everything's really good.
Well, maybe on the floor with a light on it, no!
Bents in Japanese schools are not just two.
Sometimes it happens that a girl will give the key to a specially prepared Bento, which in this case is specially adjusted by the artist, and hopefully the boy is well aware of the transition.
That's what I read in my comic book.
I'm wondering if I can see it here too.
'Why exactly Japan?' my friends asked me when I told them I wanted to go to school in Tokyo for a year.
Then I always said,
'Cause he's just freaking me out.'
At the end of the last few years, I've had the worst reading of manganese.
And to understand these comics and their culture better, I started learning Japanese once.
So it was very clear to me that I would have to come here once.
Because I also have a weakness for traditions, customs and habits.
And they're highly valued here.
On the one hand, Japan has the latest technologies and trends, on the other, is strict, disciplined and traditional.
And because everything is so well organized, I have never felt lost here, even though Tokyo is the biggest city I've ever seen."
And the cracks have feelings
If the cross or the snow escapes from danger, does it mean that they also feel fear?
Neurologist Joseph LeDoux is convinced that many animals also have feelings.
But how would it be possible to make sure that they feel the same when they behave like us?
In the online journal "Edge", the contributions of known scientists have been published for many years.
SPIEGEL ONLINE in its series presents selected answers to the question "What do you think is true without proving it?"
I believe that animals have feelings and other conditions of consciousness, without me or anyone else being able to prove it, if we can't prove that knowledge has other people.
But in this case, we can at least trust, because all human brains have the same basic configuration.
As soon as we start to hire another type and open up matters of opinion or general knowledge, we enter the uneven area, because hardware does not agree.
When the cross reaches danger, he does what many other animals do: he will pretend that he is dead, deaf, or blind.
People behave the same way that some scientists take for comparable subjective life.
I still don't believe that.
Two aspects of the brain structure facilitate the transfer of our subjective life to animal life.
However, it is because the processes associated with human knowledge are almost always included in the post-frontal cortex (because of its short-term memory and performance or management functions).
This vast area is developed in human beings far more clearly than in other primates, and it seems that it is entirely missing in other creatures.
At least in these aspects of our knowledge, which depend on the prefrontal cortex, among them the knowledge we are, and the ability to plan and decide, there is reason to believe that man differs even from the other principles.
Another dramatic feature could hide the language of a person: because it is so much of his opinion connected with his language, it is often said that knowledge depends on him.
In this case, we could expel animals.
But even if knowledge is not available in the language, the language would surely affect it, so the animal knowledge, whether it is already built, is probably different from most of our knowledge.
That's why it's difficult to find out how knowledge looks in other animals.
If, like something inside and subjective, we can't even measure, because of a particular hardware, analyze on the basis of our own experience, we're facing major problems.
Most of my sources relate to the content of scientific life, but there is yet another aspect of knowledge that should be scientificly accessible.
It would be possible to examine animals in the know-how regardless of their content, and that is exactly what happens in studies of short-term memory in primates, especially for example visualisation.
But this approach, which Christof Koch and Francis Crick fought, is more focused on the neuronal correlation of knowledge than on the causal mechanisms: both can be identical, but they should not be either.
It is interesting that this approach also highlights the significance of the non-frontal cortex for visualisation.
What does that make you feel?
I am exporting them from the fact that the emotional system, like the fear system, is activated in the brain by knowing its own activities.
What we define as "dangerous", then, is the mental state in which we find ourselves when the activity of a protected system located in the brain (or its effects as a physical reaction) uses operational memory.
From this point of view, the emotions are driven by the cortex areas that are marked for acceptance, especially people.
In combination with the language nature, it produces a pleasant reflection of thought, because with words and grammar we can distinguish and categoricalize the attitudes of each other, so that we can adapt them to ourselves and to each other.
On the other hand, Antonio Damasio, for example, believes that emotions arise from the most primitive activities in the cortex and brain cells of the committed body's senses, like Jaak Pankseep, who is more focused on the brain.
Because this network has not changed much during human evolution, it could have been able to share in the feelings of the many families concerned.
I can't answer it theoretically, but I think it's unproven.
Pankseep argues that what we feel in our skin and people like fear is probably both organisms alike: But how can it be verified, says Pankseep, do the crises and people feel the same when they behave similarly?
Does he feel afraid before danger?
From my point of view, it's not just a pattern of behavior that proves the harmony of life.
It's true that neuronal comparison continues to affect us: the cross and people have similar brain roots, on the contrary, not even the brain.
But is there a brain tumor responsible for feelings?
And even if it's possible to show it in a person, how would we want to show it in a cross?
I'm guessing that the cross and other councils, maybe even swabs (who knows?), have feelings.
But I really don't know how to prove it.
And since their feelings are likely to differ essentially from ours (because human knowledge is based on special traditions and language), I look at emotional behavior better than emotional perception.
In this case, however, we can expect progress at the neurological level if we measure the same in the cross and in the people.
Just like I don't know the language and the knowledge, I don't even know if they exist.
It's possible to make it short, but I'd rather take it before I get back to the wall again.
I'm a practical emotionalist.
President UEFA Platini: Lent of Mercy for Poland and Ukraine
The representative Prime Minister Ivan Vasjunyk said that the preparations will soon direct the president and Prime Minister.
"The government sees UEFA decision in Bordeaux as evidence of trust in Ukraine and its ability to organize ME with Poland," Vasjunyk said.
"But it's not amnesty for our country.
The news just started, and there's still much to do in both countries."
In the timely fulfilment of the time plan, the building or the stop of stadiums, streets, hotels and airports are inundated by both hosts.
It is even possible that the number of courses for ME is reduced from eight to six.
"We can't waste any more time.
We must now work as fast as possible," said President Grigory Sukkis of the Ukrainian Federation.
"UEFA will continue to follow us."
A more radical step has been agreed in Poland.
The ruling of the Polish PZPN was dismissed and replaced by independent administrator Robert Zawlock, after several scandals.
The Committee met at the request of Minister of Sport Mirosław Drzewiecke.
First, there is "the serious danger that PZPN will not be able to act according to rules," said the PAP PAP Polish printing agency Drewecki.
"The President of UEFA Michel Platini's letter has assured us that this step will not interfere with the preparations for ME 2012."
A number of teams from the first league had only been assigned in the past season because of the manipulation of the required composition, and it had to be finally immediately moved to the beginning of the league.
Persevered Dennis Quaid return officer
She wanted to publish a new film, talk about private things - and now she has problems with her ex: Hollywood Star Meg Ryan spoke about her former Dennis Quaid as a divorcer.
He's gonna scream and come back to the office.
The late war rages in the ex-wife couple Meg Ryan and Dennise Quaida: seven years after the divorce of these two Hollywood priests lead a bad fight - in front of the public air.
Meg Ryan, in an interview for the American magazine InStyle last week, first expressed her feelings for the shortness of his marriage: "Today was a long time of unfaithfulness, and it was very painful."
She first learned about the size of the causation until after the divorce.
The subject of this mental strip was the PR work of Ryan for her new film "The Women" - the story of a divorced marriage.
The reaction of Dennise Quaid on his presentation as an unfaithful husband was clear: "It's crazy," said a 14-year-old heretic in New York Daily News that "Mig repeatedly repeats the history of our relationship and manages it."
In addition, it is "political" that the sixtieth-year-old son of Jack again "publicly recalls the pain and radical changes that each child has to make."
While Ryan lives alone from his divorce, Quaid is again married and recently became a father to two.
He concludes his comments about the move: "My life goes on anyway.
I think I'm happy to have a wonderful family that's going to happen."
Flight prices and hotel prices vary
In the first half of 2008, the years and residence in Europe were lower than in the previous year.
In Germany, flights were even lower than 50 per cent according to one current study.
Flights and accommodation in hotels have been reduced again - this is the result of the study of American Express travel and financial services providers.
The company analysed its data on the reservations made in the first half of 2008 and found their express decline in the second quarter of the first quarter.
After several years of growing prices on the hotel market, housing in many places has already declined.
From January to March, prices grew in 41 out of 48 followed-up European cities by 6.9% compared to 2007.
However, prices have been below 3.6 per cent since the beginning of the last year.
The most outstanding was this trend in Paris and Rome, where travelers had to pay 30 to 37 percent less than in the previous year.
As a result of this trend, American Express considers a poor dollar course that has caused "the taste of American tourists to travel".
The price decline of hotels has also made it easier to reach a financial centre than the industrial centre, such as Hannover, Kolín over Rīne or Stavanger.
In this Norwegian city, the price of hotels increased by 26.3 per cent even the European record.
In the first quarter, the prices of the airport also showed an emerging trend:
As a result of Kerosin contamination, passengers in the Economics had to pay an average of 7.1 per cent more than in 2007, up to 29.2 per cent of the annual long-term fuel consumption.
From April to June, the prices of the airport in the Economics class ranged by 12.5 per cent compared to the previous quarter, however, in the Business and First-Class classes, changes in recognition were less pronounced.
In Germany prices have dropped even more clearly than in other European countries:
From January to March, it grew by 11.9 per cent, in the second quarter, by 23.6 per cent.
In German national years, according to the quoted study, prices dropped even about half.
One of the reasons for this price decline is a decrease in economic growth, explains the company.
The demand in many segments of the air transport market is uncertain.
On the other hand, there is an increased competitive pressure on the part of the Open Skies Agreement, which liberalised air transport between the United States and Europe.
A significant increase in the situation is the destruction of the unfavourable lines of air carriers as well as the high number of airlines that launched competition in the first half of 2008 - only 24 airlines in Europe.
HSV version Gladbach 1:0
Thanks to one brand and simple methods, Hamburger SV gets to the top of the table.
In Borussia, Luhuakia is still unable to establish a functioning unit.
Kristoffer Klein wrote - to increase Unfathomable accession to the representative of Marko Marina.
This player from Gladbach went into the game until he was late and failed with an exhilarating balloon on the floor.
His message was accurately explained and expressed from his mouth with conviction.
He just knew he was right.
"We need a second head," said Hermann Rieger on the way to the hamburgers' cabins.
It wasn't much done in catacombs, the gap between the seasons ended and most people again sat in their places.
Rieger was almost three decades of HSV physiotherapy and lived more respect than many minutes.
And that's how his request was heard at the place responsible.
Cornelius Jol, a coach assistant, was involved, and on the board, he pulled a stick.
Cornelius is the brother of the principal coach, Hamburk Martin Jola.
His command must have been the same: I am with the second floor!
There's no way to do it.
"Something happened here today on all the nicest," admitted Marcell Jansen later.
And Bastian Reinhardt would be "more relaxed."
At 1:0 (1:0) Hamburged thank-you header Mladena Petrice (11) and the circumstances that very weak Gladbashanes could not hurt the poor Hamburcians.
"It was a spinal victory," murmured Martin Jol.
Hamburger SV this Monday celebrates its 121-year existence.
On Saturday afternoon, the lovers celebrated themselves, blue sky over the air and a live updated videotape table in which their team was named as a premier.
They'll be born without a proper party.
"We know how to evaluate it," said Marcel Jansen.
It is clear that the current table result is more symbolic of the invisibility of the league than its HSV dominants.
The team with the late arrival of new players - Brazilians Nevese and Silvy, the Petrice branches and the FC Bayern obtained Jansen - is still few, but it is still not possible to close.
"We need more silence and more dribbling," said Joel frankly.
After the vote

Dark weight affects the flight of space probes
For years scientists have not known the advice with one fascinating phenomenon: the dark mood affects the speed of space probes during the so-called manoeuvre swing-by (gravitational practice).
Experts fear that the general theory of relativeity of Albert Einstein would not be entirely correct.
Almost 18 years ago, the Ulysses space probe flew into space.
The wine of the burning waters, which are already frozen, is now threatened by cold death.
Among scientists, for years one of the most fascinating phenomena is the loss - anomalies of gravitational work.
Gravitation work is an aircraft manager of space probes, where they get additional hypnotism in the gravity of some space body, such as Earth.
Thanks to that, the probes can save a lot of fuel.
The European-American research probe Cassini-Huygens used this physical trick as well as the solar probe Ulysses.
But what scientists have pointed out is that in this case, flying bodies do not act as a percentage of the human being expected under the old gravitational law.
On the contrary, it's going to be an irregularity in speed.
Sondy unexpectedly speed up or slow down.
In time, physics couldn't explain this effect.
They covered him with anomalies of gravitational work.
A number of experts fear that perhaps the general theory of relativeity of Albert Einstein, which describes the complexity of the volume of the covering space, would not have to be completely correct.
American physicist Stephen Adler from the Institute for Advanced Studies in Princeton is still convinced that Einstein did not arrive, and is trying to explain gravitational work with the help of so-called dark mass, whose presence in the universe has found astronomers.
"Responsive to this anomaly could be a dark amount which could also be found very close to Earth," he writes.
The universe researchers know about the existence of dark weights for about ten years.
It obviously comes from a gravitational force whose effect on the other universe is likely to be observed.
Rather, it itself is completely invisible, which means that it does not emit or emit any electromagnetic radiation, just or visible light.
According to scientists, this dark mass is a good fifth of the total mass of the universe.
In Egypt tourists are free
After ten days in the hands of their allies, the return to freedom is said by the Italian Foreign Minister in Egypt.
Imports from the Sudan have requested an amount of EUR a few million.
Six prisoners were killed in the shooting before they left.
Five Germans were invaded south of Egypt.
The deal with the ransom is already running.
The Germans are returning to the target of aliens.
WELT ONLINE brings you the most important cases.
The European tourist attraction to Sahar is according to all the freedom.
They reported on it on Egyptian state television, Arabic Al-Arab TV station and Italian media.
Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini, according to the report of the Italian TV station Sky TG 24 permits, confirmed: "Our fellows and other hands were released.
We're just checking their health status," Frattini said.
According to the Egyptian State TV report, five Germans, five Italians and one Romanian and also eight Egyptian leaders are fine and safe.
All 19 delegates to the desert are already on their way to Káhiry.
The unclear remains behind the shootings before the release of arms: According to the Egyptian security officer, the prisoners were prepared to end the strike before the Sudanese army had killed six of them miraculously.
"The problem was solved.
They agreed with the tax collector," said the quoted worker.
It's just, "It's just been taken care of by the hands," when that surprise came to us.
The Sudanese soldiers on Sunday in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt shot six refugees and two of them were killed.
In Germany, contributions were requested in excess of EUR 6 million; the money was to be handed over to the German wife of one of the hands.
The "El Masri El Jom" newspaper, calling on one of the German mediamen, pointed out that the release of arms is imminent because the prisoners are afraid of their safety.
According to this report, the defendants wanted to leave the woman's hand after payment of the ransom.

The abuse of my father led to suicide.
Several abuses by a father led a woman to kill herself to a court hearing.
After he admitted to eight cases of sexual harassment, seven - year - old Michael Trerise of Stithinas, in Cornwall, was sentenced to six years.
The Crown Court of Truro has heard that his own daughter, Stephanie Randle, had been in regular custody when she was between five and seven years old.
"I feel responsible for her death," Trerise wrote in a confession.
It was also said in court that Ms. Randle was killed in his home in Mutley in Plymouth on April 1, 2007, at the age of 34.
When she lived as a child in Coventry, Trerise took her to bed with her eyes and then abused her sexually while her mother worked at home.
Trerise and his wife were divorced in the '80s and returned to Cornwall.
His own daughter went to Plymouth.
However, before the trial, Ms. Randle, who spent a substantial part of her time as a volunteer for the National Trust organization, observed a pattern of abuse that she had been subjected to twice a week.
The complainant Ramsey Quaife pointed out that in 2006, Miss Randle's friends, who also committed a lot of surfing and cyclists, said that she was "emotionally dead" and that "life was gone".
In April 2007, her real father, Terrance Randle, found her dead in her apartment in Plymouth.
It turns out she's been hit by an impeccable knife.
Randle stood face-to-face to his own father, who wrote his daughter a knowledge that ended with the words: "I recognized her and sealed her eyes.
"I didn't abuse her.
I feel responsible for her death."
Judge Christopher Elwen Treris said: "You're an extremely curious fetisher and it must have been boring for your victim when she was only seven years old.
"This unpleasant story ends by the victim's taking life.
Even more dangerous is the fact that if she didn't do that, the thing would probably not have happened to the court."
"In particular, I would like to highlight the consequences of your crime to their daughter in those years," he added.
"Of course, otherwise she would probably be a promising, successful and happy young woman."
The officer who lost the data will be charged
The BBC was informed that the official who left the exact secret documents in the train in June would be charged under the State Secrets Act.
The man concerned left two exact confidential documents in the train at Waterloo when he was temporarily assigned to the Ministry of Defence.
The documents were delivered before the police were delivered to BBC.
This is at least a serious violation of the said law and does not mean a criminal purpose.
The BBC Secretary for Defence Affairs Frank Gardner said this would be amazing for many in Whitehall.
"They probably thought that the matter would be settled within the Ministry and the Office of the Government," he said.
An employee who must not be named shall be charged under section 8.1 of the relevant law, which is clauses that provide protection of information.
The complainant recommended that the Metropolitical Police report on the very sensitive nature of his work in the Joint Intelligence Committee.
The documents that he forgot included the secret analysis of Al-Qaida and the possibilities of Iraqi security forces.
He was informed of the decision on Monday morning and was moved from house to place.
B&B social foundations
British social funds may need to be provided with more than 80 million pounds after saving Bradford & Bingley's bank.
The government has provided 2.6 million customers in Bradford & Bingley 14 billion pounds.
The loans will be paid to all companies carrying customer funds, including 59 corporate funds.
The Director-General of the Association of Societies (BSA) Adrian Coles said that he is "supply", that he is responsible and that his members must pay.
Four billion dollars will finally be paid for saving the Bradford & Bingley mortgages.
However, the interest between them will be paid every year by all 700 financial companies that bear customer charges.
The BBC Compensation Fund confirmed that all 59 pools are based on this number.
It's encouraging that these institutions that have acted seriously... now have to pay some of the accounts of those institutions that have not been so serious.
Adrian Coles, BSA
He said that each company should pay in proportion to the revenues that it held, and that it should pay about 18 % of its prices.
The Ministry of Finance estimates that the increase from the debt increased in 2009 to 450 million pounds.
This means that the depositors will have to find 81 million pounds to pay interest rates from the first year.
Adrian Coles, Director-General of the Association of Social Affairs, told BBC that he is convinced that it is not fair.
"It is a shame that the institutions that have maintained considerable respect during the enlargement of the housing market now have to pay some of the accounts of those institutions which have not been so significant."
According to the BSA, there has been no case since 1945 when it appeared.
"We will have to examine all aspects of this matter in the next few weeks to see what opportunities are to protect social foundations and their members before an account that could be essential," said Cole.
The period paid in 2009 covers seven months from the end of the summer to the end of March.
In 2010 it will pay the rent for the entire year and it could be almost twice as many.
In view of the fact that the social foundations are participating organisations without shareholders, this account will eventually be paid to their members through higher payments or lower interest rates on their accounts.
Milk is about five pens per litre
People in Jersey may have to pay more for milk.
Dr. Jersey announced that since Monday, the price of her milk has increased by five pounds per litre.
This year is the second growth in prices, after double taxation, and comes after research by the consulting company.
The retailers must decide whether they want to reflect on customer prices.
Before the autumn growth, the wholesale price of milk from Jersey was finally changed in 2002.
Prison for the Bangladeshi expressr suspended
The Bangladeshi court denied the application of former Prime Minister Shajch Hasiny Vazid's release to prison, which means that if he returns to his office, he can be arrested.
Her lawyers said that the court refused to release her to prison because she was accused of being expelled from a certain company over $10 million (729,700) when she was a prime minister.
The case is one of several charges of corruption against her.
Chálid Zija, a long-term political rival of the Shajch Hasiny, was released this month on bail.
Shajch Hasina has to return to Bangladesh for the next few weeks, but her party, the League of Lida (Awami League), asked the local army to grant her full freedom for the first time.
The authors say that while she was released in a honourable manner so that she could enter a foreign medical prescription, it is not clear under the conditions of her release whether she will remain free when she returns to Bangladesh.
Her lawyers say that now they are calling against the Supreme Court against the Supreme Court.
"The Supreme Court has denied the request of Shajch Hasiny for a conviction that he does not need a prisoner when he is already conducting an investigation on a press release," her prosecutor Rafique-ul Huq said.
"We shall appeal against the regulation of the Court of Justice."
Her lawyers claimed that she needed a vaccine to get back from abroad because of the preparations for the prosthetic elections.
The High Representative of Lid's League said Shajch Hasin has to return home on October 17.
It was held a year after the military was taken seriously by the interim government, but it was released from prison in June so that it could go abroad for medical reasons.
Shajch Hasina and Chalda Zija both refuse all charges against themselves.
Fear of Waiting Against Oppression in Afghanistan
According to the UN, nearly 200,000 children have not participated in a recent widespread campaign against the armed forces associated with Taliban.
The UN has been expecting in six provinces last week.
However, she says that for safety reasons she could not have access to children south of Helmand and Kandahhar.
The OSN said that this was the case, even through the Taliban's promise that it will not attack or protect thousands of desperate workers.
BSkyB lost court dispute on ITV
BSkyB won a court dispute on the review of the Commission's decision on economic competition, which the company ordered to reduce its share in the competitive sending of ITV.
The BSkyB Court of Appeal indicated that it would reduce its share in ITV of 17,9 % under 7,5 %.
In the past, the Commission announced that BSkyB had engaged in a competitive war and had a significant impact on ITV.
BSkyB was purchased in 2006 in a trade that therefore prevented the company NTL, now called Virgin Media, to buy ITV.
In April 2007, the Court of Justice announced that the acquisition of part of the ITV BSkyB led to doubts about the independence of the ITV and called on the Commission for an economic competition to initiate an investigation.
The Chief of the Virginia Consortium Sir Richard Branson, consumer organisation and regulator of Ofcom were all opposed to the purchase.
BSkyB argued that the forced reduction of its share in ITV was incomprehensible and as a solution to disproportionate - in particular because BSkyB had previously said that it was willing to give up its voting rights.
New investigation of American lawyers' affiliations
The US Secretary-General appointed a special applicant to investigate the release of nine American lawyers in 2006.
This was the case when the report on the case by the High Inspector of Justice of the Ministry of Justice criticised the activities of the government officials.
The report criticized the officials of the White House, the lawyer and former minister of justice Albert Gonzalese.
The investigation was prompted by fears that lawyers were removed for political reasons.
The special appeal of Nora Danneh will now be examined whether the officials of the hearing during the investigation were lying to the investigators with a view to gaining justice.
General Inspector Glenn Fine stated in the report: "The serious claim, including potential criminal conduct, was not fully examined or explained."
The appointment of a special applicant with the right to testify was one of his key recommendations.
The team started when the U.S. Ministry of Justice released nine American lawyers in December 2006.
At the time, the Ministry indicated that lawyers were released because of poor performances.
However, it was later shown that the release of lawyers was not considered to be worse than many of their colleagues, which led many observers to conclude that the release was politically motivated.
Some of the lawyers were involved in the high-ranking movement of established Republican Members and senators, others refused to investigate complaints against Democrats.
U.S. lawyers are investigating and causing complaints in court cases for the government.
They may be released at any time, but they must not be removed for political reasons.
Today's head of the Ministry of Justice, Mr Alberto Gonzales, has come under fire and has finally refused.
The number of other representatives of the Ministry of Justice has also declined.
The report of the General Inspector General was very critical of Gonzalez's role in the affair, saying that he did not send "main responsibility" for letting "abdicate" from his leading position and in action "not necessarily committed".
Other officials, including former High Bush adviser Karl Rove, were criticized for not cooperating in the investigation.
Meat Loafovo will be evaluated
The Rock Star Meat Loaf will receive one of the Q Awards for its epic Himmnon Bat Out Of Hell.
A song that, for its special golden price, comes to the ceremony next weekend in London, said that it was "stupid" with recognition.
The writer, who takes nine minutes and twelve seconds, was a titled Meat Loaf's lead album from 1977.
The nominations for the annual year lead the Coldplay group, which has been selected in four categories.
Paul Rees, chief editor of Magazine Q, said: "There are some songs that stand over such things as time and jealousy, and Bat Out Of Hell is certainly one of them."
A writer written by Jim Steinman needed a great vocalist who provided Meat Loaf.
She started an instrument part that lasted almost two minutes.
The song was published in Britain in 1979 as a single and was most popular in the fifteenth place.
But Meat Loafovo's album Bat Out Of Hell held around nine years in the hive and sold it around the world more than forty million copies.
Meat Loaf - a real name Marvin Lee Aday - has endured health problems in recent years, and in 2003 he was injured because of an irregular heart rate after he fell on the floor.
In 2007, the acute laryngitis forced him to break down the concert.
Later, it turned out that he had voice cancer.
Street cover, often forgotten and possible soon for sale
New York City has thousands of roads, roads, distances and other underground communications, some famous, others just useful.
But even many tax collectors and long-term locals are having trouble finding Extra Place, mostly because they never heard of it.
This small street is in the fourth East Village and leads north from the First Street - without reaching the Second Street - between Bowery and the Second Avenue.
At the width of about ten and a half feet [4 m], it remembers a broken passage more than a transport tunnel.
There's no sign of the street name.
In normal atlas, it's practically invisible.
Still, he's got a street fan.
For example, Avalon Bay company, the developer recently built luxury buildings on the First Street.
He wants to redesign and create a clean way to shops and shops that have to open up in new buildings.
Other surprises are the long-term neighbors who say that they were hit by the street just because it was one of the last remaining ones since the block was stolen.
However, the City Agency for the Protection and Development of the Constitution, which has the streets in its power, shall not be at least interested in maintaining it.
At the meeting of the Land Committee of the present Community, the representatives of the City Authority and the Avalon Bay company planned to buy a street developer.
However, according to Suzan Stetzer, the Executive Director of the General Community 3, the Committee shall prioritise this option when the streets remain in the hands of the city and shall request a new plan which should be submitted next month.
"The city already owns only a very few lands, and we would like Extra Place to remain in its ownership," she said.
"There may be proposals for correction and management, which Avalon might do, but we also want to guarantee public access."
Avalon Bay announced a few months ago that he wanted to take a little street to go out and set up places for the meeting, some of which would use a coffee shop, whose interest in renting the developer's room is waiting.
The idea that Avalon Bay could buy the street was first published at the meeting this month.
Michele de Milly, who speaks Avalon Bay, said that although the company wants to use the streets, she doesn't want to own it properly.
"The main purpose of Avalon Bay is to make this loose street and make it a beautiful place for the public," she said and added that the sale proposed a city.
Seth Donlin, a spokesman for the Agency for the Conservation of the Constitution, said that the city of income wanted to sell the street, and he insisted that his office's property was more developed than repair.
Compared with his more colorful neighbor, Bowery, Extra Place left in the history of a small step.
Some people think that the street got its name in 1802, when the great farm of Philip Minthorna was divided among several of his children, and on that hard-on-country village no one made a threat.
The rear door of the CBGB, a punctured monument, was opened in 2006, and the street may be the most famous as the back of the photo on the side album of the Ramones "Rocket to Russia".
"This place was wonderful," says Danny Fields, manager Ramones, who took the photo in November 1976.
"There were lots of wastes, broken clothes and bars of bars, posters, letters and exercises."
Some local bloggers, including bloggers, who write about the landing of the fourth East Village, are opposed to the idea of selling Extra Place and asserts that they are the cousin of the public property to be hidden so that he should remain public.
Others consider Extra Place to be a rare - almost unchanged castle of the city, which should be left as it is.
Jeremiah Moss, who writes a blog called Jeremiahašov, who lives in New York (with the title "The Book of the Songs: The Nostalgic View of the City in the Measuring Process"), added part of the story of the Extra Place from the book About the City, published in The New Yorker in 1952.
The author of the article, Brendan Gill, wrote: "Extra Place is a narrow dark street, dark and in the day and protected by rare railway doors and closed windows, where the old news week runs through the streets."
As for a few exceptions, the street of one recent night seemed completely the same.
Krysa walked through the dark end of the street near the door, which sometimes led to CBGB, where today's trade with expensive clothes is on.
The roof had graffiti, and next to the pure dose of the frozen news, there was an empty bed of beer.
A couple of years ago, he said that he was thinking of the Extra Place, but he suggested that he could get married.
On the contrary, Fields said that he thinks some people underestimate the relevance of the street in its current state.
"The best years of my life," he said, "were in dark, tired and opposed places."
Bilingualism debate: confusion in English
In this publication, Bruce Fuller and Lance T will discuss the existence of candidates for bilingual education.
Lance T. Isumi, a californic academic worker and director of the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is a co-author of the book "Greater than you think: why the middle class needs to choose schools".
Effectively expressing the Spanish volleyball is a huge concern.
The educational agenda Baracka Obama only proves.
The Obama campaign states that "afro-American and Spanish students are essentially less likely to study than white tears," which is true.
In order to fight with such effective differences, Obama's educational agenda, in particular, "external bilingual education" for those who learn English first.
The question of Baracka Obama remains whether his commitment to bilingual education, based on the use of languages other than English, is not stronger than his interest in reducing performance differences.
We'll take the Sixth Street Prep, a charter base school in the Los Angeles era.
In most of Spain’s low - income families, these schools are very poor.
More than a third of the students from whom many of them came recently learn English first.
Nevertheless, in the 2008 national math tests, it reached the highest level of the unliquidated percentage of the fourth grade.
At the same time, 19 percent of the fourth grade's sugars were obtained at the highest level in the English-language national tests and literature.
This incredible success was achieved by another method that Obama prefers.
Sixth Street highlights control and promotion, continuous consideration of abilities and access without any explanation.
Next, and Obama should observe this, according to Lindy Michaels, director of Six Street, a pedagogical school approach for those who are taught English first, "full confusion."
The exposure to english highlights the almost excellent use of english in education.
Ms. Michaels, who's against bilingual education, said to me, "We've had a huge success with a whole new boat from Mexico - after twelve months you'd come to class and don't know what it is."
"It works," she declared, "it works for us."
Would Obama take school like Sixth Street Prep for a sample, how should other schools look with large proportions of Spanish and English students?
The results achieved by the school should be made clear in response to this question, but the educational agenda of its own party (the National Association for Education is a long-term bilateral education) and its own consistent support for bilingual education do not explain the Obama response.
While Obama agrees that the visitors should learn English, he recently tried to trivialize things when he declared that people should stop taking care of "only English" laws.
Instead, "you should make sure your children speak Spanish," he said.
If Obama really has to clear out the performance differences, he should think more about the educational models that are working, more carefully than to laugh and triviarate them.
Rope peaches due to repeated economic concerns
The prices of roses in the autumn were high because I am afraid that even an American plan to save financial markets would not make the economy live.
The prices of hot-rolled goods were cut in early trading on New York’s comic book, up to 7 per cent at $99.80 per barrel.
Since last Monday, the price's been worth more than $220 for the bar.
In the past two weeks, markets with comedians have been torn down by financial disturbances on Wall Street and also by two powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After reaching a maximum of $145.29 per barrel in July, prices fell to nearly $90 per barrel this month, which also resulted in massive financial market uncertainty.
The debt again fell to investors in the afternoon, and after the presidential announcement of the Congress reached agreement on the weekend with regard to the greatest saved plan in history.
This report was inspired by sincere concerns that the financial crisis is far from over.
In the latest episode of the settlement, the government announced that the Citigroup was buying the Banking Division of the Wachovia Corporation.
Among the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments, the European financial conglomerate fortis has been partially established.
The analysts of Barclays Capital said that the surviving weekend, which led to a plan to save the economy, "is shown to be impossible to revive market governance".
As the economic situation deteriorates, demand for comedians, including roses, is expected to decline.
"Studies for markets with global shares, interest rates and exchange rates have been strongly detected," wrote analysts from Deutsche Bank in the report to investors.
"We believe that comedians will not be able to avoid the consequences.
From a comedian perspective, it is our greatest age, to what extent the American virus spreads around the world and especially in China."
This bank's analysts mixed their expectations for the next year, as the consumption of rice was slowing down due to economic growth and reduced their gas prices by about 20% in 2009.
In the second quarter, a divorcée ride crossed the team record
After he spent the last eight season in the Jets dress, more than anyone else, the defensive player Shaun Ellis thought he had seen everything.
Then, on Sunday, he watched the development of the second quarter, where Jets changed the free game in Spanish driving.
"I've never seen anything like this," said Ellis.
The second quarter began after Jets and Cardinals had created their lost game with the nightmares of darkness over them.
After quarterback Brett Favre sent Laveranue Colese to a 12-year-old touchdown sprint, which he successfully predicted the afternoon, in which their progressive development cooperation took place over miles in advance.
Favre sent Colise in this quarter after the other two touchdowns, including the impact of the cornerback, and the next 10 seconds before half of the attack.
"It was nothing extraordinary," said Favre about all his coles' toys.
"It's a fucking good player.
We've been able to communicate with each other so that people can think of anything."
While Favre and Cole are housekeepers, they defend the Cardinals Kurta Warner's quarterback.
Cornerback Darelle Revis caught a bad hole and brought it back for 32 yards on touchdown.
Safety Eric Smith printed another puzzle and captured it.
Linebacker David Bowens gave Warnera k fumblu.
The last loss of the sword, the fumble that Bowens removed may have been the best.
The Cardinals team got to the game 10 Tuesday before the end, and after Jets got the sword back, the Jay Feely 20-year-old head from the field, where he got the 34-0 leadership.
That's what Jets got in one quarter.
When Judge Jets Eric Mangini was called to describe this madness, he said, "The second quarter, or the third quarter?"
When he was told that both - Jets were allowed in the third quarter of 21 points without answering - Mangini said, "I can tell you that the second quarter I enjoyed much more than the third.
The fall of many points in a short time."
Gebreselassie has improved his world record
Haile Gebreselasie from Ethiopia once again showed why many consider him the best long run ever when on Sunday in Berlin, he passed his own world record and became the first man who ran 26.2 miles of long race in two hours and four minutes.
The victory on a pleasant flat track at 2:03:59 turned 27 seconds his previous time 2:04:26, which ran last year in Berlin.
Gebreselassie, who is 35, created the 26th world record of his career, which is really incrediblely wide - overcome the world record or at least is the master of the world on all distances from the metric mile to the maraton.
The last month of Gebreselassie left the Olympic marathon in Beijing, because fear - from a retrospective viewpoint may be too alarmed - that the polluted air will expose its problems with asthma.
Instead, he promised to run to Berlin.
In almost perfect conditions - the sun and 48 degrees at the start, 55 degrees at the end of the week - blessed Gebreselassie with a bright average of 4 minutes and 43 seconds per mile.
As for runners like Gebreselassie and Paul Tergat from Kenya focused on further traversing, a marathon record was held in the past decade over two minutes since Ronaldo da Costa from Brazil won in Berlin at 2:06:05 in 1998.
After a Sunday victory, Gebreselassie told reporters that he had two weeks earlier in July and left the train for a week.
He's obviously more likely to wake up than she's holding.
"I'm so happy," said Gebreselasie to reporters.
"Everything was perfect.
I started again a week ago, and I was a little lost today, but everything was fine."
He was also criticised - mainly in Kenya, the East African river Ethiopia - because he planned his race first, generally avoided the world's marathons, depended on the driver as if it were a race race race, and created world records of the meaning of competition.
But this criticism can make it difficult to reduce Gebreselasian's enormous running quality.
Held at the time of four Kenya arrived at the Gebreselasse half of the time at 1:02:04.
After their departure, two elite runners James Kwambay and Charles Kamathi were chased by the remaining Gebreselas.
About something before three months before the goal of Gebreselassie finally took and fled Kambai, who then got to second place at 2:05:36 and thus improved his personal maximum of about five minutes.
Kamathi finished the third time at 2:07:48.
In the race, the woman finished her special year at the seventh fastest time of history 2:19:19 Irina Mikitánková, a cousin from Kazakhstan, who is now a German citizen.
Record time 2:15:25 keeps Paul Radcliff from Great Britain.
Six-year-old Mikitánk's amazingly praised the moon on the lake in London's marathon at 2:24:14.
Peking games ran out of something that was described as being hurt back, but she ran and won in Berlin and in the third maraton, which when she ran, improved her personal maximum for about five minutes.
She ran the race smartly and thought: she left four Ethiopian and Kenyan runners to a large race and then got about 18 1⁄2 miles.
Askale Tafa Magarsa from Ethiopia reached 2:21:31 and Helene Kiprop from Kenya ended the third time at 2:25:01.
The roots and obstacles to the lives of the blacks in a divided city
Hidden among the spacious fun parks of Greater Orlando, a few miles from all the small, semi-trailed and decorated, lies a quiet city in which the pride and generosity of African life live.
Eatonville, the first completely black city to be included in the state and where Zora Neale Hurston spent his childhood, is no longer as simple as he wrote in 1935: "The city of five lakes, three croquets, three hundred snowy skins, three hundred good sailors, a supply of quays, two schools and no prison."
Now it's a quiet place.
Alice Walker, Tony Morrison and Ruby Dee came to the annual Eatonville Festival of Zora! to make a gift from Hurston, the most famous female writer of Harlem's renaissance.
The city he described remains a stranger, even though it has made a stop for tourists by including it with the Floridian tourist leader created by the Federal Writers project during the economic crisis.
It's still as independent, decent and private as it was in the three-year-olds when Hurston wrote that the blacks in Florida had often gone off and not shared their real feelings with a white man who "knows us so little that he doesn't even know what's going on."
And today, in the year when the Swedish presidential candidate, Senator Barack Obama, calls for an open discussion of race, many more citizens remain cautious about foreign views.
"We pay great attention to how our story relates," says 59-year-old Hortense Jones, who lives here from birth and is a member of the city's oldest farm.
"It must be right."
Eatonville has long been characterised as a paradox triumfu and namahy.
It's like a historical model of the Black rise, so the community is almost 2400 people, where the measure of poverty is bilaterally distributed to the international average.
It is a medium literature, but it is also a deeply rooted example of South American foreign black culture - sometimes despised, sometimes praised - which has resulted from American childhood.
It's not too surprising that the older citizens are like the mountains, so protective.
And the age of Eatonville actually started when Zoro, which is the only way that Hurston is said to be here.
She introduced to the world her native city through the heart books full of lies such as "Mules and Men" (1935) and "Their Eyes We Watching God" (1937).
Five points of the Floridian tourist tour guide changed the city of Kosek to road No. 17, which leads through the often mentioned center of Florida, in the bottom of the Black History and Human Drama.
With the exception of a big bug in life and in literature, Hurston's reader entered the first Eatonville Age trade, Joe Clark, and then turned to personal places.
"Left by the train," she wrote, "it's a white-headed modern national school with well-kept courts and churches that always old Howard Miller, even though he can't read or write."
She also mentioned the new widow of Dash's widow and wrote that Lee Glenn "produces all kinds of drinks and even anything that fits into the hour hotel."
So in just a few hundreds of words, Hurston Eatonville preached with self-control, but also with a lack of grammar, reconnaissance of dreams and sex.
This was obviously not the typical loading of Fodor's.
Actually, it wasn't a portrait that everyone would appreciate.
"Now she said it as it was," says 19-year-old Ella Dinkins, one of the Johnson's girls' congregation that Hurston did to the immortals by quoting men who sang loud songs about their beauty.
"Some people didn't like it," she added.
In Hurston it is still remembered as a Cyprus average, which often returned after her family moved to the Florida Jacksonville.
Seventeen-year-old Augustus Franklin recalls that most of the time she joined the city, she grew up without a statement in the vast Chevrolet, burned and wore pants in the city, which is even today proud of a decent dress.
Most of the citizens were fascinated, Franklin said, but many were confused.
"The people of Zoru always liked to see," Franklin said.
But, in addition, he hopes to sit on the back terrace with a view to the island of Sabelia, where Hurston's most likely got baptized, "never stayed too long."
When Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and her books were cut out of print.
It seemed that Eatonville, together with the rest of the world, forgot about her.
Although she was once a literary star, the contemporaries of Langston Hughes and the only Blackman at Barnard College in the 20th century, she was buried in an unmarked grave in the Florida Fort Pierce, where she had lived before.
In Eatonville, there were no larger sensitivities or large public readings.
"I think neither of its meaning for the world nor of its reference," said Valerie Boyd, author of the life story of Hurston's "Wrapped and Rainbows" published in 2003.
The change came in the 1980s in the 20th century.
The representatives of the Orange County period wanted to take over the city of the five-pronged road instead of Kennedy Boulevard, which is the local double main road.
The settlement of the Netherlands has already attacked the national border No. 4 across the western part of the city.
The proposal came at a time when Eatonville was still getting from a complex historical period.
The forced integration, together with other things, ended relatively the ideal isolation of this community.
In the 20th century, the struggle against racism led to hatred for the rights of the community.
"At that time, a party of white boys, they came and picked up the moving and stuff on the people who sat on the side," Franklin said.
"We actually had one woman who killed it.
They walked out of the car with melon."
In a letter from The Orlando Sentinel in 1955, the Supreme Court's claim for the promotion of integration and its decision in the Brown case against the teacher's education chamber stated that "for my race it is more impressive than the celebration."
The population now claims that the deregregation of school, even though in some areas it was positive, reduced the consistency of Eatonville and reduced the flow of youth.
"The Black Children were used to the object - I remember it - you beat your teacher in the morning, you beat your teacher at night," said N. Y. Nathario, daughter Elly Dinkins and executive director of the non-profit group Preserve the Eatonville Community (Zachranjte Eatonville Community).
It lasted until teachers and tears came out of the same place.
"You don't care about your white teacher, because your white teacher - I mean there's a cultural barrier," said Mrs. Nathiro.
However, civil law has helped create space for many more Zory Neale Hurstons - black writers, priests and artists, who as she was raised above prejudices with ease of conscience and quotes such as "How can anyone kill my presence?
I don't understand."
In 1975, Alice Walker moved to the unknown grave of Hurston and began to fight for her story.
Five years later, he came to the police in the bookshops, a respected life-book by Robert E. Hemenwaye, who re-entered it into the American canon.
The project with the distance reached right away when the most famous daughter of Eatonville again found the light of the ramp.
The former neighbours of Hurston now considered her a savior.
To show what can happen to its remoteness, the community began planning the Hurston Festival in 1988.
Thousands of fans came to the inaugural action two years later, and every summer many return to the celebration.
After a few years, the state withdrew from the distant proposal.
"These five passes of distance rose up, you would say that it just blew up, a real civil pride," Nathiro said.
Boyd's just said, "Now she saved Eatonville."
The victory over the remote project helped change the city's image.
Unlike Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who started to go to a higher church in 1993 began to appear in a larger number, and citizens began to overestimate the past.
Eatonville joined the National Historical Register in 1998.
The new Single Book (also called after Hurston) was opened in 2006 to re-opened and completed by Kennedy Boulevard.
Today, Eatonville remains a floral anomalies: only six miles from the centre of Orlando can sometimes be seen as a western street in the summer rain as small as when it was founded with only 27 black families in the 18th century.
(Today is 90 percent black.)
With foreigners who come to look for the story and the meaning of Eatonville, it is still widely practiced.
Allowance for most of the conversations is necessary to have certain things ahead and - such as fixed furniture in the oldest Eatonville church, which painted whites and painted blacks in the fields - must not be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, such as Jones, a courageous, self - sacrificing teacher who likes the blue net, still fear that their isolated community will not be properly understood.
And as Hurston's festival grew, domestic pride also increased.
In particular, young people tend to see Eatonville as Hurston saw his entire race: beautiful, with problems and yet not better, not worse and worse, creative, laborious, travel and diversity as other American races and ethnic groups.
From the voice of Franklin's son, Edwin Harvey, he expresses his sincere love for the village when he plans to return to Eatonville after high school to work in the local government or in the police, who says she would benefit from some help.
And even younger, for example, one-on-one couple from Winter Park Alondra and Alexia Kenonov seem to have learned to describe Eatonville correctly.
"Most people, when they just walk there, think, 'Hm, this city is nothing against the others,' said Alondra Kenon recently after the church.
"But if you really stop and look for a moment in history, it's a very nice place."
Here in New York, we're talking about all the rain money.
Nothing has changed in the first place.
If tourists in Manhattan were to stay away from the news stations and the TV screens on Times Square, they wouldn't realize they were in the middle of the storm.
They would never agree that, in the exploding role of offices over their heads, every day the bankers and investment fund managers who monopolize New York, have the worst "bad day in office" since the 1929 crisis.
The passengers are still counting the truck on the train and transport the muffin bags to the breakfast meeting.
The Spaniards continue to cross between the pigs and carry, like human beads, dozens of magnificent beads that rise from the whales on their back.
The office crossings are still waiting at the front of their early luggage in street dining rooms, and it is still not possible to meet on every day of the yellow taxi between the fourth and seventh afternoons.
It didn't seem like a crisis until I decided to put myself in the balance of the next afternoon with all the pessimism.
Even though I've been spending time with this task so that I can hide with my afternoon seat on my local JP Morgan Chase, there were about twenty people waiting at the front.
Not before the stocking windows to pull up or put in stock, but before the delay where the elderly clients order checkbooks, tourists ask themselves on their way to trade with the mixed Macy's product and new customers are charging accounts.
Most of the people in front of me, as I learned from Star, my "licensed personal banker", came for the same reason as me.
However, they have already chosen their savings from smaller banks in places, such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania, or Staten Island.
They chose money from the so-called trypsies (a little like a construction company), money companies, and from those types, whose branches operate only in one state, who claim to care for their customers as family.
In the past year, 15 such banks have been downcast.
A few days ago, Washington Mutual, a bank with assets of $327 billion, went to the competition, and when New Yorkers returned home on Friday evening, another bank, Wachovia, with assets of $440 billion, tried to catch the rescue buyer.
The employees of the offices and shops who stood before me and feared another thief moved their readiness to the bank, which is considered a safe haven and which makes most of the storage on Wall Street.
In the past week, ordinary New Yorkers have learned to manage their own finances.
A woman in my local Chinese supermarket spoke on the phone and spoke to Lehman Borthers, the detached bank, and to her lost top executive, Dick Fuld, with family ties, such as if she had been on the line with her colleague.
And Lynn, the uniformed rose of my cousin's basement, changed the theme of our usual conversation - Brad, Angelines, or my food.
After my visit to the bank, she told me, "I now have my savings in the funds of the money market.
I moved it, I won't risk it."
Muslim horrors have been brought to justice by the Racquesian Right.
Heinz-Christian Strache, on the left, from the French Free and Filip Dewinter from the Belgian legal party Vlaams Belang, presented in Antwerp on Thursday, 17 January 2008, the "City Against Islam".
The cables are not similar to the transport signs that reflect the mixture of the cross-border red hat.
The police accuses the legal extremists of rebuffing the Muslim Serbs in Rakousk on the same weekend, in which extremely legal parties have achieved huge gains in general elections.
Over 90 graveyards in the town of Traun near Linze were sometimes between Friday evenings, and this morning the police were convinced that an organized action was being planned.
The Vinians have resisted certain horrors of Jewish symbols, such as David’s star, but detectives are convinced that this could be an attempt to mask the motives of extremists led by hatred toward Muslim immigrants.
It's not clear whether this incident was proposed by the elections.
The former Islamic communities said that they are "deep shock" reports of the quake that will occur at the time of the end of the Muslim post-Muslim month of Ramadan.
In the meantime, Rakuusko enters the car looking for his own soul after the transport in previous parliamentary elections.
Both national legal parties, who received more than 30 per cent of the votes, the Free and Swiss parties for the future of Rakouska, led a campaign against immigration and some of their slogans were regarded as xenophobic.
Heinz-Christian Strache, president of the Free Party, who received more than 18 per cent votes, protested against the Shaks and the Burk in the campaign, even expressing his opposition to the food in which the relationship to Islam was involved.
At the last meeting with the voters in Vienna, he spoke of "European brotherhood", which should prevent the entry into Islam.
Both parties are trying to ban the construction of muses and minerals and argue that these are political symbols of Islamist Islamism in Rakouska and Europe.
Studies and analyses conducted immediately after the elections, which have placed extreme rights in the country's most violent political block, indicate that these changes have been made by young people who care about their future in the European Union.
Gary Glitter is not allowed to travel by borders
Gary Glitter, a glamorous star who was sentenced to sexual abuse of children, ordered the court to travel to France and Spain.
The officials passed this six-month order on Glitter after informing the monitoring authorities that he was planning to leave France to Spain.
The Kents police had agreed to this order on a visit last Thursday after giving the officials evidence of Gliter’s previous sexual abuse of children.
Glitter, in his own name, Paul Gadd, did not participate in the hearing of the Ashford smallest criminal court in Kent, but was represented by lawyers from Corker Binning.
The speech court said: "On Thursday 25 September at Ashford's lowest criminal court, the county police asked for a regulation that would prevent Mr. Paul Gadd from crossing the border to France and Spain until 25 March.
Paul Gadd did not participate personally."
64-year-old Glitter informed the authorities that he was first going to a stranger to get a record in the register of sexual assaults.
He must inform the authorities if he wants to travel abroad for more than three days.
He must also forward the planned date of departure to the police a week ago.
If the obligation to inform the authorities has been mentioned, he could be sentenced to five years.
The Kents police announced that they would not be conducting individual cases of Gliter's possible roads over the course of the period.
"Kentsk police will do everything necessary to protect children in this country or abroad.
From our point of view, it is easier to follow someone who stays in Britain because we have extensive systems that control potential dangers more effectively.
Protecting Kent's citizens is the highest priority for Kent's police and we work hard to monitor the conduct of registered sexual offenders, thus reducing any danger to the public at least."
Glitter returned to Britain last month, which spent 27 months in the Vietnamese prison for the use of two girls at 10 and 11 years of age.
When he was released, he flew to Bangkok, where he was supposed to fly to London.
But he said he didn't feel well, and he went to London to fly.
The Thai authorities let him pass his passport and finally flew to Hong Kong.
The Chinese authorities also refused to allow him to enter and he flew back to Bangkok, where the Thai police and immigration officials continued on his return to Britain.
On 22 August, he reached Heathrow Terminal 3 and stayed there while his legal representative, David Corker, went to Uxbridg's lowest criminal court in western London and, at the same time, asked Scotland Yard for the order he had ordered to register as a sexual offender.
Glitter was previously in the United Kingdom for four months in custody of child pornography.
A source from the Ministry of the Interior said that Jacqui Smithov, the Ministry of the Interior, was calm and pleased that Glitter was banned from travelling to France and Spain.
"To capture the real character, I take a picture of the mystery outside the scene." Günther Bauer - photographer
No subs, no calls, no costumes.
Except the essence of the great masters of flamenca, who responded from focusing on interpretation - I only aim at the free expression of men and women.
On one side of the artist.
On the other hand, man.
Indiscriminately, if we mention individuals, in those moments far away from the public - you can then look at a reliable gesture, a deep-fashioned look or a generous gesture with your hands that are not old, because they do not want to appear on the scene.
German Günther Bauer is playing in the "Flamenco-people" theatre with songs, dancers and guitarists with the least known form of masters.
For this purpose, the photographer is composed of the unique iconography of the flamenca from different backgrounds.
The exhibition, which takes place within the month of the month of the photograph of the flamenca (Mes de la Photographie Flamenca), "responses the growing international significance of the flamenca", says the author and explains that "Flamenco-people" "may be any people, but when you look at the photograph, you will find that these are not typical pictures of artists on the scene.
These people's portraits "on the street" are artists able to pass the candles, tastes, joys... and all the wonders.
There is no need to take photos of these artists.
She wears her personality and character inside.
I was interested in creating a free atmosphere that allows me to capture the personality of flamingos.
The "Cante de las Minas" festival started Bauer in 1997 on a long route to portrait of flamenco songs, guitarists and dancers on the record camera.
These are portraits that are remembered by the selection of the camera and material.
The payment of different stylistic means is in conflict with the classic basis of the picture and provides it with a contemporary spirit, which is the idea that according to the private Bauer looks and flamenco: "The idea with very traditional roots, which does not cease to surprise and develop."
What preserves the monsters is not the movement of the dance itself, the music or the games, but the personality and the character of the artist.
Looking for the moment when we meet with the most important, the other spirit that appears in the way of thinking, being and living, was and is a constant work presented during the days in El Fotomat gallery.
This selection of about seventy photographed artists creates famous flamenco positions, which are among other things Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales or Vicente Amigo.
The project has become a kind of flamenca anthology and will soon be covered by a book publication that will contain the portraits presented.
Two years ago, Bauer's portrait lawyer introduced the idea of going back to the "Portrétech sports veterans" ("SportARTProject").
Although their concept of "Flamenco-people" is different, the photographer will agree that "photos of people, to know them and have the opportunity to get to the moment, whether more or just short, into their lives - that's my pleasure.
I think the portrait is the most difficult of all genres in the picture.
A person meets or chats with people, personalities who never know or give him a few minutes to focus.
Despite similar circumstances as a photographer, I always try to make my presentations."
A collection of contemporary flamenca portraits called "Flamenco-people" is presented in El Fotomat Gallery in the street de la Mata 20, parallel to Alamedo de Hércules, and it is possible to visit it by 16 October.
Vargas Llos acknowledged that the novel he writes is "threat"
He plays in an environment he still does not know, and reports about the events he has not known, yet Mario Vargas Llosa is happy to make his new project successful - he is working on a novel whose main brain is Roger Casemant, an Irish nationalist who lived for 20 years in the Congo and traveled to Amazon.
The permanent favor of Nobel Prize for Literature yesterday at Hay Festival Segovia admitted that the project that he is working for is "the troupe", and that "all testify that I shouldn't write" this novel.
"If I had any idea, I wouldn't do it, but I will do it and I believe it will be done once," he concluded his contribution to the festival of exchange of ideas, ideas and words that he observed in the city for four days around hundreds of writers, historians and journalists and thousands of others.
The author of the novel "The City and the Psi" was one of the main features of the third anniversary of the celebration of the word and fulfilled the expectation.
Vargas Llosa, who received the price of Hay Festival for the most popular writer - an old edition of Dickens's "Our mutual friend", filled the Juan Bravo Festival to the last place.
With Félix Rome, who introduced him, he had before him a well-known audience who spent time as a water - Peruáne with amazing accuracy and a remarkable dose of humor remembered how he came from the original "unbelieving of a curious reader" and from the "power to live more than I lived" created a literary message; how he added "not enough inspiration" by writing "discriminately", literally distorting and rewriteing, or by affecting his writings, Victor Hugo and Alexander Dumas, and what "responsive images" were written on his lips.
Hispano-American novelist admitted that "there is no way" to find out whether and to what extent books can change life, "but I refuse to believe that literature is only fun, fun experience" - Vargas Llos stressed that according to him "to people" and "to try to get rid of the order", he called the writers to "responsibility" and "take responsibility" of his mission.
Due to climate technologies losing fame in Pozoblanca - missing copies
The encounter with copies of the celebration in Pozoblanca was cancelled yesterday after the announcement of the effects of the announcement that the site is not in good condition.
Therefore, along with Fermín Bohorquez, Pablo Hermosou de Mendoza and Leonard Hernández decided to break down the barriers.
Unfavourable weather conditions link this glory to a long time ago, which two of the three celebrations have failed to perform.
On Saturday, he was unable to sleep through other planned boutiques.
During their formations José Luis Moreno, Curro Díaz and Juan Bautista were supposed to set up camps in the arena in Castileblanca.
That's how he celebrated it on Friday.
The contest became Daniel Luque, who equipped three ears and rewarded for dynamic and aesthetic quality performance was presented on the shoulder.
On the same Sunday, Alejandro Talalante changed two mornings a copy of the greeting and one ear that brought him a rather uncovered sitting in the arena than touring art.
Even worse was El Juli, who had gone to the Los Llanos Aureno's impenetrable airstrip.
In the second round of the door, without a single breath, he served as an island of criticism from most promises.
They took control of Álavi in the supplier with two thousand kilograms of hair
Ten minutes five.
Railway control of Ertzaintza in the city of Armiñón (Alava).
The officials stop two people walking in the supplier and they drive them away.
The cost, more than two tons of heat, is not to be stopped.
According to the report of the Committee within the Basque Government, the officials followed and held one of the suppliers, a man at 38 years of age who was identified as A. A. J.
He was charged with drug trafficking and counterfeiting of State documents.
The incident occurred when a number of officials of the Transport Unit carried out road control on N-1 in the areas where the border of the city of Armiñón is crossing.
They wanted to stop the supply for control, but the driver didn't listen to the instructions, the driver rushed and grabbed.
At the moment, two passengers jumped up and ran to the forest floor.
At the end of one of them, the members of Ertzaintzy finally got one of them and played 2 178 kilograms of hair, which suspects were overestimating how it came out when Iveco Daily was looking at the supplies.
The latter part of the vehicle was fitted with a case-by-case kit, which was subsequently transferred to other police departments for detailed expertise and drug enforcement.
In addition, the police found that the identification mark was "damaged" and did not agree with the information provided in the supply documents, which was therefore also accused of falsifying State documents.
Ertzaintza continues to look after the second suspect, who, as already mentioned, was able to quit in order to finally determine the origin of the drugs involved.
A. A.J., held 28 years ago, was transferred to the police department to establish the appropriate formalities before joining the next investigation.
Herečka Heather Locklearo is kept for driving under the influence of medicines
Herečka Heather Locklearo, a beloved Amanda from the Melrose Place series, was held this weekend in Santa Barbara, California, for driving under the influence of drugs.
The Witness saw her perform unusual maneuvers when she tried to get out of the parking lot in Montecito, delivering a magazine to the people speaking California railways.
The witness confirmed that around 16.30 hours. Locklearo's "the driver walked on the plane, walked ahead and back and tried to get out of the parking lot - several times the sunglasses passed."
A witness she didn't know for the first time saw Locklearo's moment when he stopped at a remote station and got out of the vehicle.
This person also warned the rescue service because "she was afraid of Locklearo's life".
When a police guard arrived at the site, she found an eerie inside the vehicle, which began to block the vehicle.
"She seemed disorientated," and that's why her colleagues took her to a specialized drug and alcohol centre to complete the test.
According to the police spokesman, he worked together, and an excessive amount of alcohol was released, but "we think Locklearo was under the influence of some drugs, which was for the first time for the guards."
The Locklearov was kept for suspected of having an effect-induced treatment, and approximately 1900 was taken into custody, even though it was already released within a few hours.
Two months ago, Locklearo returned from the treatment clinic, where she was recovering from depressive conditions and depression.
Llamazares refers to an Andalus IU to exercise its powers in the case of Silva
The Director-General of the IU and the Ambassador for the Joint Left Gaspar Llamzares today announced that the final decision in the case of the former Working Committee on Youth and Sport in Seville Francisco Manuel Silvy, who left the office last week after being accused of joining his family, will be brought to the national association.
"I am too a federalist, it is for an Andalus organisation to exercise its rights," Llamazares pointed out the meeting to which the party will have to proceed in relation to the former member of the municipal council.
However, the head of the IU maintained that in the case of an investigation of the illegal conduct permitted by Silva, the necessary "transparency" is necessary: "IU has always struggled to make similar concerns extremely transparent."
He also highlighted that the party has a "strict code of ethics for all public functions".
"Sangre de Mayo" ('Sangre de Mayo'), epileptic sachet of Garcío
José Luis Garci, in the film "Sangre de Mayo's Blood" (Sangre de Mayo), to whom he was inspired by the Episodes of the National History of Benita Pérez Galdós, revives the famous Spanish rebellion against the French - it is the most ambitious film in his film with the beginning of about 15 million euros.
In this way, the filmmaker wanted to "increase the accuracy of the composition and analysis of society", which was always excited in the work of the famous Roman writer, explained today with Quim Gutierrez and Paul Echevarría during the presentation of the picture before a large team of interpreters.
The square blood with a metering over two and a half hours will be placed in the kitchen this Friday and will reach more than four-year television series in the future.
As a great fan of the literary creation of Galdós José Luis Garci, he claimed that by completing this film he was a "child dream", for which thanks to Esperanza Aguirrre, which he believed three years ago for the Autonomic province of Madrid, he accepted a picture of the second anniversary of Madrid on May 2, with the offer that the event would take place from the episode of the nation's past.
The figure of 15 million, to which the Madrid province has fully contributed, is meant for Garci's "one chance" to create the environment with bullets and costumes corresponding to the image of "the Christian Spain who has failed to fight for which it has gone - the fight for independence led by the government of Ferdinand VII to the fall and the rest of the country," he said.
The director regrets, however, that he cannot count on the financial support that came to films of the Smurf Cross (Al sad) or Goy's performances - almost double the Flower Blood - he could not then capture some scenes from the scene of a film-signed scenario similar to Horacium Valcárcel, with which he works almost throughout his film drive.
The director of the film "Start Again" (Volver and empezar) works as usual - on the stage with the priest, with whom he usually tries before the hit and who doesn't have castinje because it belongs to "dependant" and also thinks that "the director's call is to go outside the divadel and kine and to find out what's going on in the room that's going on".
Many priests he chose for the White Blood appear before his camera several times, such as Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larrañaga, or Fernando Guillén Cuervo.
Garci, with four nominations on Oscar from one of them, is of the view that none of the three candidates representing Spain this year before the Hollywood Academy, the independent Flower Blood, the seven chairs of the French billiard and the last-elected blind Sunday, does not represent the young generation of Spanish film scenes, but claims that "this is the first to appear".
No assessment is expected for this film Garci.
"At first you think you're working for what's going to happen, but then you realize that you're only working for the class, and so you're gonna be able to make another movie more," explains Garci with more than 30 years' career.
Isabel Bayon wakes up the spiritual direction of the village dancer Tortoly Valencia
Sevilll dancers flamenca breathes other Sevilll dancers.
Carmen Törtola Valencia's father, Florenç Törtola Ferrer, and her mother, Andalusanky (Georina Valencia Valencia Valenzuele), was born in the fourth triana, and when she was three years old, they moved with their family to London.
The modern dance dance dance and its focus on the Oriental dance.
She lived a life full of curiosity, she was a leading woman's emancipation, such as Isador Duncan, Virginia Wolf, or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was a Buddhist and a vegetarian, and she was fighting to break the tie, which made it impossible for women to move freely.
The life of this woman was influenced by the dance and aesthetic revolution by the interwar European Isabel Bayon.
"I wanted to work with Pepo Gambo and she proposed this position -- it seemed incredible to me."
According to the dancer "he's not about saving her life, but about getting her soul.
The names of her dance shows reminded me of the rhythms of flamenca.
So, "fucking dance" called me a Guajir or "fahda dance" some kind of dance.
Her dance was meaningful and they told me that my dance of this aesthetic also answers," she says.
The presentation is composed of two outstanding characters: with Miguel Poddeu, who will sing in one presentation as in the "Open Doors" (La doort abierta), and with the teacher of the dance Matilda Coralov, who did the exception and joined his former jacket.
"Matilde represents the older Tortu, an adult position.
I'm glad she accepted the offer to share in my project, and it's a great honor for me."
The presentation also includes the song and guitars of Jesúse Torres and Paca Ariagy, by Miguel Ortega, el Pulgy and Moi de Morón; the bubunny El Pájara, the violin of Rafa El Violy and the associate priest Juanfry Juárez, "who plays the role of the eternal leader of this kind of artist, who are primadonists with all, and who are always in love with them."
It also takes into account the life of this woman, who played at her time in places such as India, the United States or Russia, and also throughout Europe, because she usually lived in London.
"I wanted to remind her, because I think she was one of the women who had a tremendous influence at some time, but today no one knows her and yet appreciates her creation," says Bayón.
The show starts today at 20.30 in the Lope de Vegy Cathedral.
The book "Water Women's Day" concludes and triennials
The introduction of the first illustrated edition of the "Denika of the Pure Women" in Saint Stephen's Church (New York), in a place where Juan Ramón Jiménez closed the synod with Zenobia in March 1916, is part of the programme coordinated by the Cultural Council of Culture, an autonomous andal government on the celebration of "Treinal Zenobia and Juana Ramona" (2006-2008), aimed at celebrating the fifteenth anniversary of the Nobel Prize for Literature and the anniversary of their death.
"Treennale Zenobie and Juana Ramona" are devoted to the end of the new edition of this work, the international convention that will be held in New York, the construction of the Nobel museum house and the travel exhibition "Juan Ramón Jiménez: Onen paprsk sun", which was opened in May of this year, and after which the various Andalus province is occupied, it should be moved to New York according to plans during the time of the holding of the convention.
The Cultural Council of Autonomic Andalus governments also ordered eight sets of the press "Denic of the Pure Women" prepared by Pedrem Taberem and illustrated by Jacob Pérez-Enciss, to continue to spread knowledge of the personality and role of one of the world's world's largest Andalusians.
America without Paul Newman doesn't like her so much anymore
"Sometimes God creates perfect humans.
Paul Newman was one of them."
These are the words of Hercules Sally Field, who collaborated with him on "No Wrong Thinking" and, knowing that Newman went away, cast off his unhappy vision of American cinematography and all of America.
See how they survived before Oskar got it.
And that he was in debt since 2007.
And that he knew he was sick.
And yet he was for all the boys.
"Sometimes what a person feels can't express in any way, and now I've lost a big friend," said Robert Redford in tears, "my life and my country were better thanks to him."
No one's afraid he's gonna be funny or he's gonna be crazy.
The father of the film and the authorities died, especially in a dark period of fear from terrorists and financial markets, at a time when the American consciousness is on the day when they hope to find reasons for pride.
When the time is harsh and people without dignity and only the smell of those who look at you as a wonder - there's no need to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
For all, he was almost a platonic ideal of beauty and truth.
He was an official opponent of Richard Nixon and a fighter for the destruction and escape of cases, from the addiction to drug addiction based on the honour of the first-born son, who died on the overdose until after his own sign of domestic food and bio-food.
A full contribution for a country that has continued to make a great deal of effort to break free from self-sustaining entertainment culture.
A bourgeois walnut storm swept Hollywood regardless of nationality or nationality.
Last James Bond, Englishman Daniel Craig, found that he didn't die a man, but a whole summer.
Another Englishman, Oskar's manager for the Sam Mendes regime, said that working with Newman was without too much of his career.
A bad mountain from Australia, Russell Crowe, wanted Newman to mark himself as his greatest source of inspiration.
"This leaf has brought us all into a pretty high lake," says George Clooney, perhaps one of the little ones who has to try to live like Paul Newman's life - he's on the floor and leads a serious private life away from the camera.
It's not always easy in today's media jungle, sometimes even possible.
But the happiness of those people is, and Paul Newman is their model.
He was divorced once, and he had been married for decades with Joanne Woodward, who was faithful, although he had more than enough opportunity to be.
"Why would I go out to the hamburger when I have a file at home?" he liked to joke.
Let him in heaven be proud that on earth the government's relations between his daughters and the entertainment industry - it's not too common in America.
It is said that "of all the great roles that he has played, he was the most proud of the role of a dedicated husband, a loving father, a willing grandfather and a victim's fiendpa."
Unfavourable Olympic Games
Yes, many of us complain that the Olympics will take place in Madrid, and in 2012 it will be possible to do so in 2016.
But I wonder, are we ready?
If we're going to run the race yesterday, I'm saying, no!
He talked about him as a perfect race, and according to my court he was the worst I've ever been.
Such a dream doesn't make sense that if it came to the evaluation and I was testing, it would be obvious that it was not enough.
But let's look at it from the beginning, nice one to the other.
In other words, it starts with a number of starters, which is why a person has to give up earlier.
I don't think it's bad for me, but when a man goes there, he's gonna give him everything (including a chip that's gonna pass through the wires).
But no.
Here man had to pick up the number first (first thought, go there only because of it) and (after getting the corresponding borders) - what a surprise! - they only had a triangle of size S (other meaning, because I need the size of XL).
Where do we live?
Because of the crisis, they decided to buy just a little trick, because it's less content and they're cheaper?
All right, these are all the little ones compared to what happened on the day of the race.
In addition to having to go very early for the chip and the front on it lasted more than 15 minutes, he had to carry the bags out there.
After 35 minutes she had a waiting time, which is at the race where 11,000 people are expected to be inexplicable.
So, as it was expected, the race started, and we didn't leave the gangs yet, and when it happened, it was much worse.
The waiting extended for 40 minutes of rain, leading to the general heating and attack on the cabin.
I believe that 500 of us will have breakfast tomorrow and someone like me will not see the right time to evaluate the results for the chip that they gave me and which, as I suppose, didn't mean the right time to start.
Of course, if someone asked me about a perfect race, this wouldn't happen to me.
And that's how I think we're gonna have to get ready for the Olympics.
Microsoft is looking for reception (virtual)
At the conference on new MIT technologies, Microsoft presented further developments in the new system of understanding of image and human interaction in an intelligent way - not too intelligent but capable of carrying out basic tasks such as calling taxis (or, in the case of Microsoft, a message that would move around the entire area of society) and consider what is being heard in the discussion.
Thanks to the camera and system that identifies the shapes and faces, this "receptive" can determine how many people are in the room who are - even to remember what they have to do - and listen and understand the key words of their conversations.
It may also disrupt the presence by the conversion groups.
In the demonstration video, the reception records the third person and the understanding that he does not belong to the group he speaks to, and that he is not an employee of the company.
She asks if she's going after someone, and she tells her she's going to be hired at the moment.
That's all without blue scenes of death.
That's amazing.
But of course it's a song of the future.
Now the company has the most important thing to do, for example a new version of the Windows operating system.
This week we talked a lot about changing Microsoft's strategy.
Windows 7 will be easy and will not have so many compatible programs.
Steve Ballmer came to the point that if the computers had only the most important, without competition for commercial survival, they would be five times more efficient - man, Steve, they would still be lighter.
It appears as a game when we consider that Microsoft version from the version adds a new feature to Windows and another "extra".
The change in direction would be appropriate.
Microsoft is right, the operating system is a small loss of meaning and is similar to that software.
When Google Chrome appeared on the network, I became one of those who adhered to the theory that it was the first step Googlu to compete with Windows.
Many correctly pointed out that the browser is not an operating system.
The operating system will always be necessary because it is a necessary kind of interface between hardware and software.
He's got the same function as your wife or your husband when you have to say something chini.
That's true.
It never disappears, but there is a need to think about the "death" of the operating system, not as an absolute truth, but relative truth.
What Balmer said this week, this opinion confirms.
People pay less attention to the operating system and, rather, more to the web browser.
The computer stops to download Firefox or Explorer - or Chrome - and every day we spend more time on the Internet than around the window.
What do half of the applications running the system deserve?
It's less.
And Windows 7 must be less, much less than Vista.
Less difficult, less complicated, less complex.
Microsoft is now interested in offering its services online and finally becoming an alternative to Googlu.
They need it, and I have a little example here.
I made this photo in one accountant for Microsoft employees in Redmond at the beginning of the month.
On the front car was a crying machine that asked to use their search tools: "Your search. Our future."
In 2006, independent studies showed that 66% of Microsoft employees used Google’s online search.
Last week, a new version of Windows Mobile 7.
It's not going to start in 2009, but at the end, so let's count it by 2010.
In Microsoft they will certainly try to put into the Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 market together.
The phone is becoming more and more computers.
Because Android and iPhone are already on the market, they'll have to pay for the delay.
The Fabuleux Marcel
Pablo Picasso wore it on the Azour coast, Leonardo di Caprio in one of the exhibitions in the "The Blood Diamond" Edward Zwicka, as well as Al Pacino in the "Kmotrovi" Francis Ford Coppoly, and is also part of the uniforms of the weakened gay communities.
And if we want to go to the library of his life roles, we can go down to the image of a typical sculptor with a scaffolding book that doubles the act in the rock circus.
It's basically nothing more than a typical French underpants, intruders and without arms.
English speakers call him 'tank', but only Fabuleux Marcel from Brussels turns out to be more than all the others.
For the first time for his Christmas name - even though the people call him 'Marcel' - which is related to sport, because as he reports the legend, he was named after the boxer Marcel Cerdan, the lovers of the singer Edith Piaf.
'Marcel' is the result of the other quality dance, unisex arrow, the striking shield and (a little unknown) the Belgian train that has models of the most impeccable tires as detail in the church.
And be careful, because the Belgian company does not only specialize in tank tops.
It also makes kitchens colleges, retro boxers, casserole candles, bathrobes, seams, children's clothes, mini panties...
Thoughtful shoes for comfortable underwear.
Even though it's a shame they're just under the bed.
They're so beautiful.
"I want to be a young mother.
She had a horrible look at her sister in developing her own personality.
Monique Cruz, though small, is a woman full of life.
Their new actions in fashion are now taking the sisters of Cruz very seriously.
For Monica it means much more than that some beautiful, famous girls give their name.
In Paris, a promotional action was taken by Mango in its new seat, and a declaration of the lesser modal prices that this Spanish company sponsors.
It's heartbreaking, and it's not funny, and it's getting you closer.
Tell us what you're doing in Paris.
I have come to introduce a new collection that we have proposed with Sister Penelope for Mango on the annual afternoon afternoon, and I have also participated in the announcement of the second anniversary of the "Mango Fashion Awards" and the dinner in Operè on the honour of Valentine.
Well, it was a tough day, but it's also a exciting day.
What's your new collection for Mango, since you're already working for the fourth season?
My sister and I love the 50s and 60s, and we've had a lot of things.
I also love Toulouse around the city, and I watch women walk dressed, blending and kind of dressed, I do so very often.
You're a dancer, a hero, a propeller, so a very strange woman, right?
I think it's true, but the end is all over, and it's got a lot of connections.
I should have given up my favorite clothes, I've always wanted to go to my grandmother's, go to my aunt's closet and watch her dress.
It was a sensation, almost better than going to college.
When I became a dancer, I always tried to focus on the way I'm dressed.
You know, however, that we dancers rely on how we are organized to feel good about our hours and trials in view of the mirror.
And as a hero, if they give you a bone, then you'll really get into position.
So everything's done, including with great respect for designers and professionals.
You've been 30 lately, you've had a crisis?
Where?
I feel better than ever before, I'm interested in a triangle.
I find that a woman is ready, she has experience, and life gets better with less mistakes.
I'm not afraid of biological hours.
I gave up doing what I wanted, and that gives me great inner happiness.
So you're thinking of being a mother, aren't you?
Of course, I know I'm going to be a mother because my body demands it, and besides, I want to be a young mother, I don't want to miss it.
If it's about my father, I don't care about it.
But one thing I know is, I'll give my child a sense of happiness and I'll raise him with great love.
If it's about the movie, you're gonna be waiting for a couple of film primers you've been running around for a while.
That's right, and I'm glad they're coming to the kitchen.
I'm coming from a wonderful world, and so I'm very impatient and unsatisfied, I want everything right now and it's not going to happen.
I'm happy for the "La last hour" and "En search de la Tumba de Christ".
I'm glad you're gonna like them...
A few days ago, you had your prime minister on the front of Naomi Campbell, right?
Well, don't say that.
It's not like I'm going to stand on the floor like a model.
She just called me Naomi Campbell, who had known me for a long time, and invited me to London to take part in the beneficial reviews for her "Women for a better life" organisation, and the clothes we presented - I also selected two models from our collection for Mango - the exhibition was presented and the exhibition was presented to this Naomi's non-governmental organization.
People don't know Naomi has such a good heart.
She's talking about a lot of things and I, since I know her, can tell you that many of them are not true.
Besides, I'm gonna keep up with the good things he's doing.
She asked me to offer her charity, but if she asked me to make a stand, I would do it too.
I'll do what I need to do for women in the third world.
Repeated access drivers with alcohol in the blood will have to install "alcolock"
The Ministry of the Interior requires that the driver have to install in his vehicle a system that prevents him from starting a vehicle in the truck or if he does not breathe.
The proposal was announced in June of this year and is now included in the annual report of the Supreme State Representative, according to which it relates to a pilot project, which will start one year.
Its purpose is to return the driver as a volunteer, so the drivers will also have to complete the course of transport crossings.
In addition to this experience, the International Transport Safety Authority (DGT) and the Technological Safety Authority (FITSA) will be involved in this experience.
According to statistics, between 30 and 75 % of the vehicles charged more than once for the re-route operation in this state are subject to a vacancy.
Alcolock should prevent this because it is a system connected to a vehicle that measures the alcohol content in the air and prohibits the start of a car if the driver is previously breathing or if it is marked higher than the permitted concentration of alcohol.
His price is worth 1,000 euros and he would have to buy it for himself.
A study carried out in this regard in the United States in 2007 showed that in vehicles equipped with this device, 65 % decreased during the first year following the introduction.
In Spain it is calculated that each year 115 people can be saved.
The measure shall be limited to the administrative penalty for two reasons: to resolve this behaviour before the criminal proceedings take place.
In order to assist in its implementation, as legal correction can be carried out in an ordinary manner, it is necessary to amend the criminal provisions, however, to amend the law.
The equipment is not yet available on the Spanish market in any sales version, even though some industrial vehicles and public service vehicles have already been successfully installed.
The Congress of Members will vote tomorrow on the proposal of the PSOE (Spanish Social Socialist Party) in which it is recommended to install this system in school buses, such as in France.
In Mexico without "peeptoes"
With British precision, at 17.40 a.m., as in the program, it arrived in the presidential hangar at the airport of Benita Juárez in Mexico D.F. the plane of the Spanish air forces in which the prince and princess from Asturia arrived.
The sun just fell, however, its wings had to be clogged with their eyes for the next couple coming out of the plane.
Underway, the Spanish ambassador and other officials were present.
A few hours ago, I asked the taxi driver in the street if he knew that the Spanish prince with the princess was coming to the state visit.
- Yeah, that's great.
- No, no, sir, she's a Spanish, but she's lived here for a few years.
- Yeah, so it's...
The Mexican press, however, well knows who are the prince and princess of Asturia and how important their visits are.
A lot of people are waiting in hangar on a plane in a red deck and a military cordon, which creates 27 marine soldiers ready to shoot a noble saloon.
The prince appears with a smile on his face in a dark blue color and a princess, very suddenly dressed and with loose hair, does not have his usual "peeptoes", apparently reported to her that in D.F., a storm rages.
Before they go to the hall where the official delegation is waiting, they laugh at the photographs and they don't miss them.
In the doors, where they will be accommodated, one of the four largest in the city is waiting for a corresponding Mexican television reporter.
Best adjustable fashion price
There is probably no suitable place in the world to declare fashion prices more than Paris and probably no more famous designer and bonus than Valentino.
Mango's company just announced the second anniversary of El Botón-Mango Fashion Awards to enable the international presentation of new talent in the field of fashion.
The price shall be added to the amount of EUR 300 000.
Belgium Sandrina Fasoli, the winner of the first anniversary, looked at his proposals in the Manga exhibition on the Paris bulvar Haussmann number 54 and almost cried out.
Of course, it is the second largest trade in this company in Europe and was just opened on the surface of 1,335 square metres.
The biggest one is in London.
Many events, together with the encouragement to thank the rapporteurs of Valentino for having taken the lead in the competition report, led us to an overcrowded increase in the Paris Opera Garnier.
At Mango's company, the well-known presidential table appeared to be something even more amazing next to the most famous Chagalol works.
Nati, who was deeply sorry for the recent death of her brother, was wearing the garment of this sign and the ELAH hat, over which the roof was covered, and tied to his son Luise - almost two meters of elegance - passed Valentina's head at the table at dinner at his place.
Andindi, the chief and owner of Mango's company, took a visit and as the real gentleman stayed with Baroness Rothschild without a sac, because they both offered her to two ladies.
Monica Cruz, who came into trade in - privately designed - pants and shirts, and at dinner she moved into long black chats, got a night walk after the opera for the performance of Goy Toled's, showed us a ball test room and, at other times, caught one of the pieces and marked "great file".
Inés Sastreov did not keep track of the next building, but before leaving, she showed us pictures of her son on the mobile phone.
The next morning we could love the presence of Olivier Martínez - another young man who rides on the motorcycle - and John Travolty, who came to the Paris Intercontinental hotel with his own clothes and handshakes and asked that there were no candles in his rooms.
The stars are under the stars of the Parisian sky.
Oh, that's life.
1001 - anti-Stroke Number
Not 1000, but 1000 plus one way to forget about Chaotic and surviving everyday life.
And so that's not a bit of it, they're all buried in one book that comes to the bookshop relax on September 30th.
The building sings every morning at 7 o'clock as punishment, but it's even worse to imagine yourself trapped in a successful pace that brings a modern life.
The office is called a fever and a patient's computer.
Stress is a 21st century disease.
There are, however, not one or two ways to combat everyday fatigue and problems from the world of work.
No, that number is nothing more than 1001.
Susannah Marriott’s addition to the joginal position, classic massages and "spa" therapy on the pages of his books collected all the "menu" options managed by the taste and time options of each individual.
The anti-pressive book is called "1001 way of relaxation" and thanks to the loading of Pearson Alhambra and DK bring you to the bookstore of comfort.
If someone is unable to achieve peace in such areas as work or personal relationships, the "hand" will reject this view.
In addition, it offers other procedures such as contacting nature or 100% of natural recipes that contribute to relaxation.
If you are no longer in the veins, adrenaline that restores balance in the body, and stress becomes a problem, it is time to sit on the floor, relax and focus on reading.
Spanish Talks
Some kids talk at night.
I don't think those who wake up and who tell us something that happened the day before, but the kids who talk, while they're asleep.
When this happens first, it may cure you, but in fact, it's inevitable.
It's about an unharmed sleep disorder called dreamiloct.
It's quite common, especially in children and adolescents.
I'm sure not one of you told me he was talking about sleep last night.
This egg can be very casual (e.g. once for a lifetime in high temperatures), or with more regularity (every day, once a week, once a few months...), the second day does not remember anything.
There's not just one reason to explain her attitude.
Often it is associated with other sleep disorders, such as night shifts, night shifts, night-care enuresis (night support) or sleeplessness, but it should not be.
As mentioned earlier, many may experience very high fever, stress, or worsening situation.
In any case, it's a little bit of a passerby.
The intensity with which it appears is also different.
A child can speak in a calm voice, say a single word, shuffle, or right away (screams, tears, long words...).
In cases where a child is very strong, it would be appropriate to observe and consult with a professional to find out if there is no problem that causes him great difficulty and thus to appear.
We said that it's an accident, so it's not treated unless it's associated with another disorder that can be treated (e.g. if it's associated with apnea syndrome or permanent stress).
However, we can do this to remember several very simple preventive measures, such as:
Try not to let the child get too upset before he goes to bed.
So look for quiet games and avoid being intimidated or some violent TV programs or series.
In very nervous children and those who are allowed to work, it is possible to use relaxation techniques that help them find a certain inner calm.
It's a child's quieter sleep.
When dreams occur, try to stay calm.
Remember that it is harmless for a child and that the next day he will not remember anything from what he did.
The Commission shall adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 3 of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013.
Don't be him.
It's very important, because he's not in the knowledge and you're breaking his sleep.
Even when he speaks, he sleeps, and then he rests.
Remember, if you sometimes feel that you are very upset, it would be appropriate to talk about the advice or to find out what causes such pain in your child.
If you understand what he says (which is not so common), avoid trying to listen to him and get information from him.
It won't do anything, because when he's asleep, he's not aware that he can fix his thoughts.
In addition, you will hear what he says, but you don't know what he feels like, and then why he says it, so take a great look at how you interpret the information and what conclusions you reach.
Never tell your child that you can ask him about his secret at night.
Not from the game.
That's what makes a lot of trouble.
Don't do a little bit of anxiety, it's nothing wrong, it's just an episode that lasts just a few minutes.
Illhaeusern... finally.
Illhaeusern finally found his way back to victory after a long period of chaos.
Before they could collect a great deal of fun, they would create more opportunities and be able to change one of them in a victory.
The game didn't have a very fast pace during this encounter, where the attackers were only having a hard time.
After the first attempt, Captain Kauffmannna, who shot from the distance just about the train past the link, began to have Illhaeusern easy design and first Funderflick from the distance, then Hirne air, Romain on a long foot or also Diebold gradually came to admire the defense of Dannemarie.
On the contrary, he put in half the wall of defense and left only the Agile Rihai on the edge of the attack.
The beginning of the second half showed itself as a decisive one, and this is first thanks to the two chances Dannemarie named Rihai and Temporal, then after the opening of the skin for Illhaeusern, who was raised by Marais, well established for the processing of the sword reflected after the previous Diebold's attempt (53').
However, Golman Illhaeusern did not enjoy long joy, about 12 minutes later he was forced to return to the tent and leave his associates so weak.
Dannemarie, however, was unable to recover from this and a unit from Illhaeusern, who had just become a little more "inspired" to prevent any further problems, with the exception of the last seconds of the attack, when the sword flew very close after the great disaster.
Sarkozy's going to hit the abandoned fishermen.
Nicolas Sarkozy will make a race across the UK before his flight to the United States.
In order to show the strength of the fishermen who were seriously undermining the availability of several Breton and Normund ports in the afternoon, the French President decided to go out to the Guilvinec port in Finistère to meet their representatives there.
Finally, the nominations promised to take "in a constructive spirit", and they hope that "he will come with concrete proposals".
The presidential visit comes at the same time as a wave gathering of the "crisis committee" created by the Breton fishermen with a view to obtaining measures against the sudden increase in oil prices that reached a ceiling of EUR 1.14 per litre.
According to David Martina, President of the Elysian Council, he will talk to them about solutions that can be presented to help their companies regain competitiveness and better secure the conditions of employment and payment of seafarers.
Nicolas Sarkozy is expected to be incapacitated by the fishermen.
In the morning, they carried out the operation of "floating" (a short driveway operation) in the departments of Morbihan and Calvados, which led to a 10 km of escape.
The reception site in Quiberon was also blocked, but the connection to Belle Island was not interrupted.
The filtration award was made on the island of Quiberon.
The sailors had already demonstrated their determination in the afternoon when, right before the storage of the huge volumes of bridges in Bresto and Lorent, they burned pneumatics and pallets while in Concarneau and Saint-Brieuc were conducting demonstrations.
Hunti was extended to other ports on the Atlantic coast and the canal of La Manche, such as the Sabels d'Olonne in Vendée, where traules remained in port, or to Le Havru, where about twenty ships blocked the operation of commercial ships.
The fishermen from Turballe and Croisic in the Loire-Atlantique area stopped the important total refinery in Donges during the evening.
Those from Boulogne-sur-Mer decided to wait until they decide to attend the mid-term meeting of the ministry themselves.
In Guilvinec, however, the "crisis committee" should decide on how to proceed on the road ahead and on its participation in the preparatory meeting of the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
However, some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by the heads of the State Committee of Fisheries that did not support their nests.
"The flag will continue" because "fishers from nothing" and "does not want to be brought to Paris," declared, for example, Liliane Cariou, the president of the Lorento Fisheries Committee.
However, the fishing authorisation holder who does not pay oil tax shall, at the present time, pay around 50 cents per litre, decide that the rightness of the ship is achieved only if it is less than 0,30 EUR per litre.
Paul Newman grandpa
An unforgettable representative of "Buche Cassidy and Kida" died as a result of cancer at 83 years of age in his home in Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford, or Sam Mendes have also awarded the legend of the film and politically committed priest Paul Newman, who died at the age of 83.
Embraer maintains its assumptions of supply for 2008
Brazil's aircraft manufacturer is responsible for supplying 215 aircraft during the year, and this is due to the risk of recession, which is known to the world economy.
The fourth world aircraft designer, Embraer, maintains its assumptions of supply for 2008 with 215 additional equipment, confirmed by President Fredrico Fleury Curado.
In the first half, the manufacturer added 97 aircraft.
Brazil's construction has a lot of commitments from the Chinese market, especially on the scale of its aircraft from 30 to 120 seats.
To this day, Embraer added 41 devices to Chinese customers in the range of eight years.
AIG takes into account 15 % of its assets
Assurance of the American International Group, which the U.S. money institutions have received over water, considers that he would earn more than 15% of his assets to pay $85 billion, which was given as a deposit, writes a non-profit release of Financial Times.
AIG is ready to examine the sale of most of its activities other than the environmental insurance of the international field and tax activities in the United States, clarifys the fact that it is a source of close contact.
According to the FT, the AIG Governing Council met on Sunday during the evening to investigate the possible arrival.
No confirmatory statement could be obtained from the AIG.
The assets that the AIG intends to deliver include its airline Leasing International Lease Financial Corp., its 59% share in the insurance insurance of Transatlantic Holdings, as well as its portfolio of property and investment in private equity, adds FT.
No final decisions on these meetings have been adopted yet, the FT continues.
The AIG must quickly be prepared in order to be able to pay an amount of 85 billion, which has been granted to it by the Federal Reserve Bank with a risk that the U.S. authorities will have 80 % of its capital, at the same time dividing the sharer's share.
Paríž. Analysis of the historic meeting Morning Meeting Meeting
New York's borough reported a historic decline on Monday after the Snivn representatives rejected Paulson's plan to save the bank: Dow Jones lost 6,98%, which is an invisible loss of close to 800 points, and Nasdaq 9,14%.
Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) is broken down by 777.68 points at 10,365.45 points.
The largest available point loss in its history (point 684,81) was recorded on 17 September 2001, on the day of the renewal of trade after the terrorist attacks of 11 September.
Index Nasdaq with its dominant technological stock lost, according to the final data after the conclusion of the marketing, 199,61 points and stood at 1,983,73 and the expanded Standard & Poor's 500 index fell by 8,81 % (i.e. 106,85 points) at 1, 106,55 points.
As already mentioned from the beginning of the session, Wall Street has recently disappeared after an unexpected rejection of the plan on the rescue of the shadow bank, a plan that should be re-founded on thirds of stability.
228 votes against and 205 against the representatives refused to provide the secret State agent Henry Paulson with the means he requested.
No two Republicans left his plan behind.
"It's a bad signal sent out by a market that sees Congress not capable of adopting a certain plan," says Lindsey Piegza of the FTN Financial.
"It shows how much the market has worked on this plan," added and expressed concern that the project adopted in a few days did not come "after".
"If this project is really dedicated to the dance (...), the stamp will be unprofessionally handed over to Fed (American Central Bank, etc.) and to other central banks in order to guarantee the crisis, which would further satisfy the credit conditions," warned Brian Bethune, leading the global Insight economy.
In view of the urgency of Piegza's situation, in the United States, "every new day brings a single financial institution."
After the Washington Mutual party, the banks of Wachov's bank were organised by its Citigroup River.
In the crisis in Europe, she called for irrevocable intervention in the promotion of the Bank in the United Kingdom, Beneluxu, Iceland and Germany, which means that markets are not "only with the US crisis, rather than with the crisis of the world", added an analysis from the FTN Financial.
The deal with the bonds is very slow.
The result of the 10-year contract was 3,632 % sales 3,827 % on Friday evening, the amount of 30-year profit on 4,161 % sales 4,357 % on the previous day.
Both of them won on the points in the first TV show.
After the first five-year debate between the two candidates in the White House, a second debate followed, whose task was to find out who of John McCain and Barack Obama won.
The overwhelming state of the campaign of Republicans and Democrats did not stop when both declared their victory in the television booth followed by the third American families.
Political analyst David Gergen believes that John McCaina's performance, as he was obedient, was not "brillant" enough to allow him to stop, five weeks before the presidential elections, a drop in the polls.
The Gallup Constitution, which was published on Saturday by the public opinion, has joined Obama's five-year term (49% versus 44% for McCaina), argues that democracy is the one who has won the victory in due time.
Among the undecided voters directly concerned, Obama is a winner for 39 % of the respondents, while, according to CBS study, 25% of McCain's win.
Both should have the opportunity to confirm their conduct on Thursday with the help of the supposed good performance of their co-authorate Joseph Biden, during the first and, at the same time, the only public debate with his rival Sarah Palin.
"It would be a mistake to underestimate her.
It's expected," he warned yet about the weekend Bill Clinton.
Seventeen years ago McCain gradually developed his in-depth experience on the field of foreign policy, while at the same time emphasised his "neighbour" competition in issues that created the core of the first survey.
"It seems that Senator Obama didn't understand that..." became a repeated accusation.
"I do not think Senator Obama would have enough experience and knowledge to become a president," he also warned.
Such an offensive spirit did not come from an earlier Republican TV meeting.
On the contrary, both stressed that it represents the future.
He didn't lose his head and showed himself to be professional and precise.
He developed his ability to make the right decision and to restore the good news of the United States in the world.
"McCain has not yet understood, while Obama yes," he complained about the week's democratic meeting, which the Republicans count to be that he doesn't take enough in the way of the crisis on the "normal American".
"During the ninety-minute debate that John McCain had much to say about me, but nothing about you," Obama announced yesterday before 20,000 people gathered at a pre-trial meeting in North Carolina for the spring rain.
Neither did he describe the term "meaning class" or "working". The financial breakdown of Obama, which the Americans consider to be a better way of saving the economy at the end of the disaster.
"The next week, it would be a decisive return," said influential democratic senator Charles Schumer yesterday.
Democratic representative Rahm Emanuel, former member of Clinton's administration, compared Obama's "economic prosperity" to the one Bill Clinton had during the financial crisis in 1998.
For the candidate for democracy, the same group is "the ultimate prize of eight-year-old bad economic policy, as George Bush did and how Senator McCain supported it".
The Senator of Illinois once again confirmed that over unexpected Wall Street steps, he should be able to reduce taxes by 95% of Americans, and also warned that the realization of the potential energy dependence of the country through renewable sources is a priority of his number one, along with the introduction of a health insurance system.
McCain plans to build a park with 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
The two candidates responded cautiously to issues relating to the financial assistance plan of $700 billion (470 billion euros), which were adopted last night by Congress and which was extremely unaccompanied.
"What have you noticed that there have been some elections in Minsk?"
Young people and opponents of the regime demonstrated on Sunday evenings in the capital of the capital of Belarus to reject the results of parliamentary elections.
Several hundreds of Belarus gathered on Sunday evenings shortly after the polling stations were closed in the capital city of Minsk to protest against the irregularity of voting in Parliament.
Although no results have been made yet, many young people have come to demonstrate against President Lukaschenka's regime: "dictator, demos".
Some admit that they didn't even go to the polls, "What would it be if they did what they wanted with my voice?" one youth says.
It does not believe that this regime, which was closely associated with foreign observers, with the aim of reintroducing contact with the European Union, would be prepared to carry out the work on the path to democracy.
Sanctions between the prohibition of visas for 40 Whiteheads and the freezing of certain assets may be abolished in the event that the elections will be considered as clean.
That's not what they said.
"We were kept away from the voluntary commissions and our observers were not allowed to take part in counting the votes," said Juri Potémkin, a spokesman of the Union of democratic forces, of various groups of twelve sides.
"It's a cosmetic change," explains Alexandra Milinkievic, former opposition candidate in the 2006 presidential elections and leads to the personality of the European spring, "because it's essential who's counting the votes, and it's a powerful force in us.
If any opposition envoys come to Parliament, it will be named and never elected.
However, their entry into Parliament may mean space on television, meetings in the regions and proposals for laws."
The opposition must therefore feel obliged to participate in political functioning, because dialogue with the European Union needs to be started.
It's all about our economy, deeply indebted to Russia, the current crisis, and we're not reforming, it's threatening to become a protector of Russia.
But we want to be independent."
The opposition is afraid that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which has followed through the elections, will not announce the elections to be paid.
It points out that the participation seems to be too high and that the general introduction of the preliminary vote (26% of the vote in Minsk) opened the way for all possible manipulations.
"What have you noticed that some elections have taken place?" is a social-democratic leader, Alexander Kosulin, one of the last two political prisoners released in August this year.
"There was no foot in the popular places.
And there will be at least five opposition MPs in Parliament, who are the most in favour of the regime."
The night's silence got worse again.
On television, President Lukašenko and members of the Central Electoral Commission welcome the success.
Talk - Blood That Is Safe Again
Hema-Québec celebrated the tenth anniversary of the establishment last night and his president, Dr. Francine Décary, was rightly pleased, since Hema-Québec became one of the most efficient and most effective blood donors in the world.
First of all, she regained public trust, which was seriously crushed after scandal with contaminated blood in the 1980s and 1990s.
As is generally known, the national reserve of blood processed by the Canadian Red Cross Transfusion Committee was contaminated by immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus during the 1980s.
In the light of this drama and the wishes of the public, the Canadian government launched a public investigation in February 1994 to which Judge Horace Krever had presided over and which was intended to explain the circumstances that led to such a tragedy and to make recommendations so that such a group could no longer recover.
While Judge Krever was away with the withdrawal of the report, some provinces pointed to the committee’s intention to plan for a new blood management system in Canada.
In Quebec, Gélinea's Committee took this role.
Following the Gélineau and Krever's report, two contributors were set up in Canada: Hema-Québec, who was to finance Quebec, and the Canadian blood company for the maintenance of all provinces and territories.
"When Hema-Québec started his activities in 1998, nearly 38% of people still had confidence in the Quebec blood system," recalled Dr. Décary.
"The situation was exciting.
With a simple effort to increase the safety of blood products and constant work in this area during the following years, we have regained public confidence," hema-Québek adds that at the beginning of 2008.
Dr. Décary, however, is not missing from the mirror that "faith is a very sinful thing."
Since its establishment on 28 September 1998, Hema-Québec has applied the principle of caution.
"At the time we were witnesses in Europe to the fate of many cases of human beings in the absence of crazy goods, the new variants of disability called Creutzfeldt-Jakob's disease," reports a woman whose company has been operating since its establishment in 1998.
"And we didn't know if this disease could spread blood.
We have therefore discussed one of the basic recommendations of Kreverov and Gelineau, according to which, if we do not know this and when there is a serious weakness in spreading, in this case Creutzfeldt-Jakov's weakness, which is marked by degenerative brains that inevitably lead to death, it is necessary to take exceptional measures.
In April 1999, therefore, we refused blood from people who have remained in the United Kingdom for more than a month since 1980.
A few years ago, it was safe to believe that this disease is transfused.
So this episode showed us that keeping the principle of caution meant a lot."
In 1999, a number of more precise techniques were found on the market to detect HIV: tests using nuclear oxygen (NAT) that allow the presence of the virus directly in the donor blood, and never the presence of antibodies on which the tests were previously used.
NAT tests have enabled a short period of time between the patient’s time of administration and the moment when our techniques may be in the blood of the first virus, the specialist explains.
We've been able to get back to less than a week.
Basically, we reduced the risk that some donors could be taught without knowing about it and without being able to come to it.
This improvement has made it possible to significantly reduce the risk of AIDS through blood transfusion.
The risk of being infected with HIV is today one of 12 million people.
"In other words, it means that before someone commits HIV, 12 million blood products will have to be distributed.
As a result, Hema-Québec distributes 400 000 to 500,000 blood products each year, it will take 24 years before the first case of transmission of HIV through the blood product is revealed.
I believe that today we can obtain or prescribe blood transfusions as necessary for healing," says the Head of Management of Héma-Quebek.
"The next decade's performance is the preservation of the safety of our products.
We never know what kind of disease can occur in the system.
Just last year on the island of Réunion discovered a chikungunya virus, which is similar to the West Nile virus that transmits it to blood by squeezing a smile.
It needs to be constantly careful," continues Dr. Décary and points out that in addition to safe storage, Hema-Québec must also be counted with adequate supplies.
"The need to grow, because the population is old.
Because of the aggressive treatment of cancer, patients often need a new dose of red blood cells or platelets.
The presence of the population also has consequences for the blood donor network, which consists of only 3% of Quebecans eligible for the gift."
Each healthy person is at least 18 years old, meeting the eligibility criteria, but can donate blood only once for 56 days, which means six times a year.
14% of the people offering blood are not on average accepted because they have carried AIDS or malaria, and if they have visited countries where the range of bananas has been released for one year.
"With this 3%, we can maintain a condition that meets the needs of the patient.
The lack is very rare.
However, the members of the donor’s network should be closely connected to the elderly and can no longer donate blood.
However, convincing people to donate blood is difficult, especially when it comes to maintaining and promoting regular donations.
Life is so boring today that we will only find a few hours to be able to donate blood," says Francine Décary.
With the annual budget of $297 million Héma-Québec, it provides not only blood products, but also human tissue, such as bone transplants, heart transplants, eye bubbles and skin, which is almost exclusively used for large burns.
These tissues are analysed, processed and frozen before they are placed in Hema-Québek, which is also directed by a single public blood bank from the popcorn in Quebec.
The pupacic snort, previously considered to be biomedical waste, exposes the blood rich to bone marrow that can serve to treat serious diseases, such as leukemia.
"Several weeks ago, we celebrated the value of our thousand sample of blood from the pumpkin tube to the bank, and we assume that we will collect them over a thousand years.
In the beginning of the next year, we should start offering them to transplant," explains Dr. Décary, whose blood collection program describes them as very popular.
"Some mothers are accused of having no access to him," said Héma-Québec, without sufficient means to offer this complex and expensive program to all hospitals in Quebec.
Photobal - Impact on semifinals
The impact Montréal last night on the Saputo stadium during the second and equivalent settlement of the quarter-financed feed on the total number of brands qualified to the semi-financed car sorting series of the first SSL division, thanks to victory 3:1 (4:3 is the total balance per pair of bags) on Sounders from Seattle.
Lieutenant Antonio Ribeiro gave the decisive head in the 90th minute of the game.
After the first half of the left-hand side, the depositor David Testo and Rocco Plantentino collected the remaining two golden visual formations.
Roger Levesque was the only one who was able to work with Matt Jordan for the Sounders.
Let's remember that on Friday, during the first of the first two games, the impact on Starfire Complex in Tuquile was endured on the site of Seattl's 2.1.
The impact is measured in semifinals with Whitecaps from Vancouver.
On Saturday evening in Minnesota, Thunder made a home deficit 3:1 and finally won 4:3, but Whitecaps still got to the semi-final car with the total number 5 4:4.
The impact should be addressed with Whitecaps on Friday and Sunday, however, details of the series of games will be confirmed until today.
Short - Kovalev's victory head
The first three Canadian attackers are ready to launch the season.
A unit composed of Alexe Kovaleva, Tomáše Paklace and Andreje Kosticina yesterday at the Centre Bell launched an attack on the victory of Canadian 3:2 on a private train.
Kosticin, the largest star in the universe, shot the head, Pakanec collected two assistants, and Kovalev closed one game in this fourth victory of the six ready-made games.
Kovalev assured the victory by giving a single head during his own voyages.
"I'm not ready yet," warned Rus.
"I need another game to feel good."
"In the first third, he tried to control it too much," noted Guy Carbonneau.
"But I think he evaluated the end of the tape.
He had a nice coat."
Charrest is on the north side
The Prime Minister does not exclude early elections by the end of the year
Right after the end of the Liberal Party's session, Jean Charrest moved to Jean-Talon in Quebec, where today's additional elections are to apply for a new Minister of Health Yves Bolduc (left).
"Removing between our last great northern border": such is the long-term ambition that Jean Charest presented last night with a vision of a stunning way to end the Liberal page of Quebec in Lévisia, without giving details.
During his speech, the images were displayed behind him in a picture of a screen.
On three layers of flats, the shirt ran with remarkable photos of hydroelectric ceilings, down, Quebec from the look of Google Maps, maps, etc.
Large means, just like in the pre-fabricated period.
Finally, at the press conference, the Prime Minister refused to declare that he would appeal to earlier elections on the ground, even though he warned that he had a very bad programme.
"Sever Plan" creates the fourth "vis" dimension, which the Prime Minister will think about for Quebec, the "new economic space" vision, which includes the French employment agreement, the agreement between Canada and Europe and the Ontario agreement.
Despite the fact that the opening of the North - in the 49th century - the Prime Minister has frequently mentioned in his statements, it has never been the subject of presentation.
The Prime Minister, however, was limited to explaining why the North represents a "cluster with vast potential", did not indicate the term, higher investment, or a clear priority in future projects.
Firstly, he mentioned a number of approaches to points that could be further developed: in particular water electricity, forest, in particular the subsector, generated by drought growth in developing countries and the restoration of public infrastructure.
North, according to Charrest's report, contains "nil, tin, honey, platinum, gold, silver, silver, iron, titan, and even diamonds".
This "land twice greater than France is in us", "is in Quebec.
And it's not just us, but it's in us," he stressed, as he wanted to show that he's allowed a certain national depository myth.
Québec was built to a great extent in relation to the North, the prime minister raised: gold Honba in Abitiba, Quebec engineering, James's flag.
"It's ours, it's our future," he added after he had literally declined to look at the vast map behind his back.
North, 70 % of Quebec's territory, including the portion of Labrador, which was always requested by Québec, highlighted the prime minister during the press conference.
"It's about the traditional position that restored all available governments.
There is a border sign that has not been in the contract for a long time, and if there is an appropriate opportunity, this position will again be taken on behalf of the government," he said.
Otherwise, "it is also necessary to rethink our view of the North in relation to climate change," he said when he spoke about the transition of the north-west, which is due to the presence of icebreakers all the time.
In this new geopolitical context, the prime minister is believed to be responsible.
And what about the people of the land, the original nations and the Inunite?
The Prime Minister said that the Quebec government would be very careful and that the project would be successful, especially for young people.
Two former ministers from two different sides, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (formerly a pequistic messenger from Hungary), have already begun to associate with about thirty communities.
The Inter-Ministerial Committee, chaired by Benoît Pelletier, has taken the important position of Julie Boulet (Debate and Natural Resources).
The Prime Minister does not exclude large meetings, "not necessarily summit", but when "a common vision will be drawn up".
The development of the North should ultimately continue in line with the principles of sustainable development.
The plan of the North will be "coordinately designed, structured and closely towards the environment," he promised.
Jean Charest described this "visi" as a butterfly that is referring to the sight of the liberal primers who preceded him.
"Like the liberals who preceded us, we have changed our minds in order to change challenges into a new opportunity for growth and development."
This was one of the last of the still controversial themes of the weekend, which was launched on Friday by a great cocktail that rose by the 50th anniversary of Jean Lesage's approach to the front of the page.
One of the adopted resolutions proposes to disrupt Beauharnos's centre at the Adélard-Godbout's refurbishment.
"From Godbout, who established Hydro-Québec, through Lesage, who carried out the Cold Revolution and the Nationalization of Water Electricity, until after Bouursu, who created James's arrest, proved our side to create the future," Jean Charest said.
At the press conference, he called on another authority, this time conservative, and the program "Roads to the North" by John Diefenbaker, prime minister from 1957 to 1963.
When a line came to the Eastmain1a-Ruper superpower, Charest stressed that its launch was scheduled for 2012.
"I only say it between us, but I have a plan to be there," said his Member States on the basis of which he called for a significant fall.
The prime minister, who said in depth that in 2008 there will be no election, and undoubtedly not even in 2009, did not create an opportunity to vote under the annual year, allowing him the law.
However, he emphasized that his program was a bit boring, especially the Federal Council of China and the Québec-New York Summit.
The weekly meeting provided the heads of liberal platforms for some nationalist resolutions, in particular certain "powers to change the constitution", which have been very cold: PLQ (Liberal Page of Quebec) calls for particular recognition of "Quebek Specificities" in the Constitution.
It is also necessary that Québec appoint a member of the Canadian Council for Radio and Television which would have the right to vote in the case of decisions taken in Quebec.
On the side of the opposition, Plan Sever was in his main ranks to accept sceptics.
PQ (Part of Québecois) Pauline Marois again issued the North Quebec Development Policy, which the Landry government launched in 2001.
According to it, when the liberal government came to power in 2003, the implementation of this policy was achieved.
If she'd been there, "we'd be still today," Marousie would say after her candidates in Jean-Talon (where the elections are going today) François Mercure.
The ADQ said that it supported the adoption of the North Plan in the government.
"We agree, however, that this is not just a feast," explained Sébastien Proulx, leader representing Maria Dumonta, who is returning from the holiday today.
Letters - Destroyed countries
It was Vic Toews, Minister of Justice (on irony) at Harper's Cabinet, who allowed last year to say about Louise Arbour that he represents Canada's "hanbu".
This is how a woman who has led an inexhaustible fight for justice and who deserves all of our admiration tells a lot about the prime minister's environment and about Stephen Harper himself.
We have before us a government that as one of all the Western countries involved, has not returned to the ownership of its national representative, who has been arrested in the Guantánamo concentration camp.
A government that doesn't even take a chance that in the time when the acts were to be taken out of him, Omar Khadr was a young teenager.
The only government that, despite Canada's signing the Women's Convention, signs its word and lets the child soldier go into the Dutch conditions.
The only one who deals with the generation of justice to condemn the guilty.
Let us remember that UNICEF, Amnesty international and, in particular, Canada's Association of Lawyers defend the Republic of Omar Khadra so that justice can be expected in Canada.
The government also closes eyes to torture: little depends on the fact that this young man is primarily psychologically destroyed, and it has undoubtedly continued after so many years of persecution.
We don't realize it, but we're just witnesses of the serious errors of our rights, our freedom and our "democracy", the words that Harper is so excited and that from his mouth he sounds so empty.
The time has come when there is no more morale: it is possible to punish the Canadian citizen, ill-treatment him, to arrest him according to the chief's wishes as a minority government (as it will be after October 14th...).
Many voters believe that they will find a refuge on the side that announces the Honor, the Law and the Order: they do not see this government say what has created our country's reputation and importance.
It's Hanba, Mr. Toews, in this mess, not elsewhere.
Nazory - Orwelovský discourses company Barrick Gold
In his release on 17 September, Le Devor published a letter from Patrick J. Garver, executive vice-president of the Canadian subsidiary Barrick Gold.
With Orwell's logic, it confirms that the largest gold producer in the world has begun the movement of three authors and the poor little burden of oppression, with a view to creating a "transparent public debate" and requires six million of them.
If it is true that the judges are independent and impartial, there is no justice, especially in the case of a violation of the law.
It's not surprising that Garver has completely mixed this basic difference.
Or maybe for Barrick Gold the best way to get a public debate, to get to the mass of anyone who would dare to take a stand against him?
As soon as the process comes, the authors and publishers of the book Noir Canada (Black Canada) will be forced to lose the necessary amounts to be prepared to fight and fight in a very uneven war with the army of lawyers supported by almost-off companies.
The tactics in these inequity wars are most often involved in destroying those who have been charged with the aim of putting forward a peaceful regime that shuts the mouth against the enemy, and is more afraid of anyone who dares to pay for it.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, she had a look at the whole thing to present a public opinion.
In contrast with what is happening in a number of countries where Barrick Gold is causing debate in Canada on normal situations in exchange of thought, and never in pain of clothing.
It was therefore not enough to open its books, documents, and to hold a real debate through news, media, publications and funding of independent scientific teams that could bring light to the whole.
However, Barrick Gold seems to have no confidence in public opinion and rarely rejects petitions and letters in support of the authors of the book Noir Canada.
Perhaps Garver could explain how he could demand "public debate" and, at the same time, would the views of the public be rejected?
It seems that this word in the Vice-President's world represents only highly educated lawyers, not all Canadians; it is quite a taste for this idea.
They have the right to speak in democracy.
Barrick Gold doesn't understand - or he doesn't want to understand - that the public that supports the authors and publishers of Noir Canada does so primarily because it rejects the brutal ways of the company.
The public is prepared to listen and judge, but on the basis of civilized exchanges of arguments, never in the framework of what many consider to be a move, where they must be closed by the alleged mouth (in the context of their "public debate" movement, the Barrick company immediately called on the author of Noir Canada to officially announce that they should stop using this term...).
If we remember Garver's surreal appearance, the movement of Barrick Gold is a direct attack on the universal freedom of worship and truth that are fundamental to every democratic society.
The right to quote reliable sources and to debate facts and interpretations that represent the basis of intellectual activity itself.
If it is in a country like Canada, it is impossible to study and discuss topics that don't like the rich companies of this world without being exposed to repeated trends, who else will be able to do this?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, she could create it if she was guided by the scientific standards used by the authors of Noir Canada.
He's got the right to answer.
The university environment we are dealing with is already able to manage debates and disagreements and resolve conflicts.
The above appeal by Barrick Gold clearly shows that despite what he claims, he does not want to carry out a transparent debate.
For the university world, it is a loss, just as it is for the public debate in Canada, and it is time for governments to take measures that would limit this type of wrong-doing.
Operation on the Wall Street rescue - Democrats and Republicans understand
Bush's administration and delegates to Congress, both republicans and Democrats, finally reached an agreement on the greatest saved economic plan since the Great Depression of the Third Years.
A new version of the plan, such as helping 700 billion US dollars to bridge the financial crisis that has been affecting Wall Street for months, must still be approved by both Congress Chambers.
In particular, it proposes: better control of elected representatives over its application, new mechanisms to ensure payment of paid public funds, new measures to save the number of houses for non-payments and also the right to follow up among paid managers of the secured companies.
US Finance Minister Henry Paulson, shadow representative Nancy Pelosie and representative of the Republicans at the same table, Senator Judd Gregg, announced this good news a few minutes after midnight, after the end of the two-day fellowship maraton.
"We have made great progress and have reached an agreement that will work on the markets," declared Bush's administrative representative, Henry Paulson.
"It was done so that the real economy and the ordinary Americans were safe in front of the crisis just running on Wall Street," the democracy explained.
"This is the basic point: if we don't do it, trauma, chaos and the ruining of American everyday life will be huge," said the Republican Judd Gregg.
During the last few hours, the settlement has expanded to the maximum amount of damage from the fear of the effect which would have to be further reduced to the availability of investors.
The time limit for opening the market this morning was limited.
Both candidates to the American President were invited later and both expressed themselves more to the agreement, without noting their discontent with the need for such a national solution.
Democratic Senator Barack Obama has signed an agreement on certain measures, in particular those aimed at enabling residents to live in the area, and measures on the part of the heads of working States saved by the company.
"When we ask the taxpayers to take special measures because of the incompatibility of some people, there is nothing to be ashamed of.
However, these measures are necessary," he explained on television.
His Republican opponent John McCain, who was asked by another station whether he would vote for the proposed plan, replied, "I would like to see details, but I hope so."
"The rough hair I've read, [shows] that it's about something that we're all going to have to spend and help us move on.
Allowing inaction is short-lived," he said.
The objective of the 700 billion plan is to buy back money for taxpayers, miscellaneous searches and risk and non-producing assets of American financial institutions.
The plan comes after 14 months of the crisis, which was resolved by the bubbles on the property market, which first led to the collapse of the risk mortgage loans (subpries), then transferred to another, broader forms of credit (PCA) and released in the absence of cash and the distribution of banks and financial institutions.
The first proposal for an agreement from last week shall be made by the Republican Ambassador.
Since the moment the democratics have agreed that for some "toxic" activity of a society with problems, the government will just hand it over, but will not buy it, he is convinced that the state of affairs is blessed.
In an effort to bring together the balanced views of the Congress, it was agreed that the government would be able to impose new payments that would help it recover if the programme had to reimburse costs for five years.
The new plan shall be calculated with the sum of the first amount of 250 billion, which may be added to another 100 billion if the President considers it necessary.
The additional 350 billion would be approved by the Congress in a new vote.
Instead of helping Washington, he will receive shares in saved companies that will pay dividends in the event of profit and will be able to sell again when it is all over.
The Federal Government will have the opportunity to delay the procedures for the entertainment of property related to the loans concerned, as well as to set limits for the higher assessment and compensation paid to the executives of the companies.
The planners would like to make a vote in the shadow representatives already today and in the Senate in the middle.
Despite all the efforts put forward, it is not yet certain that their plans will be green.
Last night, both in the Republican and in the Democratic Republican camps continued to vote against this project.
"It is quite obvious that Washington does not listen to you," said Mr. Scott Garrett, member of the Financial Commission of Snow.
"Ano, we have a serious financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
However, it is not a solution to make payments."
Democratic representative Brad Sherman, coordinator of a group of congressmen who is a "sceptic committee", presents the whole thing differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
"The four respected professors of the economy, including the three Nobel Prizes, wrote to us: we ask Congress not to go too far and carefully examine the way out," he said yesterday.
At the same time, Europe once again confirmed that this crisis is a global crisis.
After the end of the extraordinary meeting, three countries notified Beneluxu partial nationalisation of the Fortis banking group of 11.2 billion euros (16.3 billion USD).
The intervention of the Government of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg became necessary after the French bank BNP Paribas announced that it was withdrawing from the purchase of its competitors, which has been on the decline since it lost 2 billion euros (2.9 billion dollars) due to the crisis of risk credits on the purchase of property in the United States.
Fortis employs 85 000 people, which is between the twenty largest European banks and the ten largest insurance companies.
"We won't come here about this money," declared the Dutch Finance Minister Wooter Bos yesterday.
"To pay we get voluntary rights in the bank and influence.
And it's just a driver and a housekeeper today that's not sure to be able to evaluate."
On the other side of the La Manche channel, it seems, the British government has begun to create another banks that have been hit by the financial crisis.
According to the British press, the government had to take over all existing bank loans Bradford and Bringley, of which more than 41 billion (75.5 billion dollars) were created for the purchase of property.
According to his previous notice, he buys customers' fields and accounts from the British Bank of Spain, Santander Bank.
Bradford and Bringley will be the second bank after Northern Rock, which the British government has to be born from the beginning of the financial crisis.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of socialized icons
His beauty with the tears of his eyes for a long time represented his trumpet, according to other weaknesses.
Did this American hero come out with a shocking smile on Narcissism?
Yes and no.
Steadfastness, sensitivity, and non-exhaustive talents, which were his own, also removed him from a violent category that produces real stars.
What a long way to go, though!
Paul Newman died on Friday in 83 years on his wound in Connecticut as a result of the cancer of the lung and remains one of the last icons of American cinematography in recent years.
Less larger than Brandon, who was similar and for a long time his rival on film, Newman was a more careful priest, certainly a sinful man, but also an apostle of freedom and dissociation of the dramatic conventions.
A mixed blood often produces beautiful children.
Born in Ohio in 1925, his father was a German Jew and a native of Hungary.
Among these European roots was one of the famous forms of the American dream.
No translucent ega, which is the last mark of quality.
Because it looked at this whole country that loved itself made man, a warrior in the war in the Pacific, wounded in a battle that he had studied heretic in Yale in early 50s, then visited the New York Actor's Studio and celebrated triumph in the theatre, in television and entertainment in the film.
The same man who fought for civil rights was also a car driver who was appointed second in the 24-hour Le Mans competition in 1979, as well as a sexual symbol, although since 1958 he has created an exemplary couple with the hero Joanne Woodward.
It also leaves the dark places of this hidden, discrete, socially engaged stars, allergic to the practice of own show-business, which will always remain to a certain extent.
An obedient person, in the highest sense of meaning.
From Paul Newman's departure this week, he made the film come back to lovers, while his great role together coincides with a black memorial.
After that, more than half a century is still changing American seventh art.
In the memory of the charming fight from Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969), a young man who refuses his meaningful wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in the Coce on the explosive blast, adaptation of Tennessee Williams in 1958.
From less long ago (1990) we are preparing for his dear Mr. Bridge, who was overwhelmed by a marriage that did not meet all expectations.
So many other Paul Newmans were in trouble.
Boxer Rocky Graziano, strong, memorable delicate from Somebody Up There Likes Me (In a sense of hate) Robert Wise, a role appointed for James Dean, taken after his death, which in 1956 Newman introduced in real knowledge.
Sympathetic gangster in The Sting (Podraz), Oscar for the best film in 1973.
The charming and glamorous Christmas player in The Hustler Roberta Rossena (1961), also becomes the founder of The Color of Money Martina Scoresese, which brings him the only Oscar with seven nominations in 1987.
This face traveling years, it was him.
And he's back.
In his professional drive, he's dealing with different ages.
Her young are primarily known by the cultural Slap Shot George Roye Hilla (1977) for the role of Reggie Dunlop, a non-traditional hockey coach.
The fans met him again in 1994 in The Hudsucker Proxy of the Coenov brothers.
He then turned his career on the role of the Kmotra Irish mafia in Road to Perdition Sama Mendese in 2003.
Unlike a few film legend who almost gave up the business, Newman remained in the long-term industry, perhaps taking Hollywood away from his achievements, appearances and achievements.
French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier, never humoured her, considered "the living challenge of subplaying", the judgment that in his performances he pushed too much pressure on the pilot.
For the beautiful Paul Newman, whose role they played as a rebel, the prophecy was not always so fair.
The first lovers, however, played less often than outsiders: neurotics, alcoholics, lupus and zupals, whose fall and seizures reflected in his perfect hair.
As director Newman, he has left a little known page of his sensitivities.
His film Rachel, Rachel from 1968 (based on the novel Canadian Margaret Laurences), in which his wife, Joanne Woodward, played the leading role of a sensitive female portrait full of melancholy.
To his son Scott, who lost his son because of the surrender, in 1984 film Harry and Son, was a full-scale study and grief.
In the ceremony that Newman received yesterday, his great friend and former associate Robert Redford (played in The Sting and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) warmly declared: "His presence made my life and this country better."
The beauty, love for life, these are the main characteristics of the dead priest.
If we remember his legendary career, there's also a great warrior for civil rights, ecologicals, independent film, Hollywood's disaster.
We used to see his face on the bottle - shaped octopus, the oyster, the cucumbers, and other foods, which may have seemed quite uncomfortable to us, even though the beginning was about gas.
However, the profits from the sale went to his Christmas gift account for a hard childhood.
Newman did, rather than let himself become famous, for the last time he engaged in the company.
He left his five daughters with a letter containing the news: "Always and until the end your father was grateful for his happy planet.
I felt like I could be here."
And for us, it was worth watching the life drive of such a clear and generous American artist.
And in addition, the end of the city is an outstanding city.
What was done in the factory at Zuschlag & sex.?
On Monday, 8 October, the criminal proceedings against Janis Zuschlag and his colleagues began.
Policy and its partners are other criminal acts, including the distribution of lists, accused of a double-length and systematic criminal organisation, resulting in excessive damage.
According to the prosecutors, the money obtained in public competitions for their own purposes and the performance of tasks was often evidenced by fictional factors.
The money from state and self-government - a total of about 65 million Forints - traveled to Fiatal Baloldal's subsidiary organization, to the individual's cape.
The way in which the investigating authority was also informed was that the money obtained in public competition was selected on the basis of a fact that there was no real contradiction, and the commitments that were accepted have never been obtained.
Unfortunately, a large part of the bill was false.
The prints of these invoices came from the Yösefváros market, the golden extract was made in Kiskunhalasi.
On behalf of the company which has a invoice to carry out, the decision was taken on the other side of the road along the north coast of Balaton, to which István Ladose Janos Zuschlag sent.
According to his statement, he was first named to look at the pensions and restaurants.
He asked for accounts for his own consumption, according to which the invoices submitted after the public contests were issued outside the Ministry of Youth and Sport, the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs, respectively, of the capital city of Samospra.
The fact that the majority of István Lados were present with his colleague Andrés Žórim, who, according to our information, wrote the reports needed for the acquisition of subsidies.
On his "study trip" Lados looked at a pivot.
According to two invoices issued by Zuschlagem and its partners in 2003, this host treatment facility was provided for the Nineteenth Group of Biztos Pont.
Many people would not have come to this facility at once, according to the company’s firm’s claim.
In the same way, the formal and comprehensive errors of the bill presented in 2002 led to the award of Jobb for the Day of Judgment, later by Együtt and Harmadik Évesred.
There were only three bedrooms, more than ten people could not sleep one night, although there were about thirty guests on the invoice.
The authors of the press with the rich fantasy also took it when they pointed to evidence from the company that was also accused of hosthood - Pigal s.r. o., in which the invoices provided to the state representatives of documents bearing the name of Jobb Jözőert and Hoppa were not included.
The head of the firm, Mr Farkas for hvg.hu, pointed out that when they called him to the prosecutor and showed him the facts, he immediately knew it was false documents.
"The name of our company and our tax number were on the wrong place."
As he added, in addition to the formality, it did not even indicate that hundreds of people lived by the invoices, but only eleven rooms do not have such a great capacity.
In addition, the invoices were also subject to treatment, with their restaurants no longer functioning for a long time.
The producers of the invoice did not even testify to the fact that a visible Buddhist road office only organises foreign roads, and on the invoice with cash, which was also incompatible with the invoice practice of the company, they indicated their travel as a service to centralise the road through Hungary.
In addition, as a result of the investigation, they also indicated in the DPH document that the organisation of the road to the country outside the European Union may have been exempted from DPH.
In the four documents presented, Jobb Jözőrettė Hotel Révfülöp s.r. o. did not agree with any other than DPH. The company does not include the said 25 per cent, about 15 per cent DPH, except for the fact that the hotel's staff had only printed invoices, but the invoice was written by hand.
However, the "supply" factor may have been distorted by the fact that in one firm, it was noted that the investigation of State representation was carried out as a performance of road transport of goods that the company was originally not carrying out on investment advice.
The fact that the invoices were issued by Együtt and the Harmadik Évered for and for the tribes XXI. The cultural heritage of Egyesulet and Biztos Pont also proved false because of formal deviations - the inadequate format of invoices and the wrong solution.
In the case of Ravenna k. or the Sports Camp in Kunfehertó, whose representatives announced that the invoices would be issued.
For example, the participants did not even realize that HIB s.r. o. from Nyíregyhazy was in the time (2001) when a group of Fiatal Városert, in liquidation, claimed that according to our information, the liquidity commissioner of the company also claimed that the paper would be issued.
Facts were presented with knowledge
The second group of invoicers is those who knew they had to produce a fixed invoice.
Nadace Esély Budapest has provided four million Forts for the award of Armadik Éveredrecht at the request of the organisation Fiatal Baloldal - Ifjj Socialist.
Collab s. r. o., the head of the Collab, according to the complaint of the issue of a fixed account, was one of the accused Ludovic Györfi.
Zuschlagem and its partners also worked with Biogate s.r. o, currently in liquidation, which in 2003 received Jobb Jözőret and the Atlas and Vörösfeny's invoices in the value of the sum of five million forts that were not actually the economic activity.
Neither the movement of money, because the invoices created were later stolen, which the organizations have forgotten to include in their documents.
The other group of invoice companies belongs to those who were involved in complaints.
For example, Ivan Kubatov was a trusted representative of the Ukrainian CEO of Delta Trió s.r. o., who is engaged in trafficking in slums and motor vehicles, with a seat in Budapest, where the company is not available.
In October, November and December 2005, the company presented several invoices for the sale of accounting technology at a value of approximately 18 million forts.
According to the investigation, these invoices were purchased by the Cash Investment company, which was liquidated from 14 September 2005.
One company was a man from Romania who was supposed to deliver letters to the company in the years 2002-2005 as well as Ivan Kubatov.
As we know, Kubatov admitted during the investigation that on behalf of the company he issued invoices to members of Atlasz, Hoppa and the dedication of Egyyyut and Harmadik Évered for himself and accepted their opposition.
At the request of Ivan Kubatova, the Romanian walls were founded by Fa-Bani Jos Faipari s. r. o. and Jos-Investment k. s.
Actually, not even one of the companies worked, according to the alleged lack of work.
However, the companies were very prosperous because at the request of the Associated Counsel of the Holy See, who also prepared their depositary letters, issued the name of the firm of invoices to Atlasz and Y-Generacy related to Zuschlag.
In the name of the company Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade gave the Kubatov organisation a total of 15 invoices worth 14.2 million Forints.
The State authorities found that Cubatov had come to 10 per cent of the figures and DPH.
For the exhibition of fictional invoices, this time for the selection of Biztos Pont, he also used Szi-Beri k.t.
Spolky Y-Generation and the Society and Modern Magyarszägäg for Modern gave proposals to Nadace Mihalye Táncsicse (TMA) in January 2006 to the public competition.
It was obtained by 500 thousand forints, but the amounts did not represent the objectives set out in the proposals.
In order not to reveal this, the TMA submitted five fictitious invoices from the Workings Team s.r. o.
These invoices were last found during the home visit to Árpád Kemexei's office at the Ministry of Education.
Some of the suspects are likely to describe the production of invoices, as has already been done on the procurator.
Interestingly, if you decide to reveal everything to the chief suspect, János Zuschlag.
His record of endurance is not too detailed, and although he has many times promised that he will do so, he has not done so.
The question is whether it is in his interest - to replace a large portion of the damage, a dozen million Forints, maybe socialists have concluded a deal with him, and Zusi will take it on himself.
He could also have been injured, since his request to remedy the conditions of his detention, as well as to put him in prison, remained unexploded.
While friends of economic criminal acts, who have committed much more damage that have not been committed recently, can freely pass on or at least wait for the end of the ruling against them in their homes, he does not have this opportunity.
Psychology trumpeting: why do we lose more money?
At prices, customers are willing to spend more money, to reassess goods.
The neurological and economic foundations of this well-known - and apparently irradiational - behavior have been able to identify researchers from the neurology and the economy of the New York University.
According to their studies published in Science magazine, people don't want to stay in competition with the type of eBay auction, so they'd rather pay too much.
A study of experimental auctions has tried to map the scheme of this "play" in the nervous system.
One group of volunteers satail, another group participated in food auctions, with methods of functional magnetic resonance (fMRI) tested the active area of the brain of test subjects.
In both games, participants were able to win the money, even when playing on the auction, with the important first to overcome the other side, he began to work intensively all that was under the brain core, called the strip.
This brain area plays in addition to many other functions in the "self-adchangement" mechanism of the nervous system.
Therefore, it is possible for researchers to explain their efforts to avoid a striatous reaction.
In support of their theory, members of the research team conducted a number of economics financial cross-border investigations.
In his case, three groups were licensed against one partner under different conditions.
The control group was simply informed of the real value of the product concerned and they made cuts.
Other members were also promised that if they left the game won, they would receive another $15.
The third group received $15 in advance of the sale, even in the event of damage, its members also received the money.
Thus, the difference between the two groups began to be shared by all in that one was highlighted the win and the other win.
The members of the "opposite" group were still willing to go up above that was in the control and "vehicle" group, which confirms the hypothetosis of neurologists.
"These results cannot be derived from any existing economic theory.
To this day, they have explained the challenge of paying attention to the joys of victory and avoiding risk.
Until neurological education methods helped us solve the gap between these two theories so that we have now reached the third explanation," Andrew Schotter, professor of economics at the New York University.
Hepatitis: When are you looking for a doctor?
About half a billion people worldwide suffer chronic hepatitis B or C infection, and in Hungary, this chronic liver disease has been reported among the main causes of death.
The number of domestic cases of hepatitis infection is estimated at a hundred thousand, but only seven thousand of them are treated. The reason is that patients often do not know that they are being treated.
The name hepatitis is included in the designation of infectious liver damage caused by various viruses.
In their symptoms there are a lot of similarities, which is characteristic of eating liver and schleutek, all the causes of disability and their causes of illness are better than each other.
Hepatitis viruses are spread by two main methods: hepatitis A and E in traction equipment (e.g. infected foods, water), hepatitis B, C, D and other blood and body fluids (semi, bone secretions, salts).
Travellers should in any case be protected by the expectation of A and B virus, with no vaccine type C virus.
The signs of hepatitis A occur two to three weeks after the use of infected food, usually due to nausea, nausea, chest problems, vomiting.
Then the skin and the eye whites create a glass, a bright chair and a dark power. Treatment can last two to three weeks.
Each year, millions of people worldwide die from this type of disease, liver cancer and liver surgery caused by hepatitis B.
The main reason is that according to the estimates, only every tenth of the prescribed medicinal product is treated.
Hepatitis C may also have very serious consequences: if not treated, it may lead to liver surgery or cancer of liver.
Most of those who have been taught about their disability don't even know, the source of the disability does not have liver tumors gradually, so the first signs will be delivered in many cases up to 20-30 years.
That is why it is very important to prevent temporary accidents, to carry out regular depravity.
In three groups, this disease occurs much more frequently than in the average: among people who had blood transfusions before 1991, among drug users and among people with tattoos.
At the same time, the estimated worldwide number of individuals infected with chronic hepatitis C 200 million is increasing.
Since the disease can be demonstrated by a routine laboratory examination, a person should be informed of any evidence of an unknown origin to contact his or her practical doctor.
In time, the disease is treatable, the virus can be removed from the body and thus prevented from detecting the presence of cancer.
On 30 September, the World Day of Hepatitis, which was organized by the world’s first World Health Organization in 2004.
His goal is to warn of chronic liver damage caused by these viruses, the cause of his symptoms, and the importance of temporary recognition of disability.
Who believes in God, doesn't that hurt so much?
As a result of recent research, belief in God serves as a certain analgesics that could ease the death of already Catholic torturers.
The researchers from Oxford University conducted an interesting experiment, researching how human faith in God is affected by disease, reported the British daily Telegraph.
Within the framework of an extraordinary study, 12 Catholic believers and the same number of atheists were exposed to electrical shocks, while all observed the painting depicting Mrs. Mary.
As a result, Catholic faiths were able to eliminate a large portion of the disease.
Thanks to the techniques specifically studied by the human brain, Catholics have also been able to activate this part of their brain, which is responsible for the control of disease.
The research is the first of the series of fears that are shared by academics and scientists, philosophers and theologians from various parts of the university.
A complete test was performed in such a way that it was added to the left hand of the test entity by a drawing tool that issued electrical shocks.
The researchers asked the participants to take note of the two pieces: the Sassoférat of Ms. Marie coming from the 17th century and the Dam with the banner of Leonardo da Vinci, signed in the 15th century.
The researchers hoped that the view of Mrs. Mary would lead to a certain form of worship, while Vinci’s image was chosen because it was not the first time that he was so ill-treated and influenced by them as a comforting experience.
The test entities spent half an hour in MRI scanners and during this period they obtained four parts of the following 20 electroscopies, while separately monitoring the picture with a religious or current theme.
The Catholics found that in the eyes of Mr. Mary, they felt "in security," as if they were "old" and "caught, filled with peace."
In observing the image with the religious theme, they felt 12 percent less pain than they had before them.
Psychologist Miguel Fararias, who also participated in the study, is believed to have a similar effect with any powerful influence on the Atheist, only the right photo should be found.
"We should find a picture that will be very positive, from the position of mother or father," said a psychologist.
English Bishop Tom Wright welcomed the results of the research.
"The practice of faith should change and in many cases also change our personality," Wright added.
After such great results, it is only a question of what effect it would have on the regulation of the disease of believers if they were shown some Madonna from Leonard or the painting of a similar caliber.
Would the quality view of Mrs. Marii mean even better results?
You're what you're gonna share.
Google can report on its tenth birthdays that people can find it in their pockets at least as well as in the sky above their head; they know where they were allowed to go, what kind of research goes on and what is interesting.
According to Erica Schmidt, one of the company's bosses, it's still not enough.
As far as sceptics, making parallels with Orwell's dark vision, this is not a clear basis for the 2.0 web.
Eric Schmidt recently expressed to the Commissioner for Financial Times that the main purpose of Googlu is to collect more personal data about users, which is necessary to enable the Googlu depositors to keep their original purpose, which he said, "Let's organize all information on the world!"
According to the representative of Googlu, after ten years of global work, she was able to work with all the information.
On a question that will take five years, Schmidt replied that he would like Google to answer the questions of the type "What should I do tomorrow?" or "What work would she do for me?" - on such seemingly simple questions as well as software would not be able to answer until they know enough information about users.
Not all Internet users know well that the search terms are exactly quoted during the search on the Internet and what IP addresses have been searched and on which sites have been moved by interested parties after the search.
Thanks to the Service Personalized Search started two years ago, users can, for example, retain their surfing history, see again what they were looking for and what they were calling, and then, in a long-term perspective, they generate the findings that are adapted to many more directly to them - on the same logic will also include the Service Recommendations, through which the system will offer products and services based on previously mentioned and maintained preferences.
What if my data will be used against me, what if someone looks at me, what am I doing?
In most cases, the potential power represented by the company is more likely to increase, the anti-reaction does not cause drug awareness users, fear of abuse, free flow or even opposition to power.
This is confirmed by the fact that all the expressions sought are not only quoted, but in the case of reasons, third parties may also be issued, in such legal cases the privacy rights of Internet users are not protected.
The most recent example was the coordinated action against Brazilian pedophiles, during which Google provided information that enabled the identification of pedophiles from Orkut’s community sites, organized by its means.
However, Internet users who are afraid of privacy rights could still be released in May when a hand company with an EFF organisation successfully proved its right to dispute with the FBI: Google must not be so bound by any future article of the Constitution in order to provide any information requested by the FBI.
(At the same time, the federal government has successfully fought almost twelve thousand web addresses and thousands of search-in expressions, which received a call for strengthening the child protection law years ago, although it failed to obtain a list of individual users' posts, the full list of websites and keywords covering the period of two months.)
The view of Google is so dissociable: it is welcomed by those who are afraid to provide their personal data, because they feel that their intimate sphere and personal life will be used by Googlu services, exposed to loans, and come against it with a revolution, which belongs to an international company with a conservative image.
And yet, the American geek culture and its wild retina, composed around itself of computer fans, activists and users, appearing in many countries, sees a new generation of giants, "corporation, which is now fragile", in contrast with its Microsoft river, considered by Windows for the world's recipients, as they both fight for the same purpose.
This can be caused by the fact that Google, unlike Microsoft, does not require the identification code of its users and does not want money for its applications; an open, free and permanent clean source of information and software packages make it much more accessible, younger, "more" than the practice of official software work.
This can also be caused by the fact that geeks understand very clearly the very problematic relationship between the Internet and personality rights, which brought with them just one of the most exclusive keywords in recent years: web 2.0.
The web 2.0, however, is nothing but cooperation, the fact that we deliberately leave our feet behind and use the communication channels that we have available, and although their size is in each other, the foundation remains the same: we show.
An average young person can upload the profile right away on a few community pages from Facebook via Xangu, which can quietly work with other services, such as Twitter or application last.fm, recording to them the music that is listening to, all of which can be applied to navigation systems such as FriendsFed or Blip.fm, besides which you can write a blog that will automatically display its latest photos that are posted on Flickr or Picase.
At the same time, we can learn about a lot of examples from which it explains: a friend in the morning looking at the flood photos of fellow friends will easily come to what her jealous friend has spent the night, or the company can tell his employer just because his blog raises his sincere opinions about top leadership: one is sure, the concept of a private life has been completely overrated today.
The one who lives online is determined by what he shows himself, so we can define the basics that hide behind today's youth behavior.
And whoever wants to escape or at least avoid googlos monopole has the option (the Scrooglem, which is used by the Google search system, is still not deliberately abandoned).
A small number of people, for example, are not registered on community pages so it is not possible to find them. Online Google applications from the text editor via the photo editor and the news portal can be converted into alternative versions that are not linked to the front of the server park and which does not make up the best possible profile for us.
You haven't made public changes in secret is waiting for Google to show you a toothbrush.
The subsidy has its current value of $156 billion higher than IBM ($140 billion), Intel ($124 billion) or Coca Cola ($110 billion), in-storey areas AdWords/AdSense threaten the investment of advertising agencies and services that continue to make life more difficult for Microsoft, but also for other software designers.
However, critical observers also find discrepancy that has led to a disturbing conclusion: for example, the top management has completely rejected employees' protests after the fact that the double-rate wage for the company school, the voluntary frequent day-care of employees has been too expensive according to the company's leadership, all of which has been lost in the fact that Google was still hiding before the Chinese government in 2006 and in the meaning of their agreements, every finding that comes to good taste, in the interests of the Chinese regime.
One of the internal rules of the company says that it will never create new services before, even when it can be used, but it is certain that the expected problems of the following months and years can move the world to new places: while some think that the Googlu project is intended for the planning and archiving of books and magazines such as that the company will soon have to do with the U.S. Supreme Court, another fear of its health system, in which we can also set up a complete own health profile with previous readings.
The fact that Google is a genetic database, then it can serve as a good source of material and for the next generation of scis-fi writers, the famous novel Cory Doctor "Scroogled" describes the future of the Orwell Reminiscences, in which a person can easily get closer only with Google's data.
A double murder from Ozdu helped to remove the feet of two young people
Two young people listened to the police in the case of a double murder in Ozdu, which, according to reasoning, helped with the removal of this criminal act, said in a speech by the District Police Department of Borsod.
The persons suspected have been found and are at present accused of assisting in criminal proceedings.
Two young people, according to the MTI information, two girls are released.
Aid to criminal proceedings shall be punished by the withdrawal of liberty for a period of up to 5 years.
A 23-year-old man suspected of a double murder in Ozdu, was taken to a temporary relationship on Sunday.
It is suspected of a criminal offence before the planned multiple-war murder on the grounds that it is due.
During the study, it was found that a 23 - year - old man owed 53 - year - old a larger amount to a man.
He apparently did not want to pay his debt, so he sent his fellow believer off the road to a runaway in Ozdu, where he killed the first man and then his nine-year-old daughter.
According to information from the MTI, the young man prepared to rescue a criminal act before testify that the murder had saved a gun hidden in the scene of the crime.
The weapon and the circumstances of its use are examined by police officers.
Warsaw's bourgeois made a offer to buy prairies
Two hundred million euros - about five billion Czech crowns - offered the Warsaw Stock Exchange for the purchase of a percentage of stock exchanges.
Ludwik Sobolewski, president of Warsaw's securities exchanges, confirmed the offer made by the Polish side and despite the fact that the Czech Warsaw bridge from the area of the possible new owners of the Prague exchanges had already emerged.
The reason is that the owner of the Warsaw Bridge is state.
99 per cent of the stock is in the hands of the Polish State, which has sold more than 60 per cent of the securities for several months.
According to the Czech economic debt E15, Poland's offer represents the highest amount that was offered to the Prussian borough.
According to Czech letters, the offer has been offered by a video stock exchange of securities, a trans-Atlantic stock exchange of Nasdaq, New York Stock Exchange, a London stock exchange and Deutsche Börse.
The head of the Prague Stock Exchange Peter Koblic announced last week that the Warsaw Stock Exchange would be the worst new owner of all stakeholders, and did not assume that it could lead to the dance of the Prague Stock Exchange in the future.
The value of Prague's securities exchanges is estimated by experts on the share markets to be 5-10 billion.
According to the shareholders' agreement, about 90 per cent of the shares could be sold.
The largest owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is the investment bank Patria Finance with approximately 25 per cent, followed by Czech friendly 14.7 and Tiger Holding Four S. a. r.l. with 13.5 per cent.
On the financial crisis from the perspective of the European Charter
In its yesterday comments, the international financial crisis is already reminiscent of the previous European lists on Tuesday, 11 September.
As a global financial disaster, we can thank the President of the United States, who is accused of the Roman Republic. The President was not even able to reach his own side in support of the early draft of the law, whose aim is to correct this desperate situation...
Instead of Pearl Harbor, who reminded the billionaire and investor Warren Buffett, we could talk more about the second September 11th.
Some of the Madrid prints also see wines in Washington.
According to Denis El Mundo, the world economy has led to a lack of political leadership after the collapse.
The dangerous collapse of the U.S. financial system continues to grow, for which the whole world will eventually be paid.
Bush's plan has not been successful, however, after voting in Congress, it is dangerous that Washington does not offer a political solution to the crisis.
The world economy rises in the air - just at the moment when one of the biggest changes in capitalism takes place.
The threat can't be forgotten anymore, shows the female poet Tages-Anzeiger.
The United States of America can now proceed with the saving of the money institutions and the taxpayers can save it before the crash.
However, if other banks are turned down as the cost of the domain, they will no longer have enough funds or other improvisations.
In a long-term perspective, Member States of the European Union need to transfer their national self-esteem and coordinate control over the various financial markets.
Only on Monday did the existing financial institutions get more than 100 billion euros, notes the Der Standard, according to which fears are that, like the Americans, they will have to go deep into the pockets and the European tax taxpayers, they will continue to be more real.
The European Union is facing a crisis, which, as a result, is facing an old continent that has not been seriously left behind.
"Suppliers" must not immediately have the stamps of the euro, but it would be good if they firmly established, in which case it would be reasonable to borrow money from taxpayers to make further damages.
Intelligent car imitates the summer of the winter
What would be the best way of developing technologies capable of preventing war without the imitation of detectors of obstacles to the world of nature?
For example, at school.
The strategic idea of the surprising project, presented at the Japan CEATEC headquarters, has attracted engineers from the Nissan dymelaci company. It was about how to set up a new generation of anti-war systems.
In collaboration with such a university, Nissan has built a biometric robotic system of the BR23C type management, a robotized mini car equipped with the properties of the master, with the ultimate objective of helping to create a system that can eliminate all conflicts.
"During the summer each train will create its own personal space for the weather, which is actually very similar to our safety belt," explained Kazuhiro Doi, the general director of the technology PR and research and development field.
They play an important role in the complex eye that enables them to see in all directions in a narrow space of more than 300 degrees.
In order to suppress the function of the complex eye, engineers were able to detect a laser remote.
This shall identify obstacles in the distance up to 2 metres before the BR23C in a 180-degree field, calculate their distance and send a low-duty microprocessor signal, which shall immediately be converted into an operation aimed at preventing the injury.
The stop is caught during the middle of the second half, after the robotized car starts to imitate the movements of the wheels and the rounds as necessary to prevent the soldier immediately from changing the direction.
Unlike any existing system, this exciting manager is simply in an instinctive way.
"If that wasn't the case, the robotic car wouldn't be able to react too quickly to prevent it," explains Toshijuki Ando, leading the Laboratories and the project of the robotic car.
It must react instinctively and immediately, as this technology reflects the most vulnerable and the most internal type of safety barrier within which the conflict is currently considered inevitable.
The whole process has to reflect what she's doing to get away with another one.
This process must not last longer than the eye's dark.
However, in contrast with the principle, this movement cannot be directed up, down or down, only by two-dimensional directions, and only in a direction that can be circled around the car.
In the case of a robotic car, only the possibility of reverse motion, acceleration and deceleration was used, instead of the endless opportunities offered to be offered in the avoidance.
BR23C uses lithium polymer accumulators that are light and have a higher energy density, which means they have more life than lithium-iontic variants.
According to Ando, there is an important instinct, intelligent response, no ability to process, so less data storage.
This mechanism must be processed and responded only to a few incoming signals after the second.
There is no need to keep it and respond to it through intuition logic based on data from previous manoeuvres, so only a few kilobytes remain in use.
You do not need to remember the giga- or megabyte capacity.
It is the first step towards developing technology for immediate recovery which, according to Nissan's report, could be achieved in serious vehicles within ten years.
Another possibility of application may be to connect the unit to the GPS satellite navigation system, which, after being avoided, would lead the engine to the intended final target.
Damn dear child already has a name.
The law on the savings of the economy in the amount of $700 billion, which must be distributed to several payments and whose objective is to recover non-qualified loans from the bank, already has a written form.
In the first row, half of the amounts will be used.
After further meetings, which ended until Saturday after midnight in the United States of America, representatives of the Congress reached agreement in a few days during the ongoing debate on a rescue package totalling $700 billion, the Reuters agency sent.
"We have made significant progress," declared Nancy Pelosie, democratic president of the shadow representatives, according to which only the signing of the agreement remains.
The compromise on the package was also supported by both the presidential candidates Barack Obama and John McCain.
Finance Minister Henry Paulson announced the outcome of the compromise: "The programme will work and will be effective, but further steps must be taken."
A written version of the package was published before the opening of Asian markets on Sunday at 8 o'clock of the Washington Time (then on Monday at 2 o'clock in the morning of the Central European Time), and no special entry to the cities was made.
On the proposal for a legal standard, on behalf of the Economic Stability Act 2008 which is to be set up, will be voted by the shadow representatives first Monday and will then be held at the Senate.
President George W. Bush spoke to Pelosie on Saturday evening, after the report of the agreement was also received at the White House.
"With the progress made at night, we are calm and highly valued both sides of our financial markets and the protection of our economy," said the White House spokesman Tony Fratto.
Finally, the programme differs from the original Bush administrative proposal, which should cover the purchase of non-quality securities guaranteed by mortgages at the same time totalling $700 billion.
It is now possible to lose at least half the amount of 700 billion in the first round, so that 250 billion will be used immediately after what is expected in the decision-making sub-conference, and the finance ministry will buy them valuable papers for mortgages that are valued as non-qualified, the remaining $100 billion will then depend on the president's decision.
The programme will be controlled by the Special Assembly, which will also be chaired by the President of the Federal Reserve Bank.
The deployment of the second half of $700 billion will depend on the next decision of the Congress.
The Ministry of Finance can use a combined tactic within the meaning of the law: it can buy at the same time non-qualified loans, mortgages and securities secured by mortgages, and other "encumbered" credits.
The deduction may be carried out within the auction and directly, by the competent representatives of the ministry.
The legal standard enables the undertaking concerned to participate in the insurance programme in which the Ministry of Finance provides guarantees on the basis of the reason for concern, and the companies will then pay the price corresponding to the above-mentioned damages.
As Henry Paulson said, the law provides the necessary means to meet the urgent requirements of the U.S. financial system at up to $700 billion, whether it comes to the extensive purchase of the wrong funds, their insurance or the prevention of the system's risk associated with the deterioration of some of the large financial institutions.
"We will take the necessary steps to be prepared to introduce the law as soon as it is signed," he added.
The chief banks who have been in trouble and are waiting for state aid, however, can count on the government to reduce their distance - which is simply called a "goldfall".
To limit their costs will only come in certain cases, but these will depend on the aid provided to the ministry.
The limitation in principle means that if the ministry buys under the auction, a tax rate will be imposed on the gold banks if the bank's directors are not sent directly to the debt.
In the case of direct repurchase of non-quality loans, the government is aggressively in favour of not being transferred to management funds.
It is necessary to add that there are no changes in existing contracts of gold deposits, only the contracts of new ones, which should be another incentive to participate in the programme.
"It is the first case in the American history when there will be legal restrictions on the remuneration of general directors," the chairman of the Committee for the Financial Services of the shadow representatives, Democrat Barney Frank.
In addition, the State in the participating banks shall have the right to acquire a share which reduces the risk of taxpayers, as when the economy and the saved bank stand on the feet, they may make this transaction.
The draft plan includes the fact that in the next five years, the President must submit to the Congress a proposal setting out the way in which taxpayers can recover expected losses from the financial sector.
On both sides, of course, voices expressed in connection with the crash plan were raised.
"This is what American citizens have not asked us to do, this is the dollar of taxpayers' withholding," said a Republican congressman from California Darrell Issa.
His democratic colleague from Ohio Mary Capturo's court found that the provisions had been adopted by those responsible for the destruction of Wall Street.
Industrial prices continue to grow
The domestic sales prices in the industry increased by 0.1 per cent in August 2008, compared with 12.9 per cent in 2007 by the Central Statistical Authority.
Export sales prices in the industry were above 1.1 per cent in June 2008 and an average decrease of 3.9 per cent per year.
Production prices in the industry were as a result of changes in the domestic and export prices compared to the previous month higher than 0.7 per cent, an average of 3.2 per cent.
Domestic sales prices in the industry increased by 0.1 per cent in the last month only.
The domestic sales prices in the processing industry also increased slightly by 0.1 per cent compared to the Swedish industry.
The largest price increase occurred in August 2008 in the coal and steel industry sector (2.8 per cent), mainly due to the monthly increase in prices in the steel and steel products sector by 4.6 per cent, respectively by the construction of 2.5 per cent.
The higher price of plastic and chemical raw materials resulted in a significant monthly increase in prices in the production of chemical materials and products (1.6 per cent).
To reduce prices came in the oil processing sector (1.4 per cent), the production of electrical machinery and equipment (0.9 per cent), as well as in the woodworking sector (0.1 per cent).
The prices for paper and publishing and printing activities in the area have not changed.
In other sectors of the processing industry, we planned to increase prices by 0.2 to 0.9 per cent.
In the production and development sector of electricity, gas and water, which has a high mass industry in the Western Hemisphere, increased by 0.3 per cent in August, in particular by an increasing effect of an officially established increase in the prices of oil from 1 July.
In the 12-month comparison of domestic waste in the individual sectors of the processing industry, prices increased mostly in the professional oil processing sector (32.4 per cent).
In the manufacturing sector, it was possible to observe 13,2 per cent of food products, beverages and tobacco products, which have a reasonable weight and then 11 per cent of price increases.
The price decreased in textiles and textile products (2.5 per cent) and in the production of electrical machinery and equipment (0.3 per cent).
In other sectors of the processing industry, the rate of price growth rose between 0.6 and 9.1 per cent.
Overall, prices in the area of the processing industry increased by 10.2 per cent during the last year.
Prices in the production and development of electricity, gas and water have exceeded prices of 18.7 per cent since the previous year.
In the view of the division of the sector, the highest monthly price increase (0.7 per cent) in the sectors remaining in the production of weighted assets was demonstrated in August in the domestic sales.
Prices increased by 0.3 per cent in the production sectors, in the energy of the processing and further processing sectors were not changed due to the previous month.
The largest increase in prices over the same month of the previous year was possible in August 2008 in the energy of the processing and further processing sectors (16.8 per cent).
In the consumer goods sectors, we planned to increase prices by 6.8 per cent, in moderate assets, instead of downsizing by 1.4 per cent.
Export sales prices of industrial products measured in the furnaces increased by 1.1 per cent in August compared to the previous month, by 3.9 per cent in the 12-month comparison.
Our domestic payment over one month has weakened by 1.7 per cent of the euro and by 7.1 per cent of the dollar, compared with August 2007 by 7.5 per cent and by 15.9 per cent of the dollar.
Next year in the United States without a visa?
According to Kingy Güntz, it is a great hope that by January 12th, the American-Madarian Peace Agreement will enter into force, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has talked about it in Chicago before the leaders of the local Hungarian community.
According to her opinion, "now almost everything is all about whether an electronic road permit system will be built in the sea by sea at the time."
She also warned that the part of the new system would not be allowed to enter, and that tourists would have to be allowed to register before leaving.
The representative of the Hungarian diplomat from today continues to attend meetings in Washington.
He meets with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Condolez Rice, who passes the Middle Cross with the Star of the Republic of Hungary on behalf of the Republic of Hungary and conducts talks with a foreign policy adviser to the presidential candidate Barack Obamy and the Republican John McCaina.
Barack Obama and McCain are for a package on a saved bank
Barack Obama and John McCain, presidential candidates of both large American countries, agreed on their support of government bloc to save the bank at $700 billion on Sunday, and there are also policies that require ministers of finance.
After several days of meeting the Congress and the representatives of the administrative authorities were notified on Sunday morning: a basic banking package agreement was concluded.
A financial package aimed at overcoming the Wall Street crisis and the frozen credit market became the central issue of the presidential campaign.
Like Obama, McCain is well identified as a more suitable candidate for the country's economic crisis.
According to the most accurate studies, at the same time as they had reached the front of the economic question, Obama gained a certain benefit again and the McCain's leap, which was guaranteed by the Republican Convention appointing Sarah Palin's Vice-President.
Both expressed the hope that the law on the flag would be adopted at the Congress at 700 billion quickly on Sunday at the pre-convention in Detroit.
He stressed that the proposal contains a passport relating to consumer protection, which also supports.
"We have to go right now, responsible (...) to your places, to the whole industry, to the whole industry, to the stability of the whole economy is dangerous," he said before a 35 thousand tax.
He didn't let himself be given the opportunity to call McCaino's economics old-fashioned.
McCain, in his interview with the ABC TV station, said: "It's all going to be a little bit of a talk... but napping is just not possible."
As the rapporteur of the Republican Senate has pointed out, the proposal describes the Commission's establishment of the Minister for Finance and the limitation of the derogation for the High Representative to which he was subjected.
Both of the CBS stations reported that McCain did not have the most important role to play during the meetings, he himself was in contact with the Minister on a daily basis.
The shadow president, Nancy Pelosie, announced on Sunday that the shadow representatives would vote on the proposal of the law almost Monday.
Review of the German language area
The legal team is undeterred, only the volunteers inside it become more conscious - thus analyzes the poor result of CSU in Bavorsk Der Spiegel.
Hayderovs are ready to rule Rakuusku to prevent red-black coals.
Mirror (spiegel.de)
In the online release of a left German news magazine, Franz Walter, in his article entitled "Bavor revolution burns his father" is the story of the dramatic abuse of CSU.
According to a well-known politician, CSU's errors had begun much earlier than his office had taken over Beckstein-Huber's sad duo.
For decades, Christendom’s Socialists have restored Bavaria - and now these modern citizens are rid of them.
The Middle Ages is a problem for the whole Christian democracy, and for the Angely Merkel.
The debate was not completely surprising for the CSU, but it ended on Saturday, a process that could have been predicted for almost ten years: the end of an unsustainable hegemony of one state party.
Ten years ago, in 1998, CSU reached 47.7 per cent, the first of 50 years under the 50 per cent limit.
This was repeated three years ago in elections to Bundestag in 2005, and still in the so-called Stoiber period.
The reason is the modernization that the CSU has consistently carried out in this country and that fires its parents.
Sociologists have been predicting this for 40 years, but in time they have been very wrong.Secularization, the results of education, the exclusion of the Germans from the East and the north in the developing regions of Bavaria have still not been able to be without the consequences of CSU voters' faithfulness.
Modernization is linked to growth of opportunities, which also has its visible political consequences.
The legal team is undeterred, only the voters within it have become more conscious, more critical, more sensitive.
It is also clear that in recent weeks CSU has become the most popular in classical civil society; people are free to call, live, single with maturitude and high school education.
That's where CSU's support is already broken by 40 per cent.
The printing (depresse.com)
In its article entitled "Who, with whom? The President's party is in the question of coals persistent", the Conservative VD argues that the internal political situation resulting from the French elections.
You've had to deal with the OVP before.
OVP shall order the introduction of SPÖ into its internal affairs.
BZO is known as open to all meetings, Greens still don't want to rely on coalica.
The volleyballs are behind us, now it's all about coalition; in the debate on public television, the president's side has left a lot of attention to their cards.
Mr Werner Faymann confirmed that he had previously spoken with the OVP.
And SPÖ wants to show that cooperation between the two sides is certainly possible - in some partner countries and in social partnerships.
The question is whether to present coalitions and with Wilhelm Multerre, the current president of the OVP, as a vice-president, left Faymann open.
As it turned out, Schüssel-Molterer's course was voted on every floor.
This Directive is not to be taken into account.
Molter responded to the red offer carefully.
As he said, cooperation will certainly not be successful if Faymann tries to intervene in the internal affairs of the OVP.
Whether his party chooses opposition or enters the coalition is still open on the other side, these issues should be addressed in a decisive way within the EVP.
The President of BZÖ Jörg Haider has again been opened to all directions.
"To prevent red-black coals, we're ready to assume government responsibility," said Haider.
Journeys: There is a need to break the contaminated bread of poverty and segregation
In Paris today, the European Summit on Equality, which last year host France, began the current presidential state of the European Union.
Livia Járók, a MEP for the Fides, as one of the main speakers of the professional annual report in her mission, drew attention to the school's segregation, as it is one of the most important legal problems facing Roma children, and also the most important obstacle to their use.
The conference was held on behalf of the French Presidency - Xavier Bertrand, French Minister of Labour and Social Affairs, and Vladimir Špidla, European Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.
For the year, they met among the government representatives, European social partners, the most important European organisations for the protection of rights and civil society in the area of equal opportunities.
According to the press office of the Group of the European Parliaments, Fides Járóková warned that, despite the discrimination resulting from the collection of labour forces, Roma are expelled from the European labour market primarily by their low education.
"The majority of young Roma do not have secondary education and, as a result of poor quality of basic education, can only achieve a higher degree of education without any attention."
The speaker further emphasized that education as a basic human right plays a key role in the application of other human rights.
Investment in early Roma education may mean strengthening the economy of the Member States of the European Union.
According to the delegation, it is necessary to establish the knowledge of these relations in the wider circles - between Roma and non-Roman children.
As soon as that Roma student starts school, he will have a greater chance to become a productive member of the labour market; through income tax and consumer taxes, he will contribute to national budgets.
"Romans need to ensure the right to quality education and to guarantee that they do not accept quality and separate education," added Lithuania Járók.
According to the delegation, the European Union's cooperation with the aim and direction needed to bring about an immediate acceleration of the decentralisation of the school processes is the first step towards ensuring the proper compliance with existing and planned anti-discrimination regulations.
"It is necessary to break the protected root of poverty, segregation and unemployment, to provide Roma children with the opportunity given to democratic space so that they can participate as a full-time citizen in the future of Europe," Járók asked.
Each European Year of Equal Opportunity has the objective of the European Summit on Equality, organized each year since the late meeting in Berlin, to ensure a single forum to help achieve the objectives of equality and to eliminate discrimination at the level of Europe and of individual Member States.
CSU: Temporary grace
The judgment of the consignor of the Huber-Beckstein court shall be finalised at the end of October
The debate on personal issues has not yet been resolved with the remaining electoral debate.
The President of Erwin Huber and the country's Prime Minister Günther Beckstein can still stay in their seats, the question is, as long as this mercy is due.
On the judgment of the Tandem, which suffered a catastrophic 17 per cent loss of votes, the final weekend of the extraordinary Congress of the Party.
In any case, members of a highly criticised tribe were allowed to hear that they would not be silenced by all forces on their posts.
They were thus trying to calm down the mutatis mutandis and fundamentals who, because of the loss of the absolute majority, called for the day after the "bavorous tsunamis" of the export of personal effects.
Five years ago - true, under the direction of Edmund Stoiber at the top of the career - the Christian-social union gained 60.7 per cent, now, year after year against Stoiber, but only 43.4 per cent of its strength was enough.
CSU has been producing 18 per cent of the German GDP "control" in Bavaria for 46 years.
The networks continue to have conservationists in the southern part of the country, which has key importance for the Hungarian economy, high positions, but in the future they will be forced into coalition anyway.
One of the first signs of internal reorganisation is the fact that a member of the team's dedicated intelligence team, which initiates a random coalition of the minority government with the liberal FDP, will also be the President and the Federal Minister of Agriculture Horst Seahofer, who is considered to be the possible Huber's approach.
It is ironic that, at the request of the Free Volunteers, Gabriel Paulov, whose appearance against Stoiber used the Duo Huber-Beckstein to carry out the strike, but then, with ambitious municipal politics, did an unkindly short process.
The leaders of the CSU now focus all their energy on how to stabilize Beckstein.
In the past period, Stoiber also played an active role, which has so far served as the Netherlands's former prime minister, and sometimes the President of the CSU referred to his political career on 28 September at the latest.
On Monday, Huber dropped several travel notes to the CDU address, according to which they would be much more supportive of the sister's side.
Other CSU policies interpreted the breach as a warning for the CDU and Angel Merkel.
Following the elections to the Bundestag in September 2009, Merkel will not be able to become a Chancellor if CSU, which played a significant role in the overall success of 2005, will not be able to put the common forces on its feet.
According to Markel, who has been heavily hiding his injuries due to fatigue, there will be no loss of CSU's negative impact on the Berlin Great Coalition.
What is of course relative: healing the injured CSU will not be easier and the social democracies' crisis will continue.
The SPD has reached Bavaria with 18.6 per cent of the worst result since 1946.
Lukašenko:opose - 110:0
In Sunday's elections, there was no opposition messenger to the Belarusian parliament.
This can be explained by Russian observers in favour and by the stability of the country led by Alexander Lukašenk, as well as by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OBSE) of the illegality of voting.
The Bureau, which sent 450 observers from 43 countries, did not recognize the vote.
Although the 110-member legislative assembly of 10 million countries has been dealing with opposition for well ten years, the opposition gathered on behalf of the United Nations Democratic Force (ODS) before yesterday's elections sincerely hoped that Lukašenko, who left behind the changes in the constitutions in elections during 2006 and the fourth time renewed its presidential mandate, this time "allows" to appear in Parliament several opposition MPs.
The ODS has left the same way since an old-fashioned fight.
In the background of the opposition, the economic situation in Belarus, which has continued to improve in Russia - which has continued to reduce the impact of the injurious Russian imports of land mines, has been believed and contributed to the fact that Beltransgaz, its own-country-owned pipeline, has reached Russia's hands - has sought to improve relations with the European Union, where, due to the white political system assessed as an anti-democratic Lušenko and other high-level policies do not have access to entry permits.
It was previously shown that the OBSE, when assessing the preliminary campaign, was founded on a positive position, and not on the lack of, for example, on the prohibition of a candidate for a third of opposition candidates.
The OBSE's report had already had the benefits of the campaign, while the opposition candidates were not in a position to appear in the press, in particular that the opposition could not be able to count the votes.
At the same time, according to the opposition, only improvements can be felt in the political system: political prisoners have been released on their own, and Minsk is willing to leave with Moscow and to the smaller confrontations, while he continues to refuse to recognize from Georgia the remaining South Ossetia and Abkhazia, perhaps Russia, with which Belarus is formed on the flag of the state, considers these two countries to be independent for a month.
"We did two steps ahead and one back, but most importantly, he started a dialogue between Belarus and the EU," said Alexander Milinkević in our letter.
According to an opposition candidate from the presidential elections in 2006, it is urgent that this remain, even though "the only opposition member of Parliament has been forced to leave".
In view of the results of the opposition, it does not plan to act as a protestary action, but rather tries to provide voters with its report on the need for economic reforms.
"We have, of course, a lot of problems, opposition lists, we have to print in Russia, distribute a cover-up to the local authorities, and yet I see that the change supports as many people as possible, including the elders," Milinkević pointed out with a view that the Lukashenko regime, which, for its greatest success, considers the creation of social security, does not guarantee the right or officially the most supported type of income.
"Because of the debt of the country and the growth of the trade deficit, it is only a matter of time when social security 'invasive silence' comes to an end," judges Milinkević.
Unlike the opposition policy, the Russians of observers were regarded as democratic.
The Head of Community Mission of Independent States Sergey Lebedev, Russian news agency Ria Novosti, said that "people do not believe in words, but in deeds", so the absence of opposition is nothing but evidence of the growth of the Belarusian voters.
Brunetta: "From today's breakfast before work"
It's the first in the history of the Chigi Palace, which was built by the back door at the arrival and departure of employees.
However, from this day on, this new measure will work against the anointed, against what they are sowing and then go to coffee in working time.
The news against the Lennox was presented today by the Minister for Public Administration, Renat Brunetto, and the Secretary-General of the Presidential Council of Maurem Massi.
"The back door - says Brunetta - are a tool for better work, greater efficiency, more presentations and more services," the minister said.
"There is a new period of responsibility and transparency.
It's about reformism," continues Brunetta.
The Chigi Palace will complete the launch in all the building of the Council's presidency.
For Masio, "the opening of the back door is also important from the symbolic view."
On the part of the employees there were no objections, the Secretary-General assured: "There was a joint procedure with all workers and cooperation".
Soon, no breakfast at work; no coffee and croissant.
Brunetta smiles and says, "There's nothing better than good cappuccino in seven o'clock in the morning."
During one conference at the High School of Public Administration
in Rome, the minister will finally report that in three months' time, the absence of public employees for the disease has decreased by 50%, which means that 60 000 people are working more each year."
And it adds that it is necessary for the Italian public administration to become more effective.
"their payment dynamics – explained by the Minister – have doubled over the past 8-10 years in view of the private sector and is far higher than the inflation rate".
Meanwhile, thousands of public employees have met to reject Brunett's decree in accordance with the request of Codacons.
"While today's Minister for Public Administration will present figures of lower unemployment unemployment – says the Consumer Protection Association – the nation of 'full-time lions' will continue to grow.
In Italy, we have thousands of productive and right-wing employees in public administration who have gathered to declare war illegal in the decree."
In Taru, in particular, will be protested against the removal of allowances for the disabled, which depend on the activities; the extension of the time during which the disease can be checked, the time limit for the time-limit for the inspection visits, and the other rules included in the new ministerial provisions.
Labour force, Napolitano: "Resolute Prevention"
Every day in Italy there will be 2,500 employees, three people will die and twenty-seven will remain disabled.
Inail's values confirm that in 2007 we have a total of 1,200 deaths due to labour forces.
These values testify to the importance of the evidence that remains one of the main causes of death and cause almost double death compared with the murders.
In order to regain the attention of the institutions, social and information media regarding this dramatic problem, Anmil now celebrates in all 58ths of Italy the national day of the victims of the labour force laid down in the second week of October.
"The disturbing data spread by Anmil and the tragic reports of these days confirm the importance of the safety of the work," confirmed President of the Republic of Giorgio Napolitano in a report sent by President Anmil, the National Association for Hate and Incapacitated for Work, Pietro Mercandelli.
The head of the State expresses its living wonder at the continuing joint effort on safety at work, on the protection of injured workers, on the assistance of the victims' families and on the participation of public opinion."
"The inspired 'sufficient' has been raised, correctly shared in the face of tragedy, which, in its extent, causes the media and the participation of public opinion, but every day's reality has again offered us dramatic cases, even repeating in their dynamics."
Napolitano does not hide that "there is no doubt a resource problem: it is advisable to invest in education and information.
In particular, there are numerous initiatives in the field of education to help young people to gain a clearer understanding of the world of work.
It is necessary to take note of this concern, not to give rise to its disturbing social burden, to apply and improve legislative standards.
President Gianfranco Fini pointed out from his side that "as soon as death results from the labour rate creates an absolutely critical social situation, it affects the conscience of each of us and encourages all institutions to make sure that the situation is brought to an end."
"As regards the data of the labour force, it appears that they show a certain positive business, however, it does not support that the number of deaths resulting from work rates is so alarming," said President Anmilul Pietro Mercandelli again.
"We wouldn't want this "reducing force" to get less attention, because right now, when the attention is up, the tragedy will break out.
"We believe that it is generally too much to stop the impact problem and there are many activities that can have an impact on this problem.
It is necessary, according to our opinion, to increase control and inspection, but also to increase the effectiveness of the training of workers, and this is now from the age of school".
"There is still a need for further efforts - he added – with regard to communication and the participation of public opinion.
But there is a major need for greater responsibility for employers' responsibility for phenomen, which represents an exceptional social interest."
Mercandelli has finally declared that it is a progressive degeneration of the level of rights to compensation intended for the victim and "retireement of support care" to which the system has been granted in recent years."
"The aim, therefore, is to return the employee's guarantee of insurance - added - because the punishment of those who are hurt should not depend on spontaneousness or treatment since the time of law enforcement".
Mp3 Players accused of exposure to risk
Listening to the loud music for a longer time and using portable music devices as an Mp3 player can cause permanent damage to the ear.
According to today's published notice by the European Commission, which in one official report published in Brussels quotes the Committee's opinion on the knowledge of health risks that have recently been identified (Csseri) Eu.
"From this scientific point of view, we read in the notes, it appears that 5-10% of those who listen to music for at least five years through portable musical instruments, week more than one hour a day and hold the device at high volume, risk the loss of hearing ability."
"I am concerned that so many young people who are often using portable instruments and mobile phones at high acoustic levels can unwittingly harm their ears in an inadequate way," admits Meglana Kuneva.
"From scientific findings – continues to lead – there is a clear risk and there is a need to react quickly.
The most important thing is that we must raise consumers and publish these information.
We must continue to recheck existing control systems in the light of this scientific discovery so that they become fully effective and continue to take steps with new technology."
Brussels asked the Independent Scientific Committee to examine this problem in view of the high use of portable music devices and the growing number of young people exposed to this source.
"The experts – closed the Executive Officer Eu – confirm that it is necessary to be careful and now the European Commission will examine together with other members and parties who have faced the problem, what measures it would be possible to introduce and thus to protect children and young people before the construction of a device that is a source of portable music and similar devices".
At present, there is a European safety standard which limits the level of flow of portable music devices to 100 dB, but there is growing concern about noise damage which may be caused by excessive exposure to similar noise.
It is very possible to limit these damage by looking for solutions as a reduction in levels and duration of exposure.
In its opinion, the Scientific Committee of Eu indicates that users of portable musical instruments, if they use the voice of music (more than 89 decibels) for only five hours a week, exceed the current pay limits corresponding to the maximum allowed noise at work.
Those who listen to music under such conditions over a extended period of time risk the loss of hearing within five years.
This problem should affect 5-10% of users of such devices and their number can be estimated between 2.5 million and 10 million people in the EU.
Rome, Germany leaves the Commission free of charge for the future of the capital
We'll start today, we'll close in March, we'll have sums in June.
This is the calendar given by Campidogli to the "Committee for the Future of Rome's capital", which met this morning in his new sitting next to the Caracas lasnas.
In six months, President Antonio Marzano and the 49 other members of the Commission will make arrangements for Rome.
When the door is closed in March, Gionta and the present Council will assess the analyses and projects so that in June they can present a strategic plan for Rome with the "official discharge" of Campidogli and his work Gianni German.
"The Commission is completely independent and contains all the political, social and cultural opinions – he wants to highlight Germany – he will have to make proposals for the development of Rome, which will eventually use the political decisions that remain of Gunta e Current Council.
It's not about any change of function, but it's about the effort to have somewhere to work on a big project for Rome.
Work will be completed in March and will then be cancelled, because this institution must have a precise time limit.
In June – the elderly – we will present a strategic plan and use the work done by the Commission for the future of the capital city of Rome.”
Those who accuse the Commission of remaining undecided because its opinions are not binding, Germany replied: "All depends on the work which the Commission will be able to carry out and on the quality of their proposals.
If they are as good as the Commission's proposals, and I am sure that in Rome, its benefits will be decisive.
You are often faced with the daily problems and stresses that have taken place from time to time.
We, on the contrary, want to look further and further, in deeper perspective, to work seriously on the development of Rome and its future.
Furthermore, the elderly of Rome would like to emphasize that "this Commission is neither an ordinary business nor a bluff: it is all free, the Roma citizens will not be able to become a euro nor will it serve to think and connect the best intelligence that the city has."
For Germany, in principle, "it must have a strategic plan as a starting point, not a final or impossible one, in order to allow our city to have an authentic approach to the level that it needs, and to think of a united spirit on its future."
The future, which highlights the elderly of Rome "will not only be limited to the current present border, but will look much further" not only in the perspective of the future metropolitan city and its legal status is the main city, but also "including the role that Rome can and must play as the capital of Europe and the Mediterranean".
The first anti-American president to know why
One prominent American president wrote that it is important for him to remain independent: "Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president."
The first was Jimmy Carter, who, by his decisions, made an economic decision in the United States and maintained relations (as a private citizen) with an enemy of Islam".
The attacks against Obama are growing right away when the date of the vote is approaching.
A woman from Miami wrote on the Web: "This man is full of ambition.
Both of them, however, have the courage: they think they will get to the highest rank of the nation, which had two governors and five black senators."
In fact, these attacks do not say much"; they are the attacks of a single racial origin and do not respond to the question of voters: will they be a good president? And then we have research; they all say that Obama is winning and with a big jump.
In this case, there are those who follow the heart rather than the brain.
One newspaper from Mississippi, from the south corner of the United States, wrote a comment: at least once in the polling office, we know well who gives his voice to the American patriot.
There's a page of American thinking on the surface, which remained intact until the last minute.
Tell me what you want, we'll finally find out who's going to kill if Obama or McCaina."
There are people who swear: if Obama should win, we'd leave America.
These are things that have never been expressed, seem almost certain success of a black candidate.
However, over all these democratic opinions, George Bush is the main weapon.
1500 people were asked, what mistake did Bush make during his mandate? Eighty-nine percent answered: Iraq.
America's changing.
In Vietnam, this nation lost tens of thousands of soldiers and sent him home with treasure to the back.
In Iraq the lives of 4500 soldiers were saved, and the Americans were not forced to fight.
And yet, Iraq became the majority of Bush's poverty.
Whoever comes to Georgie W's gonna have to do a huge job.
The U.S. economic collapse has also been felt by journalists: in the news there is a period of investigation. And many blame the Internet, "killer" prints.
PEW Research Center asked five hundred journalists about their professions and predicting the future.
Well, today, almost all journalists are pessimistics about their future.
However, they did not openly say that they were less seniors in terms of reliability.
It doesn't feel isolated like it used to be.
The problem is for American money reporters, the money.
For these journalists, the 2008 crisis is the crisis of the destroyed economic model.
In addition, the drawings carried out in the newsroom, in the rooms where the editors work to give the news together are a huge problem.
According to the press, there is a problem that needs to be resolved if we do not want traditional journalism to change, as its broad public understanding has changed.
A U.S. journalist walks clear, but complex pessimism.
Six of the 10 press journalists and executive seniors are convinced that the journalist is making a wrong way at national level.
In the local area, the executive group is 65%.
It's against the Broadcast.
It's not hard for a journalist to see where the web is going.
More publishing takes the way to the Internet, where many look like a "killer" of prints.
"Economic pressure" on which journalists warn has increased to 79%.
Five hundred of the journalists interviewed admitted that they were turning to technology in hopes that their journalist would "be doing something good".
The biggest corruption in American journalism is among those who run newsrooms – that is, leadership – and reporters who work for them.
56% of those leading at national level are sure their reporters share their values while at local level, the value is 23% high.
This has something to do with "safe work" for someone.
Leaders who think they're losing their jobs for three years are 47% at national level.
As far as journalists are concerned, they're moving 30%.
In the case of "reliable work" concerning staff (our editors, etc) in America, they are still on the agenda.
Only 13% of journalists work on the contract.
In a vast nation like Usa, three million citizens and thousands of journalists, magazines, radios, TV and the Internet often offer what they want, and so it is a question to take or leave.
Leaders get almost always huge payments, and the editor can also earn tens of thousands of dollars a month apart from payment of money and insurance.
As regards the permitted persons, the argument is complex: a certain number of days after the first year, a certain number of days after the third year until it reaches the fifteen days after a certain number of years.
However, U.S. journalists, according to their own experience, are often ill over a year.
It's just a climate issue.
UNIPOL: SOUD IN Rome, DANILO COUPPOL IN GROTTAPERRAT
The President of the Second Criminal Chamber of the Court of Rome, Carmelo Rinaud, decided to refrain from giving businessmen with the realities of Daniel Coppoly, who requested that he move from his city, Grottaferrat, to live in Rome.
Coppola has been investigated for bankruptcy in relation to the anti-dumping duty on the sale of Unipol-Bnl.
During the trial on its own, he received a leave of absence from the domestic prison that was transformed into a forced stay in Grottaferratá.
His lawyer, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, asked that the realist could change the place of residence from the foreign city to the capital.
However, the Court considers that this move (to which pm was expressed) would allow him to influence his company and to obtain evidence that he was accused of.
Elitis in Danger
A few days ago, when Komora voted against the rescue plan to provide $700 billion to the White House, a large part of the Americans were more interested in and interested in the destruction of Wall Street than in saving the economy.
They also confirm this even earlier New York Times, which informs us that the current crisis is spreading to the Republican side, still more divided between their old East Coast soul, more peaceful, opposed to the federal institutions and the business community, and their new soul, which is rather conservative, non-friendly against the "those from Washington" and against the world of finance, particularly in the middle and south states.
A soul that was proud of the vote I was talking about at the beginning.
However, this just quoted thing is just an example of changes, big changes that the current economic earthquake has already shown: not only in the United States but in the whole West and perhaps not only here.
As in Usa and in Europe, it seems that this crisis is acting as an acceleration of Jews who have been in the incubator for a long time, who are applying themselves to the new climate and finally go to the light.
The first of these challenges is the renewal, the extraordinary market experience, the second category of State power in relation to certain economic renationalisation.
The crisis is the result of the crisis of banking institutions which, of course, have strong external flows, but are mainly involved in the most large number of people and families living in the single country, in the single state.
What created a political problem at the same time for those who lead it: it means how to respond to the difficulties and protests of people and families who are outside of others and volunteers.
The short-term crisis strikes the world's economy, but political is almost totally national.
Political international seems to be essentially out of the game or that there is nothing to add: the clear evidence provided by the European Union, which is always divided between different interests and different national strategies and which cannot be decided for a common political line.
And so everyone is waiting for the governments of each individual state, saved plans, market recovery, new rules and mainly fund allocations: at the moment we get to the bottom, only states have economic resources, the amount of financial resources, so that they can try to put everything in order.
In addition, the own resources and powers necessary to be used are: two sources of non-compliance, under certain circumstances, that no market or international organisation will ever be able to make available in a similar manner.
This new phase of crisis at the national and national level is finally becoming more and more consistent with the fact that the recent economic progress is being made to contribute to one factor linked to it: land ownership.
Paradoxically, while we were convinced that we had entered the kingdom of the network, that we were still more sophisticated technology, material, while we were convinced that the world's finances were already overrun to rule the world, nothing we realized that our future would still have to go on with such little material things as water, green, oil.
All things that would have been said can be moved from one place to another, however, are connected, absolutely, to the restricted area, to the ground.
So whoever becomes their ruler certainly has a lot more money in his hand than anyone who doesn't have it and who has the power to live in a place without oil, oil, and no water.
I'm getting to the second newspaper, which, however, predicts evil.
Who speaks about the territory, the state, the government, is constantly talking about politics and leadership.
Given the economic crisis, it appears that there are two convergence languages.
On the one hand, it is clear that there is an objective need for authoritative guidance, a request for someone to be able to understand the situation.
On the other hand, the power of discretion against existing guidelines, in particular economics, which have proved to be equally uneven and full of dark places.
And together there is something deeper and in a certain sense disturbing: distrust, intolerance, feelings of incompatibility and incompatibility, which are trying to control the entire ruling class in more and more Western countries.
It seems that there is still increasing in the broad masses of citizens of conviction rather than that their actions are the same as the ideas of popular elites, as their way of feeling and being, as their culture in the right sense of the word, that elite has already spent its time and is lenient to most of the views.
The demand for leadership is short-lived from the realm of one science, but strong momentum for the removal of the ruling classes and traditional political order is demonstrated in recent popular 'wars' or unexpected changes to collective power in the last and most recent time, from the conservative accession to the fall of the British labs to the opposition of American congressmen against Bush (and may also have to do with the victory of the right in Italy).
We believe that traditional elites, their sides, their programmes, and their ceremonies, their news, their accredited intelligence, someone would say their format, have more problems to understand, so to represent, what, not from today, is created in deep-rooted Western societies and that the economic crisis is reinvigorating, expanding, potentially disrupting the climate.
Before that, it would be forced to talk about persistent "mass resistance".
But certainly we can't say that it means having a proper open eye.
Super nice to wear on walls
Transmit the laws of gravity thanks to the super leopard and in the future walk on walls like Spiderman.
This is an object of various American research centres and has now been very close to the four institutions.
Scientists have been able to maintain a stochilogram body attached to a vertical wall using only 2.5 centimetres per square inch.
STUDIUM – U.S. magazine Science has published the findings of some University researchers at Dayton, Akron, Georgian Institute of Technology and Research, Air Force.
The material found by these researchers is the development of existing materials that are already used by the special structure of the needle, which is called pellets of pellets.
"The basis of the flag can be presented as a series of tubes set up as an organized spaghetti chrome," explains zhong Lin Wang from the Georgian Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
The scientists were inspired by the legs of the geek, the covered microscopic guys that enable animals to ensure perfect addition.
Tests carried out on various materials such as glass, Teflon and clay have shown that the new leaf is ten times stronger than the bones of these plasmas and at the same time "just get out of the wall" explains Liming Dai, researcher of the University of Dayton Engineering.
CHODIT PO ZDECCH? - "This material could be useful as a provisional package" adds Liming Dai.
Even though researchers think of a far less fascinating use than the combination of electrical devices, as the patient carbon tubes are heat and electricity drivers.
Other applications could be related to flight space engineering .
I don't have any great brains.
DRAZKUM – also University of Berkley, California, is responsible for research into a new leaf.
In an article in the journal American Chemical Society, Californian scientists presented a pencil shaped with a micro train as hair that is clean from dust by moving around the floor to maintain perfect accessibility.
Drugs: Never With Juss
Look at the grep, melancholy and apple juice.
If you take these drinks, which are used primarily in the summer, because they are refreshing and full of vitamins, together with some life-saving medicines, they are used to change their strengths or reduce their effects with significant health effects.
So that David Bailey, professor of Western Ontario University in London, highlighted the risk of juses both ready and fresh in combination with certain medicines, at the 263th National Meeting of American Chemicals in Philadelphia, creates a new plague: one of the ingredients of the grep, measles and apple juice to reduce the consumption of certain life-saving medicines, to eliminate their beneficial effects and to expose the health of patients.
The Greek yoke has already been accused of being responsible for increasing to a toxic level the effects of some antiarrhythmic drugs, antibiotics, anthiotics, antihistamines and neurological drugs.
RICIKU- The Italian Medical Agency has identified the same problem in an information bulletin two years ago and has challenged doctors and patients so that they do not underestimate the risks arising from this mixture and to pay attention to what they are drinking, such as Diazepam or Metadon.
NATIONAL GRAPEFRUIT – Experts also suggest that a moderate and apple juice contains substances that are absorbed by medications.
Long list of the effects of lumbared grapefruit and other juices.
From the challenge of Michele Carruby, director of the pharmacology department of the State University in Milan: "These symptoms are mostly reported to the most diverse international and national medical agencies, which may also provide and exchange information instructions for medicines.
So you always read the illustrated list of medicines you will get and if you find something that is not clear, don’t worry, but ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain it’,” said an expert for Agent Ansa.
Nobel for the economy of Paul Krugman
Nobel Prize was awarded to the American Paul Krugman for his study of commercial models and location of economic activities.
Krugman is a 55-year-old Novokeğan who teaches at the University of Priceton and is a well-known New York Times editor.
Krugman is one of the most important criticisms regarding the foreign, economic and political steps of the Bush administration.
A few months after the attacks in September 2001, in the days when Enron was arrested, Kruggman announced in a comment published in New York Times that the second event will, in the light of the consequences of the history of the United States, be far more important than the first one.
The proposal that produced a small field and which was counted after the year, however, proved to be accurate.
"I'm surprised and shocked, with the speedy waves like Enron and Worldcom disappearing from the public interest, Krugman announced at the end of 2002.
According to Lorenza Binih Smaghi of the Executive Committee of the Central European Bank, Krugman is a "econ of great importance", but also a popularizer who has a "very aggressive style, especially critical against the excessive Bush liberalist administration".
Open Office, we've got the third edition of the "anti-Mis" package here.
It is the day of the release of Open Office.org 3.0, the package open source of personal products, which aims to reach more users, from house to office, from experts to public administration, as a free alternative to the most famous Microsoft Office.
After the annual work of volunteers controlled by the SUN Microsystem, the new Open Office will show wide audiences with different news: additional, far more essential, as compatibility for the Apple Mac OS X operating system and support for the new ODF (Open Document Format) 1.2, the latest standard ISO version.
The tool is also ready to work with the Office 2007 package, Open Office is able to open the document and with new Microsoft (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx).
Special features of some models such as that allow you to reduce the size of the PowerPoint presentation, which is useful for e-transmission, or the possibility of transferring the PDF content to the model of the graphical execution and keeping the original view of the page.
We can still create PDF hybrids that resemble the typical Adobe format graphics and have the properties of the table processor or text program.
The collaboration is the first to get many improvements within the application programmes: it is extremely possible to work together between different users and avoid conflicts with changes, the text programme gives each partner one color to comment to make a clearer identification in the audit phase.
Some companies also work on transferring some Open Office functions to the Web (on the cloud) and should stop the final result in the following weeks.
The Italian version can be downloaded at http://it.openoffice.org/Download/1.0/Download300.html, was added to the English version, which is located on the back of the package.
In addition to Windows and Mac OS, as a usual package is also available for the Linux operating system.
The installation cd may also be sent at the request of the home or at the workplace.
And if the issue of freeness can be a snare for expansion in households, just in the business area of the Open Office package, and can already be counted with the most diverse projects implemented in public administration and schools.
And there are no offers of training, consultation and assistance services ideal for small and medium-sized enterprises, which could open the business perspectives.
Open Office is composed of five main models: Writer, for video writing Word; Calc is a table processor that focuses on Excel; Impress for presentation similar to Powerpoint; Dbase, as in the case of the most famous Access, is a program that allows you to work on databases; Draw, finally, is a graphical model.
The goal for 2008 is to achieve 5th million downloads, and if we consider that we are about 3 million and 600 thousand today, with the publication of a new version, it is possible that this predicted number can be exceeded.
Also the results of Kohl are positive, this is the fourth case of doping
A new positive case on the last Tour de France: it's about the Bernhard Kohl account, with the Gerolsteiner team, a third-classed and winner of the best winner's trick.
The report was quoted by the L'Equipe delineator's page.
26-year-old Kohl is a fourth successful runner at Ceru, Epo third generation, after Italians Richard Rico and Leonard Piepoli and Germans Stefan Schumacher, and he from Gerolsteiner.
The results of the blood samples of Kohl belong to those performed in the last few weeks by the laboratories Losanna and Chatenay-Malabry.
If the control analysis confirms the positive on Ceru, Rakuşan will lose the third place on Tour and will have to face the two years of disqualification.
The report on the positive attitude of Kolla to the third generation confirms that the head of the French anti-doping agency Pierre Bordry, who announced the Associated Press, has already informed the outcome of the Russian government.
The 26-year-old Rakushan took his place on the winnings for Spanish Carlos Sastrem and the American Cadel Evansem, also received the scored triumph of the best winner.
Immigrants: A York Team is worried, is it Italian racist?
Italy "as the country of immigrants has only changed to the primary objectives of passengers" accepted in response.
That's how it's changed into a beautiful country for the racist nation? So it's part of a long article in New York Times that bought this article on racism in Italy and started with the case of young Abdul William Guibre from Burkina Faso, who was killed last month in Milan, because he stole the treasure box.
This case highlights what New York Times defines as "a paradox in the north": the northern areas are at the same time those where "more integration and more work" are registered, but also "the strongest anti-citizen thinking in the country and the strongest support of the North League".
In order to confirm increasing tension between Italy and the passengers, NYT quotes cases of intolerance from Milan, Parmy, Rome, Ciampina and Castel Volturna.
That's not it.
The new legislation required by Lego, which seeks to speed up the accession and facilitate the promotion of illegal immigrants, is also cited as an example of the climate change in Italy.
The trend is highlighted as a pope, as was the President of the Republic: "Giorgio Napolitano, after meeting with Benedette XVI in Quirinale, requested that the state and the church work together on the pacific of racism."
Students with expensive loans - up to 900 euros per room
The university students' rent is not known for the crisis.
According to recent Sunia studies, rental committees, a single bedroom can be located in Milan up to 900 euros, Florence 700, Naples 650, Rome 600.
"Jev has already achieved such measures that all kinds of students have lost the right to study because of the very high prices that their families would have to bear – explains the leading office for the study of Sunia, Laura Mariani – in this city a large demand from students has been developing the market in such a way that it has made the process of increasing prices that has grown even on residents."
In most cases, loan tenders include a number of infringements: contracts in a free manner, without a restricted loan, and related contracts.
For Sunji, there is a need for an exceptional provision that could regulate prices by means of the tax audit.
If we look at the research details, we will see that in Milan, in the area of Brianza, there is a need for about 450 euros, for a single bedroom is paid from the minimum price of 650 (Bande Nere zone) via the average 800 (Lambiate, Udine and Fiera zone) to the maximum 900 (Vittoria zone).
In Florence there is one bed of EUR 350/400, one room about 700.
In Bologna, where students are concentrated in areas close to the university, there is a need for EUR 250/280 per bed in double room, from 370 to 500 per bed.
In Rome, in the central university areas (San Lorenzo, piazza Bologna) they want 600 euros for a single room, 450 beds in a double room.
The values are slightly lower (550 euros per inch) in areas near other universities (Ostiens and Cinecittà).
We will save only if we move to peripheral areas: EUR 300 per bed and 450 per single room in Prenistin, Centocelle and similar.
In Naples, you need 300/450 euros, for room 400 to 600 euros, with the highest prices in the areas of Policlinico, Vomero and Colli Aminei.
In Bari, they want a bed of EUR 250/350, at least 350 for a single room.
In smaller cities, prices are significantly lower, but they have a higher impact on the economy of citizens.
In cities such as Perugia, where the most popular holiday is for students outside the European Union, there is finally another anomalies: an increase of 25-30% of the salary they want from foreign students compared to Italians.
Next to the old Chinese Paradise, cities ruining historic forests
The cinematographic historical forces are in favour of Multiplexus.
"The town without a kine is like a blind, like a face without eyes."
The image offered by the director Giuseppe Tornator has successfully documented what is happening in large Italian cities, but also in foreign cities.
The process of limiting kine, the growth of large multiscals on the subject and the subsequent legacy of monosals in the central areas of the city is one of the events that appear to be inevitable and irreversible, but also has all the signs of genuine cultural crime.
Often the historic places are surrounded by memories, "it's like we come to a friend, a well-known one with whom we shared a lot of travel and emotion," feels the director of the New China Paradise, a film that he received 20 years ago by Tornator Oscar and the great prize of a wedding in Cannes, who reported the poetry of a neighbor’s cinema and the sadness for the way of life that the movie has lost forever.
The values obtained by Anek, the main company of operators, are clear: in the last five years, the door of a traditional type has closed 316 ki, and the highest accounts have been paid mainly in the most important cities: 10 minutes in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 minutes in Turin, 5 in Palermo.
Of the regions most reached, Emilia-Romagna is the first place to lose 82 Chinese salts followed by Toskánsk (44) and Lombardia (41).
And as evidence that the first charge for their mix is a multiplex approach, these are just the three Italian regions that recorded the highest number of new Chinese multinationals: 195 more paid in Lombardia in the last five years, 81 both in Tuscany and in Emilia-Romagná.
"Italian procedure has evolved unreasonably," says Paolo Protti, President Anescu, "is useful to create new structures, but it should be ensured that those already exist, because when one movie in the city closes, not all its visitors are willing to move to the multiplexo.
We are not even talking about insufficient funding for the support of operators: the previous state debt is a total of EUR 10 million.
From a moral and ethical point of view, it is a shame that the government does not respect existing laws.
In support of the sector, between EUR 16 and EUR 18 million should be needed annually.’
It is a bologne case, the first Italian city to deal with the closures, which was decided to find the original signature of the protocol between the city and Anec, the first of which is in Italy for the protection and promotion of small kines both in the historical centres and in the subject.
Among the planned standards are the steps of tax incentives in favour of operators and the benefits of the public with regard to mobility: admirers will be able to travel to restricted areas and will have special prices to stop and some parking.
"I like this initiative," says Giuseppe Tornatore, and I hope that the other cities will follow the example of Bologna by introducing other measures."
However, it is certain that if it is possible to stand against the great multiplex force, traditional salts must improve the quality of sound and image, as today's audience is more generous.
The defense of traditional cinema is the theme that has always been important: the closure of Super cinema in Bagheria, instead of my childhood and upbringing, was the iron that convinced me to establish the "New Paradise" that I've been thinking about for 10 years.
I've lived in Rome for 25 years, and when I've spent before the Rialt or Quirinals closed in the streets of the Nazianale, where I shared so much emotion that I don't look at the letters of a broken job, I'll turn around on the other side."
Association between politics and the Mafia group 'draghet, old Gioie Tauro in prison
"The old man from Gioie Tauro was willing to adjust the wishes of the city office according to the interests of the Mafia group Piromelli."
The charges against Mafia in Calabria against the elderly and the viceroys of Gioie Tauro Giorgio Dal Torrione and Rosariovi Schiavone, and the elderly Rosarna Carlu Martellim, imprisoned this morning for external cooperation with the Mafian organization, are severe.
In railways, too, Gioacchino Piromalli, an old mediator between the clan and the public administration, and his grandson lawyer, the chief, already accused of committing crimes of the Mafian character, which is worth EUR 10 million.
"They have ignored all legal and moral standards, as well as the sound mind," writes state officials, when two local administrations expressed their willingness to pay counsel to Piromolim.
"This would enable the Mafia Group – written judges – to formally enter the city authorities and facilitate such extensive control and management of public administrations."
President of the Calabrian Regional Commission Agazio Loiero does not hide that "the secret agreements between local institutions and organised crime are very much in his country: "There are areas in which the mediation of the Mafia is stronger than in others where secret agreements are inevitable.
But we also have a lot of local policies that give pressure to 'draghets, mountains that are still unrecovered'.
The arrests from today's morning follow after the arrest from July of last year , which the police have shown that the Mafia group of Piromelli has reached its final appeal .
Since the end of the last year - the city council of Gioii Tauro has been released since 1991, the reason has been that the alleged link between organised crime and local administration has been the result of the local policies being free of charge in the current administration.
Giorgio Dal Torrion, president of Christian Democrats, who was elected at the time of the release to be the head of the true middle coalition after the summer election.
He called for a scandal when Prefectura ordered the release of the present Council.
He called for the responsibility of the former Deputy Minister of the Interior, Marc Minniti, and accused him of putting all of this behind him for political reasons, but the judges in the Rules of Procedure signed this morning explain that the Mafian Group had grown so far as to request a change of project A3.
Among the further statements made against Dal Torrion, the author of a public complaint, was quoted as saying "the opportunity to move the orders of the business, the representatives of some larger groups are very close, as is generally known, to Piromolim and to adapt the public administration of the interests of the Mafian group."
When the energy comes from the wave, these big ones enter the game.
It is an endless story that covers more than 70% of the earth's surface and is now starting to reveal large global energy companies.
The waves, floods, floods, floods are new sources of inexhaustible energy on which the sky of clouds like Chevron is now trying to lift its hands.
The possibility of creating energy from the sea's movements has been studied for over a hundred years and in the 1970s, in relation to the first root crisis, research has intensified.
When the oil prices decreased around 1980, the idea of using marine energy went elsewhere, but now the organic organisation and the new increase in oil prices gave the sector a new impetus.
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London reported in 2007 that about 15 per cent of the world’s electricity consumption could be covered by the use of the wave movement of the sea.
this amount would be the double energy generated at the present time in nuclear centres.
And there's also floods and floods and floods.
It's gonna hit the face.
Enersis, which agreed in 2005 to set up a facility in northern Portugal.
When this objective was announced, it seemed to be an enormous revolution step.
After two years, which is based on marine energy, there are still more companies, which are based on marine energy than traditional energy.
"Chevron is studying ocean energy technology – he has expressed himself to the linguist of a company that is linked to the American Red Cross, in the economic news of Wall Street Journal – and is thinking about the possibility of working with us."
The cooperation we are considering concerns obtaining permission from the American Energy Commission, which is necessary for the extension of the project for the use of marine energy in Aljašce.
We cannot underestimate this signal, especially if we take into account that the United States's right to continue to be a heavy rock and President Bush has recently come with a plan to refurbish it.
In addition to Chevron, they monitor the rate of marine energy and the Verdant Power Inc. from New York and Ocean Power from New Jersey and recently invested sums, although not fully known, show growing interest by observers.
Technology, which needs to be developed.
Experts are talking about technology, which is still in the beginning, because they don't know what effect the use of marine energy will have on the environment.
At the same time, the facilities in Portugal and some in Scotland are small and do not seem to be causing major problems to the ecosystem.
But for more energy production, it is necessary to use technology with greater impact on the environment.
The methods are different: Ocean Power, for example, uses a system of fighting that is interconnected with each other.
The Vln force, which moves with the upper and lower forces, is modified with the help of warriors and cylinders on hydraulic pressure inside these forces.
The pressure breaks the turbine that gives energy to the generator.
The energy is reached on the shores of the ocean cables.
Meanwhile, there are four projects in the phase of this type of equipment that are only expected for federal approval and part of the energy could serve for military purposes.
Instead, Verdant Power is now producing energy for the shopping center and parking lot using six pdmorine turbines in the New York East River.
The movement of water during the passage and discharge causes the movement of turbine, which is the life-generating movement of this reverse motion.
Verdant stated that they have a long list of clients waiting for the necessary authorisation for the possibility of using this energy.
On the walls, on the floor, and on the floor.
In particular, at this point, the potential of electricity and electricity is earned, said the Institute for Energy Research.
Although this is an independent factor, waves and waves are more predictable than the wind, the sun, or the waves, and thus more reliable than the source of energy.
With the energy flow and impact of countries such as New York, Maine and Aljaška, and with other coastal states already invested 7 and half a million dollars in 2008 and predicted investment to $35 million in 2009.
