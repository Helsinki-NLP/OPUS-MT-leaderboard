European inflation has been reduced in food
The accelerated inflation recorded in the euro area is primarily due to a sharp increase in the price of food products.
The increase in prices in November has been higher than expected in the 13 countries in the euro area, registering - after 2.6 per cent of October - an annual inflation of 3.1 per cent - announced the Union Statistical Office in Luxembourg.
Official forecasts were likely only 3 percent - announced Bloomberg.
The European Central Bank (ECB), unlike the US, British and Canadian banks, did not reduce the basic interest, provided that the decrease, along with the price increases in raw materials and the reduction in force, would lead to inflation.
The ECB wants to maintain the inflation rate below, but at least two per cent.
According to one analyst, the ECB is in trap 22. "You have to negotiate" on inflation so that it will not have to intervene on this subject later.
The inflation of 3.3 per cent, registered in Germany, doubled the record for twelve years; while Spain increased from 3.6 to 4.1 per cent.
Inflation was released in the euro area as a result of food and energy price fluctuations.
Prices at the end of wheat increased by 88 per cent, and soybeans have reached their maximum level since 1973.
Similarly, much more was needed in 2007 for plant oil and milk products.
The price of raw oil on the world market increased this year by 52 percent, reaching the last month's black gold nearly $100 barrel.
According to the ECB, inflation in 2008 will drop from 2.1 per cent to 2.5 per cent, in exchange for 2009 it will decrease to 1.9.
According to analysts, annual inflation will be maintained in the next 3 or 4 months around 3 per cent, but the average annual rate will be 2.1 per cent.
At the same time, it is expected that during 2008 the ECB will reduce interest rates twice.
Gallup foresees a government crisis
After a long delay, for the beginning of December, the support of the League of Democratic Youth increased significantly, reaching its highest level since 2002, as the Gallup had previously experienced such a low level - a 13 per cent - in the case of socialists.
The difference in the case of the parties' security voters - due to the strongest strength of the opposition voters - would mean more than two thirds (about 71 per cent) in the face of the support of a fifth party for socialists (about 20 per cent).
According to the survey, the Democratic Forum and the Alliance of Free Democrats would not achieve the necessary limit for some parliamentary level: their support within the whole population is of two per cent.
Among the safe voters there is one hundred more sympathetic in both bands.
The economic environment continued to deteriorate even in comparison with the lowest point - never been so high, 41 per cent of those who judged the country ' s economic situation especially bad, while 46 per cent believed that the situation was quite bad.
Families, after the most promising expectations of spring and summer, are now more pessimistic about changing their own economic situation.
As regards the next year, the majority of the population is concerned with the deterioration of the situation and only one tenth of the population expects an improvement.
In December, 71 per cent of the consultants, more than any previous Gallup survey, believed that the President of the Government was doing better than his functions.
The 13 per cent of the consultants trusts or trusts very much Ferenc Gyurcsany, while Victor Orbán has the support of 38 per cent of the consultants.
54 per cent of the population did not fully trust the Head of Government, and 27 per cent did not trust the President of the League of Democratic Youth.
One of the indicators for the political situation is that, what proportion of society considers it possible to control the dissatisfaction experienced against the person of the Head of Government without a change of government.
While some 35 per cent felt that it would be desirable to remain in power to the Government and the Head of Government after the October disturbances last year, this proportion is currently only about 20 per cent, while the relative majority (about 33 per cent) believe that the only solution is the holding of new elections.
The interest in the reference was characterised by the fact that 60 per cent of the respondents to the question of participation replied that they would certainly participate and 20 per cent said that they were likely to participate.
Comparably, in "a general election to be held this Sunday", only 55 percent of the population would participate safely and 15 percent would probably believe in their participation. On the basis of the current intentions of the electors, there is no doubt about the outcome of the popular consultation.
One 74 per cent of the population would reject the payment of studies rights, 79 per cent of the medical consultancy service and 84 per cent of hospital care.
If we observed only these proportions among the secured participants in the referendum, 81, 84 and 89 per cent of voters would refuse to introduce the rights of studies, payment for medical consultations and hospital attention.
The most expensive is the Auchan, the Tesco has quintupled its prices
The average price increase of about 16 per cent of the hypermarkets of the Buddhist gold triangle was maintained, with the difference that VAT has not been increased this year.
Article of the Napi Economy
This year also increased in an average of 16 percent in the Buddhist gold trade triangle the usual Christmas Cana of the Napi newspaper, but in all hypermarkets, there was a high growth of thousands of HUFs.
As in December last year prices in food supermarkets had already been "dissipated", there was no evidence that a percentage-incarceration was experienced compared to the high starting point.
However, it is obvious to consumers that what last year they could buy at a very price below the nine thousand HUF, they can't today for even ten thousand.
Napi canasta in hypermarketed studies exceeded a minimum of 91 HUF the psychological limit of ten thousand HUF.
And the highest value canaster was 10,573 HUF.
(In 2003 that canast cost 6800 HUF.)
The price of the Unicum liqueur and the fishery remained almost at the level of the previous year, but there was a strong increase in the peacock’s liver, kidney, and amapola’s seed.
The price of wheat flour and bread followed the data from the Central Statistical Office, although in the Auchan we also found a kilo of bread at the price of 139 HUF.
Competence does not reduce the price of the product to less than 200 HUF.
It was equally surprising in this store that the Coca-Cola price with a two-litre convertible bottle cost less than 200 HUF, so this product, including the bottle price, cost only 257 HUF.
However, in Napi Auchan's canal was the most face, while Cora was the cheapest.
According to our calculations, with respect to Christmas prices last year, Cora increased by 15, while Tesco and Auchan with about 18 percent of the prices in the Napi canasta.
Comparing the values of the most expensive canast last year with the cheaper canast of this year, the difference has been 12 percent, while the cheapest growth of the last year and the largest face of this year has been 21 percent.
The average growth was 1480 HUF.
Last year the average price growth was 1206 HUF, so during the Christmas of last year the prices felt the increase in VAT.
This process was just what destroyed trade, the supermarkets were obviously unable to decide on the price margin to apply for each product and to calculate the effect of changing consumer prices.
(If the trader plans the speed of the movement of a product, it may lose an important benefit within the margin adjusted to the volume of sales.)
The increase in the price of the Napi Canast reached such extremes as the increase in VAT, which was higher than 1720 HUF at the recorded value in 2006, while the lowest difference was only 844 HUF.
This year did not produce such extremes, since the highest price since now has been 1630 HUF more than last year and the cheaper has also increased with 1284 HUF.
Compared to the two navigable periods, catastrophic growth was recorded at prices in less than 20 months, in hypermarkets more than 30 per cent of the price of first-needed consumer products.
(This, however, does not necessarily confirm the figures of the Central Statistical Office: this office, in the case of some first-needed foods, recorded an increase of more than 30 per cent over 12 months.
Thus, in addition to wheat, for example, in the case of eggs.)
According to the Canary Islands of Napi, in this latter case this seems almost impossible, since in the price of this product that was quite expensive last year compared to the base, it was recorded, in the worst case, only 10 per cent of price increases.
According to all the indexes, carina suppliers have a stronger position than eggs, which could impose dramatic price increases even to multinationals.
The hypermarketers do not complain about the gold trade triangle, they constantly speak of positive results.
According to our experience, most consumers of the three visited shops are no longer interested in prices.
From all products they buy large quantities, carrying the preserved food by pallets.
In the morning of the Wednesdays, large bags were formed in the three shops in front of the boxes because the number of customers increased continuously.
However, we have information that, within the country, sales volumes are lower, many multinationals complain about research institutes because income remains below their plans and not only in the case of food, but also in the case of electromagnetics.
In many hospitals, it's hidden with disinfectants.
This year several thousands of infections were first reported in hospitals due to the improper application of antibiotics.
The conditions of retinal hygiene in hospitals, washing the beds and overloading of personnel do not favour the control of infections - says the National Epidemiology Centre’s Department of Medicine.
In many hospitals, even with disinfectants.
Not much has been diagnosed with MRSA in the Department of Traumatology of Hospital János.
In a man hospitalized after a serious accident, the presence of the bacteria resistant to antibiotics was detected.
The patient was isolated.
The same type of infection occurred in this same hospital at the beginning of the year.
An accident of a serious car accident left him in the hospital, and the same patient had to return to the hospital shortly after the infection with MRSA, and since then there has been no significant surgical intervention by the presence of the bacteria in his body.
Up to 10 December this year has been registered in the National Nosocomialis Surveillance System 1094 cases of hospital infection produced by multi-resistant agents - Karolina Böröcz, chief medical officer of the National Centre for Epidemiology.
This means that in hospitals with full safety, this number of infections caused by multi-resisting agents has been registered, the rest of which have no information.
Nearly two thirds of the infections (683 cases) are due to MRSA, i.e. Staphylococcus aureus, resistant to methyl-oxacilin.
A third of the human beings carry Staphylococcus aureus (SA) bacteria in their nose without causing any disease.
The infections produced by SA (e.g., inflammation of the throat, amigdalitis, cutan infection, infection of the liver) react well to antibiotics and are easy to treat.
However, once the antibiotics are applied excessively or indirectly, bacteria that normally react well to antibiotics are converted into very resistant bacteria to antibiotics and are rapidly infected in inadequate hospital conditions.
Serious hospital infections, such as infections of wounds or sepsis, may occur primarily in patients with transient or chronic immunodeficiency, in patients with weakened body, in elderly or in people with low weight.
In the opinion of the physician-director of the János Hospital there is nothing special in the infection of the MRSA, these infections are daily in the hospitals.
The infection should not be confused with the epidemic, the MRSA alone is absent - said Tibor Nyulasi - where its presence is not examined.
Antibiotic Resistance
"These patients are isolated, the nursing staff treat them with rubber and masks and there are appropriate antibiotics for their treatment" - Tibor Nyulasi said.
Hospitalled patients are previously examined to verify the presence of MRSA in their body, but can not even prevent infection in all cases.
Can not get folder: %s: %s
It would be possible to prevent MRSA's hospital infections in most cases, although current national hospital conditions do not favour the prevention of training and contact with multi-resistant pathogenic agents - Karolina Böröcz says.
As this infection is mainly occurring in hospitals and nursing homes, hospitals should examine hospitalized patients and immediately isolate the patients who carry the MRSA in their body.
In Hungarian hospitals, however, the use of microbiological samples is not modest.
This is also due to the fact that the National Health Box does not finance these medical examinations.
So that most of the cases come to public light when there are already visible MRSA infections in the patient - the medical head of the epidemiological center said.
The European Union makes strict guidelines for the application of antibiotics in human medicine and there are also national directives to address pathological infections and diseases.
Antibiotic therapy should be undertaken in order to prevent resistance to medications, but hospitals do not always meet this requirement.
The use of microbiological samples is even less common in the case of ambulance patients or in basic assistance - Karolina Böröcz said.
Squash with disinfectants
Scientific experiments have shown that in most cases MRSA is infected by one patient to another through health personnel.
Therefore, they play a very important role in washing hands, using rubber and masks, but also in this regard there are significant deficiencies in hospitals.
MRSA is infected by the transmission of cats and direct contact between people, but in national hospital circumstances it is not always possible to isolate the infected patient.
Furthermore, hospital rooms often are torn apart, beds are often very common, although to prevent the epidemic, patients should be separated at least for a distance of 1.5 metres.
Unfortunately, it can also be experienced - Karolina Böröcz added - that in less favourable economic conditions hospitals, there are few nurses and many patients and therefore there is a greater likelihood of infection.
In the opinion of Karolina Böröcz, where appropriate preventive measures are carried out, fewer infections of this type are recorded or the infection of the pathogen agent can be stopped.
Government programme against MRSA
The treatment of infection with MRSA is a huge cost to the National Health Fund, which is why all countries are fighting against it.
In England, for example, there is a government programme to prevent and reduce cases of MRSA.
The programme appears to be successful, according to the data provided, infection with MRSA shows a trend of reduction in England.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) has among its priorities the prevention of multi-resistant agents (including MRSA) and hospital infections due to these pathogens.
Negative control of the police commander's alcoholism caused by a fatal accident
The periodic official report on the case of the fatal accident caused by the police commander of district XXII has been made.
It may be excluded from the possibility of driving Jews or in a state that has since then been dismissed by the police commander of district XXII, who was arrested on Tuesday and caused the death of a transuntant - reported the Friday Attila Morvia, a spokesman of the Capital General Fiscalia, after having prepared the per-permanent report on the case.
The hazardous report confirmed the result of primary alcohol control that had already been found that the former police commander had not consumed alcoholic beverages before being behind the wheel.
The chief of the district police then, on Tuesday with his special vehicle on the Kossuth Lajos street in the district of XXII, found a 55-year-old man who wanted to cross the street but not in the area designated for petons.
(This last thing, that is, that the peton did not use the rope to cross the road, according to the rules of the Transit Code are not current circumstances, the driver must always take the step to double.)
The transcontinent lost his life after being hospitalized.
On that occasion the district police officer resigned and requested his release, according to the police communication, because he had moved very much.
The case investigation is in charge of the Budapest Investigation Office.
Attila Morvia also said that the former police commander from a principle cooperated with the prosecutor’s taxes.
EUR 400 million more for infrastructure
Hungarian Finance Minister Janos Veres and Vice-President of the European Investment Bank (EIB) Marta Gajecka signed three credit-limit agreements in Budapest on a total of EUR 400 million to finance education, transport and the environment infrastructure, as well as the energy sector.
The European Investment Bank (EIB) approved in 2006 a budget of EUR 300 million to finance the Hungarian budget for environmental transport and protection projects, which will be implemented from the grant of cohesion funds, from which the parties had previously signed a credit contract of EUR 100 million, the contract they had just signed concerning the use of the remaining EUR 200 million.
The EUR 150 million credit agreement is also intended to finance the budget of educational projects.
The EIB has adopted a total of EUR 300 million for this purpose in Hungary, with a view to the use of the remaining EUR 150 million, the decision will be taken later, by extending the credit contract.
The parties signed a contract of EUR 50 million for innovation, which will be mainly used by the budget for the project of innovations and research at Debrecen University.
During the discussions they also covered the theme of the construction of the 4th Metro line.
The agreement was reached that for Hungary to finalise the details of the financing of the Metro with the EU, they would again address the issue whether or not to amend the original contract and how to do so.
According to János Veres, this may take place earlier in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has financed in total of 113 projects in Hungary worth EUR 8.4 billion.
The interest of the credits is adjusted to EURIBOR and the EIB provides an 8-year grace period without a commission to keep the credit available to the debtor.
Bulgaria, the EU's real estate paradise
It is wonderful to develop the Bulgarian real estate market - the attention of all Europe is directed towards that Balkan country just a few years ago.
What, where and those who buy even cheaper in the EU market, will soon be involved?
Analysis of the Bulgarian Re/Max division.
The goal for real estate acquisitions in Eastern Europe is undoubtedly no one in Bulgaria, with its cheap ski resorts and beach chalets.
The mountain regions of Bansko, Borovec, Pamproo and Vitosa are the most popular, while in the beaches of Albena, the "Costa Dorada", the "Costa del Sol", the old Sozopol and Nesebar, but more and more people are also looking for immutables around Kavarna and Balchik.
According to Re/Max analysts in Bulgaria, later or early the central area of the country - such as Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, Triavna - will awaken the interest of real estate promoters and more and more people will buy real estate in the particularly cheap Russian area.
Similarly, the capital of Sofia can be attractive, commercial spaces and offices promise rapid recovery of investment.
Bulgaria is on the best way to become one of Europe's most attractive golf havens, which could be such a high destination during the other two stations, in addition to summer and winter.
Thus, early investors are already making their purchases, for example in the vicinity of Bansko.
In the opinion of analysts, those who buy real estate in Bulgaria are also trying to change their life and way of life.
Most customers are English, but they also come from France, Belgium, Spain and more and more from Romania.
The Maltese and Cypriot promoters are also present and traditionally there are many Russian customers in the Black Sea beaches and in the ice paradises.
Foreign clients can be classified in three groups - says Georgi Jankov, Regional Director of Re/Max in Bulgaria.
Those who intend to install here buy new or renovated furniture at a price of between EUR 50 and EUR 100 thousand or well old house in bad condition between EUR 5 and EUR 15 thousand to refurbish them.
It requires good communication and access, and it is also important for them to be close to a large city, shops and generally a local doctor.
The second category consists of Chalet buyers (Bulgaria in December was included among the first 10 German holiday destinations).
The third group consists of real estate investors who make their purchases with the hope of receiving medium-term or long-term benefits.
The price of capital real estate continues to grow, as demand is growing.
Although in the European Union Bulgaria has lower real estate prices, in the last five years these have suffered an annual increase of 21 percent
The increase in the price of real estates is considerably greater than the increase in wages.
Feeder and six hundred Hungarians
According to the Minister for Environment and Hydrology Gábor Fodor, the expert-level meetings will be concluded on Tuesday and Wednesday after official opening, the negotiations at the Ministerial level on the international climate regime will continue after 2012.
The experts and politicians from 192 countries of the world will discuss the Bali Route Round, which is available on the follow-up efforts to reduce emissions, as set out in the Kyoto Protocol, which will take place until 2012.
There are currently encouraging discussions on the particularness of developing and industrialized countries.
The United States has already indicated that at the moment it does not wish to negotiate accurate figures, although it intends to reach agreement that, compared to the 1990 situation, by 2020, the emissions of greenhouse gases decreased by 25 to 40 per cent.
Another major theme of the conference is whether industrialized countries, in addition to reducing emissions, are or are not willing to provide material and technological assistance to the countries that need it.
A further agreement was reached on assistance to developing countries.
The support fund provided for in the Kyoto Protocol will be directed by a panel of 16 members, probably within the UN Environment Facility (GEF) - writes the "Pic is Benefit".
The 6 percent of Hungary
On behalf of Hungary, the Minister for Environment and Hydrology Gábor Fodor supports the EU's efforts to preserve its role in global climate protection and to promote the signing of the new international agreement by 2009.
The Minister stated that the EU is committed to reducing by 2020 by 20 per cent of its greenhouse gas emissions, regardless of whether or not it will sign the "after-2012 agreement" and is willing to commit itself to reducing even 30 per cent if the other major developed regions of the world and developing countries are also willing to undertake commitments in accordance with their responsibilities and capacities.
Gábor Fodor pointed out that the signatory countries of the 1997 Kyoto Protocol committed to a decrease of 5.2 per cent, in which 15 EU Member States then committed themselves to a reduction of 8 per cent.
Hungary's commitment is to reduce by 6 per cent the greenhouse gas emissions from the 1985-87 period, which our country will fulfil - the press release of the Ministry of the Environment.
It is very important to play in Bali, since within two years there will be a need to sign the international agreement on climate policy long-term, because if not, it is certain that its entry into force would be delayed after 2012. In this case, the reduction commitments under the Kyoto Protocol would not be immediately followed by a new international emission reduction system, the need to be warned in its most recent report by the IPCC, an international scientific association of the United Nations that is dealing with climate change, which has achieved the Nobel Peace Prize.
As a result, emissions reduction would suffer a delay and would not prevent an increase of more than 2o C of the earth's average temperature, which according to scientists would have irreversibly and irreversibly consequences.
The British Army Recruited on YouTube
British army units in a video distributor publish recordings of actions filmed in Iraq and Afghanistan to popularize themselves.
The British Air Force (RAD) was the first to use YouTube services: special units transferred to Afghanistan since March 2006 are loading videos about their actions against the Taliban - the BBC reported.
These recordings made with mini-cams mounted on the helmets are controlled in the overall Kandahar operation body, then sent to London to be loaded on the Internet.
The political message is inevitable
There have already been 139 recordings from Air Force soldiers that have been loaded in this way on the Internet and their "channel" has already been seen by more than 75 thousand people.
The British Ministry of Defence was registered in spring 2007 under the name "headquarters defense" and published videos of both actions in Iraq and Afghanistan, while both the Ministry of the United Kingdom of Nations (Commonwealth Office) and the multinational forces in Iraq (MNFI) have their own YouTube channel.
Operation in Afghanistan
The air force had originally loaded the videos with recruitment objectives, but in the opinion of the Ministry of Defence, they also served to present to the public the true objective of the British army's presence abroad.
This type of propaganda virtually costs nothing compared to conventional television spots of recruitment - declared the BBC expert Gordon Mackenzie - in exchange, unexpectedly have some political message, since they specifically justify the reason for the military action taken by the government.
The Americans prepared a video game
The army is also concerned about the fact that, in addition to carefully edited and censored recordings, the distributor also displays popular videos, such as the death of soldiers: in the "official" propaganda films, a few hypocritics, officers speak as the most lost, without presenting the bloody part of the fighting.
In addition, many videos already recorded in real operations have been posted from the Iraqi and Afghanistan war camps, but the British army is only recently taking advantage of this opportunity.
Americans use a slightly different form for recruiting with shooting video games, free of charge, called America's Army, in which in a more or less real situation the player can be placed directly instead of soldiers.
Tubula and salad pastel at the Ministry's Christmas party
The Minister of Labour Monika Lamperth does not seem to be very sensitive: instead of the Navy party, he will hold a working meeting for his colleagues who will be able to leave in 2007 with salted pastry and coffee.
There is a ministry that will celebrate its festival with live music, in other words, will create the navigable atmosphere in the hearts of public officials with tugula and a brandy.
Festival, Christmas environment, concerts and buffet - this is how power gets fun.
State offices are also preparing for Christmas.
The largest Christmas festival will be held in the Ministry of Defence, but not for the staff of the Ministry.
The children of the lost soldiers will be given to the Hourfan Navy, and for the Missions, the families of the soldiers who are currently performing missions abroad will be invited to receive a reception for the press.
This map will refer to 25 million for the festival environment at the end of the year.
The National Promotion Agency (ANF) and the Ministry of Economy and Transport (MET) will celebrate a solemn festival with regard to the parties to the other letters
The MET festival will be held in the Future House, with a total budget of 4,320,000 HUF and of the six hundred ministers of the ministry are expected to attend approximately three hundred and fifty.
At the party of the cartel, there will be an environment of Navidad, artists will also act and there will be a lot of trouble.
The NAFN's presence cost 4,700,000 HUFs and the Wednesdays were held in the building of the National Justice Council (CNAJ) with musical and dinner concerts.
The rent of the room cost one million HUF, the rest of the budget was spent for more than four hundred guests.
We have information that workers from one of the NAF departments are also invited to another Navida festival, which will hold a competition management company called Hungaro Centre for the economic development of Community funds.
To this end, they rented the complete building of the Theatro de la Comedia.
The information has not been confirmed by CHDE SA, since we cannot communicate with the competent person.
Can be seen without trace
The CNAJ building not only hosted the ANF party, but also the Ministry of Justice and Police, which instead of the Navidat held the dance of Lucía's day on 7 December.
The CNAJ of them did not cover anything about the use of their facilities.
Fifty people participated in the dance.
The party began with the Minister's greetings and after the dinner there was a live music.
Responding to the question of [or,] they reported: to attend the dance was not required to wear a dress or night dress.
Health cards, work and local administrations are prepared for modest celebrations.
The Ministry of Public Health will organize a program and party for its employees in its own building with a budget of 400 000 HUF.
On the contrary, the Minister of Labour Monika Lamperth does not expect his colleagues for an official Navy party, but for a working meeting at the end of the year.
The participation of hundreds of guests who - as the press department will report - will take only so much coffee and salad pastel, so the party will not cost more than 350 000 HUF.
The Minister for Local Government, Gordon Bajanai, will simply provide his colleagues at the Ministry of Local Government and Territorial Development School.
The Ministry of Finance (MF) will hold a navie festival in its own hall of events with the participation of 436 workers.
The Navy party will have a 2500 HUF budget per guest - this budget will be paid with buffet and a gift.
Since János Veres is a minister, MF workers all year round celebrate the same kind of Christmas.
Instead, there will be no festival atmosphere, the official nature will be given not only by the ministerial speech, but also by the afternoon of its celebration.
The agricultural map will offer a New Year's reception on 20 January, in the Ministry will not celebrate Christmas.
The reception will take place at the Vajdahunyad Castle of the Municipal Park and, as the map has been reported, there will be a budget of 1000 HUF per person for hundreds of guests.
This - according to the press department - will be a very simple foot reception, which will be invited only to specialized diplomats, accredited in Hungary.
These receptions, which are held every year, begin with a short ministerial meeting and end with a modest meal.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Education and Culture will not celebrate any Christmas festival - that is what the relevant press departments have informed you [or,].
In the Department of the Press of the Environment Map they were unable to report on the budget of the Ministry's navigable holdings.
What is known is that for the festival to be held at the Museum of Applied Arts, more than four hundred people were invited.
The forces of the giant strike were gathering
The League Trade Unions and the National Federation of Labour Commissions will be a strike committee tomorrow to coordinate the strike of the moon that will last for an indefinite time.
The Sabbath will be held in protest, while the Monday - the day when the final vote on public health law will begin.
With all due certainty, this action will lead to major difficulties in transport, as the rail traffic will be completely halted and up to 13 hours will also be in pursuit of the workers of Budapest's collective transport company.
On Friday evening, the League Trade Unions will report on the details of their monthly strike that will be held together with the National Federation of Labour Commissions.
It will also be established by the LIGA and the National Trade Union of Machines, which will coordinate the actions of the moon.
The Sabbath will be held with a mixed protest, while the participants' union will be declared in jail for an indefinite time if they do not reach an agreement with the Government.
This means that, on the day of the parliamentary vote on public health law, they did not report on the date of the end of the strike.
If the National Assembly violates public health law, trade unions will immediately withdraw their appeal to the strike.
Instead, if the law is approved, the shooting commissions will meet and decide on the future.
On the basis of the order of the day of the month of the National Assembly, it is also possible to vote only on public health law in the very hours of the night, or at best near midnight.
As a result of the strike that will begin Monday, there will be significant difficulties in transport: the railways will cease to work for an indefinite time, a part of Budapest's collective transport and more than half of the interurban bus transport of Volan companies can be seen in the morning.
At the same time, in many points of the country, half the road will be closed.
A number of civil unions and organizations have joined the strike, their names are constantly updated on the League's website.
Some trade unions announced their strike for an indefinite time, others for a fixed time.
Until late Thursday, the State Railway and the Free Trade Union (SLTF) were unable to reach an agreement even on minimum services, however, when Christmas festivals were near, they were more and more people traveling on trains.
According to information received so far, from the beginning of the day to the 13 hours, workers from the collective transport company in Budapest, Budapest Airports from 7 to 9 a.m., will hold a four-hour strike at the LIGA trade unions in the electricity and thermal energy industry, the Education Unions called for a 2- to 8-hour strike and the Democratic Trade Union of the Educators.
The Hungarian Medical Association will be held nationally in alternate hours and the Democratic Union of Health and Social Workers (SDTSSS) as part of the Trade Cooperation Forum will hold a two-hour warning call.
The most important of the four requests made by the League is that the Government withdraws its proposal on public health reform and submits a new concept to a social debate.
The second requirement is to gradually introduce the new form of calculation of pensions that will enter into force next year.
The third is to ensure, even before 2010, that advanced pensions may be allowed to enter the system by the occupations they deserve.
The fourth reason for the strike is that the Free Trade Union of Railway Workers (SLTF) which is part of the League Trade Unions do not accept the proposal of the Ministry of Economics and Transport on railway lines and expect another different proposal.
Political Capital[b1]: Risk increases in the country by the Hungarian Guard
According to the Risk Analysis Division of the Political Capital, the activities of the Hungarian Guard, consisting in August this year with the support of the Movement by a Better Hungary, has increased the political risk of Hungary and the region from several points of view.
The company's "warning of risks" is written: in relation to the activities of the Hungarian Guard, the biggest political risk is the fact that "with the increase of ethnic tensions between the Gitan and non-Gita population of Hungary, even in the short term, violent ethnic confrontations can be produced".
The main reason for this is that the Hungarian Guard's political strategy is probably the result of an event of this nature - the representative of the research institute added.
They said that all of this was due to one of the main shortcomings of Hungarian political advocates: "the public life protagonists gave him the public debate on the Gitan problem to representatives of radical and extremist political groups, who could base their policy strategy on the existing discrepancy between the Gypsies and Hungarians".
This aggravates the problem, prevents normal dialogue, strengthens extremists and increases the likelihood of the establishment of violent conflicts - they estimate.
In addition, according to the Institute of Research, the activities of the National Guard, due to the great attention of the national and international media, “has significantly damaged Hungary's image abroad, especially with regard to the country's stability and democratic development”.
We recall that since the autumn of 2006, there has been increased publicity and impetus for the reorganization of the radical and extreme right groups in Hungary and that since the summer of 2007, many organizations have been established in the country which are self-defined as "national self-defence associations".
"The common feature of these groups is that they are self-defined as civil organizations, while they openly declare the training of their members for defence - even armed - (civil defence, national defence, public order defence) and that they attach themselves to the ineptities of the police, the army, that is, the State" - adds.
They stated that all of this is done in accordance with the method of attempting to give a civilian presentation to different political aspirations, based on the dissatisfiedness of society with politics and political parties.
The importance of civilisation and the form of association in the case of such associations is not only to avoid legal problems of legal registration, but it is also a political strategy at the same time.
According to the analysis, the activities of the Hungarian Guard are also a risk factor from the point of view of neighboring relations.
"In recent months, many neighbouring States have referred to the Hungarian Guard as a potential danger, while the foreign-national political figures of certain neighbouring countries want to justify their own anti-Hungary policy with the establishment of the Hungarian Guard.
All of this affects the political stability of the region" - they added.
According to the research institute, the constitution of the Hungarian Guard is not an isolated phenomenon in the Central and Eastern Europe, so that political risks are increased throughout the region.
They wrote that the Hungarian Guard works similarly, for example the Bulgarian National Guard, whose constitution was announced in August 2007 by the Bulgarian National Union (UNB) on the right.
The composition of the Bulgarian guard is due to the massive disturbances of the Gitans that occurred in one of Sofia's bars (Krasna Poliana).
Taking advantage of this situation, UNB decided to constitute the guard, with the argument that the organization's objective is "national self-defence".
In his view, in the last 17 years there has been a "gitane terror" in Bulgaria, although the State remained powerless and indifferent to the facts - recalls the Political Capital.
They added: this initiative has led to an animated discussion in the Bulgarian public opinion.
As it has been written, it indicates the increase in the risk of ethnic confrontations that certain Roma organizations in Bulgaria have announced that to resist, they will be their own guard.
As the functioning of the Hungarian Guard has so far shown similarities with the Bulgarian National Guard, it cannot be excluded that the Hungarians also respond to the threat in a similar way, organizing their own self-defense - can be read in the warning about the risks of the Political Capital.
The Director of Political Capital Investigations, Attila Juhász, at the news agency's question, stated that the risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.
As he said, each year they publish their risk analysis and when they experience something that can influence the risk change, they inform the public opinion, as in this case, by publishing their warning about risks.
The festival is not always written with red numbers
In Hungary the law defines exactly the days that are written with red numbers in the calendar and has already become a generalized practice that is around the festival days - that the next year will be less - the working days will be reorganised.
Even in the EU or North America, the parties are united.
Hungarian laws make a difference between national festivals, State festivals and festivals.
The festivals are fundamentally related to religious festivals and historical events.
Let's celebrate the New Year too: both the last day of the old year, and the first day of the new year is a festival - this last of all so that those who attended the old year can rest.
Throughout the year, we have eleven written dates with red numbers in the calendar.
It is a national festival on 15 March in memory of the 1848 revolution and on 23 October, a memorial day of the 1956 revolution.
On 20 August we celebrated the establishment of the State, on 1 May the festival of work, on 1 and 2 November we remind our families and missing friends.
In addition, in our country the Easter, Pentecost and Christmas are held for two days.
According to the calendar, our national, national or religious festivals rarely coincide with a weekend, so it is often done when there is only one working day before or after the party.
Instead of the extended weekends, you can not be absent from work or school during the preceding weeks.
He is the Minister of Labour who rules in his specific decree when it is necessary to work directly instead of the day directly before or after the party.
This legal standard is mandatory for all employers and their employees, as well as for employees and public officials.
It is not mandatory to exchange companies and services institutions that, due to their role, work in an endless manner even during the festival days.
This year's work order can only be changed about the end of the year: from 24 December, it is practically stopped in the country, since, according to the experience, most people "has been busy" during Christmas and the end of the year or take their holidays during these days.
The next year several of our festivals will coincide with averages or weekends, so there will be fewer changes in working days than this year.
First, the agenda will be modified around the work party so that workers can rest within four days.
On Saturday, 26 April, it will be a working day, so that on Friday, 2 May, it will be a festival day.
The other change relates to the 23 October festival: on Saturday, 18 October, it will have to work instead of Friday 24.
On the other hand, the year will come during the end of the year, as from 24 December it will not work in almost any part, even if the last day of the year is a Wednesday.
Six little insatiables to ruin the lives of your fellows
E-mails that we forget to send, sound messages we've never received, innocent lies that leave us unawares: they're all part of our Folklore" daily at work.
You have to decide whether to adapt to minor disorders or to avoid sensitive situations that may irritate others.
Councils.
I'm sorry, I forgot to warn you that you've been looking for the marketing department" - one of your colleagues says."
Why wasn't that a date?
In the best of the cases, you feel it and try to fix the matter, and best call the marketing department to tell them that you have forgotten to deliver the message (this is the least common solution).
In most cases the matter is resolved by asking for forgiveness.
Before you go to oral explanations, it is worth meditating on the things that you can ruin the life of your colleagues and sincerely trying to avoid them.
Did you get something that wasn't yours?
There is nothing more irritant than when you want to get a document, an office utility or your phone and you don't find them.
You remember yesterday you put the graffiti on the table, but this morning it disappeared?
Do you find your lost bibliography in one of your colleagues' table?
Don't leave anything to your colleagues without asking them, because they'll rightly be mad at you for removing their things.
Don't worry about the office or post-it because it may be unpleasant when you need it right away and it's over before time.
Do you think about your colleagues' private life?
There is no good solution to stop noises that are already running.
Who, what are you doing, and with whom?
Where and why?
Don't pass on to everyone the information (congestions) you have about the particular life of your colleagues!
Don't abuse your colleague's trust when you share with you your most intimate secrets!
I'll tell you what you've heard and don't chisme about your colleague in his absence, even if others also know about him.
You're going to get sicklyly licensed?
When you call the office by phone and say you're sick and you're feeling uncomfortable with your head, you feel bad or well, feeling that day you prefer to rest; think that others have to do your work, your impossible tasks, your work in the end.
Don't ask your colleague!
If you know in advance that the next day you won't go to the office or something may happen to you, so you must stay at home, communiques, so your colleagues or your boss won't have to face you the next day without you.
Tarares, recipes, telephone calls
You're tired of your job, but you're busted out of it by your colleagues?
Have you heard of a phone conversation that would have been better not to listen to it?
Don't bother your colleagues with your taarers, songs, conversations in high voice (but when you do them on top of your head), patels, constant blasphemys, expressing your discontent in high voice.
All of these can be disturbed, although they are currently not deeply in a project (writing, planning, organization).
Do you blame others for a mistake?
Don't blame others if you haven't done anything in time, you forgot to send an important letter or a message!
Do not lift to the fallen possibly reminiscent in the office, nor to the noise that your fellows make!
You must recognize if you have made a mistake that harms others and you must repair the missing!
Ask me how you can fix your lack!
Are you feeling too much at home at the office?
Jogging and zapatillas: I'm very comfortable for the house, but it's not suitable for the office!
You don't see a way to jogging even if your occupation allows it!
Don't be disappointed, respect your colleagues and yourself looking at everyday clothes, elegant and beautiful when your occupation so requires!
Interested losses if you want to meet the expectations of the public
The car slows down in the usual attack in the morning.
Plays a strange game on the radio: violence with electronic effects.
I'm on the volume.
Change the rhythm of music and to the previous tunes add the bottom and then the voice of a female choir as a true joy intervenes.
The mr2 channel plays the song Wings of Love of Zagar.
National musical life did not bother us much with electronic quality pop.
But now it looks completely different when you're listening to Zagar's new album.
Yonderboi appears. Some new and interesting songs from the subground [b2]digital [b3] national little change of image and even though again the rock style garage, guitar break, national pop electricity has shown: there are news under the Sun.
Balázs Zzáser started his career in the city of Pécs, he played in the Yonderboi complex until he started his independent career perhaps because both can't be protagonists of the same set.
With his project (Zagar) and his music, a mix of jazz, cheap electronic music and pop, he tried to triunfar, when he was asked for soundtracks [b4] cinematographics (pl.
Ferenc Török Season).
The wider audience knew the whole that in principle only acted in small clubs when the wan2 magazine selected its first album edited in 2002 among the fifty most important national discs, rating Zagar, along with Yonderboi as almost the only national trainer of trends, could also be sold in the western markets.
There is no doubt that Zagar and his group are fashionable, but no one has asked them whether they take this label or not.
The set responded how to react: it prepared a new and even better disk.
The recently released disc, entitled Cannot Walk Fly Instead, can open new paths for them, although the title itself intends to establish continuity with the early years in the city of Pécs.
Because this title was one of the lines of the old set of Balázs Zzáser.
It's a good reference to the noise, the flight, but in addition to the noise of the music, it now appeared - according to the spirit and the trend of the time - the guitar that sounds stronger, the effect of rock and roll.
With these songs, the album was presented at the Millennium György Ligeti, the current singer working in England with The Puzzle set.
The disc includes a real success from the Mr2 Pethúfi channel that lasts from morning to evening popular music. This station brought up to the listeners the high-flight music of Wings of Love, recorded with six Hungarian songs (Divas Underground").
So it's all right (?)
hvg.hu asks the Balázs Zzáger.
hvg.hu: After this new success the question arises: What are you interpreting, how much is a music dedicated to a chosen audience?
Ballázs Zzázer: The definition of the chosen public for me means little.
In my opinion there are two types of castles in light music; not mainstream and underground[b5], not alternative and pop, but commercial and sincere.
The so-called subterranean alternative music can also be boring, without meaning, and can also be made only for sale, which makes it commercial.
But also a good pop song can come from a sincere inspiration.
The attitude of the listeners also works with this spirit, regardless of national languages and borders.
hvg.hu: Do you see any difference between the reception of your music by Hungarian and foreign public?
B. Zs: In the foreign world, especially in the western part of us, light music has larger traditions.
There, not only the generation of five and twenty years, perform the concerts, but also the oldest ones.
They pay much more attention to the changes that are happening around them in light music, because they consider it part of contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What role does the public have in your work?
Do you care who they are, where they are, and how many people are listening to your music?
B.Zs: Of course, I'm glad to see more and more people attend our concerts every time.
But we've never made music for the market.
We don't make music for some purpose, but for some reason.
The role of the public is better felt in the concerts where there is mutual influence, but this is only in the inconceivable changes of the moment.
And yet, I realize that if you want to meet the expectations of the public, you will lose your interest.
hvg.hu: To what point do you want to follow the example of Yonderboi?
He works alone and made his career better in the west of us.
B.Zs: We do not follow his path, although sometimes they try to compare our music with that of him.
We work better together, we trust each other's musical presence and let it develop.
At first it was impossible to compare our work with Yonderboi's music, because many of us started our career in their group and then started another way.
hvg.hu: The success list of Mr2 Petõfi Wings of Love is in the first place.
Many people first heard the name Zagar in connection with this song.
Are you aware of this style towards a wider layer?
Zs.B.: We did not intend to make great successes and sell with these success our disc.
This song is something more than that.
We add it to the end of the disc, trying to relax after the sound organ of the disc and the most heavy themes.
hvg.hu: How have you selected the six singers?
Why just to them - what was the main reason?
B.Zs: The idea was to create a crown in yellow-style.
Then came the idea of creating this choir of the soloists of our own national musical stage.
So it was created by six women - either Sena, Kutzora Edina, Judy Jay, Bori Peterfy, Ennikõ Hodosi [Neo] and Juci Nemeth - who was then baptized as Divas de Underground.
hvg.hu: Did you make exactly the song or the girls change some things?
Zs.B.: This song was there a long time ago in instrumental version and when we had all the material on the disc, we thought there was still something missing.
The deal drew the song.
That night, they even recorded the song that the girls later learned.
Everything came to the first attempt and in a incredibly spontaneous way.
I remember, I was very excited then, but of course I also needed the Divas.
With my voice I wouldn't have worked so hard.
hvg.hu: Both in the concert and in the disc appear as if the girls were in the second floor.
There are no soloists (except Judy Jay's short solo), they don't have their own role, they sing all together and not more strongly than music, so music doesn't just follow their songs.
Also in the stage are in the background.
intentional?
B.Zs: They are in the background simply because of technical problems.
Instead, consciously, we didn't want to distribute soloist papers.
The song also says about it, about which we forget a lot of our own, who from where he has come and where he goes, let us leave it, because those tears of love lift us up.
I'd like to see others also feel that state of euphoric enthusiasm that we felt when this song was born.
hvg.hu: What else have you dedicated to?
Zs.B.: In the musical composition actually to no one, rather at the time of mixing there were more difficult parts.
For example, Dorian Gray's Dilemma in which I'm playing on a concert piano or the Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls, where for a long time I didn't want to work the grove and then, little by little, everything was put in its place like a puzzle.
hvg.hu: What is your favorite song on the new disc?
Zs.B.: This changes constantly with the concerts and because I've already "stop" the disc.
Now the Prophet Is A Fool, the Escape From The Earth and the Never The Same.
A bus driver takes thousands of millions by his inferiority complex
It's a malicious betrayal.
This is how it points to its former employee, Jerome Kerviel, the great French banker of General Societé, also owner of the Czech Trade Bank.
He lost about five billion euros for it.
However, it seems better that Kerviel was a great player who wanted to compare himself to his colleagues and, of course, with good abilities.
It took time, unlike all the big Czech banks, the crisis in the American mortgage market.
"He has a fragile character" was allowed to hear from his superiors, the very ones who sent him to the police.
But what happened to Kerviel's responses is that the French media, such as the Le Monde newspaper, were dealing with a man who at the end of last year had a gain of more than EUR 1,600 million because of his business.
Crisis Not Only in America
"All you want to do was earn money for my bank" ensures in your answers.
Exactly, in the summer, he was able to win 500 million euros during the American crisis.
This opportunity has already seen her come at the beginning of the year.
In February some news about the sub-primary mortgage calls offered to low-income clients or those who had problems with payments in the past and that these clients would start having problems.
However, this crisis should not affect the whole economy.
Kerviel didn't believe it and was correct.
And then, at the end of the year, their profits exceeded EUR 1,600 million.
"When I win my first 500 million won't know how to report it," Kerviel confides and adds, that nothing has been left for him himself, absolutely.
Throughout the interrogation, he stated that the records had been incorrect in such a way as not to be found.
He even came to deceive the leaders, even when the Eurex Bols began to take an interest in his business.
The risk became beneficial
I was afraid you'd find out?
Better, no.
"I thought he had won 1,600 million for the bank and that from that simple fact, that would please them."
Where did he get so much volunteer strength to get this way?
In my position, I had to work gradually.
He went to work at the General Society in 2000, just after finishing his studies in Lyon.
Its annual salary was between $11,000.
Two years later he was already a Bolsa driver's assistant, and in 2005 he became a bus driver with an annual salary of $90,000.
Still, I knew I would never win as much as the others.
"In my first interview in 2005, I noticed that they were watching me carefully.
Because of my training and also my professional and personal progress," Kerviel described to the researchers.
But shortly after I got into the company, the first big success came.
Thanks to Allianz's actions, he won, during the bombings in London, playing low a figure of 500 million euros.
And this is supposed to be a start-up mechanism, and I want more.
If you win, we'll leave you.
"This is like a snowball," said the police.
But it's said that the bosses knew about all this or that they'd rather suspect it.
"As long as I got money, my eyes were closed."
Only then came the attack at the beginning of this year.
One day he lost billions of euros.
After the end of the week in mid-January, I wanted to wipe out all the eggs.
When the moon came to work, I didn't work in the bank anymore.
And two days later, the bank announced that it had lost EUR 5,000 million for its guilt.
And how were they able to locate him?
He became suspicious from his vacations.
"I only chose four days for the past year.
The runner who doesn't have vacations is a runner who doesn't want anyone to take a look at his expedition," said Kerviel.
The Czech Republic has access to 365 billion
The government ministers of the Czech Republic signed yesterday with representatives of the European Commission a total of nine operational programmes for which the Czech Republic can achieve EUR 14 billion (about EUR 365 billion).
It is practically half the total amount that the Czech Republic can obtain from Brussels for the years 2007-2013.
Of seven operational programmes, approximately 125 billion crowns will be delivered to the regions.
Chechnya companies will be able to obtain around 100 billion crowns from the Business and Innovation Programme.
Most of the money will be for transport up to 150 billion.
The Transport Programme is the largest of the operational programmes and represents up to 22 per cent of the resources available to the Czech Republic from the Fund.
This money increases the budget of the State Fund for Transport Infrastructures, which will next year account for the amount of 90,800 million crowns.
The Business and Innovation Programme should serve entrepreneurs and businesses for the resource of business innovation.
Companies should receive funding for the acquisition of new technologies, for industrial research and for the implementation of more effective organizational methods.
With regard to the current use of EU funds, the Czech Republic is among the most recent countries that use them.
Twenty-one years old for the representative of Nicaragua, the court ruled
The Nicaraguan Appeals Tribunal ruled on Thursday the 20-year sentence for the country's representative, Arnaldo Alemán, who was sentenced to 100 billion dollars in 2003 (about 1,800 million crowns).
Nevertheless, a while later, he was released from prison to go into house arrest in his factory not far from the Nicaraguan Metropolis.
It is not clear at these times, according to the AP agency, that, then the chief of the Central American state between 1197 and 2002, is again between kings.
According to the President of the Appeals Tribunal, Ileana Pérez will be better dependent on prison officials if they let Germany end their sentence at home or if they do so again in prison.
Four years ago, the court demonstrated how German was constantly transferring government money to the account of a company in Panama.
This society was fiction and the account actually belonged to its closest family members and supporters.
Part of this money ended in the fund that Germany created to finance its campaign in the 2001 elections.
So we were approved by the budget.
That's right.
The budget of the State was adopted.
Why is this budget special?
It is the first developed by this Government and accepted by the majority of coalitions without the support of the opposition.
The budget for this year was already adopted with the support of ČSSD, because it was prepared by Minister Sobotka and ČSSD could not be allowed to accept it.
Apart from different debates before the vote on the government's confidence vote, this time there was nothing dramatic.
The parliamentary assembly, in this traditional view, although most influential, calmly adopted the new law.
It's a big paradox.
Each government starts and ends with each chapter and starts the budget, likes it or not.
The budget is an important part of politics, but it conceals the flexibility of power between the government and the opposition.
It is important for the media and therefore devotes special attention to them.
Political discussions are far more interesting than simple numbers.
The State budgets of the last Governments of the democracies suffered three shortcomings that could not be resolved so easily for 2008:
The first of these is the high participation in mandatory laws, called as the costs of not only pensions but also social benefits that have already been approved last year before the elections by the "silent" coalition of ČSSD and KSČM.
The second is the deficit in the economy as a result of the first deficit.
The third limit is the deficit of public funding, such as the municipal and Community budget deficit.
Nevertheless, the highest risk is not in the deficit of the State budget.
This is public and relatively under control.
The clock bomb, however, is in the absence of the municipal and Community budget.
In order to obtain other investment sources, apart from taxes, taxes and bank credits, many have often issued disproportionately obligations with which they have made their payments.
In recent years these debts have been paid through the massive sale of energy actions and other development networks received from the state and privatization.
They currently do not have this resource.
If we only tell the official and verified facts, we find that:
Our economy, a few years ago, has passed through stages of growth in the same way as the rest of the world, of what is happening in ČSSD.
This was the ideal occasion for his government to order the State's finances.
Instead, however, the state continued to deteriorate.
The rest of the countries, with the exception of some such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan and Egypt, had significantly more economical than our republic.
It is a great shame that falls, above all, in the previous government.
We belong to the nations that are less threatened by poverty within global measures.
That is why there is no need for massive social programmes that have, unfortunately, been unsustainable in recent years.
And although they were able to eliminate part of the incomprehensible population costs adopted this year before the elections, if it does not change the age of retirement and pension reform, then it will be the end of any policy in this country and, the government who will rule will only be a simple bureaucracy.
By exaggerating a little, we can say that the politicians in the government will turn into officials, mechanical distributors of the majority of the money of taxes for jubilation and social benefits.
Therefore, this year's budget cannot be revolutionary, but it can stop the pressure on the normal costs of the mandaters.
The planned deficit of more than 70 billion for 2008 would have been absolutely unnecessary if the previous government had not abused what they had been able to do in the last ten years.
We do not want the politicians in the government to become only officials, so we must be patient and give this weak coalition of the government, which is seen to be that the state can only spend what it can get from taxes and taxes, the peace for the preparation of other reforms of the laws.
This will only make it possible to achieve a balanced budget of the State.

Banks want to resolve the crisis
The United States Federal Reserve Bank, the European Central Bank and the British, Swiss and Canadian Central Banks decided to fight together against the financial market crisis.
The Monetary Mark will receive more than a hundred billion dollars through bids.
In these tenders, banks are in charge of the types of interest for which they are able to provide money.
For example, the American Fed will send $40 billion to petition, and then another $40 billion will be made available to the Central Banks of Europe and Switzerland.
Following the attacks of 11 September, it is the first time that central banks of different states agree in this coordinated process to protect and reduce the consequences of the financial crisis.
"This step must solve the biggest economic problem, i.e. the continuing growth of the free capital gap that banks could afford," wrote Bernard Baumohl in his report to customers, the consultant for the Economic Outlook Group.
"This coordinated action by the central banks probably reduced the recession in the United States from 65 per cent to 50 per cent" added Baumohl in his report.
Banks have already spent $60 billion on paid credits, especially in the United States.
The economists still expect billions of dollars in losses.
"Central banks must really be afraid of what they are still waiting for when they decide to take this step," ABN Amro's leading economist Kieran Davies said.
"It seems that the situation is really bad," he added.
Central banks are afraid that they have the same access problems with loans and that they will therefore have to pay more expensive to their customers.
This would reduce consumption and send the American economy to the recession with a different impact on the growth of the world economy.
The central banks thus decided, after not being able to reduce the so-called LIBOR rate, the London interbank rate used for the loan of money in the interbank market.
This means that banks were constantly afraid to pay money even when the Central Banks of the United States, Canada and Great Britain reduced their interest rates several times during the autumn.
"It will have the same effect as another drop of interest rates," said Reuters agency Greg Salvaggio of the Tempus Consulting company.
Some economists are not surprised that the step taken by the central banks contributes to the crisis because it does not solve the fundamental problem that is the fall of the real estate market in the US.
Klaus: Ecologists' discussions are incredible
Global climate change affects especially developing countries.
President Václav Klaus once again spoke about the problem of global warming.
The criticism now emerged at the conclusion of the United Nations International Conference on Climate Change in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book Blue, not green planet, he commented that the discussions of ecologists are incredible.
Klaus says that it is unacceptable not only the structure of the conference that creates an extraordinary mix of representatives of government and non-governmental organizations, but the fundamental difference between the rhetoric used and the reality.
"There are only structured debates, they are artificial fires of words, substitutes of solution to current problems," Klaus said.
The Czech President during the presentation of his book stressed that this issue was very important to him and that is why he was interested.
He also expressed his joy at discovering his book translated into German because, as he said, "Many times I only find myself with the character of my ideas."
Interested parties can now be informed of their differing views.
Klaus recalled that he is not a climatologist but that he has, according to his opinion, sufficient assumptions as to write a book like this.
It is academic, with the ability to follow and judge a specialized entertainment, has experiences with statistics and is also an economist.
At the key point of the closure, he expressed his view that climate changes are constant and that their changes are normal, that there is no agreement between scientists on the warming of the planet, that the consequences of the current changes are not so large and serious, nor represent possible disasters, and that efforts to influence climate development are ineffective, ineffective and cost-effective.
In addition, as a man experienced with totalitarianism, it is unacceptable to impose unproved opinions on others, which is a dangerous way to restrict the freedom of others.
The questions posed by the present were repeatedly explained that it is not against "the reasonable defenders of the environment, but against the ecologicalists who do not take into account the relationship between costs and benefits".
Klaus spoke on the same topic in Vienna two months ago at Hayes Institute.
600 thousand people could not change their sheep to drive
To six hundred thousand drivers were past the date and therefore they were not able to change their old meat to carry which validity ended at the end of the year.
Today is the last day when people can ask for the change so that the staff can take time to the end of the year to issue the new meat.
However, the Ministry does not fear that after a new year, hundreds of thousands of drivers will be found on the streets without the valid meat.
According to traffic, the meat has not been changed primarily by those who are not even willing to drive.
As the people announce a rapid decline in the exchange of meat, the metropolis offices are filled with requests and the interest of the new meat has increased.
The Foundation calculates about 2,000 daily customers.
There's a half-hour waiting for the wheels.
The new meat has not yet been removed in Prague about 14,000 drivers.
The issue of a new meat lasts twenty days.
However, it is possible to request the issue of meat within a shorter period of five days.
But in that case, the driver must pay fifty crowns.
The drivers who are obliged to change their meat and do not reach the end of the year, but they will be on the streets without the valid meat will be taken to a mill from January.
The offender will pay a maximum of two thousand crowns.
The police can fix the offence with an amnesty.
If it is an administrative offence, the wave will rise to 2,500 crowns.
According to previous information, you could receive a lot of that person who does not go anywhere.
They could pay at least 30,000 crowns.
The Ministry called on offices to gradually enter many thousands of crowns, as maximum.
According to the voice of the Ministry of Transport, Karel Hanzelka, many thousands of crowns threaten no one.
According to him, the meat is a document in which people can decide whether they want it or not.
It is not the body of identity that each person must have valid.
People who don't want to drive should deliver the meat to drive.
Just bring it in or send it by email certified to municipal offices.
At the end of the year, the animals issued during the years 1964 and 1993 were left to be valid.
However, drivers should gradually change the other types of meat to drive.
People with the document between 1994 and 2000 are up to three years old to change it.
The validity of the meat issued between 2001 and 2004 ended in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, it is about 2.6 million more documents.
The court reduced the punishment for Berdych's complicit detectives
The former officers Josef Opava and Petr Kojörík accused of complicity with the criminal David Berdych are going to be spent in prison for thirty-ten years.
The Supreme Court of Prague decided as a final sentence the reduction of penalties, the first one year, and the second two years.
The department's detectives complained about organized crime, in principle, between 14 and 12 years of age.
Against today's decision, it can no longer be invoked, only by the repeal of the Supreme Court.
Berdych is also in this case accused, but he is primarily awaiting the verdict of the Court of First Instance.
Despite this in other processes, it has been sentenced to a total of 16 years.
He can't get any more.
In January, the District Court recognized the participation of 19 persons and today the Supreme Court withdrew to 16 of them.
Most of the accused ' s allegations were rejected by the investigation because of invented causes.
According to the headquarters of Central Bohemia, police officers in accordance with Berdich provided information on police sources to criminals, covered the thefts, and helped members of the criminal group to avoid penalties.
These criminals delivered 30 percent of their slaves to Opava and Kojrík.
The charge relates to the criminal acts carried out by the group between 1999 and 2001.
As for the theft, its victims suffered serious health impacts, but they were also accused of abuse of power as public agents and without the permission of weapons.
In the domestic register, the police found guns, ammunition with steel core, a laser manager and a amplifier.
The criminal group, according to the charge, stole tens of millions of crowns.
With the exception of almost twenty men in this process, the court has already confessed to Berdych and others guilty.
Other men related to the case of Berdych are still declaring other processes, and in some cases they have not yet appeared.
Tomáš Pót and Maroš Šulej, who have now avoided the trial, are in prison in Ireland, where they expect the final decision on their delivery to the authorities of the Czech Republic.
One account for changing children: 12 million
To change some children in the maternity home, the lawyer of the affected families, Igor Veleba, wants 12 million crowns of compensation more than the costs of the trial.
For each of the mothers, three million, for parents, two million, and for children, one million.
The hospital offers at least 200,000 for each father.
The legal representative of the hospital, Ondréj Dostal, is not in principle in accordance with the Veleba proposal.
"So demand we don't approve, it's too high," Dostal said after the meeting today.
"In order for us to make an idea of this counter-proposal, we need the expert's report that the opponent sent to investigate.
We'll find out if it has a reciprocal value.
We keep in mind that there will be hundreds of thousands for all," said Dostal.
The amount should be moved between 100,000 and 200,000 crowns for each parent.
At the beginning of the case, Jablon's family wanted every month that they did not create their biological daughter, a million crowns.
Vela was served as the basis for negotiating the compensation of the expert's report, only that it was prepared at Motol's facility in Prague.
The parents of girls according to psychologists and psychiatrists suffered psychological and stress at different levels and depth.
The stress situation was better sustained by men despite the struggle with crimes against girls.
Women take it worse with the trauma they are currently living and with regard to what is happening today, Veleba completed.
Verónica and Nicola were changed by nurses in the Mother's House of Thrébič last year, the ninth of December.
Last week, the girls returned to their biological parents, Nicola and Čermákový and Príbislavic, and Verónica and Libor Brož and Jaroslava Trojanov in Jablon.
The governor of Vysočina, Miloš Vystrčil, delivered 100,000 crowns to each family at the end of October as compensation costs for the error committed in the hospital in Trebič that the region administers.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic are guaranteed by law as liability for damages.
In the case of errors, the reserve fund should be withdrawn and may request assistance from the administrator.
The court has so far recognized them as a relatively low compensation, the amounts calculated according to the tables of hundreds of thousands and of millions of crowns.
Polivka lost the kingdom of Valaquia
Bolek Polívka lost the battle on the flag of the Kingdom of Valaquia.
According to the court of the provincial court of Ostrava, it was the first to use the Kingdom brand of Valaquia, but the project was created for many years by Tomáš Harabiš with whom the actor collaborated.
Polivka didn't present today to the oral view.
According to your lawyer, the case is probably not over and your client will run.
"The dispute consists of that Mr. Harabiš and his team are a Parisian of the popularity of Bolek Polivka," said after the trial, Polivka's lawyer.
For him, in front of the words of the Kingdom of Valaquia, the image of the actor and comic is everywhere.
The same idea also has Harabiš.
"We've been after us for ten years of work.
Search for money and invention of activities," he said.
For him, the cause of the plague is in the money.
"After years I have learned that the project has been successful and that it could therefore also receive something.
They want to live as Parisians of our work," he added.
A lucrative business
According to the court, the Kingdom brand of Valaquia was first used by Polivka in its television program.
In 1993 he was crowned by actor Radoslav Brzobohatý.
Then it was not intended to guide him towards the creation of a fictitious kingdom.
A few years later in Harabiš he was able to edit the passport from the Kingdom of Valaquia.
From that comic, it was a business and a lucrative business activity in which Harabiš created the Kingdom of Valaquia.
In 1997, Polivka agreed to use her name and sign the passports and even offered her owners discounts to visitors from her farm and visitors to her exhibitions.
Who's gonna sit on the throne?
The judge today also determined that Harabiš used only a simple idea that Polivka made public on the stage for his own business benefit.
"It is clear that Bolek Polívka helped the popularity of the Kingdom of Valaquia," the judge said.
He added, however, that in the spirit of the project is Harabiš and his team who have dedicated themselves to it.
The collaboration, among today's uncompromising parties, continued until 2000 when Harabiš organized official coronation for Polivka in Vsetín.
Since then, conflicts have begun between Polívka and Harabiš whose culmination has resulted in the defeat of "King Boleslav I, the elected forever".
The main role in the kingdom, by means of Harabiš, was achieved in the singer Jarmila Šuláková, as the queen's mother.
In 2002, Polivka filed a complaint against Harabiš and his society that has been rejected by the court so far.
Something clearly could lead to the fight, the tournament for the throne with its princesses, which is already preparing Haribish.
From him should come the new king.
He didn't want to reveal any more data or dates.
"We don't have any prizes.
It should be something like the king's way to Moravia.
The king should be elected on a specific date.
Even Mr. Polívka can present himself" added Harabiš.
Test Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi: excessive damage
In fact, I never liked Peugeotu 206.
Its walking characteristics were never special, the quality of the change box, the manoeuvre, and also the product could be characterised as under the medium.
But now there is in the market its successor, the Peugeot 207, and this is much better.
This Combi called SW is a bit more advanced and to me, I'm just gonna think about it better.
When I tried the classic Peugeot 207 five doors, I complained, for example, of the head space in the back seat.
But this would be the only complaint because the ride of the Combi means in this sense, that I'm not going to suffer before two meters long.
Flying by the world
Step through the inside quickly so that you don't repeat it too much.
It is an elegant design where the only defect is the poor central tunnel.
Here I would appreciate the design invention even though the car already seems quite elegant.
The seats are comfortable, and there are times when we were angry with short seats and supported.
Unlike model 206, the lateral direction has also improved considerably.
And the space?, and here you can feel how the road measures have grown.
In the Combi disappears the mentioned lack of space in the head.
Malettes on the maltery
But the main thing in this vehicle is your suitcase.
This should be appreciated as very accessible ( thanks to the portable back door) and a well-shared storage.
Dead spaces are equipped with rubber mail that provides an ideal solution.
They do not bother, and they can be extended to the point of subjecting heavy objects.
But we stay in the warehouse.
According to the tables, in a basic regime, it has a capacity of 428 litres, which is better than a average value compared to the competition.
But not in comparison with the vehicle of the same type sold in the Czech Republic, Scotland Fabia Combi.
If we compare the 207 SW to the new generation of Mladá Boleslav model, let's assume that the Peugeot remains on the roof with its perceived 52 litres.
For vacations abroad or for placing the baby's kitchen is critical.
But if I had to comment on something positive, then I have to quote the space that remains quite flat after subtracting the back of the second line.
120 Horses in Four Horses
Our vehicle test was equipped with a four valve injector on a 1.6 l capacity and 88 kW force.
And the truth is, that's how it should look like a 1600 that would lower the family five doors.
It's quiet, it's low consumption and, above all, it's driven.
If I compare it with the time of the shock then it seemed as if the escape tube was tapped by a trap, I can say that with this I can be impressed.
Prices Responsibilities
The car price is not for all bottles.
We must, however, bear in mind that we have tested an elegantly equipped vehicle and with a very good engine.
The basic car price with 1400 injection fuel for 329,900 crowns is still possible.
Our aggregates make it from 410,900 crowns, which is already too much.
The tested Premium type already reaches another 80,000 crowns.
Only we would still have airbags in our heads, air conditioned automatically, automatic cleanup, automated rear windows...
I mean, the car with everything, costs 531,900 crowns.
It's a lot, but it's about the team plugins in Fabia and it's going to get to a very similar number.
Now it's only been decided by which of the two marks.
Slovak students are not included in English schools
In English schools children from Eastern European countries are being attended, and therefore the places are afraid of further changes in schools.
The integration of the Eastern Europeans is now only a series of problems.
The British schools also record cases where conflicts between immigrants and children of indigenous origin increase in violence.
The problem of integration of Eastern Europe's children into British schools is well illustrated in the northern city of Kent where the conflicts between the Slovak tribes and immigrants begin to grow.
Discussions, exorcism and arguments among students have already reached even their own parents.
The situation has reached as far as Chatmam's police arrested a Slovak woman who was holding a ten-year-old student with a green beard.
In his defense he said that the girl was insulting her son with racist tone insults.
The police had to act also after a two-year-old girl attack against a Slovak immigrant.
The girls grabbed him with racist insults and threw him to the ground.
"When we went home, a boy approached us at the bus stop and started to dig us up.
When I told him that he would leave us the afternoon to launch us hands and feet, and then he lowered his pants and showed us his back," another unpleasant incident for The Times, the mother of the Slovak student.
The complaints are on both sides.
One of the tribes even designated the conflict with the immigrants in Eastern Europe as a struggle for survival.
The cases mentioned above show us how the environment in English schools becomes quite tense.
In Britain there are 70,000 Slovaks who came here for labor reasons.
About 30,000 Slovak students attend English schools.
Cuba, the most beautiful Caribbean island
For visitors it is really the island of freedom.
Anything you expect from your vacations can be achieved, if you choose correctly.
The sandy and expensive beaches, large oles or a quiet sea like a stench.
the palm trees and everything included with beds offering pizzas on the beach, ice or various cocktails.
Kitesurfing, golf and roll.
On the island of the Caribbean you can find all this and much more.
Only in one island is much more and that island is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful of all the Isles of the Great Antillas.
In the Spanish era, Cuba came to be the conquest of America.
He called her the most beautiful place that human eye has ever seen.
The Habana became a storage and cargo port for the treasures that the Spaniards extracted from America and brought to Europe.
And then came the American era.
The National Hotel grew up in the late 20s.
He was ordered to build one of the heads of American mafia, Lucky Luciano, because everything that had been criminal in the US (and therefore forbidden) was welcome and supported in Cuba as drugs, play and prostitution.
Among his guests were others
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
High buildings emerged in the Habana, with extensive advantages running cars that were a symbol of worship in the last 50 years.
Ernest Hemingway bought a factory in San Francisco de Paula, near La Habana, and Cojimar had his yacht.
In the walls of the Middle East, the stars of the world of the show and politics of all America were left behind.
And today?
On the walls of the Bodeguita you can also leave your autograph.
At the bar of the National Hotel they mix the cocktails according to their wishes.
And these cars have been worshiped since the 1950s, they are still operating by La Habana, because those Ladas and Fiats that have arrived long ago have been oxidized between these wetlands and windy salads.
Even when La Habana, in particular the old neighborhood, is going down significantly, there are not many wonderful colonial monuments around it.
Other places are metmorphose in beauty, for example, Trinidad.
Because tourism brings so much money, its development is guaranteed.
In the last 15 years, new hotels have grown not only in La Habana but also in Varadero, in the coast of the province of Holguín and in islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba still offers a curiosity that is in the unique world and is highly valued by the lovers of the railway.
The sugar cane is transported from large plants to the sugar factories on narrow roads in steam or electric machinery.
Their cars for decades have not been discovered and now they are there, machines that work and whose models of brothers that are in other parts of the world are only in museums.
Where are you going?
The most known place for most visitors does not change.
And that's why you don't need to talk more than La Habana or Varadero.
Maybe, just remember that in Hemingway's already mentioned, there's a museum that for those who love the writer, they don't have to stop visiting him.
The valley of Viñales is the most picturesque coast of Cuba west of the island.
Explosive vegetation that grows in rocky soils.
Mogots, rocky rock Pilons and high-scattered rocks in the fall of the valley, and in their grotesques, the fertile soils are accommodated by which rocklike rocks that hide dense vegetation.
The valley is the place where it is likely to grow, the top quality tobacco in Cuba.
Visiting some of the cleaning factories can be found with your final product.
Perhaps someone seems interested that there was the Chilean part of the series, the Major German.
Trinidad
The old city is abandoned that was founded not long after the Spanish colonize the island.
slavery and sugar brought her fame and wealth.
The wealth became beautiful with the constructions in the small town.
The Spanish colonial architecture, particularly influenced by later French colonies, has only changed in four centuries.
Trinidad, between the sea and the Serra de Escambray, is such a separate place that in the 50th century there was no road to join it with the rest of the country.
Such isolation helped her to stay out of the rest.
Nothing new was built and therefore nothing was destroyed, because everyone was happy to have where to live.
If you have more time to stay in Trinidad than one afternoon, it is worth knowing interesting places in nearby areas such as the Playa de Ancón or the valley of sugar factories.
the night belongs to the House of Music, whose soul with its music is the silence of the morning.
Baracoa
A small town in the far west of Cuba, some consider it the most beautiful of the island.
Surely that opinion has already been confirmed by the way itself.
The two roads that come there from Guantánamo must pass by high and broken mountains, as well as by a nature that only knows man's action.
This eastern location of Cuba has been registered as the Heritage of Humanity by UNESCO thanks to its intact nature.
There they make the best chocolate, in their church they have the cross of Colón (in fact it is a cross that came 100 years later from the landing) and from the hill, where the castle was found and there is now a hotel with its own name, the mountains and among them the most known, the Yunque.
Coffee, red, pure, the Sierra Master, the Baja de las Cochinos and the island of Pinos, the Tropican Cabaret, the Cuban patron, the Virgin of the Charity of the Cobra, the Santeria, the African religion that was practiced by the descendants of those slaves, all of which could be filled with many pages.
However, as it is said, it is better to see it sometimes.
Alliances are passive in Afghanistan, Americans say
Few soldiers and insufficient equipment needed is what is affecting the start of the mission in Afghanistan.
NATO, according to American Defence Minister Robert Gates, should design a concrete plan for the coming years.
The mission in Afghanistan is not as expected, the representatives of countries with troops in the southern part of the country met in Edinburgh, Scotland.
At the same time as the conflict with the Taliban movement grows, today the eight participating States discuss the plans and coordination of allies.
While the United States this week through its defence minister, Robert Gates, encouraged NATO forces to do more, Britain saw as a priority the strengthening of the authority of the Afghan government and the distribution of development assistance.
"Development in Afghanistan is palpable but armed forces can only be one of the solutions.
The following is to enable the population that they alone can start economic and security development," the defence minister, Des Browne, told the BBC station.
Ninety percent
The activity of Afghan rebels according to US military data is higher than in the last five years.
The number of violent actions increased in comparison with last year by 27 per cent, and in the province of Helmand up to 60 per cent.
The NATO countries have approximately 40,000 soldiers in Afghanistan who are in the south of the Territory.
For the United States, however, allies have reached the same limit as the organization and equipment of the units.
They ask more helicopters, soldiers and experts to train Afghan units.
"We will have to think seriously about concrete goals for the future and how we will achieve them," Gates said.
In a similar way today, NATO Secretary-General Jaap de Hope spoke.
"I'm not happy to know what we have on earth and heaven in Afghanistan.
We have a nine hundred soldiers and teams that we would need, and that's a little," De Hoop told Reuters agency at the close of the three-day meeting with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Who's passive
Among the countries that have been involved in the past few months, there has been a policing of whether all allies do the most in Afghanistan.
For example, Germany was criticized for passiveness.
"Germans have a relative number of replacements in Afghanistan.
But they are located in a minimum area of violence and the fighting requirements there are not as high as in our, the south and east part of the country," Gates said.
Sun sensoryist newspaper, this week called German soldiers vagos.
"The Afghan rebels find that the Germans are dedicated to playing while our boys play," Sun wrote in a material accompanied by photos of German soldiers playing at the table tennis.
German Bild responded to the attack and published a photograph where the British army played a rugby game in the southern part of Afghanistan.
State debt will reach billion in 2009
For each check, the State owes 84,000 crowns.
The total debt rose in September to 842,700 million crowns.
This year the government planned to provide 159,200 million crowns.
However, early in December the ministry reduced the plan to 152,800 million crowns by improving the economy of the state budget.
The state debt of the Czech Republic grew at the end of September at 842,700 million crowns.
In nine months this year, it increased to 40,200 million crowns.
Since June, however, 13,400 million crowns have been reduced.
Thus today, the Ministry of Economy confirmed its data on the debt of the state of early October.
For each check, the debt corresponds to 84,000 crowns.
Last year, the State ended up with more than 111 million crowns.
"Now it seems that thanks to the low deficit of the next year, we could cross the border of the billion crowns by 2009.
The next year the debt should be moved between 900,000 million and billion crowns," said iHNed.cz, economist of Patria Finance, David Marek.
Similarly, the economist of Next Finance, Vladimir Pikoro, also says: "We could spend the billion in 2009.
Exactly when that will depend on the next budget we still do not know.
If the situation in the political scene would change and politicians would be able to save, then it could be delayed by 2010.
But such a change I don't see," he added.
The Doubt Grows
The debt of the state creates debt in the central government and, above all, comes from the accumulation of the deficit of the state budget.
The debt of the state is paid through the assets, state obligations, direct loans or, for example, loans from the European Investment Bank.
The state's internal debt increased this year from 38.500 million to 719.400 million crowns.
The external debt has now increased from 1,700 million crowns to 123,300 million crowns.
The call for a commercial debt at the end of September contained 803,300 million crowns z since June was reduced to 13,700 million crowns.
The average government debt gain increased by 6.5 years.
"The total international debt from the first to the third quarter created a 13 per cent which is enormously given as the economy operates.
It is interesting that growth is generated above all of the obligations where there is a 20 per cent increase.
It is bad that debt grows but on the other hand shows that it will be negotiated until there is a pension reform," Pikora commented.
Better than expected
The State debt payment and debt management strategy for 2007 suggests that the government planned this year to provide 159.200 million crowns.
At the beginning of December, the Ministry reduced the plan to 152,800 million crowns by improving the evolution of the state budget.
The amount consists, above all, of the state budget deficit that this year will be 76 million crowns instead of 91,300 million crowns.
The rest consists of maximum resources planned for the Czech Consolidation Agency with some 13,300 million crowns, the reserve of 10 billion crowns for pension payments, 43 billion crowns to finance state obligations and 1,800 million crowns in payments from the European Investment Bank.
I compared today before a court to Jarttum to have given a name to a pelican bear
The British professor who was convicted in Sudan for insult to Islam has been sentenced on Thursday afternoon by a court of Jarttum for 15 days in prison and for expulsion, he indicated his lawyer.
The British was charged with leaving students from 6 to 7 years of age to give the name of Mahomet to a pelican bear when all representation of the Prophet of Islam is illegal.
It was a pity of a lot of tears.
This 54-year-old British school teacher at the University of Jarttum in Sudan has been detained on Sunday in his home and accused of paying attention to Islam and seduction under article 125 of the Sudanese Criminal Code, resulting in several complaints by parents of students before the Sudanese Ministry of Education.
The story goes back to September, when this teacher asks his students, from 6/7 years old, to choose a name for the class pelican bear.
" Eight names come out of the children's mouth, such as Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed " , says the school director Robert Boulos.
Finally, after a class vote, 20 children from each 23 have chosen Mohamed as preferred name.
Mohamed is of course the name of the Muslim prophet, but above all a very common name in Sudan.
Then the children have produced a book for the class with the photo of the mouse with the following legend " My name is Mohamed ".
The ego himself did not bear any label with this name, but the problem is simply the representation of the prophet considered an insult to Islam.
One of Gillian Gibbons' Muslim colleagues, professor at the same school in Sudan, said that he knew it well and that he would never have done anything that could be an insult to a religious faith, "I just feel that he has asked the children to vote for a name, " it's just a " innocent mistake".
A shared opinion by many students of the school teacher who describe it as " very attentive to their students " and " never talking about religion in class " .
We remember that the name Mohamed is also the second most given name in Britain, written in English in 14 different ways.
This name often chosen by the Muslim families is a way to honor the prophet (often given to the first child of a family).
But what are the rules that involve the use of this name?
Can we give it to a player, for example?
It is of course an interpretation issue.
Wednesdays have not reached an agreement on the future status of the province during the last negotiations in Vienna.
Finally, the failure.
Kosovo Serbs and Albanians have ended Wednesday morning in Baden, Austria, a sixth and last session of discussions without being able to overcome their divergences about the future status of the separatist province.
" It is unfortunate that the parties have not been able to reach an agreement on the status," European mediator Wolfgang Ischinger said during a press conference in Vienna.
Emphasizing that peace in the region was " in play " , his American counterpart, Frank Wisner, urged Belgrade and Pristina to respect their efforts to preserve peace and dialogue beyond the end of the negotiations.
" We do not expect violence for now but enter a very difficult period " , he added, pointing out that " there are obvious tensions " .
End of the mediation on 10 December
The media of the troika, which regroups the European Union, the United States and Russia, will be held once a month in Serbia and Kosovo.
The future of the province of 90 per cent of Albanians could become clearer when Ischinger, Wisner and Russian mediator Alexander Botsane-Khartchenko return their relationship to the United Nations Security Council from 10 December to 10 December.
Baden's discussions, near Vienna, constituted the sixth and final session of negotiations since the trial was under way for a new UN mediation last August.
The US and Europeans believe that their mediation will end on 10 December.
The Russians, who have already blocked the granting of independence in Kosovo in the Security Council, insist on pursuing negotiations beyond this date.
" Russia was and is committed to a negotiated solution, a compromise solution," Botsane-Khartchenko said.
A unilateral declaration of independence?
After eight years of administration of the United Nations in Kosovo, the Westerners believe that independence under the supervision of the European Union is the only viable solution.
Pristina is prepared to proclaim it unilaterally if the Security Council does not resolve in its favour.
Belgrade insists on increased autonomy.
" Unfortunately, no agreement has been found " , announced the President of Kosovo's autonomous authority, Fatmir Sejdiu, at the Baden hotel where these "last opportunity negotiations have been held since Monday .
Hashim Thaci, former commander of Kosovo's rebellion and future Prime Minister of the province, has given part of his forces.
But he added that the autonomy plan presented by Belgrade " belonged to a past that has led to homicides and deportations".
"Effect dominated "
Serbian President Boris Tadic has considered that a commitment was always feasible, warning the Albanian majority of Kosovo against the consequences of a unilateral declaration of the province ' s independence.
Belgrade said in particular to fear a " effect dominated " in a region still weakened by the wars of the 1990s.
"To Serbia, he said, this does not mean that a commitment is impossible."
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation had insisted that every decision belongs exclusively to the Security Council, in which its Russian allies had a right of veto.
" The Kosovo Parliament will have the last word "
" Only a solution within the Security Council is acceptable for Serbia " , Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica had declared.
" These negotiations have lasted two years.
They must end as they have begun: in the Security Council."
To journalists, Fatmir Sedjiu had responded that " the Kosovo Parliament will have the last word on the status " , adding that every unilateral declaration of independence on the part of Albanians would be " in concert " with the West.
Bush creates an agreement between Israelis and Palestinians
President George Bush announced, during the opening of the International Peace Conference by himself on Tuesday in Annapolis, Maryland, that Israelis and Palestinians had finally agreed on a common declaration.
It was necessary that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas had agreed to negotiate immediately in order to find a definitive regulation of the old litigation point of 60 years among their two peoples.
In the presence of two men, Bush promised he would do all he could to help them conclude a "peace treaty" before the end of 2008.
Meanwhile, Palestinians must disarm " terrorist infrastructures " and Israel must end its colonization activities, Bush said, recalling both parties ' obligations regarding the roadmap for peace they accepted in 2003.
The head of the White House stressed that the negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority, chaired by Abbas, would " seek to conclude a peace treaty that would resolve all pending issues, without exception, including central issues " .
This name covers the three main threats of the Israeli-Palestinian point: the future borders of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem and the success of the Arab refugees expelled from their homes during the 1948 conflict.
Taking the floor after the American President, Abbas stressed that future negotiations would be "globally and deeply " and refer to all aspects of a regulation, namely " Jerusalem, refugees, borders, colonies, water, security, among other things " .
Turning back to the court, Olmert committed himself to what future negotiations would be "direct and continuous" and to make "an effort to conclude them in the course of 2008.
Bush established the term of office at the end of 2008 as its " vision of two Palestinian and Israeli States " that existed.
Saudi Arabia revealed that it had achieved an effort in this sense by Bush before deciding to participate in the conference.
Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis is a success for Washington, is at the beginning of a plan, sponsored by all Arab countries, which proposes Israel to replace its withdrawal from all Arab territories occupied during the 1967 war, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis marks " a point of confrontation in the history of the Middle East, especially because it attacks the root causes of the conflict and its central aspects " , according to Prince Sauud in his Arab periodic interview with Saudi capitals.
For the prosecutor, the police are not responsible.
What exactly happened last Sunday?
As always in this kind of events, official and Romanian versions are opposed.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the first elements of the investigation of the French National Police Inspectorate (IGPN), a police car circled on Sunday, shortly after the 17th Luisa-Miguel Street, in Villaries-le-Bel.
"He was not in intervention but in patrol, and he was traveling 40-50 km/h, without driving ", explains a police source.
A green motorcycle from the Kawasaki brand, "not approved, or not authorised to travel on the public road " (read below) and driven by two innocent young people, circled " to all gas " .
"He hit the police car on the left side, after a failure of the cedada, the walk to the right," the police said.
The alcohol control practiced on vehicle operators was shown to be negative.
The state of the car (the front-famous front, aggrieved parasitic, set-up parachute) testifies to the violence of the shock.
Very quickly, tomorrow morning, the prosecutor of the Republic of Pontoise, Marie-Thérère of Givry, announced that he had entrusted an investigation for " indiscriminate murder and refusal of aid " to the IGPN, co-convened with the Departmental Directorate of Public Security of Val-d'Oise.
In the afternoon, during a press conference, the prosecutor needs the investigation of the IGPN, at this stage, to discharge the responsibility of the police.
According to the judge, three witnesses to the accident, on Sunday afternoon, confirmed " the police version, knowing that this minimotocycling had reached their left relatively quickly " .
Yesterday, a kind of noise, no doubt caused by the freezing of the scissors on the ground, showed that both vehicles had been trapped in time for the police car to come to an end.
Vehicles have been confiscated and are to be subject to technical inspection.
Both victims' bodies have been autopsied yesterday.
What happened just after that?
Yesterday, a noise circled quickly by Villiers-le-Bel, according to which the police would have gone very quickly from the site, not providing such support to both young people.
The IGPN, being cautious, would also set out " all serious deficiencies " concerning this point.
" It is the most difficult aspect of the investigation, which requires more research, on which it must be very cautious," a police source said.
Liberation found an eye witness to some of these moments that have followed the accident.
One of your windows that exactly gives the scene.
"We then go down, with my first nurse in the hospital, to try to reanimise them, count this witness.
There was nothing to do."
Then he saw a completely disappointed police officer, who was asleep.
Two others tried to re-enact one of the young, the room was talking on the phone."
Faced with the tension that quickly surrounded the scene, and it seems to be certain that the young people were present in the unexpected situation, the police have been taken in a car by colleagues who had arrived at the site.
According to this witness, the relief came " close to twenty minutes after the police left " .
They also practiced heart massages in the bathroom.
" I will not let it be assumed that police services did not provide assistance to young people.
These young people have suffered.
The bombs came back.
Everything has been done to try to save them," the prosecutor insisted on his part.
The tension rises in Pakistan
The Pakistani police repressed the first demonstrations on Monday since the establishment of the state of emergency two days ago by General Musharraf.
In the city of Lahore, east of the country, about 2,000 lawyers who were protesting against the measures taken under the emergency status have been injured by the lacrimogen grenades used by the order forces, according to witnesses.
These last replayed with stones shots, shooting the cops.
At least 350 lawyers have been interviewed.
Similar scenes to Karachi and Rawalpindi, where police loaded and fired lawyers.
Many would have been interrupted.
In Islamabad, the Supreme Court ' s lawyers demanded a general strike and announced demonstrations, resulting in a wave of about 500 arrests during the weekend of opponents, human rights activists and lawyers.
The streets that provided access to the Supreme Court were blocked by the moon in the morning to prevent the grouping.
Other events would have taken place in Multitan (center) and Peshawar (Noreast).
The movement of lawyers collected the support of the regrouped religious parties in the powerful Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal alliance, whose president urged the people to send flowers to the judges who had spoken against the state of emergency and the losses to those who had made an oath in front of Musharraf " .
"The promise of Musharraf is no longer fulfilled"
The Supreme Court of Pakistan refers directly to the measure of the exception proclaimed on Saturday afternoon.
It had to be announced in the coming days on the legality of re-election to the presidential elections on 6 October, to the indirect subsurgency of President Musharraf.
The President of the Court, Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, has been removed and replaced.
" All we have witnessed is illegal, anti-constitutional and contrary to the errors of the Supreme Court, " said the judge in The News.
The promise of Pervez Musharraf to leave the army head and become a " no longer valuable " civilian president after the state of emergency was established, said Monday to the Deputy Minister of Information Tariq Azeem.
It was expected that he would leave his military uniform from here on 15 November, at the end of his first presidential mandate.
The Minister of Information also confirmed that January elections could be transferred.
On the other hand, the Pakistani government has depleted the country's persistent rumors that President Musharraf would have been assigned to reside by his Deputy Chief of Forces.
More than a third of the pregnant women remain unpredictable
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24 %) as well as unplanned or unexpected births.
Today, more than one pregnancy of every three (36%) is not foreseen, reveals a study carried out by the National Institute of Demographic Studies (Ined), four years after the vote of the Neuwirth Act which liberalized the recruitment in France.
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24 %) as well as unplanned or unexpected births.
The different methods of contraception such as pill or steroids still present a 5 % to 6 % failure index, estimates Ined.
The liberalisation of contraception, however, allowed a better " domain of fertility ", according to the Institute which notes that the rate of use of the pill between women from 20 to 44 years has passed from 5 per cent in 1970 to 60 per cent today.
Finally, eight generations of every ten would be well planned today.
Even calculated little more or less per month for a couple of each five and if possible for the spring, judged period as the most pleasant time for having a child.
Spectacular repair on the space station
More than seven hours of work will be required in space for the astronaut Scott Parazynski and his crew members of the International Space Station (ISS) to perform the spectacular repair of an unfurnished and essential solar panel for the continuation of the scientific activities of the station.
A sharp exit that accumulated records due to its duration, its distance from the living modules, of the speed with which it has been imagined, "captured" instruments by the astronomers to make the repairs.
The problem appeared on Tuesday when the astronomers had released from the Discovery launcher the Harmony module, a green cylindrical piece that was soon to reach the European and Japanese scientific laboratories (see box).
This module is a type of land mine for laboratories.
But you have to be able to supply them with electricity.
The second task of the crew was to move an electricity production module with 175 tons of solar panels, already in the ISS, to put it in its final position.
After moving it, the crew started reorganizing the solar panels of the module which have a depth of 76 metres.
And it's where one of the panels, which is expressed as accordions, has been damaged in a little more or less than a meter by a cable that has been hit.
The deployment has been stopped so that the panel will no longer be damaged.
Astronauts, who initially had a control exit from the Discovery Launcher, and then went to repair another solar panel whose rotation system was defective, were forced to dedicate themselves to the damaged panel.
And it's Scott Parazynski who has been chosen to carve at the end of the 30-metre length of the teledirected arm of the launcher added to the station to make repairs.
It's one of the best "spacewalker" of the Nasa.
High, resistant, very capable, has the very developed torso and the long arms.
At 46 years of age, this trained doctor has been charged with "working" the solar panel "hered".
After having specifically inspected the damage, he cut down the fable cable and installed types of "tables" in the damaged area.
He had been helped by the second " spacewalker " who had stayed close to the exception of the air and, inside, by other astronomers like Peggy Whitson, the commander of the crew.
The tool that he used, a hockey minibaton wrapped with an insulator to avoid electrocution in the solar panels that produced several hundred volts, has been designed and "captured" by the astronomers on the side of the station.
Once the operation was completed, Scott Parazynski expected the panel to be fully deployed before making the inventory of its instruments and to return to the inside of the station.
In the morning, the astronomers took advantage of a medium of rest before today, seven astronomers return from the Discovery launch for the return to Earth for the miracle of the miracle.
The title EADS fined in Bolsa
The EADS action is currently under way to the Paris Bols, after the Aeronautics and Defence Group announced that it had to spend between EUR 1,2 and EUR 1.4 billion to deal with the A400M delays.
EADS currently loses 4% to 21.96 euros in Paris.
The group has been obliged to review its forecast of the operational result for 2007 in response to delays generated by slow progress in the development of the A400M engine, which provides for the inaugural flight of the aircraft.
The cost of the delay in the delivery of the military transport aircraft, announced in October, amounts to between EUR 1,2 and EUR 1.4 billion, of which more than 1 billion for Airbus, announced the home of the European builder EADS.
In view of these burdens, EADS will be forced to announce new objectives of the 2007 performance (EBIT) during the submission of its quarterly results on the next Thursday, adding no more encrypted precision.
The group also indicates that the estimate of new charges is consistent with the delay of six months.
It should be recalled that the operational result of EADS was 86 per cent in 2006, mainly due to delays in another programme, the very large carrier A380.
Initially, the group provided for a first delivery of A400M to the French army in October 2009.
The selection of the quo 's state
No wonder on Sunday, at the end of the hours: the Russians are going to make a massive choice for the party of President Putin, united Russia.
Confirming its ambition for stability, including authoritarianism, after a very limited campaign.
Within three days of the legislative elections, Russian President Vladimir Putin today gives the voters a television message on public chains, already registered but its content is kept secret.
It does so as the leader of the list for Russia, the pro-Kremlin party whose victory is aflame.
Yesterday, the president left nothing to be transpired by receiving foreign embassies, happy to deliver a new burden on the accused West of inference - his prelude theme during the campaign.
"We know the price of true democracy and want honest, more transparent and open elections, free elections," he added.
According to the opposition, we are far away from the truth.
Advertise a printed campaign.
Communist leader Guennadi Ziouganov says there is no " never had so many Swiss elections, until the time of Elshin " .
Following the repression of the last weekend's demonstrations, the former world champion Gary Kasparov, sentenced to five days in prison for illegal demonstrations, are prohibited from visits according to his lawyer.
"The Russians kept the mind of the Soviets"
Following these undisputed legislative elections, two more open questions are being raised:
Who will happen to Putin at the presidency?
The Official Journal published yesterday the date of the first re-election of the presidential election on 2 March 2008; the candidates will have until 23 December to make their appointment.
Selected in 2000 and re-elected in 2004, Vladimir Putin cannot request the third consecutive mandate.
Then there's no chance.
What role will Putin play after March?
Prime Minister?
The Head of the majority of Parliament and the very powerful Russian party that would choose the government and the president?
In any case, in the legislative elections as well as in the presidential elections, the outgoing power will triumph.
It's a tradition.
"The Russians kept the mind of the Soviets, they do not feel the owners of their destiny," said sociologist Lev Goudkov, director of the independent Levada centre.
Historian Nikolai Kopossov, of the State University of St. Petersburg, is moving farther away: civil society has retreated into this Christianized country five centuries after Europe; the famous spirit of the community has delayed the formation of individualism.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s, "Potine restored the model of a patriarchal state, perfectly accepted by the population, since this new patriarchalism has not been followed by terrorism, but by a certain economic disadvantage ", estimates Maria Lipman of the Carnegie Foundation.
Today the Russians " reject their personal responsibility " by their own will " of those who have recently tested after the establishment of the USSR.
"For what to reflect?"
The phenomenon affects all social spheres, including the world of affairs.
And the administrative elite intends to maintain the status quo: 65 governors (of each 85 heads of Russian regions) conduct the local lists of Russia.
New import freedoms in the West are often synonyms of chaos, as in the 1990s.
The opinion prefers stability.
On behalf of the Russians will not vote by extremists either.
Conclusion of Tamara Tcherednitchenko, 54-year-old teacher: " Why reflect?
What are they in power is not too bad, why change them?"
A Hard Memory
After more than 60 years of confidentiality, Bad Arolsen's Nazi files, which describe the destinations of 17.5 million victims of the Hitleric regime, are free of access.
The 47 million files of archives, stored over 27 km of buildings in Bad Arolsen (Hesse), were not even here available for a "humanity" purpose only, i.e. individually and nominally, at the request of an ancient victim or of his rightholders.
The eleven States responsible for their management - such as Germany, France, Israel and the United States - agreed in May 2006 to open them to researchers and historians.
Since the ratification process of this agreement has been concluded by all States, opening has been effective since yesterday.
Cannot initialise Evolution's mail component.
Access by historians to Bad Arolsen will allow for research " in particular on the displacement of prisoners, the population of the camps and the health status of forced workers " , Reto Meistern, director of these files administered by the International Commission of the Red Cross (CICR).
To date, several States, such as Germany, have been opposed to the public's opening of these nominal documents, due to the sensitive nature of certain information.
Just as the supposed homosexuality or the mental handicap of certain victims of deportation.
The records of the concentration camps or detention orders established by the Gestapo had been gathered after the war in a practical manner: to find the deported or underprivileged countries and, if possible, to give them proof of their internship, in order to open the way to their compensation.
Today in Bad Arolsen, more than 300 permanent employees are dealing with tens of thousands of individual requests.
However, for a part of the scientific community, access to Bad Arolsen has a limited interest.
" There is nothing fundamentally new to be expected of these documents," said Professor Wolfgang Benz, director of the Research Centre for Anti-Semitism at the Technische University of Berlin in 2006.
The European Union and India want to reach a free change agreement in 2008
At present, indo-European bilateral trade has reached around EUR 60 billion per year.
The European Union is India's first trade partner and represents 18% of its external trade.
The European Union and India hope to sign a free change agreement in 2008, the European Commissioner for Trade Peter Mandelson and his Indian Homologist, Kamal Nath.
The Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the European Union had given their approval in April to the European Commission to start negotiations with India, South Korea and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asian). Indo-European bilateral trade has already reached around EUR 60 billion per year.
The European Union is India's first trade partner and represents 18% of its external trade.
The EU is also its first foreign investor, but India is only the 9th trade partner of the European Union, according to the figures of the European Commission.
" A free exchange agreement will greatly double both economies " and " India would improve its entry into a market of 450 million prosperous Europeans," Peter Mandelson explained.
Europe represents the first or second market for each of the ten first products exported by India, the European Commissioner said. Asian and European giants change annually by " 47 billion euros of goods " and by " ten billion euros of services", Daniel Smadja, head of the European Commission delegation in New Delhi, felt that bilateral trade "has not yet achieved its potential". The European Union and India will meet Friday for their eighth diplomatic summit in New Delhi in the presence of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and the President of the European Commission José Manuel Durao Barroso.

The Bank of England takes note of concerns by offering 10 billion pounds in five weeks
The Bank of England was concerned about the current return of credit concerns, and announced a 10 billion-dollar bid on the basic index of 5.75% in five weeks, an offer of an unusual duration.
" To alleviate the concerns under which the financial market conditions will be particularly affected for the year, and to give the banks greater certainty in the way they will organise their liquidity positions over this period, the Bank intends to offer an important proportion of its provision of reserves for the maintenance period beginning on 6 December in the form of an open market operation for five weeks " , notes a communication.
The bank needs 10 billion euros (14 billion euros) to be placed on the market on 6 December at 12 a.m. 15 GMT, the basic index and until 10 January.
This is the first time it seems that the BoE English bank puts liquids in the market for five weeks in an open market operation.
These usually take place in a week.
The BoE adds in its communication that " is prepared to take other measures to keep the indexes " from interbank loans online with its basic index.
The interbank rate per day was 5,829 per cent.
The index after three months was established at 6.6 %, higher than since 18 September.
Since the beginning of the financial crisis in the summer, the amounts placed on the market by the Bank of England have been combined with an important index of penalties which had caused banks to resort to this.
According to some rumors, strengthened by the evolution of the euro-related free exchange, many had preferred to subscribe to the amounts brought on the market by the European Central Bank, to the most profitable indexes and with a more secure discretion.
The UMP and NC parties reject the review of the PS party's proposals on the acquisition power
The UMP and Nouveau Centre refused Thursday to discuss articles of the socialist law proposal on the acquisition power, which was equivalent to a disassessment of the text.
In a socialist "nice" (session for the initiative of a parliamentary group), the text referred to a decade of measures taken on Tuesday by the PS national office, including an increase of 50 per cent of the surplus for employment, the restoration of the TIPP (internal rate for oil products), a check-over or the restrictions on rentals.
Since UMP and NC have voted against the review of articles (180 votes against 115), the session has been raised at the end of the general debate that led to exchanges, sometimes live, between majority and opposition to certain hours of Nicolas Sarkozy's television intervention on the acquisition power.
The representative of PS Jean Marc Ayraul announced that his group would represent the integrity of its proposals in the form of amendments to the draft legislative financing bill considered by the Assembly next week.
A New Festival of Light
As a result of numerous rumors about the creation by C3 Presents of a new music festival in Philadelphia, the promoter / producer announces the Vineland Music Festival in New Jersey, in collaboration with the British producer Melvin Benn's Republic Festival.
"For our company, it is an honor to work with a person who inspired, not least, the current movement of the festivals in America," Charlie Jones of C3 entrusted Billboard.com.
C3 produces the Chicago Lollapalooza Festival and the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland, New Jersey, is a summer destination for the campsite.
The festival would take place from 8 to 10 August in a private farm of 500 acres around 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
Another time known as Mean Fiddler, director of the Republic Festival, Melvin Benn, is one of the most respected festival producers in the world.
In 1989 he took the lead in the Reading Festival in the United Kingdom, which annually attracts some 80,000 people.
In 1999, Melvin Benn added Leeds Festival to his portfolio and then in 2006, the Republic Festival created the Henham Park Festival Latitude in Suffolk.
Since 2002, as co-owner, Melvin Benn has also been responsible for the production, licensing and organizational tasks of the Glastonbury Festival, which can now accommodate up to 177,500 people.
Qualifying Glastonbury 's " most inspiring event " to which Charlie Jones of C3 has never attended, says his company and Melvin Benn work in parallel to give the region a European-style event.
"We have chosen Philadelphia as a market and worked with the Fairmount Parks Commission to create a festival in the center of the city of Philadelphia," says Charlie Jones.
" We were in negotiations with the city and the Commission was motivated and excited by this project.
Unfortunately, we are in low-class policies because of the current administration, pursues Charlie Jones.
" Luckily, we could discuss with Melvin Benn and prepare to create a magnificent festival on an exceptional site that finally took place in Philadelphia."
C3 Presents resurrected the Lollapalooza Festival in 2005 in the Grand Park of Chicago, after being off-limited in the 2002 Festivals landscape with the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Both events recorded gross income of $9.8M and $11.3M in 2007.
These festivals have a place in the urban environment.
"Melvin Benn's European model is a camp festival, while ours are doing better in urban green areas," says Charlie Jones.
The objective is to merge, in one way or another, both formulas to give once and for all an impression of a camp festival in the European and urban way in the American way."
Vineland is more or less on the road between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
"Vineland community, including the mayor, actively supports the celebration of this event," says Charlie Jones.
The latter is denied to reveal the terms of the agreement, but says "that they are quite interesting to allow you to invest in such a event and to attend a festival that, we hope, will have a long life."
Charlie Jones says that the hotel offer at this festival is "very big", for example about 80,000 people from Bonnaro Music Festival in Tennessee.
He says that invitations have been sent to the groups, but that nothing could still be confirmed at the time of going under pressure.
"Vineland will have the pleasure of rock, but music will be varied there, with the hope of attracting all sorts of spectators," says Charlie Jones.
His C3 partners, who received the award Top Independent Promoter from the last Billboard Touring Awards, are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.:
Montreal is in front of the Terminator
It's not easy to attract Hollywood films to Montreal when nothing more than Terminator is against that...
This seduction mission is part of the duties of the delegate.
A mandate - "politically difficult" because the governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, complains about "runaway productions " .
Is it hard to compete with the Governor?
"It has to be prudent, it's the industry that decides where it goes.
If you find that the conditions in Montreal are favorable, you'll go there.
Our role is to offer those who will judge the best," he says.
The Race to the Festivals
At the moment, Denis Turcotte's priority is despite the promotion of the film from here.
The race to the Oskares is started.
All the festivals of the West Coast, whether Sundance, Denver, Seattle or San Francisco, will have to present the Czech films, give them value and ensure that the performers conduct interviews.
The New Year had a good picture at 30th Mill Valley Film Festival, a few weeks ago.
It will be presented to Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake Hands with the Devil is on the map to Santa Monica and will be presented at 30° Starz Denver Film Festival, in November.
Quebec also presented four long meters and four short meters to the American Film Institute Festival this month.
Are there rally at the end of the year in the bag? Experts, divided by the crisis 'substantiation'.
In less than five weeks to defer the end of the exercise, investors are already shaking their hands, waiting for the traditional rally to arrive at the end of the year.
This year, however, experts are not so clear that this is going to be produced.
Banif believes that "from a statistical point of view, the month of December in baseball usually has a positive attitude.
However, projections should not be made solely on the basis of statistics, especially because in the current context, uncertainty prevails in the markets, at least in the short term."
Although they are not party to the fact that the bus carries careers in the last weeks of the year, these experts point out that "the Brussels market is sustained by the existence of liquidity, willing to invest given the lack of alternatives with guarantees, especially the fixed rate, affected by the bad effect on quality values both in the long lines and in the shorts".
Therefore, they believe that the bass will have a better lateral behaviour, not an exception to flying "over everything because it is not known the impact of the likely decline of the Fed types, given the high level of cruelty and the risk of stimulating inflationist tensions".
Javier Barrio, responsible for BPI sales in Spain, agrees that it is not a good time to venture to say there's going to be rally.
"It's not the thing for many joys," says the expert.
Ibex has lost about 4 per cent of the maximum marked on 8 November when the index closed at 15.945.7 points.
Still not all experts have this very negative vision.
Juan Solana, analyst of Intermoney, believes that Ibex 35 could close the year closer to the 16,000 points due to the restructuring of the cards and the traditional contributions to pension plans that are produced every year at these dates.
However, the expert argues that things will be something different this year because he believes that the rally will proceed to the second week of December, after the constitutional bridge.
The analyst does not think that flight will affect market trends.
On the other hand, Federico Olucha, an analyst at Inversis Banco, appreciates that we are close to technical levels and that "that is why we could see a review of the index that could be driven by the news coming from the US on the consequences of the crisis on the credit market".
The analyst trusts them to be positive.
Analysts agree on the time to choose the values that will be charged to lead Ibex to new maximum rates.
Solana, from Intermoney, says that "this year it touches the great values."
The expert would include in the paper the two large banks and some builders "because when the date comes, the electricity sector will be very expensive".
Meanwhile, Federico Olucha, of Inversis Banco, ensures that the subsidies will come from the bank's hand and from the industrial sector.
Constructors can also benefit from this rally, if given.
"ACS takes several months to recover positions and we hope other builders like Ferrovial and FCC follow their own path," explains the expert.
cyclic consumption will be protagonist in the last part of the year due to the increase in sales during the shipping period.
On the other hand, the expert believes that technology will also do much good, although in this case there is not much representation in the Spanish market.
Five times seven years
In the last seven years, only two occasions in December has been a month lower.
The real Rally of the end of the year lived in 2003, an exercise in which bourgeoisie markets emerged from the crisis caused by the painting of the technological bubble.
This year, in which Ibex 35 recovered a 28.17 per cent, December recorded a 6.68 per cent response.
You will need to see if 2007 is the fifth consecutive year of profits (Ibex has now risen to 8.36% since January) and if you can count with your final year rally.
Popular will open 200 offices 12 hours a week
Popular has decided to renovate a large part of its offices.
In total, 200 are located in the most commercial areas of Spain.
These subsidiaries, which will operate under the Max Popular brand, represent a big change for the bank.
It is also for the rest of the Spanish entities, as it is the first group to be decided to give the jump to the uninterrupted opening of their agencies until 20.30 p.m. and to open the Saturdays from 10 a.m. to 20.30 p.m.
Another group that has also repeated on several occasions that wanted to extend the time of its subsidiary, BBVA, has not yet decided to take the step.
Meanwhile, it is about to close an agreement with the trade unions to close 75 per cent of their offices on Saturdays instead of opening one afternoon, although not to the public.
The results of Popular experience will be decisive for other entities to point out whether or not to this initiative according to trade time.
This is precisely the objective that is pursued by Popular with the project.
Catch the particular customers who move through these areas to carry out their purchases, to the pymes, autonomouss and trades of the chosen streets to open.
The bank wants to have these 200 open offices throughout Spain in about 18 months, as they are not new openings but remodeling existing ones.
To that end, the entity will modernise the resources already in commercial areas, adapting them to the profile that customers from different roads present.
In this way, the expansion of the clocks is accompanied by a different design from the branch space and a new design, more modern, with more bright colors.
The commercial bank manager, Ángel Rivera, ensures that this restructuring does not entail a large investment, even if it is a higher staff contract, since there are about six local employees from eight to nine.
Offices, which will even count with spaces so that the pymes can meet there, will sell non-financial products.
A positive experience for the group
Popular has already tested its initiative in three Madrid offices.
And experience has been positive, according to Ángel Rivero.
The surrogates of the streets Bravo Murillo, O'Donnell and Grand Vija de Madrid have been elected, and it seems to be with steel, according to Rivero.
Popular accounts are currently available with 2,500 resources.
And 60 others operating under the WorldCredit brand, specialized in immigrants, also with very wide hours, even opening Sundays and festivals.
In these sites of PopularMax, the BBVA model will not be repeated, where several of its offices have a large bank of non-financial products for sale.
'We don't want to compete with our customers,' says Rivero.
From now on, they have reached an agreement with Telephonic to sell mobiles, with external staff at the bank.
Double telephony for the first time the value in Bolsa from its River Antena 3
We got it.
With that phrase, he expressed his satisfaction yesterday with the satisfaction of Paolo Vasile, a delegate from Telecinco, at the end of the market, when he found that the chain leading doubled the value of his rival, Antena 3.
Only one aspect pushed his joy: 'and what hurts me, it's not because we've grown more but because we've fallen less', he said.
Still, he stressed that in a weak market, 'we have fallen less'.
Telequinco concluded yesterday with a 254% increase.
That gain is the loss of what we've been doing since the year 15.66%.
The value in Bolsa of the company controlled by Mediaset (with 52% of the capital) and participated by Vocento (other 13%) thus reaches EUR 4,488.88 million, according to Bloomberg's data.
Its Antena 3, which yesterday issued a 1 52% drop of 40.5% since January, costs half, 2,193,46 million.
The value of the other daily communications companies is 3,571 million in the case of Sogecapable; 2,518.53 million Prisa (Finco Days' Editor) and 1.779 million Vocento.
According to Vasile, comparison with Antena 3 must be that we're talking about two similar companies.
The fact is how much we are able to do, in the same market, at what cost and how we make it possible in terms of hearing.
Telecinco announced last week that it was planned to become the first television channel this year in excess of 1,000 million gross advertising revenue, according to the assurance made by Giuseppe Tringali, the member of Telecinco and Publiespa, the branch that manages the group's advertising.
In order to make this announced date real, the television chain would record an increase of 3.6 per cent in its advertising bill of 965.4 million in 2006.
On the other hand, the net invoice of Antena 3 increased by 1.6 per cent in the nine first months of the period (up to 734.4 million) while net television revenue increased by 0.7 per cent (630.4 million).
One of the factors that analysts point to for the best relative evolution in Bolsa de Telecinco is the high payout that has maintained so far: in 2006, the company chaired by Alejandro Echevarría distributed 100% of the benefit among its shareholders.
Vasile ensures that, although it is ready to make the decision, this ratio may vary after buying 33% of Endemol in association with its Mediaset matrix.
'We have the official commitment to give at least 50%, although we have always declared much more.
This year, I hope that we will be able to leave our shareholders happy, whom we have already given with 33% of Endemol'.
According to analysts, the market provides samples at these moments of certain chance.
Lehman Brothers recently reduced their profit estimates on Telecinco in 2008 by 4 per cent and by 2009, by 7 per cent.
It should be explained that the projected increase in income from 10.5 per cent to 8.4 per cent in 2008 and from 5.5 per cent to 5.1 per cent in 2009.
This same signature has reduced the expected gain of Antenna 3 by 4.5 per cent in 2008 and 7.5 per cent in 2009.

In parallel with its parliamentary treaty, which concluded today with the vote by the Congress on the amendments incorporated into the draft Senate, the Government has issued a public hearing on the regulation that will develop the new law, with the aim that both will enter into force before the end of the year.
The representatives of the different groups agreed to highlight the efforts made by Members and senators to negotiate and agree on the best regulation in order to ensure investor protection and to regulate the activities of entities for the effective functioning of markets.
The Mifid, which amends the Securities Market Act, aims to modernise financial markets, while strengthening investor protection, improves the supervisory powers of the National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) and promotes cooperation between the various supervisors of the European Union.
The new regulation will allow financial advisory services to be provided both to specialized firms and to natural or legal persons and create a new type of financial service firms (ESIS), financial advisory companies (AFIs), which join value companies, value agencies and card management companies.
In addition, the number of systems for the execution of financial instruments is increasing, so that regulated secondary markets are included in multilateral trading systems and internalisation systems, which will compete with the current exchange managers.
The Act also requires investment services companies to disseminate on the market information on the key aspects of their business profile, exposure to risk and risk management and requires them to carry out a register of all operations they perform to facilitate the supervision of CMMV.
A number of amendments were incorporated in their progress by the Congress's Economic Commission, including the fact that the debt held is considered to be a "complement" financial instrument given its high risk to the investor, which has been demonstrated by the event with the debt of high-risk mortgages in the United States (subpression).
In addition, the transposition of the directive to legally delimit the functions that diplomats can develop in Economics and Business 30 years after the adoption of the actual decree limiting the professional functions reserved to economists in 1977.
The Senate, on its part, incorporated the creation of new figures in the financial sector, such as the intermediary, who will work on the basis of this, will not require the authorisation of CNMV and may provide its product marketing and customer capture services to different investment firms at the same time.
The harmonised IPC increases five decades in November, up to 4.1 per cent
This indicator, which then serves Eurostat to incorporate it into the calculation of the inflation rate in the European Union, provides a progress in how prices in Spain evolved during the month of November.
Its publication responds to the policy of Eurostat and the European Central Bank (ECB) to provide timely and quality data to producers in the United States.
The advanced indicator is calculated using the same procedure as the user for the Harmonised Price Index, but using various statistical modelling methods to estimate the information that is not available at the time of their publication.
INE recalled that the information provided by the advanced indicator is only indicative, so it should not necessarily match the final date, which will be known on 14 December.
"IPC will continue at relatively high levels"
The Second Vice-President and Economy Minister Pedro Solbes stated that the rise in a 4.1 per cent of the IPC in November is a "temporal figure", but at the same time he pointed out that the price index will continue at "relevantly high" levels in the coming months.
In any case, Solbes has pointed out in the Congress's passports that "although the figure is not good" the difference in Spain's inflation over the monetary union continues to be "more or less" the same in recent years.
It has also explained that in November "there has been less surprise" than in the previous month, when the Government did not count on such a high rise.
"We expected a figure around 4%," the Minister of Economy acknowledged regarding the earlier date today.
Virgin plan to recycle with Northern Rock 42,000 million euros in three years
The Northern Rock deposits have fallen more than 50% to 12 000 million pounds (16,800 million euros) since they entered the crisis in mid-September and had to resort to an emergency loan from the Bank of England.
At that time, there were record deposits of more than 25,000 million pounds, a figure that had fallen progressively in two and a half months because of the mistrust of its clients and despite the guarantee of a hundred per cent of that money offered by the Government and which would remain until the end of the crisis.
Virginia, which would re-number the entity with its financial brand Virgin Money, needs to take around a quarter of the revenue in British banks that are deposited in the next three years to achieve those remaining 18 000 million pounds until the goal of 30,000 million is achieved.
The Group of Magnate Richard Branson, known for its so-called advertising campaigns in the United Kingdom, aims to spend 50 million pounds (about EUR 70 million) per year in advertising and marketing to achieve its goal.
Northern Rock announced this week the offer of the Virginia Consortium, in which three other companies participate, as their preferred to rescue him from the bank.
Held the mayor of Totana for alleged trauma of urban corruption
The Civil Guard has detained today at the first hour of the morning at the current mayor of the mural municipality of Totana (the People's Party) for its alleged relationship with the trauma of urban corruption this week.
In addition, one of the secretary-generals of the building and the chief police officer of the municipality have also been arrested.
José Martínez Andreo replaced last May with Juan Morales, now popular, and until then the mayor of the municipality, and that according to sources of research consulted by the Cadena SER, could be the 'head' of this line.
Officers continue to register municipal and Urbanism Council units and are no longer released in the coming hours.
In addition, the letter of Juan Morales, the main suspect of the trauma of urban corruption, has been introduced at the beginning of this week.
As reported yesterday by the Cadena SER, to the lawyer of the "popular" Member Juan Morales, he was therefore arrested by leaving the house of Morales with important documentation related to the trauma.
Furthermore, the subject of the investigation, according to research sources, is the alleged cover of Morales commissions instead of facilitating the signing of a urban convention with a Galilean construction company to recalibrate 200 hectares of land.
At the moment, there are eight people arrested.
It is good to accept the application of the PSOE by Toledo and to preside over the Congress if they win the
The former Minister of Defence José Bono has accepted the offer of the President of the Government and the Secretary-General of Socialists, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, to complete the list of PSOE by Toledo for the next general elections and to be president of the Congress if the Socialists win the general elections.
This was announced by the Secretary of the Organization of the PSOE, José Blanco, and his own Bono, after the meeting that he held this afternoon at the federal headquarters of this party with Zapatero.
The Chief of Executives has justified the offer to the former minister because "it's important to count with the best" in political life and Good is "one of the best".
In addition, he pointed out that "so it seems" that the minority political will be the candidate of the Socialist Group to preside over the Congress if the Socialists win in the next elections.
It would be good to replace the President of the Congress with Manuel Marín, who published his decision on 15 November not to submit to the next general elections and to abandon his career in active policy to fight climate change in the university area.
The former Minister has recognized that the President of the Government has not given up on his efforts to return to political prosperity since he left the country two years ago.
In addition, it noted that, as citizens know who will be the Vice-President of the economy if the PSOE wins the elections, its party has wanted to announce who will preside over the Congress in a "transparency act".
If he reaches his job, he is looking forward to turning the camera into "the house of respect and not the insult or cry" and making "it seems more and more to the citizens."
"Sometimes it seems sadly that Madrid's only place where we can't talk peacefully and quietly is Congress, at some point the President of the Government has interrupted him at the Senate 26 times."
Also, he has had words of praise for his current president, Manuel Marín and his "good to do" and has not wanted to see himself taking over his position so as not to fall into what, as noted, his opponents could see as "prepotence".
Climate propaganda
Since the movement against climate change is immeasurably persecuted by both the scepticals of its predictions and those who prioritise other political and social battles, it is required to show coherence of iron.
And another leader of the movement who is the president of the Government as Zapatero and believes that this struggle is more important than Islamic terrorism and is even proposed to sign a "new contract with the planet".
This planting requires you to explain why the action, or inaction, of your Government has made a decisive contribution to Spain's failure to implement Kyoto.
Who are responsible for non-compliance, in which sectors have been produced and why his Government, the contract with the planet, has not prevented it.
In addition, it requires him to explain to the Spanish what measures he will take to curb climate change.
What companies will be affected, what citizen habits should be changed, what individual and collective energy savings we will be forced to do, what economic consequences it will have.
Who will sacrifice and who will pay to save the planet.
But there has not been nor will there be such explanations.
Exactly because it's about sacrificing and paying.
The measures against climate change, the real measures, are imputable.
Costs, disadvantages and threats to business and individuals accounts.
Even the centenium of the fuel suggested by the PSOE has seemed so dangerously dangerous to Zapatero that it has been rushed to deny it.
That is, it's about saving the planet with nothing, with pure propaganda, with empty slogans of any real consequence.
With impressive phrases, commissions, committees, protocols, new tasks.
With contracts with the planet, that lord is so useful for electoral campaigns that neither speaks nor complains nor demands, but he loves myth and terrorism.
Whenever it is limited to being a virtual contracting party and does not assume that we move in a bicycle or refresh us with the bannic.
Arrested by the mayor and chief of the local police of Totana by a suspected urban corruption plot
The Civil Guard has detained the mayor of the murchin location of Totana, the "popular" José Martínez Andreo, the head of the local police, the Secretary of the Association and a host company for potential urban crimes, have reported sources of research today.
He was arrested in his home and was transferred to the Constorio, whose units are now located with numerous agents, who have also attended the Urbanism Council and the municipal management company of the Industrial and Housing Field.
These three detentions took place six months ago in Galicia, Murcia and Madrid, in an operation related to the recalculation of more than 2 million hectares of Russian land in urbanized areas so that the Gallagian company Nuaria would build 4,000 homes after payment of illegal commissions during the past legislative period.
In addition, two other persons were not detained but are involved in the summary, which teaches Judge No. 1 of Totana.
The first six detainees have passed the court order today.
According to the sources, the former director of Totana and today's autonomous parliamentarian of the PP, Juan Morales, is being investigated.
In addition, the ex-wife, owner of a real estate agency registered today in Totana, has become imputable, just as the current news from the former director, who lives in Murcia capital.
The director and owner of the Nuaria Group, the lawyer and entrepreneur, Manuel N.A., was detained in Nigrán (Pontevedra), as Pablo José M.G., director of Soelo de Inmonour, an agency integrated into the aforementioned group, and through which the subsoils would have been carried out.
The investigation is carried out by the Urban Crimes Group of the Central Operational Unit (UCO) of the Civil Guard, whose agents, in addition to the detentions, practiced eleven records, most of the companies related to detainees and located in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (Madrid) and Totana.
Only one person was then arrested in Totana, in particular the owner of a company of highly known aircraft products in the region, which could have acted as an intermediary.
The Nuaria Group was responsible for developing what would be the largest residential complex in the city of Totana, which would support the construction of more than 5,000 dwellings, a golf course and two hotels with "spa".
The company acquired in Totana 2.2 million square metres of land that had been recalibrated and its project would double the population of the municipality, which has 25,000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria Group integrates companies such as Autesa and Inomonauur, dedicated to real estate promotion; Conycase, which manages live parkings from Coruña, Venezuela and Fernando el Catholic Square; Hogartel, dedicated to the direct marketing sector; Precomoni, focused on the promotion, sale and installation of construction elements.

If they appear, let's leave the Book of Mes, see if another ‘premiology’ and other competencies occur.
I'm looking for something.
Life is a change, people.
Of course, you are invited to propose inventions.

Our Finnish correspondent facilitates this yesterday's comment in the most important newspaper of Finland (in particular the PISA report on educational level in the world), the Helsinki Sanomat, which refers to what they published on November 18, the same day that clearly appeared in the Blackburn book:
"The content of the philosophy signature has jumped to the public opinion as a result of the tragedy of Jokela's school.
The guilty of the deaths, a student of the bastard, quoted in his messages the works of Plato and Nietzsche.
The Teaching Council responsible for the assignment of Philosophy, Pekka Elo, requested from the pages of the Helsinki Sanomat newspaper that teachers adopt a critical attitude towards Plato and stated that studying Nietzsche is not essential in the compulsory basic course of Philosophy in the institutes."
We've got three of them.
A colleague provides information on the introduction of the Criminal Code on Internet Downloads:
A. The removal of a song would be a crime of six months a year.
On the other hand, if you steal discs at a value of less than EUR 400, you are considered to be simply missing (Article 623.1).
B. If you steal from the store up to EUR 1,000, the thief is already guilty, but the penalty is still below the duty to download (Article 234 of the Penal Code).
C. If you steal a car and return it 40 hours later, the penalty remains lower than the download (art. 244.1).
D. It is less serious to participate in a fight to participate in the exchange of compacts.
Participating in a tumulous kidney has a three-month penalty per year (Article 154 of the Penal Code) and exchange would have a penalty of six months to two years.
(Article 270 of the Penal Code).
E. Sexual harassment at work is considered less serious than downloading a film on DVD, according to article 184.2 of the Criminal Code.
F. The distribution of films protected by copyright and without author permission is more punished than the distribution of pornographic material to minors (art. 186).
Finally, if my colleague's on the right, someone's going to get his hand, a very long hand.

My head doctor extends to me one of his articles on rare research entitled 'Money produces brain activity, especially if others receive less'.
In other words, the feelings generated by the monthly wage of workers depend on what the partners earn.
The study has been conducted through magnetic resonances at Bonn University, and the results are published in the latest issue of Science.
According to Bernd Weber, author of the study and director of the Life&Brain Image Group, in Germany: "The strongest activity was performed when the participant responded correctly and his companion failed".
Investigators observed that if both were satisfied with the same payment, the activation was moderate, but if one received the double, the activation was greater.
I don't know if I'd need so much science this conclusion.
The Fiscal of the Balkans
Carla del Ponte spent eight years in an unsolicited pursuit of the Balkan war criminals from the Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, located in La Haya.
Its mandate ends at the end of the year and Carla will go with an agridulous taste, because the main officials of Srebrenica's death - in which 8,000 Muslims died - the former general Ratko Mladic and former Serbian leader Radovan Karadzic continue to be released.
His names are on this list that takes his title from the Swiss author Marcel Schüpbach, 'The Carla List' (2006, no stranger in Spain) who, with the rhythm of a police triller, follows the work of the Swiss prosecutor in Belgrade in New York to pursue the crimes of the Jews and pressure the governments involved to close the circle.
What's sure about me?
Car insurance, which covers the driver in front of possible rails, implies an important cost that will depend on various factors, such as age, sex, the ancientness of the meat, the civil status, the type of vehicle to be ensured or used, among others.
Having the car is just the beginning.
And it's that, choosing the appropriate car insurance is even more difficult than choosing the vehicle model.
First of all, we need to be clear of what we're talking about.
Car insurance is an agreement between a insurance company and the insurance company.
This commitment is materialised in a insurance contract, which provides that the company receives the value of the first agreement instead of being liable for the obligation to pay compensation in the event of a fine.
The first is the price of insurance, which is established taking into account various factors, such as age, sex, the ancientness of the meat, the civil status, the type of vehicle to be ensured or the use it gives, among others.
Insurance companies set their prices on the basis of statistics so that more likely to suffer an accident, more cost to subscribe.
That is why both adults and women are required to pay lower premiums, since statistics show that they have a lower rate of synergy due to their caution.
Also, by exaggerating the accounts, companies have come to the conclusion that married persons tend to have fewer accidents than single drivers.
The use taken from the vehicle will influence the frequency, and thus the probability of having any type of percussion.
As the frequency increases, the probability increases.
There are many variables that insurance policymakers take into account when establishing the price of the premium.
That is why the driver must carefully examine the situation in order to choose that car insurance that best fit his profile.
We will present here the most significant variables at the time of choosing one or more types of insurance, so that this, in addition to adapting to the features of the insurance, offers a reasonable price.
Young people under the age of 25 are faced with various inconveniences when purchasing insurance at a affordable price, such as reduced experience in driving and earlyness of the meat.
Although the ideal for being well-secured is a risk insurance, there are other more economic options.
The earliest drivers can choose for a full risk with franchise, so that they can obtain the cover of a security at all risk but at a more affordable price.
This type of agreement would suggest that the customer pays part of the amount of the fine.
"The share of the amount of the synergy that the customer will contribute will be established according to the value of the premium, which will be higher than the amount below the amount," says Luis Noguera, the highest official in Spain of First Europe, online insurance intermediary.
Another option is a security for extended third parties, so that the customer ensures protection against damage caused to third parties, although not before the cause of the damages in his own car.
In addition, it would be covered by theft, fire and the loss of the vehicle.
A advice.
If you are less than 25 years old, try to be careful and avoid the sinisters as far as possible, as this will affect the bonus, which may reduce the cost of insurance in the future.
A bonus is a reduction on the base price of the company.
On the contrary, a penalty is a charge on that base fee.
"Vonifications and penalties shall depend on the company and its benefit.
If the company has had a good year, it can be allowed to increase the bonus," Noguera explains.
After the fall of 25 years, drivers are more easily able to buy a security, as the synergy index is reduced thanks to the accumulated experience.
For this reason, the most recommended is to buy a full risk with franchise.
"Of course, young people cannot make use of the experience previously acquired at the time of an accident, and even at the time of conduct," says the director of the European company in Spain, adding that most of the accidents occur in the second year of driving, once again 'the middle of the novel'.
However, if the client is married but still has no children, it is preferable to negotiate insurance at all risk, always and when his economic situation allows, of course it is.
On the other hand, marriages with children are considered by insurance policymakers as the public with a lower rate of synergy, so the recharges will be lower.
In this case, the best insurance would be one at all risk with franchise (may be EUR 300), or, when it is available at a high level of bonus, one to thirds expanded from the third year of life of the vehicle.
"They carry out a more relaxed conduct and have a greater acquireive power to allow the pleasure of taking a greater number of franchise," Luis Noguera’s sentence.
For young people, insurance is recommended for all risks with franchise (i.e. EUR 150), or one to three-thirds expanded when there is a high level of bonus.
It has to be said that car insurance is important, not only because it covers the driver in front of possible rails, but also because it represents an important expense, which is why it is essential to adequately study the insurance that most suits us according to our personal situation.
Celtic seeks in Milan a point worth the octaves
Milan and Celtic are measuring this morning in San Siro looking for the point that they lack to achieve their respective goals in the close of the 'Champions' league, as Italians serve them to be the first and the Scottish to condemn their classification.
The Italians have taken ten points and have already certified on the fifth day their passage with an empathy in Portugal, while Celtic has nine points, but still needs another to ensure that Shakhtar, with six, and that he receives Benfia, who has four, does not go ahead.
These two parties of Group D will be played one week before the end of the sixth day, as Milan has to dispute the World Club in Japan, where it starts on 13th in semifinals looking for a place for the end of 16.
Thus, this group will be closed before the rest and the impact on the Giuseppe Meazza seems to be the most expected result, although the two teams will try to get out of a victory, because the Italians will not want to speculate at home, and the Celtic knows that by winning it would be first and ensure a better cross in eights.
On the whole of Gordon Strachan could even use a defeat to classify himself if Shakhtar doesn't win, but he can't be trusted because at the same time as nine points the pass is for the Ukrainians, who lost last week in Glasgow (2-1), but won (2-0) in the other direct debt.
Thus, the Milanists will try to trap him at night to the Scottishs, who rely on the 8th in the restructured Championships League and consecutively, after they have been specifically defeated in that round the past campaign with a Kaka gol in the distance (1-0) after the 0-0 of the age.
Waiting for the victory of the 'rosoneri' will be Shakhtar who only deserves the triumph, in the case that he loses Celtic, both to stand in octaves and to continue in the UEFA.
And it is that Benfia, despite being the last and no options to pursue the European maximum competition, could achieve the third battle with a victory, with what the UEFA would play.
20,000 people attend the first concert of the Spice Girls race race in Vancouver
The Spice Girls have started in Vancouver, Canada, before some 20,000 spectators, their first race since they dissolved in 2000.
'Posh Spice' (Victoria Beckham), 'Scary Spice' (Melanie Brown), 'Baby Spice' (Emma Bunton), 'Sporty Spice' (Melanie Chisholm) and 'Ginger Spice' (Gri Hallwell) said shortly before starting their concert at the stadium GM Place of Vancouver that the group meeting was "flamming".
Some 20,000 people have increased the entrances to the concert, which included a video on the history of the group that was angry at the end of the 1990s.
The meeting and the world tour coincide with the launch of a new album that collects its main achievements as well as two new songs, 'Headlines' and 'Voodoo', published in Spain by EMI.
The five Spice Girls' integrations went out to the stage with some brazalettes that had given them the husband of 'Posh Spice', British footballist David Beckham.
The sportsman was among the public who had broken down the GM Place, although Victoria's nerves had been banned days earlier.
At the beginning of the show, Victoria Beckham pointed out that the British astrologer "has not seen our dresser for nothing, so I'm nervous about what he's going to think of the show."
'Sporty Spice' whose release from the group in 1998 "for the differences between us" caused the resolution of the fifteenth year after, also expressed his nervousness during a meeting with the press, two hours before the show began.
"Be careful to stay.
I was nervous but I saw that the world's feeling has changed, the feeling of the Spice Girls has changed.
And I thought why not, so I am glad that I made the decision," Chisholm said about the group meeting that she dissolved nine years ago.
The singer also pointed out that in time, "the things have been arranged and we love everything very much".
But many things have changed since the Spice Girl acted last time together in 1998.
To begin, according to CTV, the group arrived at Vancouver on a special flight from Virgin Airlines.
When he arrived at the airport, he was waiting for an army of children.
There are seven children among the five.
After the Vancouver concert, the group will act in California (USU), San José (4 December) and Los Angeles (5 and 7 December).
Madrid will act on 23 December.
New fears about gas between Russia and Ukraine
The growing debate on the price of gas between Ukraine and Russia increases the risk of fuel exports to Western Europe by Russia.
The majority of the gas exported by Russia to the European Union (EU) is directed through Ukraine, so each rock between the two nations is a source of attention.
Kiev has warned that if Moscow increases gas prices, Russia will have to pay higher transit fees.
A previous year's debate reduced supplies to EU states.
The last dispute between Kiev and Moscow came with the Ukrainian government and the Russian state, the monopolical gas owner, Gazprom, trying to agree on the amount of money that Ukraine should pay for the Russian gas in 2008.
Gazprom said it would take more to Ukraine, as it has committed to pay an extra 50% in 2008 for the gas coming from neighboring Turkmenistan.
Analysts say it could be that Ukraine pays 40% more for the imports of Gazprom.
"It is important for us to use our arguments as one of the most important gas transits during the talks," Ukrainian Economy Minister Anatoly Kinakh told Reuters news agency.
"The changes in gas prices should not relate to our arguments on the levels of transit rates [to Western Europe] via Ukraine."
The last major gas dispute between Moscow and Kiev, Gazprom cut supply in Ukraine in January 2006.
This meant a fall in exports to Western Europe, which quickly rose prices.
Russian gas represents the fourth part of the EU supply.
Russia has the world's largest gas reserves, but a good part of it is still not fully developed.
As a result, Gazprom complements its own supply with Turkmenistan's gas supply and other former Soviet countries in Central Asia.
NHS "should test foreign workers"
The Scottish NHS needs to monitor previous criminal records of outside European employees, said one observer.
The recommendation of Auditor General Robert Black came after it was verified that a foreign doctor was related to the attack on the airport of Glasgow in June.
Black also expressed his concern that the Scottish NHS does not have the exact idea of the number of foreign personnel with whom it is concerned.
However, his report indicated other controls that were properly carried out through a sample of five health authorities.
The auditor-general checked the number of foreign staff hired outside the European economic area, due to attacks at the airport of Glasgow.
Bilal Abdullah, 28, an Iraqi doctor at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was arrested at the airport after he shot a jeep at the doors of the airport terminal building.
He was one of the three doctors who acted at the Old Bailey by video conference in October, accused of alleged bombings in the United Kingdom.
NHS expects pre-employment checks for candidates to be carried out in order to ensure that they meet the qualifications, experience and authorization to work in the United Kingdom.
Although the Scotland Health Board uses "Disclosure Escocia" to carry out criminal checks, the Agency has no jurisdiction to obtain this information outside Britain.
The report of the Auditor-General recommends, among other measures, that meetings should be conducted under the direction of the Criminal Records Bureau, which assists employees with criminal controls in many countries outside Britain.
"Although we find some of the personal records with evidence of these controls, this is not a routine review," the report says.
Black states that Scottish NHS has a high level of compliance with its own employment policies, but notes: "Our report highlights areas that can be improved to ensure that information is available in NHS's foreign staff."
BMA President of Scotland, Dr. Peter Terry said it was "very unlikely" that pre-employment checks could identify potential NHS employees who could commit terrorist acts in the future.
"The report suggests that pre-employment checks operate in NHS Scotland but it is not clear what the added value of the recommendations made is," he explained.
The Scottish health authorities claim that there are currently 1,161 foreign persons, most of them doctors and nurses.
However, the auditor-general warned that the number could be higher, partly because the meetings have problems identifying who are employees who have unlimited residence permits.
The investigation also found that the verification procedures established by NHS authorities in Ayrshire and Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanrkshire and Lothaan were being carried out extensively.
This includes passport checks, work permit and qualifications check.
The Scottish Government is currently reviewing foreign policy and pre-employment guide in NHS.
The health secretary, Nicola Sturgeon, said: "I had a great interest in carrying out this work because of the terrorist attack on the airport of Glasgow.
He added that the Scottish Government, together with health councils, could consider the recommendations of the reports and that this would be reflected in the update of pre-employment control guides for all working groups - including foreigners - which they had planned to publish next month.
Joy Division dominates cinema prizes
Control, the biographical film on the late vocalist of Joy Division, Ian Curtis, has won five prizes at the British Independent Film Festival, including the Gilead at the best film.
The trophies were also given to protagonist Sam Riley, who worked in a warehouse until he was selected for the role of Curtis, for Director Anton Corbín and co-protagonist Toby Kebell.
The actress Judi Dench was best named actress by the triller "Notes of a scandal".
And Bond's protagonist, Daniel Craig won the prize of variety to put a British film at the international stage.
The awards were delivered at a ceremony at the London Roundhouse.
Control follows the rise to the fame of Curtis with Joy Division, until his death in 1980, at the age of 23.
The film - in white and black - which has a sound band of The Killers, David Bowie and New Order - was produced with only 3 thousand esters.
But he also won the Dutch photographer Corbin, already known by the iconic charatula of the U2 album Joshua Tree, gifted with two prizes-a better director and a better beginner.
The rock music was the center of another award in the ceremony - like Julien Temple film on The Clash Joe Strummer's vocalist, won the award for the best documentary.
The award to the best actor was taken by Viggo Mortensen for his role as a leader of the Russian mob in London, in the film of David Cronenberg Promises of the East.
Ray Winstone, who has a reputation for playing hard, received Richard Jarris' award for his contribution to the British film.
The 50th, whose films include Scum, Nil By Mouth and Sexy Beast, currently filmed the Indiana Jones century "The Queen of the Crystal Head".
Winston said he was proud to receive that prize, so named in honor of Harris, the star of Camelot and Harry Potter, died in 2002.
"There were people like Richard Harris and Albert Finney who opened doors to people like me," he said.
"I was lucky to meet Richard Harris a couple of times.
He was a great guy, a great actor of our time, is really an honor."
The awards for independent cinema, known as BIFAS, are selected by a team that includes cinematists, actors and festival organizers.
Sympathetics and events at the Bifa festival include Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Nigh, Meera Syal and Michael Winterbottom.
Saudi Arabia arrests 208 terrorists
Saudi Arabia yesterday revealed that 208 terrorist cell soldiers were planning an imminent attack on oil installations, as well as attacks on religious and security forces.
The state television of the world's largest oil supplier said one of the cells was planning the missile control.
Sympathetics from Al-Qaeda have mounted a campaign against local monarchy, in partnership with the United States, since 2003 after Iraq's invasion.
An eight military cell formed by foreign residents planned an attack on a oil facility in the province of the East, declared the television report.
Saudi Arabia created 35,000 effective forces to protect Abqaiq, the world's largest oil plant, following a failed attack on Al-Qaeda in 2006.
The report, quoting a statement by the Minister of the Interior, said that 18 of the arrests belonged to a cell led by a "missioning expert", who entered the country.
The Minister said that the military had planned to enter eight projects in the country.
22 other detainees were planning killings of religious leaders and security forces.
The Government warned the religious leaders that they should be more active to stop Saudis travelling to Iraq from joining forces in Al-Qaeda to fight ally forces and support the Muslim Shiita government, which is considered inheritance by the most extreme Saudis.
The Al-Qaeda militias are looking at many religious people in Saudi Arabia who have been appointed by the authorities to support the policies of the real family, which governs the government.
Soldiers - recruited by Osama Bin Laden, leader of Al Qaeda, born in Saudi Arabia, to join the country's pro-occupational government - had the objective of foreign residences associated with the government, government buildings and energy facilities.
"This was a great effort of the security forces, since five months of work," said the interior minister on state television.
The arrests also include a "meditative cell" of 16 people in Medina, whose aim was to promote "takfiri thought" - the ideology of radical Muslims who support violence against the Muslims considered infidel and apostatized.
The arrest includes 32 other persons accused of providing support and financial support to the military.
Venus’s climate can give an idea of the future of the Earth
Venus could have once been an appropriate place for life, scientists said yesterday.
The data from a European orbital spaceship showed the planet most similar to a sphere of Earth that had previously been observed.
Venus is the nearest planet to Earth.
The two planets have similar size and occupy similar orbits, although Venus is slightly closer to the sun.
Millions of years ago, Venus could have had conditions similar to those that made a inhabited planet on Earth, now scientists believe.
But the effects of carbon dioxide and the winter effect, the atmosphere erosion by solar radiation and the slower solar rotation sent Venus to a very different kind of development.
Today the planet does not have water, the temperature of the surface is enough to slow down the floor and is erosiond by the hurricane winds and rain storms.
The results of the European Space Agency for the Venus Express, which has studied the planet for a year, offers a panorama of how the Earth could develop catastrophic changes due to the climate.
Professor Fred Taylor, of the University of Oxford physics Department and one of the leaders of the Venus Express mission, states: "It is clear why the weather in Venus is so different from the Earth, when two planets are so similar.
"Our new data makes it possible to build a scenario in which Venus began as the Earth, possibly with a living environment millions of years ago."
Police decomposes "enriched uranium"
A kilo of radioactive material, which they claim is enriched uranium, was decomposed yesterday by the Slovak and Hungarian police.
One police officer said three people were arrested and the material was examined.
The effect could not be confirmed if it was enriched uranium but said it could have been sold by $1 million (48,000 esterlin).
Still Open
Mitt Romney says it is not worthy that presidential candidates answer the questions of a snowflake.
However, the Republican candidates for the presidency may be able to hold a debate on YouTube, where common and current voters record questions in video and send them for their dissemination among candidates.
None of the questions raised on Wednesday, 28 November, were more ridiculous than the snow monasteries who asked Democrats about climate warming in the debate of the Republican YouTube party.
But the questions, and the answers, this time reflected much of the Republican party's status in the elections next year.
It is not known exactly how CNN producers, co-sponsored the debate, chose YouTube videos to show candidates to appeal.
But the first half hour of debate, the longest devoted to a single topic, focused on immigration.
The theme is one of the most powerful topics for the Republicans.
CNN asked a group of indeterminate voters to go to the dial when they heard ideas that they liked: the stations noted approval points when the candidates spoke with extreme arguments.
The toughest exchanges of words at night were between Rudy Giuliani, the national pioneer, and Mr. Romney, who had been in the critical investigations of Iowa and New Hampshire.
Mr. Giuliani is trying to destroy Romney's reputation because he was white with illegal immigration when he was mayor of New York.
He attacked Mr. Romney, accusing the former governor of Massachusetts of hireing illegal immigrants to work at his home.
Both responded aggressively when they were asked whether some candidate might support an "admissibility" (by allowing the illegals to regulate their situation and giving them the opportunity to obtain citizenship).
The smaller candidates like Duncan Hunter, a California congressman, and Tom Tancredo, a Colorado congressman, reached agreement on the subject.
No one has the word of being nominated, but they both remain in the race, perhaps because they both warned about the issue of immigration before others.
At least in immigration, and in general terms, candidates share views: increased border surveillance, intolerance with illegal immigrants.
This topic, along with the fear of Chinese toxic toys and other external concerns, helps the Republicans to forget, or minimize, the divisions between liberals and Christian conservatives.
But the debate became uncomfortable when other topics appeared.
Mr. Giuliani was asked why he had supported arms control in the past.
John McCain and Mr. Romney discussed whether water immersion should be considered torture.
One person asked if the candidates believed in every word of the Bible.
This led Mr. Giuliani to point out that although the Bible was his favorite book, he did not literally believe in the history of Jonah and the whale.
Another asked if Jesus would support the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee - now, against all expectations, first in Iowa's most recent investigation, thanks to his long-term Christian conservativeism, he said that the death penalty was painful but necessary.
When he was pressured to answer if Jesus was in favor of him, the river said that Jesus was too intelligent as to be applied to the elections.
The race is not always open.
Mr. Huckabee is increasing in Iowa, consistent with the liberal Ron Paul's fund-raising campaigns, and his warm statements of the Wednesday debate.
They both left the fund, because the two parties did not reach agreement on the most famous and traditional candidate.
In 1980 and 2000, a candidate joined the early and convincing party with a winning message about America's greatness, satisfying both parties.
This time the game is divided and the result is far from clear.
Workers' Pains
Gordon Brown has discovered another afternoon in which to cry; but also emerges
As political scandals continue in England, this is not particularly interesting.
It does not seem to have been sold with influence, it is neither exorbitant hotel accounts in Paris nor extramarital fingerprints.
But it has been revealed that a rich business man has broken down contributions to the English labour-government party, of more than 650,000 pounds (1.3 million dollars), for almost four years using false names, and that the party has not denounced it.
Two months ago, when the first minister listened to the call for an election, utterly insulting British intelligence by saying that opinions were not influenced by his decision, the hope was to provide a strong and effective government.
But instead, like Vince Calbe, the leading liberal democracy with growing engineering, because Mr. Brown's fear of being Stalin is going to be Mr. Bean.
Northern Rock's rescue, a problem bank, demonstrated regulatory weakness and the poverty of justice in times of crisis.
Bad proposals to change the tax code have put the business groups together against the government.
The tax authority lost 25 million personal data that revealed an inimaginable administrative cap.
A third of the generals who were withdrawn began a motion in the chamber of the Lores, protesting against the courts in military spending: being ministers of the armed forces is, they claimed, a medium-term employment.
Now they are the many donations of David Abrahams; Peter Watt, the Secretary-General (and former complicity) has already given up.
None of this means that Mr Brown walks irrevocably toward the exit.
Governments can reach a point of inflation after failure to govern.
People don't think of them as politicians, but they usually insist on their credibility when a new struggle takes control.
Once it is clear that the first minister can't improve things, which does not last long, that suspension is more than that: public officials begin to fail; the ministers of the office are exposed; the press is looking for bad news; and the government is on the defensive and does not focus on it.
In part, Brown's position is particularly difficult, because unlike other political leaders, it cannot be defended by arguing that it is new.
Even though I wanted to renegotiate Tony Blair, he was his superior.
The problems of Northern Rock and the registration tax of authority are related to the decisions Brown made as canceler of the error.
And even when it's not directly focused on Blairish's contracts - or "efficiency for partners", the research into the financing of political parties - voters can assume that if it is.
However, Mr Brown's situation is not as bad as it seems.
The tiles aren't as bad as the Tories want to show.
Like Mr. Bean, no one's dead, no one's been standing directly.
And the remedy, although painful, is to give what Mr Brown's natural Stalinist tendencies have always promised: a reliable and brutal government.
The new political scandal of donations is a good example.
Mr. Abrahams, who compared his gifts with gifts of charity, said that he did not want public recognition for his blessing.
This may be so, but the decision doesn't make him.
The laws against anonymity for large political contributors are clear and there is a clear reason: the public has the right to know who is buying access to those who have power.
Mr. Watt, who said he was aware of Mr. Abraham's agreement, and that he was not illegal, would obviously face Jon Mendlesohn, the fund-raising chief at which he was asked about donations in October.
But Mr Brown has not yet been involved: there is nothing to suggest that he knew of these actions, although the magnitude of the payments was done after he took control of the office in June.
Until now, the first minister has done half of the work.
It has been quick to condemn his party for violating the law, but it is slow to decide on a family matter, a commission of inquiry on the matter - conducted, in good measure, by a judge and a bishop.
In this case, morals are not complicated.
If the law has been violated, it's a matter of the police.
In addition, there are other things Mr Brown has to do, such as finding a permanent and independent leader for the Committee of Standards in Public Life, since he has not had one for six months, and he must also press for a genuine reform of the financing of the parties.
This will require a great deal of co-operation of workers with the Tories, and perhaps a rejection of the special financial situation with the trade unions - bitter measures for a party like Mr Brown.
But he's got to do it to some party stuff.
Conservatives now have a good level of support in the investigations; he is two years old to win voters; and the only way he can move to victory is to act with an impeccable probabilities and a solid competence.
Tiburone tart
The mortgage crisis is undermining the American credit card market?
When there's blood in the water, it's natural that some dorsal joints don't feel around.
Today, the American housing market is in crisis, the dealers have their views on the country's credit cards market.
Analysts in Goldman Sachs estimate that losses in credit cards can amount to $99 million if the mortgage crisis affects other forms of consumer credit.
Contagion signs are coming.
There is an increase in both card charges and crime rates, which measures the proportion of balances that have not been amortised or have more than 30 days of delay respectively.
HSBC announced last month that it took 1.4 million in its financing business to the American consumer, partly due to the failure of card providers.
However, it's very early for the panic.
Morosity and crime are low.
According to Moody's, a qualification agency, the third quarter of the crime rate of 3.89% was almost a percentage point below the historical average.
The deterioration in rates can be explained partly by technical factors.
A change in the American law on persons' pensions (2005) led to a fall in the claims of interest, which in turn represented a large loss in credit cards; the number of applications (and therefore, of mortgages) would be growing again, or could happen that conditions for suppliers were increasing.
The industry also reports solid payment rates, which show how much of its debt is paid to consumers every month.
And confidence in credit cards and asset-backed values is strong enough, despite parallelism in other financial areas.
Dennis Moroney of TowerGroup, a research firm, predicts that the emission volumes for 2007 will be about 25% higher than last year.
The direct channels of the crisis infection between the subsidised mortgages and the credit card market are certainly present: consumers like to load credit cards debts now that credit institutions are losing.
But credit card issuers see more liquidity flow than active values, so that the prices in decline do not necessarily change in the creditors' credit capacity.
They can even work to benefit the stations.
The incentives for consumers to continue to amortize the mortgage indicate whether properties are less than the value of the loan; and as a result, the payment of the debt of the card goes up in the list of priorities.
Card stations can also respond quickly and flexiblely to difficult conditions than mortgage lenders, changing types of interest or changing credit balances.
That in theory should reduce the risk of rapid asset resuscitation.
"We're not going to wake up one day and reevaluate all the loans," says Gary Perlin, chief of Capital One Finance.
If a sudden infection of the premium on the credit card market is unlikely, the risks of a sustained decline are much more real.
If house prices are lower and a credit contract push America into recession, the industry will inevitably face a stronger future.
You've got to keep watching those dorsal lights.
British bankers declared guilty in the case of Enron
Three British bankers who were judged for their responsibility in the frauds with the former chief of Enron's financial office, Andrew Fastow, were declared guilty of these atrocities.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew were originally found innocent of seven fraud charges due to joining Fastow in a secret financial operation in 2000.
They were sent to court in January.
But during the hearing before Judge Ewing Werlein Jr. of the U.S. district, each was judged guilty of fraud.
The three ancient executions of Greenwich Natwest, a unit of the PLC Scottish group in the Royal Bank, became a celebrity in Britain for the two-year extradition procedures.
In the United States, its case marks the final flow of an investigation launched after the destruction of Enron in 2001.
Initially, the charges against the bankers were to be alerted in 2002 to Fastow, which was the objective of a government investigation on the fall of Enron.
The charge against the bankers - doubled the "NatWest Tres" - says they came to Houston in 2000 to invent a fraud scheme with Fastow and his former assistant, Michael Kopper.
Greenwich Natwest had invested in a subsidized Enron company controlled by Fastow, which was the artifice of a dream of fraud in Enron, which helped his fall spiral in the brain.
In 2002, the bank valued the interests of the zero subsidy, but the three British knew that it would be worth it.
A company under Kopper's control bought the bank interest of the subsidy at $1 million.
Bankers paid Kopper $250,000 for interest in that company.
According to the charge, Fastow falsely represented Enron, since the energy company would pay $20 million to Greenwich NatWest for its part in the subsidy.
But 20 million remained in the hands of British bankers, Fastow and others.
Bankers accounted for 7.3 million, while Fastow, Kopper and others received about 12.3 million, according to the charge.
In January 2004, Fastow was convicted of two conspiracy charges in the Bay of Enron.
The third British was arrested three months later.
Fastow is fulfilling a 6-year sentence in a federal prison in Louisiana.
Kopper's doing a 3-year sentence and a month in Texarkana.
Each of the three British banks must pay $1 million that they requested to live in the United States while the trial was held.
Enron, one of the seven largest companies of the nation, declared in bankruptcy in December 2001 after years of accounting, could not hide the debt of millions or make their business seem successful.
The collapse has cost thousands of jobs, more than 60 million in market values and more than two million in pension plans.
Enron's founder, Kenneth Lay and former executive chief, Jeffrey Skilling were charged with crimes last year for their roles in the company's collapse.
Skilling is fulfilling a sentence of more than 24 years.
The conviction of the Law by conspiracy, fraud and other charges was suspended when he died from a heart attack last year.
We're not down in Moscow
The price of a golfstream G550, equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine and sufficient fuel capacity to fly directly from Moscow to Los Angeles, starts at $54 million.
But this is a small cost for some of the Russians.
"He has up to 18 passengers," says Dan Firer, representative of Gulfstream.
"But no one asks for that model of so many seats because it is for private family flights or for the presidents of a company."
Mr. Firer was in charge of the Gulfstream cabin last Friday in the Feria del Millionario, a four-day consumer organisation held at an event centre in the vicinity of the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, 200 other luxury suppliers had installed their exhibition stands, waiting to attract new Russians assembled to all kinds of products, from crafted yachts in the cave to the trailers of compressed diamonds, 50 cents.
Mr. Firer looks carefully at a bright orange Porsche in his stand near his."
"It's a nice car, but it's nice and warmer than we are," he said.
"After the United States, Russia is the second largest market for private aircraft."
Fueled by oil spill, the Russian capital seemed to Dallas when he was in support.
"We saw the same in 1890, when some desperate Americans came to meet in Europe, where they were seen as materialists," says Marshall Goldman, senior professor of the Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian studies at Harvard University.
"Like the Saudis of the 70s and the Japanese in the 1990s, the Russians are growing as the world's largest consumers and consumers."
The most exclusive luxury brands in the world are looking for their part of the pastel.
In another location in Moscow, a conference on the luxury industry will be held this week with Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnold Arnault, president of LVMH, to exchange ideas on how to sell luxury goods on markets like Russia.
(The conference is organized by the International Herald Tribune, owned by New York Times)
Russia has 53 million multimillionaires making a total of $2282 billion, according to the list Forbes of the richest people.
In addition, second-class wealth includes 103,000 million Russians whose money comes to $670 billion, according to a study of the evolution of personal wealth in the former Soviet Union, written by economists of the Centre for Economic and Financial Research, a thought thank local.
(The World Bank says that in 2005, some 15.8% of Russians were below the level of subsistence.)
"There are hundreds of millions in Moscow - and that's why we're all here," says Nicole Marais, a sales and marketing representative of David Morris, the London joyer.
She attended the fair for the first time with the Russian brand distributor, Soho Jewelry group.
"Women are imperceptibly prepared and men are very dignified."
Visiting the holiday on Sunday night, dressed in late afternoon, two Raquel agents, Evgenia Yumatova, 21, and Svetlana Turovtsova, 26, described their customers and themselves as millions.
"I looked at the cars and I'm trying to decide between Infiniti, Mercedes and Porsche," Yumatova said, who reeled off the design trail that he used as a network veterans dissipating with Joan Rivers.
The fair aims to attract the new rich, the type of buyers who would be willing to stay for several hours in a storage that mix brands from Cadillac Escalades, platinum cuts, ice creams from Mövenpick, pool tables, Dubai apartments and Gund's Teddy oss.
The general public can buy tickets of EUR 30 ($44.57).
"The Russians are interested in learning what brand is the most expensive and the best," said Mr. Gijrath, who sat patriotally in a stand of the real Dutch porcelains Delft, in front of a wall-size reconstruction of a painting of Rembrandt, made of hand painted steel.
"Of course, the Russians are more interested in bling-bling."
In fact, the sellers said that the rich Russians of more trajectory (10-15 years old, for the Russians) have changed their tastes from their logos to the limited edition marks, which would not be exposed in a commercial fair.
However, several thousand people: millions in effect, millions of people or tourists, fill the passports every day.
And some of them buy.
On the first night of the party last Thursday, Roman Ersov, director-general of King Koil's beds, said he sold two $70,000 collection systems each, chairs, cachemira and cotton interested in gold thread.
Also on the first night, Mikhail Lyubiumov, a sales manager for A1 Moto, a company that equipped high-ranking cars with ad hoc alarm systems, said the company had sold the shining Porsche for $17,000 to a Russian millionaire.
On Sunday afternoon, Andrei Karapetian, president of L.A. Connection, company that changed luxury cars for private requirements, said he had sold three car trailers in the form of chains, for Rolls Royce Phantom, at $55,000 each.
He showed the reporter a wheel of car, designed for the owner of a Russian casino, with raw-colour crystals of Swarovski, so that it was similar to a wheel wheel.
The cost: $22,000 for four rounds.
"The Russian millionaire who wants leather wheels or a picture of his wife made of zirconium cubes will not necessarily drive on those wheels," said Mr. Karapetian.
"He's gonna keep the car in his garage, along with another 30 or 40 cars."
Even if many of his Russian customers are rich, Mr. Karapetian explains that the phrase "Russian millionaire" does not mean exclusiveness, given the price oil of real estate properties.
"If you bought an apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, it's probably a millionaire, at least in the paper if not in fact," he said.
"There are more of them than you think."
Those who were not millions could at least pretend to be rich in support of the Continental Alliance, a Russian asset management firm.
The company made four red phone cabins (British style) filled with fake bills of a million dollars.
Azad Karryev, the company's marketing manager, said his team had printed 500,000 fake tickets for the Millionaire Fair.
The visitors stopped to collect money piles, asking their friends to take pictures with their mobiles while resting on coins, or a couple of millions.
"You see, in Moscow, everyone can feel like a millionaire," says Karryev.
Surgeoning could be caused by a death in New Jersey
It was the day before Gracias Action when Ronald Livingston looked through the window of the restaurant "A little healthier" and saw how an ambulance came up by White Cape Cod, two doors below West Scott Avenue.
Suddenly, a police patrol car appeared.
And then another one.
"Then you came up with the ambulance," said Mr. Livingston, restaurant supervisor, that Wednesday.
"It was there when I realized that someone had died."
The authorities claimed that the dead woman was Olga Arroyo, a 41-year-old assistant to Newark police department.
Now the researchers are trying to determine whether she died due to a procedure carried out by an unauthorized plastic surgeon, who is not yet identified by the police, but who works at the house of Av 212 West Scott.
The authorities still do not determine what caused the death of Mrs. Arroyo, but wait for the toxicological test, although the results will not be available for several weeks. This will help to resolve the mysterious death that has been confined to the upper ranks of Newark police.
Ms. Arroyo had been the assistant of the police director, Gary F. McCarthy, since September 2006, and his voice was familiar to many in the department.
"She was loyal, hardworking and tenaz," said Mr. McCarthy about Arroyo in a telephone interview on Wednesdays.
"She was my guard."
She protected me."
Mr. McCarthy said that Arroyo was Jimmy Arroyo's wife, an ex-police officer from Newark who worked for the Committee on the Control of Alcoholic Drinks, leaving two children between 14 and 11 years of age, and a daughter.
Eileen Walsh, the prosecutor of the Union of Condado, Theodore J. Romankow, said the detectives are trying to determine whether Mrs. Arroyo died because of an unauthorized surgical procedure.
"That's one of the possibilities," said Walsh.
"It's an ongoing investigation."
The authorities said they arrived at the house about 3 P.M.
On November 21, they found Mrs. Arroyo in a sofa.
He was declared dead in the place.
More than a week ago, the authorities said little about their research or about the owner of the house, Flor Margarita Castro.
Mrs. Walsh could not say if Mrs. Castro had been questioned by the authorities.
Researchers are trying to determine which part of the house was used as medical advice.
The miracle, no one answered the door at Mrs. Castro's house, where a pink rose lies on the front side of the house, and a dark side on the back.
A blue drum marked as "vainlinina ethyl" - used as a substitute for the fanilla in food and perfumes - was found in the kitchen door on the side of a door leading to the sofa.
Two mountain bikes fall off the side of the mountain.
Mr. McCarthy said that when he arrived in Newark after 25 years in the New York police department, Mrs. Arroyo was an invaluable help to get to know the new island city and its narrow political culture.
"She would say, "You have to watch this or that," he said.
"She was always here when I was, and also when she wasn't.
You're awful."
It is expected that the federal reserve will cut the fees to raise the Bolsa
The shares jumped on both sides of the Atlantic yesterday after the market expected the federal reserve to ease the credit conditions with cuts in interest rates, which increased with the calm comments of the Vice-President of the Central Bank of the United States.
The bags were located in London, New York and across Europe after Donald Kohn, number two of Ben Bernanke, president of the reservation, said that policy makers should be "flexible and pragmatic" in response to continued tension in financial markets.
In a clear effort to calm the markets through growing samples of credit exchanges, Mr. Kohn said that recent turbulence was "inverted by the improvement in the market in late September and during October".
If the trend remained high, it would increase the possibility of additional adjustments in the financial conditions for real estate and business, Kohn said.
Comments were taken by investors as a signal that the reserve is ready to inject fresh capital in the US markets and to make further cuts of interest, to stabilize credit conditions.
Comments also helped calm Wall Street in the midst of bad news for the US economy, such as domestic sales that reached the lowest record in October.
The consequences of financial turbulence were highlighted by a Bear Stearns, an investment bank that will cut 650 jobs, equivalent to 4% of its total work, in a global cost reduction to compensate for the losses of its investments in the U.S. sub-primary mortgages.
Only 20 of these posts are expected to enter London, where the bank employs 1,500 people.
In New York, the industrial average of the Dow Jones rose at 331 points, or 2.55%, to close to 13.289.40, while the broad index S&P 500 rose by 2.65%.
In London, the FTSE 100 index rose to 165.5 points, or 2.7%, at the close of 6.306.2, adding more than 39 billion esters to the value of first-order companies in Britain.
Germany's Dax index rose by 2.6 per cent, and France's CAC40 was above 2.3 per cent.
In the past, there was a strong demand for a three-month balance of funds from the European Central Bank, which considered these loans to European trading banks in a 4.7%, the highest rate since April 2001.
The pressure on the Bank of England to continue the operation of the federal reserve and the ECB and to inject extra funds into the value markets in London increased the credit and interest rates of three months between the British banks, meaning that since September, it has been 6.59 per cent, after a steady rise since 12 November.
England takes the requests of Owais Shah and Ravi Bopar
There are two dilemmas, each as difficult as the other.
Who should hit No. 6 by England in Kandy this weekend, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And no one is less important in front of the first test against Sri Lanka, who should make the decision?
The second question is relevant because David Graveney, the president of the selection that is indemnity - with this particular title at least, is here to help Peter Moores, the trainer, and Michael Vaughan, the captain, to decide; and also because the office of Hugh Morris, the director of England, is starting to fill out offers to become a national elector, and if not, in part time.
One who does not achieve the sixth battleground will be disappointed, but life is often unfair and sports too.
It is not easy to take what a man does on his profession's top, while another never goes beyond the lower level, sometimes for lack of luck more than by capacity.
Not only in cricket is the choice is difficult, because it requires judgments that always end up being subjective.
Is it the right time for Bopar to get up?
Is it right for Shah if he does?
The same question could be asked in another way if, says John Edwards or "Tubby" Banerjee, two brilliant young executives with good grades and well-known business, had been promoted to the table: there was only one place for them.
Who should say what's a good level for a cricket player unless he's on the occasion of falling or swimming to the next chance?
The figures of course have a great influence on decisions, but they also have opportunities.
Within a team, a cricket player has to catch the captain's eye at the same time to take a "wicket" and a beater to get opportunities to change the order if he wants to have an impact as a player someday.
But catching the voters' eye is more complicated.
There were many who improved the past period, for example, James Anderson, who certainly plays in the first test even if Stephen Harmison declares himself "fit and bowls" as the wind in the networks.
Anderson took 32 weeks of the first class in 33 careers for each one to win a place.
Chris Tremlett took only 29 on the same average, but they both had their high moments and can expect more of them.
The games of Shah or Bopar in the Asgiriya Stadium can be just an opinion issue.
Option can break or make a man's career, or it can mean a small difference.
Four years ago in Sri Lanka, Garreth Batty played in each trial and did well in the first five weeks and 40 useful careers, but it was Paul Collingwood, struggling to establish at the same time who came to become an important player, and despite noting a double against Australia, it can still be underestimated.
The probability is that Graveney, Vaughan and Moores, after further discussion at today's meeting in Asgiria, will follow their conservation instincts and will support Shah's greatest experience on the young Bopar's exuberance.
There are arguments for both.
In favor of Shah is its bright and valuable proof of the beginning of 88 in Bombay, 32 cents of the first class facing only 6 of Bopar, who, in 22, is seven younger years younger, and has excellent precedents against spin bowling.
But Shah made only ten careers in his two tournaments in May against West India in the test in Lords, his home as a Middlesex player, and that caused an immediate rejection of the voters when Vaughan claimed his place for the next meeting, it seemed that he had taken his "batting" something of eland than in Bombay.
On the contrary, Essex's team is happy to live in swords.
He took over nothing in the cricket field and his attitude was summarized as when he turned his vehicle into an exhibition for the English car sponsor, Volkswagen.
He suffered minor injuries and probably a shock, but the first thing he did was to get his Vodafone (patrocinated, of course) and call Alastair Cook, his teammate who looked at the distance, to tell him with excitement: "Do you see that?".
Bopara is the best player, it's including your rebalancing pass to have effects in your games that seem to satisfy it, so fight with confidence and skill.
Choosing the right man is one thing, choosing the best moment, another.
Maybe that's the real art of the selection.
My invitation would give Bopar his opportunity, which doesn't mean that Shah doesn't sell, as the tea leaves suggest, is he who plays here this weekend.
Buses bring refugees back to work - and fight against Al-Qaeda
The first buses with Iraqi refugees from Syria began to arrive at Baghdad yesterday, throwing out those who remained unimpeded, without extension of the visa and those who expected the city to return to normal.
Some even returned to fight the soldiers who drove them out of their homes.
At the Mansour bus station, even before the arrival of 800 people from Damascus on an official bus from the government composed of a dozen buses, the terminal was full of refugees from Syria and Jordan who had returned to private transport.
"I decided to go to Syria after killing many doctors in Baghdad," says Sabah al-Qubaisi, a Sunita doctor.
"I returned today for what I saw on TV and what I read in the newspapers, about what happened in Baghdad and it's safe now."
"They say Mahdi's army has stopped killing people," he said, referring to the Chinese military of the religious warrior Cleric Moqtada al-Sadr, who ordered his troops a temporary halt.
Qassim to Atwani, a 38-year-old teacher and teacher in the southern area of Amariah, returned with his two children because it was impossible to renew his visa in Syria because the regime does not want Iraqis working in his country.
His neighbors called him on the phone to tell him that a U.S. allies force helped get Al-Qaeda out of his boat to the west of the capital, and they urged him to return.
One of Jordan's recent arrivals was the head of a Sinite and Chitaka tribe who had been driven from his home in Sleikh in northern Baghdad by a grenade attack, after urging the citizens to rise against Al-Qaeda.
He had come to fight.
"Two days ago, some of my friends called me and told me that they had started an anti-Al-Qaeda militia in Sleikh and that they needed my support and the support of my companions."
"That's why I came back today," said Sabaah Alu Obeid, 62 years old.
Many said they were attracted by the growing peace in the capital since the U.S. troops invaded groups of "announced citizens", armed and working in cooperation with the US military to defend their neighbours.
But many have said that they have returned to denying visas and the lack of money in Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqis have been established in recent years.
Salaam al-Samarii, 51 years old and father of three children, voted to the common suspicion among the displaced, that Nouri al-Maliki, the first Chilean minister, asked the Syrian government to impose restrictions on the visas of refugees to force people to return.
More than two and a half million people believe that they have fled the country because of the sectoral deaths.
"We were well until al-Maliki visited Syria and urged the government to stop giving Iraqis directions to force them to return to Iraq," said the tsunami.
"I can't believe in a government that supports criminals who burned my house after I left it."
Part of the reason for the cessation of violence is that the sunnets have been expelled from the affected and vice versatility areas, reducing tension.
There is the fear that an oily poured of refugees will bring back sectoral tensions and start the fight.
Little Sarre, good education.
The smallest federal state is the first in vocational training and even shines by the international guidance of its higher schools.
As in the whole country, the sarlandese are missing only from a educational field.
"Air explained for fifty times to a non-Sarlandese that we are not French" - that was the ironic motor over itself of the smallest federal state for his 50th anniversary.
At the same time, France and Luxembourg have a great role in the Sarre educational system that in a study of the German Institute of Economics (IW) called "Bildundsmonitor" took place in the fifth place.
Thus, traditional higher schools have good relations with neighbouring countries.
The University of Saarbrücken was founded in 1948 by the French.
So far, students can finish their university career here with two or three diplomas.
As a result, the percentage of foreign students is high, 15.6 per cent.
However, the number of students from Sarre is higher than the average in higher schools. Many of them do not have a bicycle.
"In Sarre the system of vocational education is being used," says Axel Plünnecke, an expert in the educational sector at the German Institute of Economics (IW).
More than five young people do their homework in the Professional School. Thus, the Sarre is 7 percent higher than the national average.
On the contrary, the variety of possibilities for vocational and academic education is very broad.
The offer of double routes, relative to the number of people, is the second best in Germany.
Despite practical training and a growing demand, the number of academics in Engineering Sciences has decreased by a third in recent years.
That was the reason why the Ministry of Education of the Sarre required higher schools to make more publicity available for the specialities in Engineering Sciences.
"After the first PISA study, we made some reforms in general education schools," said a spokesman of the Ministry of Education.
Thus the government introduced comparative evidence throughout the country.
In order for children to start studying the last year of the project called "Kita-Jahr", it has no cost. In the meantime, this model also imitates other federal states.
The comparison with the next studies will show whether the performance of students has increased.
According to the 2003 PISA report, the number of late students in school development decreased from 29 to 20 per cent.
But, in general, Sarre did not improve much more than other federal states.
In Bavaria, students know how to calculate better.
For the sake of the sarlandese, the PISA report does not compare the knowledge of foreign languages, although in this field good results can be achieved.
Although the saralandese are not French, the language of the neighbors is a mandatory assignment in Secondary Education Institutes.
You need to change the time.
Nearly in Venezuela there will be another time gap different from the rest of the world.
On 9 December, President Hugo Chávez allowed the clock to be changed in the South American country after the medium-hour clock.
Currently Chavez is staying as a comic in Spain.
As announced by the Venezuelan State Official Bulletin, according to the new law, the hour will be at least four hours of GMT.
In this way, the South American country will have an hourly divorce that does not exist in any other country in the world.
Among other things, Chavez, as an enemy of the United States, justifies his decision by saying that the United States would impose on the world on its day the obligation to change a full hour.
In addition, the Wednesday (local time) Chavez announced the breaking of relations with his neighbouring country Colombia because of the action with the take-off of reindeer.
The left-wing nationalist said he would not maintain any relationship with the head of state or the Colombian government until the conservative Alvaro Uribe continued to be the president of Colombia.
"My dignity does not allow me to do it," says Chavez, who is proposing a constitutional reform where citizens in the oil country must decide on Sunday in a referendum.
With this reform, its power could be extended quite well in the country.
The reason for the conflict was the decision taken by Uribe by withdrawing the mandate of Chavez in negotiations with the Marxist War in which it dealt with the release of the hostages.
Sunday Chavez said in critical terms that the decision taken by Uribe has offended Venezuela.
There is also much talk about Chavez in Spain.
A new tone of call causes feelings in the country: "Why don't you cry?" is the phrase that has already downloaded half a million people.
This phrase was pronounced by the King of Spain, who felt troubled by the continued interruptions by the peoples of the left in the last Ibero-American Summit.
In 2007 the decline in real wages threatened Germany.
According to one estimate, this year a decline in real wages threatens German employees despite a strong bond.
Experts present a large number of reasons for a psychiatry.
According to the estimates of the Hans Böckler Foundation, German employees should count in 2007 with a lower real salary rate than the previous year.
"The blame for this is the weak evolution of wages, the increase in taxes on added value and the stress of food and energy prices," reported Gustav Horn of the Institute of Macroeconomics and Economics Research.
New unemployment insurance charges may also correspond to employees.
The Finance Minister Peter Sitinbrück told the newspaper "New Ostanbrücker Zeitung" that given the current situation, the intention of reducing unemployment insurance by 3.3 per cent over the next year was just and reasonable.
Of course, the Labour Office does not have to reimburse itself in an unpleasant situation, asking for credit and subsidies to the Federal State, in accordance with the words of a German social-democratic party policy.
On Tuesday, the inflation rate with the price explosion in the food sector and the oil derivatives sector was made public, reaching the highest level for 13 years.
Compared to last year's prices, these are increasing by 3%.
Come on, my brother's brother of the Earth.
Although its atmosphere is not suitable for life, Venus is the planet most similar to the Earth, something that has not yet been planted. The "Venus Express" European probe discovered rays in the atmosphere and remolins in the fields, which also appear in winter on Earth.
For three decades, researchers have suspected that there could be rabies in Venus.
But now the European probe has brought new evidence: it has discovered electromagnetic waves at the edge of the atmosphere. In Venus the rays call a height of 54 kilometres from one cloud and behind another, says Chris Russell of the University of California in Los Angeles in the scientific journal " Nature".
According to the famous model of the origin of the life of Urey-Miller, the rays caused life on Earth: the storms could have caused reactions in the ocean that, on its part, had given rise to amino acids that are the basic components of life.
In Venus this is not the case: if one day he would have lived there, that would have to be in one of the first states of evolution," explains Sean Solomon of the Washington Carnegie Institution.
Today, there can be no life on the surface of Venus: the atmosphere pressure is almost 100 times higher than on Earth and on the surface of the royal temperatures of 500°C, oscillating so that temperatures can be reached below zero.
"Probably, Venus is a "devil" snake of the Earth, but it still is a snake," said Russell.
The main objective of the "Venus Express" mission is to answer the question why Venus, so similar to Earth by its mass and size, has had such a different evolution.
As since the 1990s there have been no special missions, only for research on this planet, the launch of Venus-Express in November 2005 was a very important step in the research of Venus.
The latest results of the research that will be presented in many articles of Nature, according to researchers' opinion, not only highlight the uniqueness of Venus in the Solar System.
"This also shows that nearby planets have more common characteristics with the Earth we've assumed," the ESA reported.
Despite the well-known weather winds in the North Pole, researchers have discovered in the polar region an even more rapid wave formed by the clouds.
This phenomenon recalls windflows in the heights of the earth's atmosphere, according to a team of researchers by Giuseppe Piccioni of the Italian Institute of Special Astrophysics and Space Physics.
The second planet of the Solar System has the mass nearly equal to the Earth and with its equatorial diameter of 12,000 kilometers is nearly as large.
This planet is also called a white star or an orbital star around the Sun almost 225 days.
But its rotation period is shorter: one day in Venus equals 243 days on Earth.
Although Venus with its surface temperatures of 460 degrees and its atmospheric pressure of 92 bars is not very similar to Earth, scientists share the basis for both planets to be formed under the same conditions.
In both planets water had been collected that remained in the oceans on Earth, but Venus was dissipated in the universe.
While carbon dioxide has been converted into carbon stones in the Earth, in Venus forms most of the atmosphere.
Koehler defended Merkel's myth with Dalai Lama.
Koehler, President of the Federal Republic, insisted on the end of the fight between the parties by Dalai Lama's reception in the Federal Chancellor.
He directly criticized the German Social-Democratic Party for his attacks on the Federal Chancellor after the mid-September.
Horst Koehler, Federal President, was concerned about Germany's reputation and therefore demanded that the great coalition end that war by the reception of Dalai Lama.
"In this case we must not present ourselves as a divided nation," Koehler told the newspaper "Handelsblatt".
At the same time, Koehler showed his understanding of the reception of Dalai Lama by Angela Merkel (Democratic Union Party) in September.
"Although I have great respect for the difference between cultures, human rights are absolutely vital to me," Koehler said.
The whole world knows that Germany has to act with great balance in the metric of foreign policy, underscoring the Federal President, defending Merkel for the challenge he received when he was making a new policy with China.
"The Federal Chancellor did not take the distance from the traditional course of a Chinese policy.
China also knows," Koehler said.
Frank-Walter Steinmeier, Minister for Foreign Affairs (Social-Democratic Party), had expressed his disappointment at the reception of Dalai Lama and for this he was attacked by the members of the Union.
Among other things, Steinmeier criticized the Union for its inoperable external policy.
Dalai Lama's reception in the Federal Chancellor caused considerable misunderstanding in Chinese-German relations.
Thus, the Chinese Government not only withdrew the invitation to Peer Steinbrueck (Social-Democratic Party), the Minister of Finance of Germany, but also, according to information sources in the "Spiegel" magazine, concluded the so-called strategic dialogue of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of both countries.
Wen Jiabao, the head of the Chinese government, asked the Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel to recognize this reception of Dalai Lama as a mistake.
In affirming China's position, Wen Jiabao said that China would not accept that European politicians would receive the religious leader of Tibetans in their official position.
The actions and words of Dalai Lama have shown that they are trying to divide the Tibetan and other Tibetan region of China, which now includes other provinces.
Schaeuble warns that there will be disturbances such as those in France.
Battles with the police on the streets, shots, car fire: Wolfgang Schaeuble warns that there will be disturbances such as the case of France.
The Federal Minister demands that all efforts be made to prevent social satisfaction in Germany from moving to the streets.
Barriers were made, the vandals were shot with guns at the police: after serious disturbances caused by young people in France, the Federal Minister for Internal Affairs, Wolfgang Schaeuble (Democratic Union Party) was afraid of similar trends in Germany.
"We must be committed to ensuring that the social problems of our country do not take the form of violence."
"That's what we have to take seriously," said the newspaper "Nue Presse," published in Hannover.
Not all young people develop in the constant exchange of social reality.
The Federal State, federal states and municipalities are already working with emphasis on solving these problems, Schaeuble said.
This refers not only to the integration of immigrants.
"From the Summit of Integration to the Islamic Conference: all this is already giving its first fruits."
It's still early to give you the end of the alarm.
At the same time, Schaeuble indicated that German suburbs do not have the same building and sociological problems as they do in France.
Young people were greatly disturbed by the street with the police in northern Paris last night.
In Tolouse there was also a fire in public cars and buildings.
Kenan Kolat, President of the Turkish Community in Germany, called for greater efforts by the Federal Government for integration.
Kolat, in view of the disturbances in France, warns of an imitator effect.
It is true that the situation in Germany is not as explosive as in France.
Nevertheless, actions are necessary.
Kolat indicated that the peer index among young people under 25 years of age is above average.
There must be more vocational training.
Kolat says, "We have to give a perspective to young people."
The President of the Turkish Community added that in Germany more than in France, there is "great social control in families", greater than in France.
In addition, most youths of foreign origin do not want to destroy what their parents have built here.
Kolat thinks, "But despite everything, we have to be careful."
It is necessary to "give young people the opportunity to get faster a job or vocational training".
While both night and night in the Parisian subway Villaers-le-Bel passed peacefully.
Hundreds of police participated in the action, a helicopter flying over the territory.
The responsible authorities reported three arrests, as well as buses and burnt cars.
Since the day before, a team of almost 1,000 police is in charge of security.
After seeing a riot, Michelle Alliot-Marie, the Minister for Internal Affairs, announced that the police would take strict measures until necessary.
On Monday night at Tuesday about 80 police officers were wounded by disturbances in Villaries-le-Bel.
The disturbances continued the following night in Tolouse.
The disturbance began by a traffic accident on Sunday, where two young people died.
According to the information provided by the tax system, the death of young people was not the responsibility of the police.
In the kingdom of Angela Wolke.
The very far from the reality of the Federal Chancellor, shows that the coalition on content reached its final point and that there is no need to wait for anything more than it.
But in which country does Chancellor really live?
After her desperate, inconsistency and lack of content in the general debate of the Lower Chamber, she has to say that she does not live in the country she should be governed by.
With regard to the claim made by the party that it had been committed again to actions in foreign policy, the Cancillar rejected it with a budgetary phrase.
He said that this would be a provincial way and thus showed that he did not want to understand what was in the interest of critics.
A very clear statement was made in the Lower Chamber that the speech was appropriate.
It was not possible to feel a minimum interest, nor any kind of feeling about the country's problems.
But instead, Angela Wolke presented herself in this way: a very high policy that runs in foreign policy and remains there without achieving anything in concrete.
One example: the prevention of climate change: many of them were commended for the decisions taken in Heiligengamm, but it does not say anything about how these goals should be achieved here on climate issues.
In general, this way of praising itself - two years ago the head of the Democratic Union Party has not been able to allow so much modesty.
So he's trying to express himself so that he can reach people.
And in this way, it damages its public image by the pragmatic design with which it solves problems without going through the branches.
But in the kingdom of Angela Wolke the internal problems are seemingly insignificant.
The poverty of children and the concerns of workers with low wages?
The only thing that is dedicated is to talk about this subject using subordinated prayers.
It is impressive how many times you fail to speak when it comes to the supplement for children.
And in this case, Merkel needs more than three attempts to make a more or less good phrase.
It begins to trickle "as if it had been in an unknown territory," when it was more specific information.
The attack section.
The two favorites, Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney, were faced with a heated discussion of the presidential presidential candidates of YouTube and should now be afraid of just one candidate from the outside.
The tensions between candidates have been noted since the beginning.
Mitt Romney told his opponent Rudy Giuliani that he would have turned to New York in "a refugee site for illegal immigrants".
This, for its part, replied with serious reservations: "I would like to say that his own house was a "port" for the illegals." Giulani answered the former governor of Massachusetts saying that he was the one who used illegal immigrants without paper.
The candidates have been attacked: as the group of Republicans so far has no clear preference, the eight presidential candidates take advantage of the debate in the CNN, especially in order to discredit their opponents.
The small 30-second video, surrounded by Internet users who were sent to YouTube, also doesn't have much content.
"With this sort of isolation we let Hitler get to power," it was John McCain's speech to his opponent Ron Paul, the only meeting he insisted on immediately withdrawing Iraq's troops.
Romney also receives many criticisms by the veterans of the war in Vietnam, when it is refused to acknowledge as torture the "waterboarding " method, a method of interrogation, by letting a person go to a person who simulates his death.
Public reactions in the St. Petersburg room in Florida show that while the most important topics of the campaign are others, not just the war in Iraq or the debate on torture.
The public was always very proud when they praised the conservative values and denied the rise of taxes.
This can be better seen where the weaknesses of both favorites are.
"At that time I was wrong," says Romney composed and apologized to the people and the public on television for having been a defender of abortion in 1994.
Giuliani, on the other hand, did not know what to say when asked what to think about the literal interpretation of the Bible.
For the first time, Musharraf has no uniform.
One day after his resignation as chief of the army, the President of Pakistan was sworn as president.
That's how the eight years of military government in Pakistan ended.
Thursday Pervez Musharraf, president of Pakistan, took an oath for a second 5-year term.
Pakistani television broadcast the ceremony at the Presidential Palace in the capital Islamabad.
Musharraf swore to respect the constitution and act for the welfare of the nation.
The militia transferred its military commander's mandate to his confidential Ashfaq Kiyani and thus accepted international pressure, especially by the US.
Eight years after he had power with an intruder military attack, the former General was in power for the first time the state as a civilian chief.
With his resignation at the head of the Armed Forces, Musharraf complied with the main conditions of the opposition and the west.
The other requirement is the end of the state of exception, which was announced by Musharraf on 3 November.
According to Malik Muhammad Qayum, the state's general prosecutor, after Musharraf's oath, will soon cancel the state of exception and will meet the second condition of the west.
Since the state of exception had been declared in the Supreme Court, there were many party lawyers from Musharraf. Last week the Supreme Court of the country rejected all resources prior to the new presidential election on 6 October.
In the meantime, five soldiers died and four others were injured in a military traffic accident in the Watristan region of the North.
According to information from the military carrier, a bomb exploded in one of the streets on the border with Afghanistan.
The Founders of Krautrock return.
The most famous German band in the 70s continues its activity: three members of "Harmonia" participated in a concert in Berlin.
As a restaurant, a copy of "Live 1974" was written in the best time of the band.
They were already very popular in foreign countries at that time.
The assistance of these three ladies to an official food caused the feeling.
Each of them has their cajita, their cables, and above all their buttons.
In the middle is Dieter Moebius who is 63 years old and is dressed with a white shirt.
On his left is 57-year-old Michael Rother, who has his laptop and guitar.
On the right, looking at the audience, is Hans-Joachim Rodelius, 73 years old, who is very busy with the control panel.
Each contributes to its sound, including rhythm.
Sometimes, without any intention, these sounds turn into a piece of music.
This doesn't seem to bother you.
Something very exciting for Krautrock's fans was the fact that the Harmonia band would do music again.
What we have to say here is this: the exact questions have shown that the name of the band has come back to people's minds, but it wasn't so special that after 32 years the public would be so foreign.
But why can't the Germans also complain about their live legend of the seventy years?
Above all, because Krautrock was always more valued in England and the United States than in his own country.
When the entertainment industry granted a "Echo" musical award to members of the Can 2003 band in Colonia for their work of life, they could see the surprising faces of German pop artists in the room.
And when Red Hot Chili Peppers thanked the band La Düsseldorf und Neu!, they all opened their mouth with a surprise.
Later, Michael Rother spent time on the stage during the concerts of Red Hot Chili Peppers as if he had been an old friend (from the band).
Ignorance in your country and foreign recognition are one thing.
It is a problem to remember this band, because the third only existed for two years and in those times it did not have a great effect on the public, however, it was obtained with subsequent thanks to others.
A long time ago, Moebius and Rodelius had made music with the artist Conrad Schnitzler and had a name, Cluster, who promised a lot of fame.
At first they played in the Berlin Schaubuhne room.
Then, for economic reasons, they worked with a music company in Duesseldorf that was sponsored by a church.
For a while, Rother had a job in Kraftwerk and then he worked as a guitarist in the New band! He managed to improve the fame of this German band that was then too radical.
In 1973, Rother followed the music of Cluster at Forst exile in Weserbergland.
There, in Alten Weserdorf, a ruin of the 16th century, they lived as refugees in the city.
The way of life was less ideological than in Common I, where Rodelius could complain about his position.
That was rather a life of an artist full of surprises.
According to them, one day a band of Ottenstein Song Association appeared on the ground, which turned out to be a good name for the art.
There were also disadvantages in using the name Harmonia.
The first album was called "Music von Harmonia" and the second "De Lux".
Although music was quiet and simple, the band had financial problems.
Life as an artist wasn't just to get to know himself.
The "Live 1974" CD was recorded during a concert in Griessem. Some remember that almost 50 people participated in this recording.
Then Rother expressed his desire to promote harmony and do it again when we tried.
For Roedelius and Moebius this requirement is against customs.
In 1975 the band announced its separation.
Rother finished his essays on esotericism and ensured his existence with albums such as "Flammende Herzen".
Cluster has lived for eight years, and since then he has been more successful than he had Harmonia.
The direct recording of the album in Gracesmer, that must be thanking Groenemeyer.
His music company Greenland was set up to cultivate this German own contribution to preserve it as live music.
Like the work of Rodedelius, the band New! was again discovered.
The presentation of Harmonia as a band takes place at the World Cultures House in Berlin.
The band was subsidized with public measures at the Wordtronics Festival.
There is Julian Cope, the English, the old punk and the author of the "Krautrock Sampler" manual.
There is also Dr. Motte, the inventor of Loveparade.
Thus, all the influence of Krautrock on the next pop music are present.
Harmonia takes the position of a super-band, a place that was empty.
Brian Eno's phrase accompanied by special music fills the room: "This music is the only music that belongs to the future."
There are photos where Harmonia appears with producers in a fine.
The history of the development of the legend is shown in the projections of photos in white and black, where instruments with cables are seen.
In the background there are three veterans who started improvising again.
They do nothing but fix the microphones to the organ and to the battery so that they can produce extraordinary tones with the help of the impact devices that they had built with their own hands.
Currently, electronic music is as much as it should be.
Three people deep in the technique.
But that doesn't change anything.
Under the direction of Barbara Morgenstern, in a musical environment, it moves, rises, and at a good time of emphasis is singing "Aaaaaaah!".
Krautrock was always a term of English origin.
But it was never about rock.
The origin of the gender was not found in the blues, but in music schools (Can), in technologies (Kraftwerk) or by the artistic and social conventions (Cluster).
Whoever's here crying "l68!" is also right, but now Harmonia keeps peace.
The scenario reflects very well on what is already evident.
Where does it start and where does the music end?
It can break one of the nerves or give you a quick moments of luck.
Richard Gere just needs more cynism.
The two films "The Hunting Party" and "Moerderischer Frieden" are re-deprived to the war in the Balkans.
But the two didn't have much conviction.
Or the concepts are much fixed on actions and shootings or the two films are too exciting.
Richard Gere with his "The Hunting Party" can't help in this case either.
At first there was good news: Karadzic and Mladic, war criminals, still hiding in the Balkan mountains, but precisely there, in the inner darkness of the country during the war of Bosnia, the actor Richard Gere was discovered again.
Finally, we had lost sight of the most beautiful man in the 1980s, because no one wanted to see him after his pleasant papers and of little importance in films for women and after many press conferences on Buddhism.
Now, suddenly, Richard Gere is the most important argument to see perhaps the film "The Hunting Party- when a hunter becomes what he pursues" (Why today the titles of the films have to be so long and shot?).
The film has a wonderful presentation for the view: in the background, its role as a reporter in the war is the presentation of what Richard Gere could do, if the destination and industry of the film had not been so merciful with him. He was a man whose best times of life had already passed, as a monument of his decade's ruin had so far preserved most of his love.
"The Hunting Party", despite this triumph, along with "Moerderischer Frieden" which is the German production and will also be presented this week, resulting in only a series of successful films about the war in the Balkans.
The film "Moerderischer Frieden" can be spoken in a few words: it's about two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt) who want to save a Serb from Kosovo's francophones, one of them acts very quickly and that also leads him to love her.
The meaning of the film is lost by the actions and shootings, although we observe that Serbs are no longer presented as the only criminals.
The film is like the German series "Alarm fuer Cobra 11" without autopist, but in a war situation.
The example of "The Hunting Party" can be investigated, because there was never really a good film on the war in the Balkans.
On another occasion, with another director and with another script author (Richard Shepard in two posts), the story of the U.S. reporters in the war going to detect a criminal war Serb called "sorrow", could probably be a new "Apocalypse Now".
Thus, stories are surprisingly similar: small teams go to the mountain twice to do something that the army can't do and every time it turns out to be a vacation trip.
One reason for the failure of "The Hunting Party" is when they first introduce us to Simon Hunt, to whom they don't just let him be a cynic with heart.
No, the script also provides for a loving adventure with a Muslim Bosnian who will then be killed.
Then "The Hunting Party" is far away from the reality, especially when in the last five minutes reporters with an impressive speed achieve what they could not achieve for five years the NATO, the CIA and all the world's leaders, who were captured by the war criminal and left them to the Muslim Bosnians in a just way.
It is so bad that they wish to appeal to the international court in The Hague based on crimes against cinematic logic.
However, the purpose of the film is, in fact, a deep human.
The film wants to condemn the fact that Karadzić and Mladić are even free, and stresses that the Americans and the French are not really concerned about pursuing them, because they have political arrangements between them.
Sometimes good and bad are so similar, so one comes to his head a very famous poem from Brecht.
In this poem it is a mask of an Asian demon: "In the big faces of his face, sharing his feelings with him, which is hard to be bad."
In movies like "The Hunting Party" there are also these demons, but they prove that hard is to be good.
The problem is not only in the nature of war movies in the Balkans.
A few years ago, a newspaper published that all the films about Iraq produced in Hollywood are fake.
It can also be added that there has never been a good film on South Africa.
Almost always has a rule: when a star is set by a crisis region or mine fields, then there is something like "Rangoon" with Patricia Arguette, "On the other hand of all borders" with Angelina Jolie or "Hungary Diamonds" with Leonardo DiCaprio.
Probably all these conflicts took place in a short space of time.
They have to spend at least ten years until Hollywood steals a good movie about the holocaust, having as an example the movie "The Schindler List".
Some movies need more time. Classics like the war works in Vietnam "The Deer Hunter", "Apocalypse Now" or "Full Metal Jackett" were not celebrated in their times as unanimity as the works of teachers.
Today we may be too confused about global conflicts, and that is why in our times every murder (Massenmord) is presented directly on two home televisions.
And that's because guided authors don't have the least repair (which is necessary for power) to tell good stories.
"Ser or not" or "The Grand dictator" came to an end so good, because Lubitsch and Chaplin still didn't know that the Nazi regime was really bad.
Maybe you shouldn't be a good person to round up a movie.
Maybe it should be like novelist Lawrence Norfolk, with his sarcastic look and away from an artist.
When they asked him about the parallelisms between his new "Limprière Dictionary" and the war in the Balkans, he said, "That only owes some things to never change."
Large cities will always be in danger, men will always be brutally killed, and in Yugoslavia the war will always prevail.
Von Beust receives the negative criticism of the Olympics.
The mayor of Hamburg received many political and economic criticisms not to apply for the Summer Olympics.
Many want to continue fighting competitions in the water sports section.
But Beust remembers that you have to be realistic when you consider the possibilities.
Hans-Joerg Schmidt-Trenz, director-general of the Hamburg Chamber of Commerce, expressed this rejection as "not good for economic location".
Last time, no other project in the big city had promoted as much motivation as the idea of the organization of the Olympic Games.
"Without this objective, political momentum could not be maintained, sports at the same level."
Schmidt-Trenz asked the Senate not to forget this project, but to find a long-term application "which refers to another time".
The Wednesday mayor Ole von Beust maintained his statements that the ambitions of Hamburg in the organisation of the Green Olympic Games would not be realized until at least 2028.
"Hamburg does not decide on the request for Olympic Games, but decides on the German Federation of Olympic Sports," says von Beaust at the WELT Online.
He referred to the decision of the Sportbund, which was expected at the beginning of December, on Munich's request for the 2028 Winter Olympic Games.
"This preference means for us that in this period of time, which we have thought to be up to 2028, from a realistic point of view, we will have no opportunity."
Despite everything, this dream didn't end forever, von Beust said.
The Hamburg Sports Federation (HSB) laments von Beut's statements.
This gives the impression that in the next 25 years Hamburg does not want to apply for Olympic Games.
"It's too soon to let go of the opportunity, if the plans are now broken," said Günter Ploß, the director of the HSB.
A rejection of the request was contrary to the statement made by the Senate chief in a reception due to the general meeting of the German Public Federation for the Sports of Higher Schools (ad).
There von Beust designed Hamburg's request for 2015 Universitys not as a "replacement" of the Olympics in Hamburg.
Only last week the High School Sports Federation appointed Hamburg as a candidate for the application.
The German Social-Democratic Party (SPD-Bürgerschaftsfraktion) spoke to the Senate that it did not take the time to build houses in Hamburg.
"For many years the Senate delayed the development of the small village of Grasbrook, because it was in plans for the Olympic Games or the construction of houses," said Carola Veit and Jan Quast, German social-democratic party members (SPD).
While the SPD always required an integrated planning of Olimpia for the small Grasbrook and then the use of built-in houses, the CDU stressed the importance of entertainment.
At that time, Hamburg's request for the 2012 Summer Olympics was very enthusiastic.
But Hamburg failed because of Leipzig.
They're not wooden boxes.
Whoever's related to the terms of Sweden and the box of wood, think about Ikea, but don't think about Andy Warhol.
Oh, yeah?
The wooden boxes currently produced in Sweden are like the shadow that weighs on the Warhol work list.
Most of the nine and four Brillo-Box "type" of this list are false.
After a few months the Swedish journal "Expressen" raised doubts about the authenticity of Brillo-Boxes of 1968 by Andy Warhol, the Moderna Museum of Stockholm carried out internal research and came to a disturbing conclusion: the six "Brillo-Boxes", which the former director of the Pontus Hultén museum gave to the Moderna Museum, are false, and almost one hundred others of the "Etocolmo" that are in circulation in the international art market, they also come.
Prehistoric history is too complicated with a confused relationship between artistic production and patterns.
In 1964 Warhol created his first "Brillo-Boxes" in New York, painted the red, blue and white wooden boxes, with the same pattern that had apple powders "Brillo".
According to Warhol, at the exhibition of his works in 1968 at the modern Museum of Museet, hundreds of Brillo-cajas of cardboard were exposed. These did not Warhol (because of expenses), but were brought directly from the "Brillo card factory".
It was not about works of art, but about copies (which were only some objects) exposed.
In the same year, 1968, Warhol allowed in Sweden to produce a brandy of wood, but were not exposed to the Modern Museum.
Witnesses from those times now talk about almost five boxes, which at that time entered the history of the art and the subasta as the originals of the "Brillo-Boxes" of the "Stocolmo" type authorized by Andy Warhol.
Some of them were purchased by more than $100,000.
The problem is that after the famous director of the museum Pontis Hultén made false statements that in 1968 in Sweden were produced and exposed almost a hundred of the wooden boxes that Warhol left.
But in fact, 105 boxes were produced in the same year in 1990 in Malmö for Hultén and for the exhibition in San Petersburg.
By this time Warhol had been dead for 3 years.
Lars Byström, the director of the Museum of Moderna Museet, invested six Brillo-Boxes property of the museum and also three of the Swedish private property that were manufactured in 1968 in Stockholm. They first printed and painted their precious plates and then painted them with the oil.
On the contrary, the structure of the copies of the 1990s shows that the painting was applied with a scroll without printing the printed plates directly. Furthermore, it is not about oil painting, but about acrylic painting.
"These boxes have not been authorised by the artist and must be removed from the official list of Andy Warhol Brillo Boxes," says Lars Nittve, director of the Modern Museum and adds that if the "Andy Warhol Art" Authentication Committee in New York will not reach any conclusion, the Modern Museum will classify these six boxes as copies/exposure objects".
Already in July The Commission for Authentication formally announced that it accepts these "hard charges" in which it deals with apple powder boxes.
But since then everything has remained in absolute silence.
The rebel soldiers are running in Manila.
In the Philippines, rebel soldiers who had been trapped in a hotel in Manila and had demanded the fall of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Capilla Antonio Trillanes, who protested to the president, corruption and electoral fraud, told a reporter that he could not answer for bloodshed.
The government's faithful soldiers had taken over the hotel using lacrimogen gas.
Almost two hundred soldiers had been trapped in the building for hours.
Almost half of them, including Trillans, had the Jewish judgment for attempting a state strike in 2003 that ended with a failure.
Take advantage of the negotiations, so that you can quickly deposit yourself with about 30 sympathetic people.
Apparently, the military police who had to monitor him had gone through their ranks and followed their lead.
They entered the hotel "Pennisula" and demanded the fall of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Government troops blocked the neighborhood around Hotel Noble.
The President called for an urgent meeting of the Security Cabinet.
Norberto Gonzales, National Security Adviser, condemned the conduct of soldiers.
"People are hot," said Trillanes.
"We call people to pass through our ranks."
General Danilo Lim, who had previously led the elite team Scout Reangers, said that within a short time the other military troops wanted to follow the course.
The high government critics called on Thursday to a great protest against the president.
For months his government has been receiving threats to corruption.
In 2003 the financial district in Manila was a place that attracted all attention to the word that was tried against Arroyo.
The rise failed after about 24 hours because the army wanted to participate.
Since 1986 there have been at least seven attempts of state attacks against the democratically elected government in the Philippines.
United Internet will be the largest shareholders of Versatel.
The United Internet provided more than 20 per cent of the shares of the Versatel telecommunications company.
The company reported that the average price for an action was 14,46 euros.
It has only 20.05 per cent of the social capital.
There were many speculations about company absorption.
There are also options for increasing the financial share in Versatel.
The United Internet reported that this step would speed up the consolidation of the German DSL market (Digital Subscriber Line).
The mercols had already made assumptions about entry into the business, after which the Brendenberg bank increased its participation in the Dusseldorf network operator by 5 per cent to 15.1 per cent.

In addition, companies started negotiations on trade cooperation in DSL products.
"Let's promote our collaboration," explained the United Internet portal.
The two companies founded a joint MSP company to acquire the Freenet competitor.
The United Internet youth reported that at the beginning, the two companies wanted to be happy with the participation of 10 percent in Freenet and did not exercise their right, i.e. they did 18.49 percent of Freenet.
This meant that both companies maintained all the options, especially the participation in Freenet anonymous society.
The negotiations between the United Internet and Freenet on a strategic partnership ended in mid-November.
This "game" with Freenet will last for many months and is not very understandable is part of the consolidation of the German Telecom market.
At the end of the third quarter, Freenet had 2.9 million customers with a mobile phone contract and 1.27 million with a DSL contract or a full contract.
So far the maintenance of the United Internet and Drillisch had directly 6.01 percent of Freenet's participation.
Then they had agreed that Drillitch would achieve the other four percent.
The right to purchase 18,49 per cent of Vatas investment company was already agreed in August.
