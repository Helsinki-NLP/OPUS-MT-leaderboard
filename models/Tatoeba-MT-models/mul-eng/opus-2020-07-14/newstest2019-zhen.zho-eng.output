According to the British media, U.S. Navy Vice-Malance Minister William Moland will say that even if the United States Navy is repressing its forces in order to respond to increasingly disturbing Russian borders, the United States continues to expand the Asia-Pacific region — a five-year-long stretch of the region, including the Indian-Asia-Pacific — as the focus of the Navy.
According to the British "Principal Prevention Week" website, on 24 September, the United States was listed as a strategic opponent in the new defence strategy published early in the year.
After that, the United States Navy restored the second fleet to fight Russia more directly.
It was reported that these movements raised some questions and concerns among allies and analysts, who feared that the U.S. Navy might be away from the "Associated" strategy of the Government of Obama.
But it will be said that the US Navy remains the focus of the West Pacific.
On 24 January 2018, at a round table hosted by the National Asian Research Agency in Washington, U.S.A., he said: " There has been no major change for us. "
Moran says: "The focus is still more balanced, focused, or whatever you want to describe it."
But he admits that the United States has a close relationship with Europe.
He said, " We will continue to care for the growth of the West Bank and balance what we can do."
Although Molan pointed out that the overall policy on Russia was within the mandate of the United States Minister for Defence, he warned: " Russians may face the challenges of population and economics, but history proves that if we face a conflict with them, they will be very strong. "
It will be said that as part of the re-operation between the United States against Russia, China and other competitors, the US Navy is moving towards deploying the forces as a " new mode of action " , which will help to prevent the enemy from deploying the United States fleet or other assets at any particular time and place.
He said: "Our Navy and the Marine Army support it — the concept of warfare that is unpredictable, not once again appearing in the same place, almost as it is now -- is our practice. "
It is reported that this new approach was first tried by the "Hari Duruman" team, which had been deployed early, including work visits to ports and patrols in the areas normally adopted.
Moran said that the U.S. Navy is currently working to ensure that its allies know that these ships will remain in traditional regional patrols and to address logistics and family contact issues for new deployment procedures.
The Australian Royal Navy Commander, Michael Noun, will also make a statement in this event that the Australian Army can cooperate with the American air force.
He said that the situation would continue as Australia's Royal Navy plans to repurchases 9 vessels equipped with the "Closs against" war systems.

From 29 to 30 September, the National Assembly held a close meeting of the Deputy Prime Minister in Beijing on the important thinkology seminar on strengthening and improving public political cooperation.
It is noted that since the 18th century of the Party ' s approach to the creation of a new approach to strengthening and improving public political cooperation, the first time that it was proposed that the People ' s Associations should be an important channel for socialist consultation and a specialized consultative body in democracy, an important part of the national governance system, a system with special arrangements for China, the first time to clarify the characteristics and advantages of the new system of political parties, the emphasis was placed on the right treatment of coherence and diversity, and the fact that the people's democracy was in the right context, and that the situation of the people was brought to public attention, and showed the rational connection between the rule of China and the political system of China, and that the development of good people's thinking was the latest results of the party ' s political context.
He stressed that the various levels of political alliances, in order to study the theory of learning as a machine, further explore the weaknesses and weaknesses of political cooperation and challenge their efforts in strengthening and improving their effectiveness.
In order to fully strengthen the construction of the parties to the political co-operation system, it is essential to ensure that central decision-making deployment of the Party is consistent with the political cooperation.
To strengthen the political leadership of thought and to improve the systems, procedures and mechanisms for the "both-to-development" of the capitalist and collective consensus, the implementation of the political leadership into all aspects and processes of the performance process.

On 5 November, the People ' s Network of Beijing (the King-in-law) began to focus more and more on patent research and related protection work, and to cover the potential value of patents, under the leadership of the market.
In the same way, a number of technical companies have experienced minor violations in terms of patent technology, such as patent technology use.
By the end of 2017, three persons were charged with a special violation of the rights of the seller to execute the "Science of the APP " Developers of the Beijing Small Scientific Technical Limited (hereinafter referred to as "Scientific Technology"), the Company of Operators (hereinafter "Scientific Deployed"), the Sales Company of the Gaspian Internet Information Services (hereinafter referred to as the Gaspian Pacific) against the Court of Public Knowledge.
Three prosecutors requested court orders that three accused cease immediately to produce, sell, sell and use the appellant's patent.
On 30 October 2018, the Chinese judicial instrument published " Professy, as well as a violation of the jurisdiction of a CPR " and disclosed some of the details of the case against the APP against CPR.
The three complainants considered that the whole operation process of "Roading " in the APP" in response to the technical programme for the protection of patents on the basis of the transfer of terminals and the method of "compulsory patents and discoverers" and "circuits" applied to "APP" was contrary to the technical programme for the protection of patents in the case.
However, during the court ' s decision, the microscientific authority found that the vast Pacific is not an appropriate accused, which only provides free-of-charge coverage of the APP " discharge" case on the network and does not implement the patent method of the case, without direct or indirect violations, and should not be listed as the accused in this case.
Second, this case is not in the East.
In accordance with the law, violations of the jurisdiction of the jurisdiction of the court should be conducted in a position to fully implement the jurisdictional procedure in question and therefore require the transfer of the case to the local court of the accused, namely the Beijing Court of Injury.
In the view of the Court of State Inquiry of the right to self-determination, the Court of Justice of the State of the District of the District of the District of the District of the District of the Territory considers that the alleged APP products have been placed on its network platform and that the accused would not be inappropriate for the District of the Territory to be accused.
It is also reported that the Pacific area is located in the city of Galway, which is within the jurisdiction of the Court of the Jurisdiction of the State.
The complainant ' s claim to transfer the case to the Beijing court of intellectual property rights and, on the basis of insufficient grounds, withdraws the objection made by the small technical limited company of the accused to the jurisdiction of the case and assumes the cost of acceptance of jurisdictional objections.
Other proceedings in the case have not yet been made available, and the journalists will also pay close attention to the follow-up details of the case against the patent violations.
Advised Chief Executive Officer of the Australian Federal Science and Industrial Research Organization: The results of technical cooperation between Australia are outstanding
" The scientific technology in China has developed rapidly over the past decades, and both countries in Australia are involved in scientific fields and can achieve successful results. "
In the welcome of new social journalists in Beijing, the Chief Executive Executive Officer of the Australian Federation for Science and Industrial Research said that cooperation in the field of technology in the field of technology in Australia was a major challenge from the response to climate change to the "air" project.
As the largest national research institution in the Australian Federation, CSIRO has achieved many innovative research results in the field of oceans, energy, biological, material and astronomy.
CSIRO has maintained close cooperation with scientific institutions such as the Institute for Science in China.
"This is a lasting friendship, which includes the tradition of trust and long-term cooperation with partners."
In May this year, China's 500-millimeter ball-ray radio remotes -- " China's Sun Eye " installed an international 19-Bobbon L-point receiver.
It is currently the most advanced 19 ballistics source receiver in the international, jointly developed by Middle Australian scientists.
Marshall indicated that the successful development of the reception machine was based on a technology pool based on CSIRO for more than a year and that the FAST circuit speed would be 5 to 6 times higher, while further scientific observation objectives would be extended.
"This is a force that CSIRO contributes to FAST."
In addition to the above-mentioned cooperation, CSIRO has close cooperation with the Chinese Institute for Science and Technology to develop new types of fuel technologies, such as the construction of radio spectrum in square kilometres.
" Previous scientific research has often been focused on issues that have been over a century ago, and that requires more scientific research to address the issues ahead. "
Marshall believes that the two countries in Australia have complementaryness in the field of scientific development, while both countries face a number of challenges in development.
For example, extreme weather on global radio, droughts and floods have caused food shortages, and food shortages have seriously affected human development.
At the same time, population explosions, ageing, and chronic diseases are also a serious challenge.
" The cooperation between the two countries in Australia has been mainly focused on solving these problems. "
The Marshall report states that CSIRO's International Centre for South-South-South Marine Research, which is co-founded with the National Laboratory for Marine Science and Technology, focused on observing the phenomenon of El Nino and Ranina, studying the relationship between the two of them with extreme weather, and establishing an early warning facility for extreme weather; and that the new species of forests developed together with the CSIRO can also be addressed by food shortages resulting from extreme weather.
" In the current environment, technological innovation is difficult to complete alone, needs a high cost, and is very much in the way of solutions, so cooperation is particularly important today. "
Marshall indicated that the more close cooperation is possible to achieve disastrous progress, which is also the meaning of strengthening cooperation between the two sides of Australia under the "one-way" framework.
" Strengthening bilateral cooperation is primarily scientific cooperation for us. "
For example, in the case of Marshall, CSIRO has recently issued a gold mining law that does not use mercury, which is very dangerous to the environment, and many countries wish to find a method of gold mining for the environment.
"We are willing to introduce this technology to China, which is one of the results we have been involved in "co-operation with one another."
On 29 March 2018, the Co-operation Conference on the Travel of Baby and Vegetables, which was held in the city of Urumazi, New York, was also appreciated as a result of the development of the baby.

The Democratic People ' s Republic of Korea indicated to the United Nations that sanctions continued to be imposed on the United States on the United States by increasing its distrust of the United States and that it was not possible for Korea to release nuclear weapons individually in such a situation.
At the United Nations General Assembly, Lebanon stated that Korea had adopted " very friendly practices " last year, including the cessation of missiles and nuclear tests, the elimination of nuclear testing sites, and the commitment not to proliferation of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"But we didn't see any corresponding response from the United States," he said.
" If we don't trust the United States, we don't trust our national security, and in such a case, we can't give up weapons individually. "
Although the League is a renegade complaint against the United States against the "substantial phase" of nuclearization, his speech is important because it is not exactly as it was before.
He referred to the joint statement made on 12 June by Kiyenne and Trannon, at the time he agreed to the efforts of the Korean peninsula to modernize, and the Tranpeg was committed to protecting the security of Korea.
Korea has been seeking a formal end to the Korean war of 1950-53, but the United States stated that it had to give up nuclear weapons first.
The United States also rejects the request for the release of international sanctions against Korea.
" The United States insists on ' pre-nuclearization ' , and increases the pressure of sanctions to achieve the objective of high-pressure, even refusing to declare 'the end of the war ' , " .
"The idea that sanctions can make us desperate is that we don't know who our people are doing the white-day dream.
But the problem is this constant punishment is deepening our distrust."
He did not mention the United States President's second destination plan mentioned earlier this week in the United Nations.
On the contrary, he stressed the three-month meeting of the Presidents of China and the Korean Presidency, and said: " If the other party that has been nuclearized is Korea rather than Korea, then the Korean peninsula will not become such an obstacle. "
China declared that from 1 November 2018 it had reduced import tariffs for 1585 tax purposes.
Since this year, China has been linked to a reduction in import tariffs.
This year's comprehensive reduction in the import duties for all common medicinal products, including anti-cancer drugs and anti-cancer biodegradable medicinal products, will be zero for the import of 28 import duties, including 28 import duties, in actual imports.
At the same time, there has been a significant decrease in the production of anti-cancer drugs and an increase in import value tax.
On 1 July, 218 vehicles and spare parts were taxed.
After the reduction, the total rate of vehicles in China has been lower than the average level of developing countries and is in line with the practice of the Chinese car industry.
This reduction will promote industrial structural adjustment and resource optimisation, speeding up surpluses, contributing to the quality of products and services, and is expected to increase the price of cars to a certain extent and make consumers more effective.
Consumer taxes are taxed on 1 July for 1449 purposes.
Daily consumption taxes are linked to the need for rest for a good life for the people.
This reduction is not limited to more and more than 56 per cent of the average tax rate.
Daily consumption tax reductions directly benefit large consumers and promote greater competitiveness in the domestic industry.
On 1 November, there will be a reduction in the taxation of electrical equipment for 1585 purposes and industrial products, such as spare parts and raw materials.
The appropriate reduction in import tariffs for domestically needed industrial products can attract more external funding, benefiting from increased effective domestic supply, support for industrial growth, while contributing to the global resource allocation of enterprises, reduction of production costs, and reduction of the pressure on the domestic environment.
The presentation by the Office of the Committee on Customs Tax Regulations of the State of China, more than four voluntary reductions, and the third phase of the extension of the outcome of the negotiations under the ICT agreement on 1 July this year, would reduce China ' s overall rate from 9.8% of last year ' s level of tariff to 7.5 per cent.
The overall level of adjusted tariffs is slightly higher than the EU, less than most developing countries, at the medium-term low level, compared with the situation and development phase of developing countries in China.
It was suggested that the overall level of tariff should be adapted to the economic development phase of China as an important indicator of the openness of China ' s trade in goods.
China ' s first global trade in goods has already had an additional open economic base, but there is a gap between the quality and benefits of trade development and the developed economies, and it is therefore appropriate to reduce the overall level of tariff.
The tariffs are a common means of protection, and the level of tariff should be adapted to industrial competitiveness, encouraging good competition, protecting too much against industrial development and improving quality.
The adjustment of the rate of duty should be accompanied by the demand for production and the demand for consumption.
The focus is on reducing domestic demand, contributing to the increase in commodity rates in industrial transition, an effort to increase imports of special advantage products that are more focused on population needs, increasing enterprise and public awareness and meeting the increasing needs of industrial structures and consumer structures.
The reduction of tax forces should be combined with the capacity of financial income and industrial development.
In the choice of specific reduction of tax goods and reduction rates, two markets in the country must be integrated, two sides of the journey, produce and consume two relationships, and maintain a positive trend towards economic stability in China.
The Head stressed that this year was the 40th anniversary of the open-ended reform, and China's initiative to reduce the overall level of import tariffs was an important initiative in China's own capacity for achieving high-quality development, contributing to the integrated use of two external resources in international countries, contributing to the improvement of domestic quality for the quality of the system and meeting the needs of the peoples.
This action and initiative indicated that China would firmly refrain from moving into an open strategy for mutual benefit, firmly supporting economic globalization, firmly upholding the principles of free trade and the WTO's core multilateral trading system, and continue to draw development strength from the openness of the world, as well as making China's development more beneficial to the world.
Serbia announces its entry into the state of the highest war, and the President of Serbia will discuss the situation in Kosovo tomorrow.
The South American Society drew up information from the Office of the President of Serbia that, in view of the occupation of Kosovo's forces in the direction of the Gaza Strip, controlled by Belgrade, the Gulf of Serbia, had led the country's armed forces into the highest military situation.
On 29 September, the Minister for Defence of Serbia, William, declared that the Serbian army had entered the full state of war.
Bahrain stressed that Serbia would continue to monitor the current situation in Kosovo as long as the orders issued by the U.S. Army remained valid, regardless of the direction towards development.
According to the Russian Federation, on 29 September, Vuchić indicated that he had been informed of the current situation with all parties, such as the US, and was going to meet with President Putin on 2 October in Moscow and Russia to seek his support on the Kosovo issue.
When it was asked whether Serbia needed Russian military support like Syria, U.S. military response was denied: " I do not want a major military conflict on our territory. "
Vuchić also pointed out that Serbia's entry into full combat is not only a threat to prevent conflict, but it is also a clear warning that no violence will ever be tolerated in Kosovo.
As a result of the expansion of the state of war, the two major initiatives in Kosovo are linked.
In line with Serbia's claim, the Albanians have recently been in large-scale detention of Serbs living in the region of northern Kosovo, and these Serbs who have been arrested have not violated any law.
In his statement, Mr. Maco Yurich, head of the Kosovo and Metohi Office of the Government of Serbia, on 26 March this year, has been attacked and arrested by the Kosovo Army and arrested by the Albanians and has continued to grow in the region and have been subjected to unhindered arrest and expulsion from Serbs.
In addition, more than 100 armed police and shooters, including the armed forces of the Ministry of the Interior of the Republic of Kosovo, once declared themselves, occupying their positions near the Gaza Strip, entering the ecological and sport centre near the northern coast of Kosovo, and blocked all roads, which were already controlled by Serbia.
Vuchić noted that this military venture in Kosovo had been carried out under the auspices of the West Bank and that the initiative of the Kosovo Army had not previously informed Serbia of the violation of section IX of the Brussels Agreement and of the military technical agreement between the United Nations Council in its resolution 1244 and Seko.
Vuchrich has called on the Secretary-General of NATO to criticize the false statements by Western countries on the Kosovo issue.
The root causes of the conflict remain the roots of the hundreds of years between the Separatists of the region of Kosovo.
With regard to Kosovo ' s membership, Serbs and Albanians have various statements.
Serbia's vision of Kosovo is the source of the spread and cultural turmoil of the people, as Serbia has established its most powerful country here in the 12th century, and the Albanians have only had a large number of invasions since the invasion of the Ottoman Empire and the return of the Serbs to the north.
The Albanians maintained that the Ilyrians of the former 4-5th century lived in Kosovo, and thus had been the territory of the Arab people since then.
The main political division has led to a strong conflict between different peoples, religious and cultural, and a strong opposition between Serbs and Albanians in the Kosovo region.
In 1912, Kosovo Albanians first declared Albania ' s independence.
After the first world war, a large number of Albanians living on the Balkan Peninsula moved to Turkey, with Serbs rising relatively high, and the Serbs seemed to be “only taking back their land” but were regarded by the Albanians as the genocide of "Great Serbism", both of which had been inspired.
Kosovo has become a " fireball " in the Balkans.
In 1999, the Albanian separatists of the Kosovo Liberation Army and the Serbian Army and the police had a armed conflict that led to the bombing of the South Union, consisting of Serbia and Montenegro, and the Kosovo War broke out.
On 17 February 2008, Kosovo unilaterally declared independence from Serbia.
Although the information was subsequently sent out to Serbia to normalize its relationship with Kosovo and to sign a global and legally binding agreement, it was not possible to sign a multi-party agreement in the United States of America because of the hatred and political turmoil of the historical peoples.
However, one month earlier, Vuchić had made it clear that the Serbs had been separated from the Albanians in Kosovo and had reopened the opposition of the two tribes.
The power supply is still shut down.
According to the figures published by UNAMI on Friday, 30th day, a severe earthquake and tsunami in the village of Sulawiski, in the country, resulted in 420 deaths.
William Rampanilei, head of the Indonesia disaster relief department, said that the figure was only the initial statistics of the city of Chipalu in Central Sulawesi, about 80 km in the middle of the disaster, because of the lack of large search engines, many of which had been damaged by the hotel, the market, and the warehouses had not yet been searched for.
On 29 September 2018, the local time was in the Indonesian Baroque, a series of devastating earthquakes and tsunamis.
The heavy destruction of electricity and communications facilities continues to be the unconnected " island " , the number of people who are unable to statistics.
Meanwhile, the media reported that the Vice-President of Indonesia called the number of deaths or thousands.
Power cuts, communication breaks, road stops, airport is damaged... and the rescue work after the sea is hard.
Because of the power cut, some hospitals and relief stations in Palu needed fuel.
The road into the city, however, was blocked by mountain skiing, which could not have access to large vehicles, including oil cars, causing the supply of fuel to be very tense.
The Ministry of Social Affairs of Indonesia stated that, because of the damage to road, the Department had not yet delivered emergency relief funds to areas such as emergency relief supplies, such as beds, blankets, clothing, food and household supplies, from the neighboring South-Surewiski and Colombo.
The rescue material transported from Jakarta, the capital, is being transported through the air carrier to the disaster area.
In view of the damage suffered by the Palu airport command station and the roads in the disaster, all commercial flights have been stopped in order to ensure safety and security, and only military aircraft for the transport of relief materials and personnel have been dropped.
In the Indian policy for disaster relief, Vilanto, the Deputy Minister for Legal and Security Affairs, called for the rapid recovery of power supply and airport business services to ensure that relief agencies, such as the hospital, move to more relief personnel and volunteers, enable relief funds to be made available to disaster areas.
On 28 January, a number of violent earthquakes continued in the province of Sulawiski, Indonesia, and the 7.7 earthquake that occurred on 1702 at the local level, causing serious disasters in the city of Palu, Nicaragua, and in the western part of the country.
On October 1st, the New Beijing Society released its air-conditioning, air-conditioning, air-conditioning, air-conditioning... ... in the near future, Beijing continued to launch the most beautiful blue model of the world, bringing thousands of Chinese citizens to the social platform to enjoy their joy in the ongoing mourning, "under the white sky, the 'Witness' of the Americas, this is the best list of Beijing's " .
Since August, Beijing has come to "the blueest sky " .
In Kyiv, you can always see the people or have a smart phone, or take a single photo of the camera.
Mybo, on a social platform such as the micro-friends' circle, there is a different beauty in the eyes of my friends' heads, the gates, the birds, and the hooves... and all the buildings in the blue sky.
A friend of the Internet said that such a "birth of wind" was the best city advertising film in Beijing; and a friend added that if such a blue sky was long-distanced, people would be better off; more friends would hope that "the blues would be more colder in the winter and make the city's sun bright " .
For the people of Beijing, it's a blue day?
Only since people in this city have been suffering from the cold weather of the past, as well as from the blue sky, and in Beijing called for " Blue War, " the air quality has changed, the blue sky has increased, and the people have seen joy in their eyes, and the happiness they have gained is also a large part of it.
It's New Year's Day, Beijing.
At 8:00 a.m., most of the 35 air quality monitoring stations in the entire city showed the green of the "levels".
The theme "The Bluest Sky" on the social platform is still ongoing.
Why is it so blue in Beijing recently?
According to the relevant authority of the Beijing Environmental Protection Agency, this year, Beijing's average area of particle matter (PM2.5) is 35 km/h, with a record of its best record for almost five years.
The PM2.5 actually exceeds the current number of positions in September.
One of the major factors of the "Blue Sky" is the overall benefit of the weather conditions for the near-term period, and more importantly, that Beijing maintains a climate pollution control, and that it has been strongly promoted for almost five years to promote the clean air action plan, which has continued to reduce environmental benefits and reduce the total emissions of pollutants in the region, which have laid the foundation for continued improvement of air quality.
Beijing was officially published and implemented in 2013 " Plan of Action for the Clean Air of Beijing 2013-2017 " .
According to the plan, the official continued to guide non-primary functions to promote energy clean-up alternatives and pollution reduction, totalling 4923 fire extinguishers.
Beijing is also the first major city in China to achieve global naturalisation.
Data show that from 2013 to 2017, Beijing's PM2.5 average annual volume decreases by 35.6 per cent; air quality indicators increased by 50 days; levels of excellence increased by 25 days; the number of recontamination dates decreased by 35 days and the frequency of recontamination clearly decreased.
While continuing to improve air quality, Beijing officials launched a three-year plan of action in September on " To Win the Blue War in Beijing " , focusing on the current governance phase and pollution characteristics, collecting fuel vehicles, munitions, operating organic governance, optimisation of transport structures, industrial structures, energy structures and land use structures, strengthening regional defence units, strengthening the urban precision management, promoting overall green development, making it " the most permanent " city of Beijing " , not " in value " , but not in the context of the population.
During this year's Golden Week, the City Tourism Commission, Business, Urban Affairs and Public Security will strengthen the law enforcement checks on "one day" markets, collect "six" distortions, and verify that violators will be severely punished in accordance with the law.
Last morning, the municipal government convened a series of "a day" thematic events to be deployed to further a "a day" of illegal action.
The "six" riots involving the interconnected blacks, blacks, blacks, blacks, blacks, blacks, blacks, blacks, blacks, the "six" riots, the city launched a campaign on 28 July on a very illegal day."
The mission has been carried out to date, with 39 complaints of "a day" of acceptance throughout the city, 63 per cent of them; since this year, 270 complaints of " a day" and 62 per cent of them.
For nearly two months, the entire city has been in the "Black Car" 248, the "Court" has been under attack by 158 tourists, the closure of the shop "black" and 29 houses in the theater, the "13s " , 27 people " , the arrest of illegal advertising .6 million . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
By the end of the regime, illegal "a day" is basically controlled by "a day" and "a day" market ordering a stable situation.
It was suggested that in recent years this city has been increasing its efforts to eradicate illegal "one day".
In 2016 and 2017, the City Tourism Commission accepted 1612 and 897 complaints, with 79 per cent and 44 per cent respectively, but the illegal "one-day" continues to fight, and it has become a regular counter-attack, black-rolling, black-cold, black-collar, black-net and black-lined "six" contradictions.
In particular, street illegal passengers such as " black ticket " , the illegal website of false travel information , the " black network " , the travel agency or the private body of non-road travel companies or the " black business " , the " black market " undirectional travel certificate or the " black market " travel of illegal travel agents , the " black market " , the vehicles of which they use non-road travel services , or the " black car " , which provides passenger transport services for a " illegal " day " , and finally they bring to the destination of the " black shop " , the " black shop " .
In this dedicated action, the city continued to increase its regular inspection and mobile monitoring of illegal "a day" and to the high-end and impact of the "a day" travel route to the illegal "a day" and to send the relevant sector to the group on a daily mission to find evidence of violations of law.
Among them, the "Black Car" and "Black Hotel" are two major focusses on the specific actions.
It was suggested that without a black car, it would not be possible to perform an illegal "a day's journey" and that the black car would be easily detected, remembered and inspected, as well as a single high-value fixed asset.
The relevant sector uses road traffic surveillance to increase the control of the " one day" road tour bus focusing on the " one-day " road transport, using techniques such as defence and technical wisdom, as well as the discovery of " black car " .
The "black shop" is also a major focus because of the limited number of travel, the operation of the premises.
In order to strengthen the tension and combating force of illegal "a day" and to investigate violations of the law in the specialized actions, the functions sectors are subject to severe punishment under law.
In August this year, this city also held a seminar on legal issues related to the illegal "a day" and discussed measures associated with administrative sanctions and criminal offences.
The City Tourism Commission stated that in the future it would encourage more formal travel companies to carry out the "one-day " , one-day" tour in Beijing, with a view to further occupying the living space of the illegal " one-day" journey, and the current specific programmes were also in research.
In addition, the City Tourism Commission has continued to improve its electronic processes information system to ensure that each team is integrated into the electronic processes platform.
From a tourist sign to a digital economic sign, what have these years experienced?
As the permanent address of the World Conference on Internet, Uuu is concerned about how to respond to the Red Cross.
From the beginning of the first World Internet Conference, over five years, the change in Uu has been a common sight.
In 2014, the entire city and digital economy had only 12 Internet-related enterprises, up to the third quarter of this year, more than 500.
This is a summary of the Ubun's digital economy.
The call of the Internet conference to enable local enterprises to accept the digital economy, digitally digitalized innovations, a strong desire for enterprise transition growth, an increased investment and development of traditional manufacturing enterprises in the field of machine exchanges, wisdom management, etc.
The U.S. C.E. recalled that the future of U.E. would form a new economic energy centre.
The development of the digital economy does not leave the support of infrastructure.
This year, Udun launched 5G pilot work on the basis of the full coverage of 4G communications networks and free Wi-Fi.
At the same time, urban urban areas in Utah became the hot spot for the development of the Internet industry as the first country to build the Internet data channel for the first time.
Since the first World Internet Conference, there has been a total of 565 digital economy projects, totalling $377.25 million, reaching the total economic core manufacturing value of 87.3 million in the three-week period preceding this year, with an increase of 13 per cent.
"It was a tourist symbol, and then it was more dramatic and cultural, because the Internet Conference, it now became an Internet and digital economic symbol. "
The city council recalled that the Red Cross of the World Inter-Internet Conference had been set up in time and therefore needed to build a platform to accommodate all parties, project and technical inputs.
For 20 years, rural people have been working abroad and have returned to rural business because of their close association with the Internet Conference.
On 2 December last, he had a high-powered digital technology-reduction solution, and had attended the fourth Internet-based lighting show, which was hosted by several clients.
"In Udun, it's easier than I thought, and our application is slow, and Udun's smart car stop project has our application."
One way in Udun, the Internet Conference had a devastating impact.
It is not just a tourist sight, it's a one-way industry.
In order to rely on it, the U.S. Section was born to create a collection area.
Journalists are aware that in the future, Ubun will be the leading position in the development of rural agriculture, with a high level of application of sound medicine, wise ageing, and the results of intelligent governance, which will include the total GDP80 per cent of the population and many high-level people in the city.
Indonesia's violent waves have made it difficult for at least 410 people to escape.
According to the Director-General of the Public Information Office of the Police of Indonesia at night, the earthquake in the province of Sulawesi has now resulted in 410 deaths, of which 97 were confirmed.
Another 29 missing, 540 injured.
The Palu airport is still closed.
Active treatment, China's 29 weeks and earlier child survival rate reached 98 per cent, reaching the level of developed countries.
The National Children's Medical Centre, which opened 30 September at the University of Rehabilitation on 30 September, introduced Canada's advanced approach to the project in the lead "Protection of Early Child Care in China's NICU House".
The results of the project show that, as an active treatment, China ' s 29- and earlier child survival rate has reached 98 per cent and has reached the level of developed countries, but there is still a greater improvement in the survival rate of early childhood and early childhood.
For almost 20 years, the Chinese Government has been paying attention to the salvation of new children.
At present, infant mortality in the above-sea area is reduced to 3.71 ng, which is clearly lower than the national average, reaching the advanced level of developed countries.
The four-year non-permanent efforts to improve the quality of early birth in China's NICU hospital have significantly increased the quality of early birth.
The Director-General of the NICU Hospital for Rehabilitation of Newborn Children (NICU) told the journalists that while raising the rate of early childhood survival, attention should be paid to reducing the quality of early childhood survival, reducing the incidence of early childhood mortality, improving the overall endpoint of early development, improving the overall quality of early childhood survival and the quality of the population, which is an important issue of the internal and internal reproductive care of the newborn sector, and also the key issue of the project's attention.
In its four-year work on improving the quality of early births in China, NICU, the national census of the number of births 33 weeks and the following early births, has reduced the mortality rate of early births of small children and small births, while the incidence of early births has significantly decreased and increased the quality of life of early births.
The project, through the establishment of a national network for improving the quality of new births, introduces the concept of the quality of co-operation, the launch of a 25-house collaboration hospital throughout China, the establishment of a set of arrangements for improving the compatibility of domestic affairs with early births, the improvement of the full level of new birth healing, the system and the effective means of improving the quality of cooperation.
According to the project's accumulated experience, a new child-retirement guide is being developed to provide guidance and guidance on normal treatment for new births in China.
It is understood that in the project "Probation of early births in China ", the Child Hospital introduced EPIQ into the 19 provinces of the country by 25 major NICUs to address the problem of early childhood infection in the new child care room in China.
Over the past 10 years, Canada's national early childhood unemployment rate has increased by approximately 1/3, and Canada is now one of the best countries in the world's early childhood.
The EPIQ approach is now applicable to all NICUs in Canada and is adopted by six countries.
In the case of children's hospitals, the results show that after EPIQ intervention in two years, early childhood infections decreased by 35 per cent, while vaccinated use rates decreased by 20 per cent.
In the future, the University of Rehabilitated Child Hospital will continue to extend and implement this approach to the national level, with a view to a comprehensive reduction in all early births and the occurrence of diseases and improving the quality of the care of the new national child.
At the same time, there was a difference in the level of treatment in the Chinese regions, and inequity was indisputable.
According to Professor Wyoming, as an important construction unit of the National Children ' s Medical Centre, the Children ' s Hospital will play a leadership role, covering several western provinces such as New Zealand, China, Ghana, and the West, with a view to gradually promoting the harmonization and normalization of new child care throughout the country.
It is understood that the University of Rehabilitation-based Child Health Hospital is developing a new National Child Science Unit based on the project's accumulated experience and the development of a new birth-infection guide to provide guidance and guidance for standard treatment for new births in China.
It was discovered that in 2019, the focal point, located on the Chinese network of new-born children at the University of Rehabilitation, took the next phase of the 63 National Hospital to improve national quality in order to promote the sustainable development of the level of new-born child care in China.
The Director-General for Marine Health expressed surprise that the sea could become the central city of Central Asia, not only of the current research, but also of the construction of the same system of services, and that the quality and performance of services should be shared in Asia, thereby truly reflecting the health level of China.
Sinhala: "Hero's memorial in the heart" - written on the fifth day of the festival.
On 30 September, at the age of 69, we arrived on the fifth day of the solemn anniversary of the Republic of Warsaw, with the arrival of the parties to the Day of Peace and the national leaders to attend the celebration of the celebration of the Lord's Evening Meal for the people.
Now, no matter where you are, I'm very grateful to you.
The Memorial Day is warm, more wake-up.
It's a long history, after every great man's name, that's a good life.
They also have hot youth, true love and close family.
However, because they firmly believe that "the truth of our faith is the truth of the universe " , so as to avoid " the suffering of the next generation " , they are willing to sacrifice everything for themselves.
"I'll live one day and cry for China one day."
Through the air, the British set up a mental signal leading to the course of action.
"Where did you come from, go to " what kind of person " , read English, you don't have to answer.
The most important thing is to build a "Hero Memorial" in the heart.
According to incomplete statistics, since the era of the Revolutionary War, there have been some 200,000 powerful men who have been independent of the peoples, free peoples, and the country has been very courageous.
For various reasons, many are too early even to leave their names.
A number of powerful souls with the idea of blood transfusions, the practice of living faith, the memory of their ancestors, the transfer of their souls, the source and soul of the peoples.
This "Hero's Memorial " does not allow any damage and damage.
For a while, history has been out of the question, and it's been a mystery, and it's been a long time since.
A variety of confusion of history, a violation of a strong practice, a challenge to the knowledge of justice, a misjudged value, and a threat to the public and the security of the whole society.
The hero can't forget.
The conduct of the approach to the bottom line, which cannot be heard, must be braved by the sword, to protect the dignity of the rule of law.
On 1 May this year, a hero protected the law officially.
From the practice of justice, the judgements of some cases are very rapid, as well as the effective preservation of the image of the Great Light, and the release of the hero from the worship and respect for the ultimate good power of the case.
A nation that has pursued can't have a hero, a nation that has an idea can't have an advance.
First of all, call the hero, it has become a universal social consensus.
At present, there are millions of national memorial facilities in the country, and more than a billion people visit the Great Lakes every year.
The heart is the strongest stone.
Let the hero, the hero, the hero, learn the hero, love the hero and become the wind, join the hero in the blood of the people, and a "hero-memor" will stand in the midst of the earth, and people will be in the heart.
On 28 September, Ruth Brussel - in Italy's view of the EU's request that the large budget deficit plan give rise to market frustration, the EU take a non-compulsory position on Italy on Friday, but if Italy holds too high goals, the EU may take a more exciting position.
The Italian Government ' s claim was that budget deficits were 2.4 per cent compared to GDP for the next three years, which indicated that there was no debt reduction in the face of a reduction in the deficit.
" We are not interested in the crisis between the Commission and Italy, " because the EU's recommendations and sanctions may have no impact on Italy, he has responded cautiously.
EU officials and diplomats still wish to submit formal submissions to the EU Commission in October, and market forces will be able to convince Italy to adjust its budget plan.
After the Government announced its plan, the euro had reached a minimum of five to two weeks and the Italian debt rate had reached a maximum of three weeks.
If the deficit targets remain unchanged before the end of October, the Commission may reject the draft budget of Italy, which the Commission has never done to any State.
At a meeting of the Vice-President of the European Commission, in the capital city of Latvia, at a meeting of the President of the Eastern European Commission, Blovsky, he said that the current financial plan of Italy " seems to be incompatible with the Stability and Growth Convention " , which he referred to as the financial provisions of the EU.
But he didn't say what it would cause the EU to react.
The tenderer may submit an application for participation in this open tender by 26 October this year.
Previously, the Ministry of Agriculture had set China one of the priorities for exports of Russian agricultural products.
The Russian Agricultural Supervisory Board announced in May that this agricultural year in Russia was the first time over 1 million tons of food exports to the U.S.
The Board predicts that China may enter the ranks of the former 10 Russian Food Importers.
On September 30th, after the first battle of Cuba, China's women won 30 days of fighting with the Turkish team and won two World Cup games in 2018.
However, it is more likely that China's women would be excluded from this role than the Prime Minister.
There were 24 women's births in 2018, and Chinese women's ranks were organized with Italy, Turkey, Bulgaria, Canada and Cuba in Group B.
From the world-class and global strength of Group B, Turkey and Italy are the main opponents of China.
After the day-to-day match, the Chinese team was faster able to enter the situation, to get the lead, to maintain the advantage, and to give small pressure to the opponents on the ball and the cable network, at 25:18 to take the lead in a more comfortable manner.
The second head of the Turkish team, which entered the station, was very violent and had reached 6.2 leading positions, and the Chinese team had requested that the bridge be temporarily adjusted to 7 levels, followed by seven more rounds, and that the final Turkish team was to be divided into 15.19; the Chinese forces were to be divided into two seconds after 24:20 positions; and the Chinese forces were to be reimbursed, after which the Chinese team was to be reimbursed, and the Chinese team had to reimburse the lead to the second station, with 25:23 below.
The situation in the third case is very complex and the two sides are divided by an increase of 19 degrees.
At a critical time, the Turkish forces had failed, followed by 21:19 in advance, and the Chinese forces had taken the heavy killings and the usual assaults at 24:21; then the Turkish forces would be divided by 23:24, and the Chinese forces would be stopped, and the Chinese forces would have a common attack, and the Chinese forces would have a 25:23 lockdown.
China's women's coaches are saying that the whole game is not easy.
"We're ready to get better, we're good, we're better than Turkish troops, we're going to have to reduce mistakes, we're trying to win through our own initiative."
In the face of well-known former team members, the forces of the Turkish Wakifer Bank had been severely restricted in the first stage of the match, and then she had begun to seek a change and took a strong step along with the old one.
"and each other very well-known, it's normal, but the Chinese team is very successful, and it's good to have a network and an attack in the event of an inconsistency."
Next, the Chinese women's ranks will be held in one day for physical and technical training; the third group will be hosted by the Canadian team on 2 October.
On 30 September, 30 September, the new river basins were held in the second half-year-long project focusing on the year 2018.

New Zealand is China's most important breeding area, and according to the National Statistical Office, the growth rate is 35 million tonnes in 2017, representing 61 per cent of the national crop range.
Since the introduction of land in China in 1982, over 5 million tons of agricultural crops have been collected in the new part of the country and some 300,000 tons of land have been used annually.
Of these, the forest coverage rate reached 100%, and the forest coverage accounted for about 60% of the new land use.
With no copper, the product can reach a total of 320 kilograms to 350 kilograms.
As the increase in the level of new land-based inputs has increased, the decline in the rate of recovery remains low, the gradual increase in land-based residues and a series of problems, such as the destruction of soil structures, have a serious impact on sustainable agricultural development.
Depletion not only causes severe contamination of soils but also has a significant impact on the quality of the flowering plant.
At present, over one third of the new country's micro-organisms have been obtained.
In 2017, about 14 million tons of new machinery were collected.
In the process of the acquisition of the machinery, large amounts of soil entered into the soil, the fractures on the soil, the complex particles in the soil are difficult to clear during the process of the processing of the dust, and the quality of the raw material cannot be fully cleared in the process of subsequent processing of the evaporation.
On 28 September, the national free-of-charge osmosis seminar on exchanges was held in New Zealand.
In an effort to solve the pollution of the soil, simplify the plant technology, improve the effectiveness of the soil, and carry out an eight-year-old team of plants, implement "Mami 619" without soil technology, adding "to the green growth of New Zealand's agriculture " .
The tree has been described in detail by developing new ways of innovation, developing early growth, slowing down, slowing down, and producing new landfilling products " 619 " .
" ‘Medieval 619’ has achieved a series of package measures, such as non-smokers, adhesion, a series of non-smokers, adhesion, adhesion of rigid selections, rational chemical control. "
At present, Aksu, Kurler, Aaral, has established a sample base that is free of charge, up to 4,800 pounds per kilogram.
Uncooked flowering has been achieved by the production, distribution, environmental protection, and overall improvement.
The third agricultural artist of the Agricultural Section of the New Zealand Development Mission said that the total yield of the raw materials could reach 320 kg to 350 kg and possibly even higher.
"The expansion of the no-cracking technology is a great prospect."
It is believed that, at present, non-ferrous farming technologies can address the problem of land-based pollution, but there is a gap in economic growth compared with current economic benefits.
"The maintenance of the harvest price will benefit the future expansion. "
He and his team will continue to carry out in-depth research and extensive promotional applications for non-emergency, and to make the uncumbered industry strong and fully resolved soil pollution.

Mr. Zhao said: "We're going to challenge ourselves and see if we can complete the 50-km port route!"

Under the additional arrangements published on a week-old trade agreement, the new United States-Mexico-Canada Trade Agreement will retain the ability of President Tranton to implement 25 per cent of the import-to-tax threat, while at the same time exempting duty-free vehicles from imports from Canada and Mexico.
If Trannon is known for national security reasons to collect the so-called "232" tariffs for cars, Mexico and Canada will have an annual quota of $26.6 million for the export tax to the United States of America.
Pika produced in two countries will be fully exempt from tariff exemptions in accordance with the subsidiary arrangements.

Both quotas are far higher than existing production levels in the two countries, providing growth space for both exports.

Despite the lack of details, the apparent progress mentioned above has been sufficient to move Mexico and the Government of the United States to immediately stop the publication of the text of the Trade Agreement between the two parties and to extend more time to Canada to accede to the Agreement.
In Mexico, the President of the Vice-President of Mexico (Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador) said to the journalists that the Government of the United States had made new counter proposal to the Government of Canada and that he would continue to encourage all three countries to participate in NAFTA.
The Minister for Economic Affairs of Mexico, Ildefonso Guajardo (Ildefonso Guajardo), said that the time for the submission of the text of the trade agreement by the United States of America to Mexico and the United States of America was delayed and that the Government of Canada and the United States tried to reach an agreement " very serious " .
Guahardo said, " In the 48 hours to come, we will know that we have to reach a third party agreement text, or that we must publish both parties' agreement texts. "

Officials of the Office of the Prime Minister of Canada and the Office of the Minister for Foreign Affairs have not responded to requests for an assessment of the objection.

The initial value of the trade surplus in September was $97 million, higher than $69 million in August.

The declaration stated that " the export price of oil prices increased and would also benefit from exports in the second half of the year " .
"But the continued trade conflict between the United States and China, and increased market fluctuations after the United States rose, are all the negative pressures faced by exports."
Exports on average per working day increased to $26 million in mid-September and amounted to $22 billion in August.
This year, the Republic of Korea fell from 24 to 26 September, so only 19.5 working days in September and less than four working days in the same year.

Korean media criticizes the United States of America's lack of flexibility in the sanctions against Korea
In a commentary published in the Korean Journal of Labour on 30 September, the United States did not slow down its search for early dialogue with the United States, which is a "compliant" approach.
The article said that the United States of America " 4 days " , called " non-nuclearization in order to achieve the Korean peninsula " , emphasized that the United States continued to implement the position of the United Nations sanctions resolution.
In the United States of America Joint Declaration, the two parties committed to establish a new relationship with the hope of peace for the people of the two countries of the United States.
In the United States, there is no doubt that such practices are counterproductive.
The article said that if a new U.S. relationship is to be established, a permanent and permanent peace-building system on the Korean peninsula is to be achieved without fully modernizing the Korean peninsula, trust should be placed at the top of the building, starting from what it can do, and ending at a step-by-step.
The article also said that the United States should understand that sanctions are not justified against Korea.
The article said that even the "Northern Devinsk" before the "Katang" also praised the Americans.
The National Interests magazine called the U.S. Marines: "We're going to meet a powerful potential opponent.
The current U.S. commander of the U.S. Army in the European Ocean also has the honour of the North Devinsk submarine.
He said: "The submarines are deeply impressed by the development of the Russian Navy and how they use resources will know that their main efforts in research and development have been to strengthen the submarines " .
But the National Interests magazine still believes that the United States remains in favour of Russia in this area.
Fugo said: " I believe that the Western States still have a negative advantage. "

It is requested that the various types of violations found in the monitoring inspection at all levels be dealt with strictly on the basis of the General Assembly ' s " anti-fraud approach to broadcasting facilities " .
In the event of a serious breach of the rule of law, there is a need to give a speech, to comment on the criticisms, to suspend advertising until the frequency channel is broadcast, and to give public attention to the situation.
In recent years, the Directorate General has repeatedly been calling for a stop to advertising abuses.
This year, the National Television General announced that there was a public call for a "0-year-old " Soccer " " bunwow " " " Bungry Plant Prevention Disappearance " to spread and spread a wave of propaganda that led to serious violations, such as the public.
The Directorate-General has developed a number of regulations and notifications to regulate the broadcast of broadcasts.
"Notification of further strengthening of the transmission of short advertising services on television channels" provides that the television channels should not be broadcast on short notice at 18 a.m. to 24 a.m. every day.

Don't look at the U.S. threats!
EU or will reach agreement with Iran on oil procurement
The United States Government earlier announced that November would reopen a new round of sanctions against Iran and even urge other countries to reduce imports of oil to Iran.
But it seems that the American allies didn't listen.
According to the U.S. "New York Time" report, on 29 January, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Iran, Zairev, was disclosed when he was visited, despite the threat that the United States would impose sanctions on any country that had business with Iran, Tehran was approaching an agreement with the EU on the sale of oil.
The core purpose of this agreement is to try to create a new payment mechanism, i.e., in an easy way or cash pricing, for the exchange of United States dollars.
The aim of this approach is to overcome the United States and prevent the United States from preventing financial transfers.
At the same time, while the EU is committed to the promotion of the agreement, some French and British officials are also concerned that if the agreement is achieved, it would be the most open opposition between the EU and the United States against the withdrawal of the I Nuclear Agreement.
The U.S. media say that in an hour's interview, Zaire's language sounds more positive than it's been in the last few months.
Because the agreement has the ability to "dissociate" traditional American allies, the US has effectively broken down its efforts to reduce Iran's income.
" This will ensure that we sell oil and benefit " , Zairef believes that States have the legitimate right to trade with Iran in accordance with the agreement reached in 2015.
The European Union's foreign policy chief, Dilika Moguerini, also said earlier, " No sovereign State or organization can accept the decision of any other person to come to trade with whom it is possible. "
However, she also foretold that before the United States Government launched its next sanctions in November, the United States leaders had the possibility of adopting a series of financial instruments aimed at banks, traders and States that were engaged in business with Tehran.
This year, in May, the United States Government failed to reach agreement, unilaterally declaring the withdrawal of the IN Agreement and stated that the agreement could not be permanently prohibited from the production of nuclear fuel in Iran.
The United States subsequently threatens to prohibit the operations of those companies that purchase Iran oil and other commodities in the United States.
This threat has led some companies to withdraw from Tehran, Iran's currency storm.
Aeroplanes and French oil pipelines have eliminated hundreds of millions of dollars in investment.
British and French officials have said that the U.S. Government may be " winding up " .
Unfortunately, according to a recent report by the Turkish media, sanctions in the United States did not seem to have a significant impact on Iran's oil exports.
Iran's Minister for Oil Zigana revealed earlier in the day that no other country besides Korea had stopped buying Iran oil.
Zairef and Iranian President Ruhani believe that a series of actions by the United States are intended to violate Iran's "insult" agreement.
Zairef was also surprised by a series of attacks on the United States, and when asked if the United States would be able to reverse the current Iranian government by increasing financial pressure, he even laughed, "It's a better strategy than a government, that's the real purpose of the United States."

On Monday, 5 November, the President of the Central Bank of Japan indicated that it was aware that the long-term implementation of the excessive monetary policy could undermine the interest rate of financial institutions and undermine the stability of the banking system of the country.
However, he said that, given the uncertainty of the economies in the sea, Japan needed to maintain its massive incentives plan and to pay close attention to the benefits of its policies.
" Japan's regime fully recognizes that under the continuing monetary slowdown, the strength of financial institutions will be more and more affected, and " Montenegro has expressed its influence in its statement to the business leader of the House of Commons.
He said that if financial institutions were to respond more positively to the risk of increasing the impact of low interest rates on years of decline, the banking system could be affected when serious adverse attacks occurred.
" Despite the small risks currently seen, the central line will focus on developments and encourage the financial institutions to take the necessary measures, he said.
The report of the Japanese Railways Meeting, published a week earlier, showed that at the conference in September, the Committee on the Policy of Japan discussed the continued rise in the cost of long-term depletion policies.
The record of the meeting shows that one member said that if the economy continued to expand, " the future of Japan would be more plural in terms of policy. "
The record of the meeting shows that another member claims, given its limitations during the policy period, that the Committee should discuss how long Japan's policies could be maintained.
In the East, it is said that Japan will assess the financial risks posed by the slow-down policy, while considering the uncertainty surrounding Japan ' s economic outlook, which could affect global needs because of trade and increasing protectionism.
" The impact of such a question on Japan ' s economy is temporarily limited, " The Black East claims.
" But how the issue continues, the impact of Japan ' s economy may have changed, " he adds.
" There is a need to maintain a strong monetary flexibility policy, while taking into account positive and negative effects in a balanced way, " the Black Sea states.
Despite an increase in the momentum of the promotion plan, such as long-term low-rate infringements of the benefits of financial institutions, the slowdown has forced Japan to maintain the plan.
Japan's monetary policy has been maintained over the past month; the risks posed by the global trade war have been eliminated by the Black East from the possibility of recent expansion.

In the reconciliation agreement, SEC reiterated its request to remove Moscow from the company's office.
Many investors claim that this punishment will be disastrous.
"I think this is the best possible outcome for all relevant individuals, Ivan Feinseth of Tigress Financial Partners said that Fenseth gave the central rating " , and claimed that SEC's punishment for Moscow was " from a light penalty " .

On Monday morning, Mr. Tanya, who traveled from the island to the border crossing the border of the Gulf River, along with the remaining 500 troops of the population, watched the national flag together and celebrated the 69th anniversary of the establishment of the People's Republic of China.

With the continued expansion of the country's "one-way" building, as one of China's fastest roads to Southeast Asia, the river ports have steadily increased inland flows.

During the 73rd United Nations General Assembly, some positive information was released around the Korean peninsula.
The President of Korea, in his letter, referred to the rejection of the "reversible" resolve of Korea, and indicated that President Tranpin and the Supreme Leader of Korea might be present at the end of this year.
The U.S. Department of State subsequently stated that it would visit Korea in October to promote the implementation of the Singapore commitments of the U.S. leadership.
From the beginning of this year to this year, Korea has broken the line of ice-opening dialogue, Korea, the meeting of the leaders of the United States, the situation of the peninsula continues to deteriorate and the principle of the dialogue to address the question of the peninsula can also be strengthened.
First of all, the fact that "the nature of the problem of the peninsula is a matter of security" has not changed, and the achievement of peace on the island is a good one, and it is a balanced solution to the legitimate security concerns of all parties, rather than a pressure on each other, to emphasize their claim.
Secondly, in a dialogue to achieve the non-nuclearization of the peninsula, the parties were divided on the steps and ways to achieve the non-nuclearization of the peninsula, and due to the long lack of political confidence between the United States of America, "who was the first to become one."
At a public meeting on the Korean peninsula, held earlier at the United Nations Headquarters in New York, the various voices raised on the issue of sanctions in Korea were re-examined by the two points " that had not changed " .
The U.S. State Secretary-General of the United States insists that the sanctions against Korea will not be abolished until the Korean peninsula is fully realized.
In addition, Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov stressed the principle of " reaction to action " , which he noted: " The decline in sanctions should be consistent with the steps taken by Korea on a slow-down path " .
There is no doubt that the parties concerned should continue to carry out comprehensive, complete and accurate implementation of the Council's resolutions, but not with the aim of imposing sanctions and promoting political solutions are the requirements of the Council's resolution, both inexhaustible and not just one.
In view of the positive progress of the current United States relations in Korea, as stated by China's State Members and the Queen of the Foreign Affairs, the Middle East believes that the Council needs to take into account the need for due consideration of the introduction of counter-reliance clauses, thus encouraging Korea and the parties concerned to take a greater step towards non-nuclearization.
Recall that in the past, every step in the process of non-nuclearization and peace, there was a need for all parties to show sufficient political courage.
At present, the international community is looking forward to increasing expectations for the promotion of the political settlement of the peninsula, in particular political tensions, political decision-making, commitment, resolution of problems, continuing to move forward, and the process of non-nuclearization and the establishment of a peace mechanism on the peninsula together with the establishment of a lasting peace of the peninsula.

A short-term survey published on 1 October in Central Japan revealed that the confidence of Japan's major manufacturers and the lowest level since September, due to the rising cost of raw materials and a series of natural disasters, had made companies feel stressed.
The investigation has almost failed to show that the growing global trade motility has been a threat to the confidence of large manufacturers.
However, the risk of the outbreak of a comprehensive trade war has been countered by the operational prospects of enterprises, which may pose a threat to business capital expenditure.
Living capital expenditure is a clear point in Japan's economy.
The investigation raises questions about the economic expansion of the Japan-based health line, which will help to promote the speed of communication towards 2 per cent of the target, although evidence indicates that companies are moving their costs towards customers gradually.
" In the event of concern about the outbreak of global trade, the confidence of manufacturers to stop because of the poor export slowing and manufacturing industry, " South U.S. Director of the General Research Institute for Agriculture, South Africa, expressed concern.
"Reliance is still high, and I don't think the confidence will continue to slip because the profits of the company are improving and the price is rising."
The short-term survey showed that the indicators of the large manufacturing prospectus in September were reduced from 21 to 19 months ago, to a continuous deterioration in the third season.
The market forecast was 22.
The number of large non-constructional indicators decreased from 24 to 22 in September and increased from 8 to 22 in the first quarter.
The road survey is 22.

Investors are not interested in the indicators of short-term enterprise perspectives, and the daily unit index is the number of days.N225 rises from 27 years to 27 years, and the continued value of the daily turnover helps improve the export prospects for Japanese enterprises.
Capital expenditure is healthy.
Despite the decline in enterprise confidence, the latest short-term outlook shows the healthy planning of enterprise capital, benefiting from updating capacity and increasing the labour shortages that have led to the ageing of the population in terms of machine and automatic investment.
The central short-term survey showed that large enterprises planned to increase their capital expenditure by 13.4 per cent in March 2019.
The previous short-term survey was 13.6 per cent.
The South U.S. reported that all business capital expenditure in this financial year was projected to increase by 8.5 per cent, near the pace of the Japanese economy.
He said, " Given that small enterprises have increased their profits from now on, capital expenditure continues to grow in space, this is largely dependent on the impact of trade wars on business confidence. "

In September, the oil price had been doubled: on 3 September, the oil had been added to 180/tonnes, the oil had been added to 170/tonnes; on 17 September, the oil had been added to 145/tonnes, and the oil had been added to 145/tonnes.
The domestic oil price was linked to international oil prices, which continued to be investigated after the international oil price fluctuation during this cycle.
As at 28 September, the United States of America received $1.13 for WTI oil and reported 73.25 dollars/pound.
The amount of $1.0 for the Brent oil period is estimated at $82.72/pound.

The first students made a mistake by the teacher's physical punishment, and the school's annual evaluation preferences are cancelled - a new network.
In the case of the "Lessed by the Teachers" incident, a report published by the Council of Directors of the New Districts of the Province of Cheining reported yesterday that the fact that the situation of students in the secondary language school in China is true has been reported to have been transferred from the teacher's position and to the annual "assessment" rating of the school.
There were parents in the past reflecting that a six-year-old girl at first school was deeply concerned about the failure of school math teachers to deal with the problem.
Later, the Institute for Social Affairs of the New Eastern People ' s Republic of China set up an investigation group into the school of relevant persons, and asked whether there was a gathering of evidence to move the teacher away from the teacher.
Yesterday, the official release of Chibobo from the Governing Council of the New Eastern Region of China reported that there was a fact in the case of Dr. Ro XX, a teacher of foreign language schools in China.
According to the study, " one vote " , cancels the annual " rating" for the final year of the foreign language school in China.

The 69th International Conference on Space - New Network in Germany
The New York Society did not come to Germany on 1 October (the journalist's honour) at the 69th International Space Conference on 1 October at the Medieval Centre, where more than 6300 spacecraft, space agencies and business representatives from around the world, such as experts and young students, were present.
The President of the International Federation of Spaces, Jean-Eff Légal, made a statement in the opening remarks that the global space industry is no longer only a few countries and institutions, which this year's number of participants has increased significantly, indicating that more institutions and individuals are joining them.
He called on States to strengthen their cooperation with innovation and to promote the development of space science together.
The Deputy Minister of Industry and Information about China, Director-General of the National Space Agency, Zukhi, introduced China's space plan at the time of the exchange, and indicated that China would extend international cooperation in the field of space to contribute to human space activities.
China Space Technology Group, relevant bodies such as China Space Sciences Group, as well as a number of civil enterprise representatives, showed the latest achievements in China's space, including the transport of rockets, satellites and space technology applications.
The International Conference on Space has been held once a year since 1950 as the largest meeting of the world aviation community.
For five days, this Assembly was co-organized by the International Federation of Space Sciences, the International Institute of Space Sciences, the Centre for Scientific and Monetary Research at Mei University, and the International Space Law Association.
On 5 November, a press release published by China on the week of the International Trade Centre in China showed that the situation in China was still complex and 80.6 per cent of the companies expected to be able to export for the entire year 2018 better than last year or maintain balance.
However, taking into account domestic raw materials, the continuing cost of integral elements such as labour force, the increased external impact of trade flows in Central America, while showing companies that the export situation is not satisfactory next year.
At the closing press conference of the 124 broadcasts, the Under-Secretary-General of the General Assembly, the press speaker, the Deputy Director of the External Trade Centre of China, said that the procurement of this broadcast was smaller than the number of people and exports.
The current buyer was 189,812 from 215 countries and regions, with a decrease of 1.11 per cent.
Exports amount to $2064.94 million (average $298.6 billion) and fall by 1 per cent.
From the market, Japan, the Ten Asian States, the " gold and silver " countries, Korea accounted for 74.4%, 11.4%, 7.2%, 2.5%, and the traditional markets, such as the United States, Australia, Canada and the European Union, decreased by 30.3%, 8.9%, 7.3%, 0.8%.
From industry, transport tools, mechanical equipment, construction and packaging materials, electronic consumer and information products, growth of 24.8 per cent, 21.1 per cent, 20.0 per cent, 15.1 per cent, and 7.6 per cent, household appliances fall 13.0 per cent, 6.7 per cent.
As the rain and wind indicators of China's foreign trade, the current situation and export data of the vendors of this broadband network show that the development of foreign trade in China in the coming year remains a number of uncertainties.
However, with the in-depth progress made towards structural reforms and policy measures on "six" in recent countries and local landscapes, the new momentum for foreign trade in China is increasing, and the growth of the business market continues to be making new progress, which are the important basis and strong conditions for external trade development.
" Integrated factors, which are expected to continue to maintain stable growth, quality and efficiency throughout the year, are expected to increase the quality and effectiveness of Chinese exports throughout the year. "
China's General Customs Office announced that the price of the United States dollar was 14.5 per cent higher than the increase in September, that imports were 14.3 per cent higher than the increase in September, that trade was at a rate of $316.9 million, and that the export rate in September was at least higher than in February this year.
Despite the steady increase in trade flows in the United States, China's exports continued to be highly anticipated in September, and there was a need to be ambitious, for companies to export prices to the United States before taxing taxes, or as a major contributory factor, to show some degree the severity of foreign trade in China, but the fight against trust in the Central American trade in the fight against industrial links, and to analyse the challenges of China's foreign trade might appear in the quarter or in the next year.
The Road Survey shows that the United States Fund Manager's recommendation to increase cash in September continues to maintain a careful position, with the introduction of the latest round of import tariffs in the United States and China, and that there was no slow evidence of the dispute.
However, according to the management recommendations of the 12 Fund managers involved in this survey, North America ' s assets were increased to the highest since June 2017, while the euro area, particularly in the emerging markets, fell.
The global share ratio is 56.6 per cent, the debt is 35.5 per cent, which is essentially consistent with the previous month's investigation.
Its most obvious change is that cash ratio is higher than 5.1%, which has been higher since December 2014.
A fund manager of a large fund stated that " some economic data have led to market confidence, but trade wars are still the biggest concern, so it is best to prepare for entry into the market when it comes back. "
However, in September, the Fund's manager remained in favour of the shares, in particular the United States, even though the US shares were considered to be high.
Today, in China's open field, the world's first major national exhibition on the subject of import — China's international import exhibition, officially opened in thousands of people.
A show will be like a " window " and will give the world a better understanding of a city and a country.
Through this "window " , people see the "opening China" at a higher level, and thanks to the "opening of the " window " , they welcome the world and the "opening of reform" victory.
"In the case of a country, open is like a broken bone, though it will experience a temporary pain, but will change into a new life. "
A close memory of the conclusion of the open road led to an important reason why China could.
Recalling the 40-year opening of the reform and the courage of China to enter the Great Lakes of the World market, despite the fact that there has been drought and hurricanes, the open-minded approach to all risk challenges, the continued release of internal mobility and the continuing increase in competitiveness.
It can be said that China has been able to explain the value and meaning of openness with its own real achievements.
At the beginning of the new history, a major decision taken to move towards a new high-level open-level approach to the world open market, a major initiative by China in support of the practical actions of economic globalization and trade liberalization, showed the strong and clear will of China's "open doors will not be closed, but will only be extended and expanded."
In addition, the country's visitors reported on the phenomenon of " a challenge " , which was the most sure and best response to China's broader, broader and deeper development of the open economy.
More importantly, the current global trade order has reached a cross-border route.
The high walls of trade protectionism, the return of unilateralism, the growing concern of the international community about the prospects for free trade, and the growing uncertainty of the world economy.
In the context of such a period, this gathering in the Gulf of Cyprus showed China's protection of free trade, which enabled the world to see the open market and share the future China's confidence and China's concerns.
Get out of here. Get out of here.
China's greed and ambition for the world have not only contributed to its own development but also brought to the nations and regions of the world a vengeful " opportunity.
In recent years China has provided a range of international public products, providing real export markets, development opportunities and jobs, to enable businesses and China to use " roadmaps " to develop " cars " in China.
The entry of the House is also a public product, a large platform for global trade cooperation.
On this platform, more than 130 companies in more than 130 countries and regions have a unique quality product and service lighting and are taking a new step in the Chinese market.
In addition to national enterprises, there are real benefits for domestic consumers.
Through the development of this "opportunity advantage" platform, many channels have been provided for consumer upgrades to meet the needs of the population in terms of individualization, diversification and diversification of consumer needs.
As China's open door expands and expands, it is becoming more and more solid to the path of a good life.
From a more subtle point of view, the importance of entry into the House has already exceeded the scope of economic and trade, but in the future, it is open, inclusive, universal, balanced and shared ideas that form a common consensus that meets today's challenges.
The world is good, China is good; China is good, the world is better.
We look forward to a bright and comprehensive future for the world, and we look forward to the bright future of the "Open China" community with the world's leadership of human destiny.
External media: United States of America reached a framework agreement on the North American Free Trade Agreement.
[Summer] The content of the Agreement includes Canada opening its milk market to the United States, and the United States does not impose tariffs on vehicles produced in Canada temporarily.
According to external media reports, a newsman from Canada disclosed the local time on 30 September and that the United States and Canada had reached a framework agreement on the North American Free Trade Agreement.
It was discovered that the content of the agreement included Canada's opening up its dairy markets to the United States and that the United States did not impose tariffs on vehicles produced in Canada temporarily.
On 27 October, the United States and Mexico announced an initial principle agreement on the conclusion of the North American Free Trade Agreement, but the United States and Canada were unable to reach an agreement within the period established by the United States on 31 August to extend the negotiation period until 30 September.
Earlier, the speaker from the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Canada, Fryland, stated that Canada would only sign a favourable agreement, " focusing on the substantive but not on the timetable. We would like to continue consultations and wish to reach an agreement that is in line with the interests of Canada ' s countries. "
More than nine Brazilian women's candidates said the presidential candidate had not considered the need for women.
According to the South American Network, recent data published by the National Geographic Research Institute (IBGE) in Brazil indicate that more than 90 per cent of the Brazilian women ' s population do not believe that the presidential candidates considered women ' s needs.
It is reported that the number of women in Brazil has now reached 1.7 million, and if women from all of Brazil are gathered to form a country, the population of that country will be ranked global 13 and more than twice the national population of Spain.
In Brazil, the number of female voters is 52 per cent of the total number of voters, 48 per cent of men, although women are very high in the electoral process, but in Brazil, only 10 per cent are women.
Of the 193 countries in the world, the participation of Brazilian women in politics is only 154, higher than in the Arab countries.
After more than 20 years of human rights struggle, Brazilian women have not been able to obtain their own rights.
Brazilian sociologist Natalia Mori (Natalia Mori) noted that the existence of this phenomenon was the result of the common role of ancient father society, racism and capitalism.
"politicalism should be the result of national democratic civil rights, identity, access to public products and the same society as many social groups.
A study conducted earlier by the Brazilian Institute of Motor Vehicles (Locomoviva) also indicated that 94 per cent of Brazilian women did not think that the politicians of the elections could represent their rights, 90 per cent of Brazilian women did not agree with the decisions made by the politicians, and 93 per cent did not agree with the current Government's governance policy.
"We need to turn to the question of women's representations in Parliament, and the political system of Brazil remains affected by inequality. To date, there are still serious gender, class and racial discrimination in the political area of Brazil. "Natalia Mori said.
Although women ' s rights are inadequate, most Brazilian women still believe in the power of democracy.
The survey revealed that 76 per cent of women felt that they could have a role in democratic elections and 72 per cent of women were interested in politics.
In addition, 55 per cent of women felt that democracy was the best way to make women less desirable.
On 1 October, China's Ambassador to Kazakhstan, the new Central Network, Astana (New Zealand Journalist, Winjay), hosted the new 69-year-old Chinese campaign on 1 October.
The rest of the remaining 80 members of the General Assembly of the Embassy of China in Kazakhstan, the news agencies, the financial institutions, the medium-sized enterprises, the Walloons, the Baroque School and the rest of the students participated in the event.
On 1 October, China's Embassy in Kazakhstan held a national flag ceremony to welcome a new 69-year-old Chinese flag.
After the outbreak of the flag, China's Ambassador to the Hague stated that during the 69-year-old day of his arrival in the United States of Great Britain, we held the flagship in his country of origin, a deeply loving and educational activity.
While people live outside the sea for a long time, they are concerned about the great country.
It is said that the Chinese people are closer to the grand goal of the people's restoration than ever before and that they are closer to the center of the world stage than ever before.
"Our mission, responsibilities and work are more glorious than ever before, enormous and extensive. "
It stressed that, if we do not forget to begin, remember our mission, to promote the construction of a "spatial" road in the Middle East with a "stable, deep-rooted " path, a " work painting " line, and the creation of a " work plan " for the development of the country, the Middle East is making a good contribution to the efforts of its fellows.
The International Airport T2 is officially opened on 30 days.
The Communication Council of Communicating said that the new airport could meet the requirements of 12 million passengers per year and build a new advantage in the transport of Lingala air, which would further improve the flow of the Pacific Ocean, the shipping of the seas, the land and entrances of the airport to the "four" modern-state transport agency.
It is estimated that 90 million people this year will be accommodated by Jillin.
The construction of the T2 terminals and the extension of the facilities at the T2 International Airport and the construction of the station is an important public benefit project for the 60th anniversary of the establishment of the Franciscan self-government district, as well as a marked project for international tourism.
The project was launched in December 2015, with a build-up of 100,000 square metres, a total investment of 32.58 million people, which was able to meet the requirements of 12 million annual passengers, 1012 million times, and 9 5 million tons of mail.
On that day, two hundred flights arrived at the T2 airport at the two international airports in Zharin.
The design of the newly constructed building is breathless under the Mount of Olives, and it can be seen as a "mountain of water" and as if it were a house of ruins in the north-eastern part of the Mount of Olives.
It was suggested that the new airport airport facilities could meet the high level of access to ports by almost 4,000 times per hour, using the smartening system of air-conditioning systems, the security of the platform, the technical means of "Wise Airport" and the planning of a wide range of business areas such as cooking, shopping, free of charge and leisure.
As the growth in Asia and the emerging markets in Europe cannot be encouraging, the United States is increasingly becoming the main engine for global economic growth.
On 23 September 2018, in New Jersey, U.S.A., a pack of containers stopped inside the port.
However, because the current growth in the United States is benefiting from the time it has gained to reduce tax incentives, the economy is also deeply concerned.
"As the United States returns to full-time employment, the economy appears to be in danger."
He said that the only problem was when it would happen, and he seemed that he might not just move forward.
Although Bachley had a positive outlook on the United States economic outlook before this year, the bank acknowledged that it was more difficult to predict a longer period of time.
" In the absence of more sustainable investment growth to boost economic growth potential, current growth driven by financial policy will be difficult to follow, " Bachley economists say in a study.
" In the absence of investment growth, the economic risk of land being seriously rising in 2020 will be increased, " they say.
A series of business surveys will show a significant indication that major economies are in the economic cycle at the end of the third quarter.
The euro area and the United States manufacturing investigation to be published next week will be concerned and the third will be published on the service industry survey.
However, the focus of the next week will certainly be the United States non-farm employment data that will be published on the following Friday, which will provide a clue to the rapid employment market in favour of a significant increase in wages.
Its importance is not only important because of its capacity to profit and consumer purchasing of enterprises, but also because of the increase in salary or the rise in overall inflation, it is likely that the officials of the United States Federal Reserve Commission (USF/FED) may be disturbed.
"The salary will be taken into account, as it may be even higher than the previous month.
The same rate of growth may not have fallen by 3 per cent in September last September, but we can expect a month to collapse, "The International Group of the Netherlands Economics (ING) wrote in a study.
In China and other regions of Asia, the European political authorities may be the source of market fluctuations, while the following figures are clear.
The Italian Government's financial commitment to the EU before being ignored by the Government of Italy will have to be firmly opposed to the decision of the other Member States of the European Union.
As the United Kingdom retreats to the key stage of the European negotiations, the British Conservative Party may also fire four times during its annual meeting in Bingham.
At the same time, the concerns of the new emerging markets will not be greatly reduced as the presidential elections will be held at the end of the next week in Brazil.
[Summary] The ship will be delivered to the East Coast of China's National Seabed Authority, and the Director of the Division for the Marine Pre-Accession Monitoring Division of the Ministry of Natural Resources of China stated that the ship's introduction would be of significant importance to the development of the coastal marine observation system in China.
On 29 September, China's top 3,000-twenty-level flagship "to the sun 22" was turned into water under the Chinese armed group.
After the ship was built, the current China will break the equipment bottle in large flags, the subsidized, recovered, and repaired.
"To the Sun 22" is primarily used for the maintenance of flu/ sub-signs, periodic release, recovery, prompt release of flu/ sub-signs, recovery and rehabilitation of safeguards, while having the capacity to carry out integrated marine investigation tasks, such as cross-expendicular investigations.
The captain of the new ship is 89 metres long, 18 feet long, 7.2 meters deep, and the fleet is 10,000 seafarers.
The Under-Secretary-General of the Armed Forces said: " The ship on the South-South 22 is a major flagship in my country, and the only in the country that has a 10-mile flagship, which will further enhance the security of our flagship. "
It was understood that the ship would be delivered to the East Seabed of the National Seabed Authority of China, and the Director-General of the Marine Pre-Accession Monitoring Division of the Ministry of Natural Resources of China stated that it would have significant significance for the development of the coastal sea observation system in China.
"This ship has a large fleet of maintenance operations while having the capacity of the marine integrated investigation, which is the first integrated ship to be used for the operations of the Mediterranean and the integrated marine investigation.
There's such a floating business ship, and in the future our marine observations and marine investigations have a powerful instrument."
On October 1, 2018, the impact of the New-Earth "Sun" on the Thames, which was launched on 30 September 2018, was delayed on the first day of the game until 1 October, and met before the race at the Sun Oysan Centre, with a view to the number of 12 of the 12-country and district-based boatmen.
The impact of the "Major" wind on the port continues, the maximum speed is 24 degrees, the launch signal is delayed from 1 p.m. to 1 p.m. and the speed is still not reduced, and the president of the series, Annie Mdrant, announced the end of the first day of the game, will be delayed until 1 October.
"The strong wind from the shore continues, and the sea is really too heavy."
Mdlant explains: "In such a situation, no one knows how much wind blows on the boat at any time.
To the near city stage, for the current situation, the elimination of the game is the wisest choice."
Everything's ready for the crew. There's still some disappointment.
"The boat is ready to stop, and we're fine."
"But I know that the game change is the right choice, and I hope that today's wind will be small, we can show our hands."
"Omika Wilkinson, of the New Zealand Star of Hope, which was honored by the Tokyo Federation in 2020, says: "The loss of a day's time has made the game more interesting.
Because today's play share will increase, and only two days will be left for the game.
You'll have to die in a special way."
Despite the violent waves of the sea, the French team of AbM, Pierre Ives Duland, met before the game, complained about the warmness of the island with the game: the five years ago, the international series of extremely limited ships was injured, broken down, and the treatment of many local medical teams allowed them to stay in the stadium today, five years later.
It was reported that the international series of extremely limited ships was created in 2007, as well as with Walvo, U.S. wines, and World Ships' World Cups, which were not known for the race against the cycle.
The game of this island will take the "FlyingPhantom" water bubble.
In 2018 it was the 8th year of the island of the "Wondership" on the island, and it was the war of the series of harvesters.
Despite the continuing global financial market turmoil, the Hong Kong Financial Authority stated that the foreign exchange fund's investment income in the third quarter of this year decreased by 97 per cent over the previous period, and that the foreign exchange rate was high under the mid-American trade war.
According to the Agency's latest data, the foreign exchange fund of 7 September 2018 recorded the investment income of $16 million, which was significantly lower than the 618 million ports of the same year, but was better modified by the second half of the year.
At the legislative meeting, President Sande of the Board of Governors indicated that, at the beginning of the Central American Trade War, Hong Kong and the emerging market share indicators and the United States Unit index were in reverse, until late in September, after the decline in market conditions had been observed, the market situation began to deteriorate, as investors became increasingly aware that the trade war had been detrimental to the United States itself.
"A change in market conditions is good, and if trade war has only a unilateral effect, it is not a big help in resolving matters."
But at the same time he said, "If the Central American Trade War failed to resolve, financial market fluctuations would continue to rise."
In the third month of this year, the foreign exchange fund in Hong Kong lost its share investment in more than 8 per cent to 47 million dollars in the previous year, and the share in the foreign exchange increased by 172 per cent to 128 million in the previous year; the foreign exchange decreased by 162 million dollars, the debt profit of 97 million dollars, and a reduction of 24 per cent and 31 per cent in the period, reflecting mainly the overall increase of the United States gross domestic currency and the fall rate of US inflation by 3 per cent in September.
The Foreign Exchange Fund is mainly used to support the Port.
Since 1983 Hong Kong has implemented a system of exchange rates linked to the Ports and United States dollars.
In terms of the current financial situation in Hong Kong, Chad claims that economic and asset markets increase uncertainty and increase the risk of decline, but that the Hong Kong financial system is healthy and can be protected and counterproductive.
" The international capital increase in Hong Kong is 4 times the net value of $14 billion in net assets compared to GDP, more than 2.5 times in Singapore and 0.6 times in Japan and is to be compensated for by the economic downturn or reverse. "
In its recent decline in the shareholding of the Ports and the expansion of the share of the United States dollars, Sidd said that the exchange of the Ports had increased to 400 base points on 21 September, which the market generally considered to be mainly related to the increase in the share of the port, after which the share of the Portals fell to close to 7.80-7.84, and the recent increase in the share of the share of the dollar could lead to an increase in market share of the purchases of the dollar, which would increase the likelihood of the exchange of guarantees by the Porters over a period of time.
However, he believed that the normalization of the port interest rate would change with the beginning of the Hong Kong interest rate, and that the future port interest rate would be lower than the United States dollar interest rate.
" Portable interest rates will be more consistent with the United States dollar interest rate, and everyone needs to be more careful about managing risks, preparing for and responding to market fluctuations. "
Due to the volume of the Portal funding, the volume of the port drop decreased further, from 0.9 per cent per month to 2.08179 per cent, from 46 basis points to 51 base points per month; one monthly drop from five new months to 120 basis points to 127 basis points.
From May to September, the current rate of exchange was nearly $7.85 per cent.

The Board of Governors purchased at 7.85 level at the level of the connection exchange system and issued US dollars in order to maintain the stability of the port exchange rate.
In May and August, the Board of Governors purchased approximately 522 million dollars under the guarantee exchange mechanism.

It was asked by the journalists that the revised individual tax law had been standardized by the tax resident of my country for 183 days over a year.
Please ask if there is any advantage arrangements for outsiders, including those in Port-au-Prince?
The Director replied that the regulations on the application of the existing individual tax law had special advantages on the issue of taxable persons outside the territory of China and that individuals who had not lived in China for more than five years, whose income was derived from outside China, could be taxed only by units or individuals paid by individuals in China.
The head said that in order to maintain policy stability and the next step in the implementation of the new individual tax law, it would be considered to continue to make a favourable arrangement for foreign nationals, including those in Port-au-Prince.
There are no moonlights in the moonlight: quality certification leads to quality enhancement.
With the movement of "two-year-old economy" and the prosperity of the mother milk market, from the north to the three-fourth cities, the celebration of several months of archive gathering has taken place.
The following months of fire met the consumption needs of the population and the cost was not equal to billions of dollars to hundreds of millions of dollars, but it was also located in the outlying area, which has not yet been opened and there is also empty space.
The National Market Control Board carried out a series of national "quality month" activities in 2018, and journalists visited a five-star monthly centre in the city of Tassin.
General monthly centres provide new birth care, food and post-natal rehabilitation services.
At the center of the household, the journalist saw that nurses regularly check the situation of newborns, provide care for the newborns, and treat them with care, as well as care services.
At the same time, in order to meet the needs of the new mother, early injuries care from month to month, services such as the United States physical care, and the provision of care projects such as medical care, such as medical care, to help the mother recover her tingling.
A new mother who lived told the journalist that she was planning to meet this month just eight months ago.
The monthly service projects directly affect the level of rest during the mother-in-law and physical recovery, some small-monthly months will be able to provide only a few simple monthly services, there is no rule on drug health, easy to deal with infection, and a single non-scientific diet.
The head of the household centre said that they were the only one in all five-month centres in the city of Tasshin and had access to the B-level Service Certificate.
" Although some customers initially did not understand the meaning of the B certificate, through certification, the process management of the firm's strict standardization process has been important to the long-term development of the company, he said. "
The Deputy Director-General of the National Market Control Division confirmed that the certification of services was based on customer awareness and was concerned about a new type of certification system, which was an important component of national quality infrastructure, which contributed to the promotion of quality services and had a positive role in strengthening international competition for Chinese services.
Since the beginning of 2004, my country has experienced a ten-year development of the service certification project, a process of progressive development, such as financial service certification, maternal care certification, post-market service certification, electronic business service certification, and a set of effective service certifications such as health certification.
According to the National Market Control Board statistics, there are currently 130 other service certification agencies in my country, two thousand service certifications, and almost eight thousand effective certifications.
In order to further guide and promote the development of service certifications, UNICEF, sport, finance and electricity, such as in areas such as health, education and training, and the expansion of the scope of service certification, it was suggested that the service sector should be further guided and promoted to improve its quality and quality.
On 5 November, the price of the Hong Kong building fell two months after its completion, and the President of the Hong Kong Financial Authority indicated that it is now necessary to monitor whether the city has entered the following cycle, if confirmed, to consider the policy of withdrawal measures for the appropriate time-limited reverse cycle.
Siddong pointed out that if the price was restored, the first impact would be on the construction industry at the height of the city, but it is expected that the price crisis, such as the Asian financial storm in 1997, would be very low in the price sector.
At the high-level legislative briefing of the Office of the High-level Board of Governors of the Shandong-Mains, it was stated that appropriate time-limits could be suspended if it was confirmed that the city entered the downward cycle.
"But now only a few weeks have seen the data, and the rest of the talk is still early, and it still takes time to see if the city enters the next cycle."
Since 2009, the Board of Governors has launched eight round round rounds measures that have been in place since 2009, with a significant reduction in the number of obstacles to various types of industries, including the reduction of the number by-catch, which requires the applicant to pass severe pressure tests in order to increase bank risk management and counter-terrorism capacity.
As Hong Kong officially entered the settlement cycle, the private housing price index for the whole of 8 September-September saw an increase of up to 1.44 per cent in the month of September.
But the growth of the third quarter of this year is still 10.2%.
According to the Board of Governors, the financial situation in Hong Kong in terms of financial risks remains healthy, and this second year, the Hong Kong households are 66 per cent higher than in the middle of 2009-11; the new average distribution is 47 per cent and 34 per cent, and 64 per cent and 41 per cent are significantly improved in 2009-11 respectively.
However, Siddong points out that the high anti-terrorism capacity is not represented by the economic damage that has been done by industrial citizens, as the value of the industry will fall and that those who buy high-end buildings will be more likely to be the first to be affected.
While the Board of Governors has received a high rate of loans for loans by lenders, employers can also obtain a high rate of loans by means of insurance insurance or by developers.
Zhede points out that loans are currently available to the developers and that the borrower can be 85-90 per cent at the rate of the loan, and that if the price falls below the building, assets (i.e. the value of the business market is below the level of not reimbursing the total loan).
However, the Vice-President of the Board of Governors noted that the Authority estimated that the total amount of fines provided by the developers represented only 2 to 2.5 per cent of the bank's total amount of fines and that the proportion remained lower.
When Hong Kong has high assets in 2003, the number of assets is over 100,000, which is 22 per cent of those who provide buildings.
As of the third quarter of this year, Hong Kong has continued to record zero assets.

The systemic red blood cell is a complex and complex multi-cellular disorder that has been called " maladies " in the past.
Because of the lack of knowledge of its disease mechanism, it is difficult to deal with doubt and lack effective treatment methods.
In recent days, the Director-General of the Institute of Living Sciences of the University of Chihuahua and the Director of the People's Hospital of Beijing have found that the United Nations group has found that there is a need to increase the vulnerability of human immunodeficiency to the human immunodeficiency virus, which is involved in the prevention of infectious B cells.
In short, the two groups have confirmed that an unusual immunizer in the human body is a major cause of systemic red blood cell disease.
According to one of the authors, the hospital of the Northern People ' s Hospital reported a significant increase in the incidence and severity of the incidence of diseases in the immune cells and species that occur in the body of patients who are immunized by the virus, many of which are self-contained, congenital, contaminant, convulsive, convulsive, and blood clots.
By monitoring, testing, testing, and testing of various methods of research such as these immunizations has been identified as an interactive immunization signal route and facilitating the distribution of B cells to various types of immune mechanisms.
The journalists were aware that the two groups were strongly united, fully exercising their own advantages and achieved a close link between basic research and the application of interim care.
The 1 million lithium team is committed to the identification of B-B-B-B-B-B-P-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-N-O-O-O-O-N-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-N-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-N-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O
" This study is one of the results of two team collaborations for several years, and it is the first time in the scientific community to realize that the immune protein is usually going to spread systemic red blood cells, setting a solid basis for further study of academics and for treatment of chronically ills. "
It's not short-term, it's legal.
The lawyer's wearing the head of the court?
The news was really exciting, and it was also in the legal circle.
The law of the City of Fountain subsequently applied for 500 lawyers' fines for the case, and it recommended in writing that the City Law Association investigate.
According to a New York report, the former City Council issued a formal notice that the conduct of two lawyers did not involve violations of law and that they were not punished by law.
It was reported from a majority that the treatment of the City Law Association was not short-lived or opposed, but that it had been approved by the Central Chamber.
At the same time, events that may have caused tension within the legal community could eventually be resolved in a good way.
On the contrary, it is based on a more complete relativism: the same pattern of the head of the defendant's lawyer and the same number of the accused's instruments, but it is not open to them to provide additional evidence in the evidence circle, without fear of movement or the main intention of "the safety of the court".
The determination of the violation of the law of law requires four very important details: the first, the first two courts of the local court, showed only the originals, showed their need from the defence point of view and showed the need for the originals; the second, the first was to buy only one hour before the trial, not to seek the consent of the lawyer, but not to seek the consent of the judge on purpose; the third, the whole of the case was not abused or inappropriately used; fourthly, the first time the lawyer was publicly admitted and the court apologized to the court.
These cases are integrated, and they can be seen as nothing more than a defense of the lawyer concerned.
After clarifying the whole fact, the U.S. municipal councils did not promote water pollution but decided that it would not be punished.
And this decision has also been tested by facts and laws.
As far as it is not permitted by the Court, it is easy to cause insecurity and misunderstanding as a guide for the control of the gun.
In view of security and careful consideration, the previous sanctions and judicial recommendations of the Central State Hall are also ineffective.
In order to protect the dignity of lawyers, to prevent the private court from paying for the prosecution of the offenders, the Supreme Law issued in 2014 the " Rules of the Court of Justice of the Court of Justice for the Safety of the Judiciary " , establishing the principle that the court does not need to carry out a personal security check.
Since the rule was published, a large number of cases have been conducted by large lawyers who have been involved in the security of the Tribunal as a result of an investigation.
In very different cases such as the U.S., it is not difficult to eliminate the spirit of mutual respect, understanding, and understanding.
The Association of Lawyers, as a self-law organization in the law sector, has a dual mandate to punish illegal and legal safeguards.
In the past, individual law enforcement organizations have been subjected to discipline, lack of security, and disease.
However, the decision of the State Law Agreement, whether from the process or from the outcome, is commendable and has set a pattern for the performance of more legal agreements.
From 1 October, what tax benefits will affect our wallet?
The new individual tax law will be implemented on 1 October 2019 in order to allow the general public to enjoy tax benefits as early as possible, and from 1 October it will be preceded by the removal of wages actually earned by taxable persons at the starting point of $5,000 per month and the new tax table will apply.
What are the benefits of working together with the new political community?
Benefit I: A clear reduction in wage wages
The taxable taxpayers who obtained wages after 1 October could remove the basic cost reduction of $5000/month and apply the new tax table, most taxable persons had different levels of tax, in particular low-income tax rates.
According to the tax reduction table for different income groups, the reduction rate for the monthly income after "three-risk" was $8,000, 10,000, and 50000, respectively, should be offset by 90,290, 1590, 9090, compared with 3500 points per month, respectively, by 73.9%, 61.1%, 49.0 %, 18.8 %.
It is worth noting that, for the reasons of holiday holidays, a new basic reduction of costs and tax rates could be applied to wages that were issued by individuals to be issued by the law at the end of September.
In order to do this, the tax sector-wide tax-examination client-side software has provided the corresponding tax-based accounting function, but the corresponding tax must still be declared to be paid within the statutory reporting period.
Beneficiary 2: Low-rate file level clearly shows the size of the file
In addition to the increase in raise points, a new rate table will be applied on 1 October.
The current salary, the rate of seven and the previous balance of the salary, did not change, but there was a marked change in the level of the tax rate, 3 %, 10 %, 20 %, and 25 % of the level of the lower tax rate, and 30 %, 35 % and 45 % remained unchanged.
It is worth noting that the tax law has also adjusted the rates of taxes received from production operations, with a minimum tax rate of 35 per cent of which is higher than $100,000 to $50,000.
This means that individuals' businesses and individuals' companies will benefit from tax changes.
" From the previous period, in view of the individual assessment of tax reductions for individuals at sea, the benefits of tax reform, especially those of low-income people, will be clearly felt by the large tax authorities. "
The Head of the Tax Office of the National Tax Office, at the Office of the National Bureau of the Maritime Tax Office, expressed concern.

On the other hand, tax reception policies are promoted for tax collectors of large cities.
Use the official website of the maritime tax office, micro-public, and micro-biological channels to temporarily transmit policy hot points to ensure policy dissemination.
At the same time, on 28 September, the MIP 12366, on behalf of the People of the Sea, carried out the information services on integrated tax reform through the advice of "man-work-wise" on tax services.

This transition reached the highest peak this year, which he produced in 5,000 acres [1,600 ha] and reached an unprecedented size.
But Thomas and many like him are planning to transfer the main food crops of the former U.S. agricultural region in 2019: corn and milk.
This year, farmers in the United States have overcrowded their crops, and for the first time in 35 years.
It is therefore planned to transfer other food crops because, in the context of the war against China, President Tranpe of the United States, the American farmers were in a difficult situation.
China usually buys about 60 per cent of the US exports of potatoes, but in recent months it has been almost zero for the United States for the past few months, leading to a decline in the price of lead to ten years.
Thomas intends to increase the quality of food next year, and he wishes to increase a number by reducing the dependence on crops that are dependent on China's needs.
Thomas said that the price of beer " brings us a painful fight " .
He pointed out that without China's purchase, the high price of beer near its farm was $7.10 per ear, and the cost of covering was $8.50.
The U.S. farmer collects a high record of the crop this year, and it is expected that it will be a high record.
It's a time when it's so easy to get hit, they've been hit by a trade war.
In July China collected import tariffs for imported Chinese goods against Trenup.
The United States Department of Agriculture will publish the first forecast report on next year's crops, which will include an overview of the impact of tariffs.
The estimate is expected to confirm that civilian institutions will be expected to reduce the incidence of large-scale plebiscites.
According to a report seen on the road, the Information Economics is expected to increase by 4 per cent to 9.7 million pounds (3.7 million kg) in 2019, and the large-scale crop will decrease by 7 per cent to 8.3 million pounds in 2019.
The information is also expected to increase 4 per cent of the United States small-food crops.
This year, the large surface of the pre-responsive tariff increase of 8.9.6 million pounds this year, up to about 1.5 million pounds 10 years ago.
The growth rate has increased from less than 5 million ng since 2008, to 8.9 million ng, and this year the growth rate is 4.7 million ng ng, which is nearly 100 years of minimum standard.
Aaron Carlson, head of the Ilyno State Coalition for Plantation, collected a total of 3,600 pounds, which he spent nearly half of this year on plants, but planned to reduce the future.
He said that it was likely that in the farm in northern Illinois, it would increase the cultivation area by up to 20%; it was the largest country in the United States of America.
But the demand for fats is low, which reduces the overall cost of cultivation.
If a farmer moves to the end value of corn, it may increase the cost, but it will benefit some businesses, including Andersons Inc. salesmen.
Andersons, Executive Director Pat Bowe, pointed out on the road that he expected the transfer of mercury would be beneficial for the use of mercury.
Biar is also expected to benefit from the farmer's transformation of corn.
The Director-General of the Hong Kong Airport Authority of Thailand, Mr. Shireawa, convened a meeting on 29 December, accusing a Chinese citizen of the incident at the airport and expressing appreciation for the hospitality of Chinese tourists, which would strengthen the management of the sector concerned and improve service awareness and avoid similar incidents.
On 27 days, it was reported that there was a civil conflict with a Chinese man who was denied entry.

The Thai Immigration Service has now arranged for the man to return to China.
She expressed her regret at the event in which the image of Thailand was damaged, and expressed her deep appreciation for the fact that she was willing to do her utmost to reduce the impact of the incident on visitors, and would send a petition to the parties through the Chinese Embassy in Thailand.

New International Time Rating: Protecting multilateralism, China's Knowledge Unit.
Under unilateralism, international rules and multilateral order were attacked.
To some extent, unilateralism and multilateralism entered into a crucial period.
As a responsible major country, China is in a position to promote multilateralism in a balanced way and to work together with the international community in order to promote multilateralism.
In the face of new challenges to the new situation, China made a loud voice on the development direction and path of multilateralism.
As stated in the general debate of the 73rd United Nations General Assembly, multilateralism in the new era should continue to be a goal of cooperation, based on a rule-based order, and for a just purpose, to direct effective action.
At the same time, China called for the establishment of a United Nations core, the main channel for North-South cooperation, the complemented framework for global development cooperation, and the creation of a community for human fate.
China's thinking and voice reflected the key voice of the international community.
As the 73rd President of the United Nations, Espinosa said, under the current situation, " the United Nations needs to promote multilateralism and maintain the international system based on rules " .
The President of the International Monetary Fund, Lagad, said that the international community should continue to maintain strict adherence to the multilateral trading system, to strengthen international trade rules, and to resolve differences through consultation.
In recent years, with a comparison of global economic forces, a number of emerging markets and groups of developing countries have played a greater role in international multilateral mechanisms to provide new development incentives for counter-terrorism.
In this context, China's promotion of a large family, rather than a small circle, has maintained a common community rather than a multi-ethnic concept, which, in due course, is to meet global challenges, to resolve the world's problems and represent the common demand of most countries in the world.
There's a forward concept, a more serious action.
China's "one-way" initiative has become the largest international cooperation platform.
China ' s joint " one-way " , the Asian Investment Bank, the International and Regional Cooperation Initiative " 16+1 " , promotes international cooperation in the region, complementing existing international systems and ordering innovations for multilateral cooperation and contributing to a more equitable approach to development in order to promote international order.
China's actions are increasingly powerful at this multilateral level, as the maintenance of international order and multilateralism.
At a high international level, climate change, participation in peacekeeping operations, a strong reduction in poverty, and other countries' support for the implementation of the 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda.
As the Secretary-General of the United Nations said, China has become an important pillar of multilateralism.
When the world's "trust deficit" has been intensified, when democracy and extremism have emerged, the world is the most urgent time for multilateral cooperation needs.
In such historical contexts, the international community needs to take the lead in the integration of action, firmly defending multilateralism and promoting the building of the Community of Human Rights.

The fifth "deficiency Month" came to focus on the problem of disability in youth education -- a new network in the media.
In recent years, the issue of adolescent education in China has been widely discussed, but the challenges remain for young people with disabilities.
In the near future, the comprehensive educational challenges and practical strategies for disabled persons were held in Beijing.
How sexual education for disabled children and young people is an important topic for this seminar.
The "Centralization of Child Disability and Youth, attitudes and behaviour reports" presented at the meeting showed that children with disabilities were sexually harassed and that sexual abuse was higher than healthy children.
More attention is given to "sexual protection" for disabled children, young people, in society.
This seminar aims to support family support, school education and institutional services in three areas in China for the promotion of comprehensive education for disabled children and adolescents, from the outset providing support for disabled children and adolescents to have the right to themselves and their loved ones.
The experts believe that the public of China has always remained aware of the vulnerable groups at a low level.
The impact of traditional ideas on persons with disabilities, especially disabled children and adolescents, is not sufficiently profound in China.
In recent years, however, with the support of the United Nations UNESCO and the public benefit, Chinese disabled persons have had a positive development in their overall cycle of sexual and reproductive health education and the achievement of the road.
“Report” showed that visual barriers, hearing barriers, mental barriers and physical barriers to children and young people in access to sexual knowledge, and that the understanding of close relationships would be much more difficult than common ones, but in general, it has accelerated and enriched development.

On 30 September, the publication of net net data on foreign assets on the Chinese Central Line revealed that as at the end of August this year, the foreign currency continued to zero for 12 months to the beginning of this long-term and long-term contract of purchase, with no more head of the month.
The previous data in the Central Panel showed that as at the end of August last year, foreign currency had an air head of $60.44 million for the long-term and long-term contracts for this currency, which remained unchanged for the fourth month; the air head size of SDR (special lending rights) was 42.76 million SDR.
After that, the long-range outer ring of the central line has been zero.
This data was first published by the Central Bank at the end of March 2016; the foreign currency of the Central Bank in late February 2016 showed an amount of $24.38 million for the long-term and long-term contracts for this currency, which amounted to $289 million for the airhead.
Data released by the end of October of the same year increased the net amount of $164.1 billion to $453.1 billion for the first time in September.
The latter indicated that the foreign currency’s long-term and long-term air-conditioned capital reflects mainly the conduct of the foreign exchange with the foreign bank, meeting the requirements of its foreign debt portfolio, and will continue to provide long-term insurance products in accordance with the principle of necessity, which will have a lower impact on the future foreign exchange reserves.

From the point of view of the fact that, although most of the results were ultimately condemned by the public, by the administration of the public sector, and even by the fact that they were included in the list of true beliefs, the public still did not feel " hate " : why could they not be punished?
Why can't the place prevent its immorality and even illegal acts and then be punished?
And how is it that just a man's "sees the wrong way" for "the grand prince"?
The main reason for this is that only long-distance vehicles are equipped with police and short-distance vehicles are not generally available; even if there are police, many of the police are concerned about possible independent responses from the occupants and do not take forced action to remove them.
The incidents of torture, which have occurred since then, have made it clear that it is essential that the offenders be forced to leave the place and even punished.
This requires that our vehicle drivers be able to take strong measures at the right time, without the vehicle being driven, to prevent and combat violations as soon as possible.

To that end, the Ministry of Education has notified that new national labels are required to be implemented at the field of mass media in primary schools, which will be delivered after 1 November this year.
Compulsory national standards for "the field of primary-school composite materials-level movements" are organized by the Ministry of Education, 26 scientific and inspection institutes involved in the drafting of, for more than two years, the organization of more than 100 expert conference papers, as well as country-wide field studies, and the sampling of samples, and the collection of the evidence of hundreds of enterprise products on the market that do not count on the market.
In response to the 2005 mark of the country, the new country has found that not only from " national promotion standards " has become " national mandatory standards " , but has also increased many elements, including heavy demands, physical strength, ageing capacity, non-optimal content requirements, anti-smoker high concentrations requirements, physical quality limits, non-smoker and solid materials, etc.

Tin and Juju are friends and friends, both of whom are familiar with each other's art.
Whether it's ready or hot before the game, both sides look like the same.
In the course of the contest, two of them pointed out that they had completed their mission.
But there's a higher level of play between the middle of the game and the rain.
Firstly, the great experience of Tinn is a three-way lead, followed by the fall of Tinn's fall to 3-pound.
Then the failure of Jiang began to increase in the attack, and Tingin's arrest was three to five minutes ahead, and at 10:6 a.m. point.
Dinn's still using the ball at 11:9 a.m.
Second, the failure of the rain forest remains high, thanks to the advantages in its existence at 6:1 a long way forward.
In the case of rain falling after 2:7, the cycle changes to 2 minutes, and then the use of a step-by-step will be doubled to 8:9.
It's a key time. It's two minutes 11:8.
Thirdly, the two of them can be hit more closely by 3:3 p.m.
In the case of a further three-minute failed in the attack, however, she then used a three-point assault to score 6-pound.
The rain forest is two times the advantage, and at 10.8 points are taken first.
But Tinn's attack was very fatal, even after four seconds, and the third sentence was taken at 12:10.
The fourth floor, the raindrops opened at 4:2 a.m.
However, there was a strong attack on Jin after that, even after four minutes, the rain stopped.
When the rain stops, it's going to get back to 8:8 p.m.
It's a critical time. There's no software. It's only two minutes to win the race.
With the raindrops back out of the ball, Tinny 4:0 takes his arm.
In the last month, Tinn won a prize in Bulgaria and ended up in a 14-month-old championship, although she indicated that she had not set the goal of winning this game before, but in the mid-term finals of the morning, she said she had completed her mission.
The final victory of the Tin Winner team is raining down and getting the third world champion, and she is satisfied with her performance: "A champion is important to every activist.
I didn't think of it before, just say a piece of shit, decide to play or be very satisfied."
She said, "I think the whole game I've been dealing with with with is a great deal of work today, which has led to the lack of achievement of the goal of the defense. "
Active rural consumption, based on the conventional mechanism, is to clean the market, guide the health needs, and enhance access to agricultural consumption.
The data show that the potential for the continued release of the consumption of rural people, the growth in the number of rural consumptions in the last half of the year, by 10.5 per cent, has increased rapidly to 1.3 per cent of the city.
In a poor village in the western part of the country, there's only one convenient hotel in the village, some of the goods seem to have been known, "The Golden Fish" marked "Golden " , "Waan" became "Water " , and "Mountain" many of the goods.
In recent years, similar phenomena have appeared, some rural holiday brand names, named near, dressed in a similar way, have been false and can't be avoided.
A consumption survey report published in a city in the western part of the country showed that there was a serious problem with over 66 per cent of the users who bought over-crowded goods under the urban network, with more than half of them.
The sector in question has managed the rural market, it's crying every year. Why don't you still fight "Leagan"?
In contrast to the urban markets, the knowledge of agricultural protection is relatively weak, and many rural areas are far away, and there are areas in which control is not enough to allow counterfeit goods to have soil.
A multi-stakeholder commodity, a sectoral price, a controlled product, a regulated market, a functional breakdown, a year's holiday, a centrally controlled wind, a faucet, and a slow fall, just finished old holidays, and a new holiday.
Lack of long-term control mechanisms, difficulties in cleaning the rural markets, in violation of the law, and in great interest, have led some illegal merchants to trade the brains of the mountain village, and in some rural areas, to become " waste markets " .
From warm to healthy, large farmers are heading for development.
Earlier, the Central Party, the Ministry of State, issued a series of views on the improvement of the system of consumption and the increased potential of the population " , which suggested the promotion of the increase in the consumption of rural people with a view to enabling large farmers to consume " voluntary " consumption " , and to make rural consumption a reality.
There is a need for deepening reforms, eliminating multiple market regulatory barriers, multi-managed barriers, creating healthy food security, product quality monitoring networks, constantly blocking rural travel and selling spaces.
On the other hand, in order to increase law enforcement, to regulate " boneble blood vessels " , it is decided not to allow fraud to spread in rural areas.
The severe agricultural burden is the protection of agriculture, and no matter how many farmers are hidden, it should not be a reason for the existence of counterfeit goods, and the relevant sector should be clearly responsible, undermining the basic control force, and the issue of the division of responsibility, which is to be pursued, and which is to be left unattended by the seller.
Strong access to the market, strict review of the quality of the operators, movement of the market, road to products, road, basic means of thinking, the safety of legitimate vendors and the purchasing of the farmers.
Active rural consumption to lead to healthy consumption.
Along with increased consumption, many farmers have not only sought to eat, eat well, but also to pursue a high quality life, such as culture, health, and could not make rural markets with low-quality "Price".
This needs to promote the expansion of electronic commerce into large rural areas, promote the merger of both urban and retail channels, facilitate the integration of low-industry and online business platforms and support the growth of new industrial models into rural markets; promote the integration of goods and leisure industries, rural tourism and product processing; and improve the integration of existing rural communications networks, and effectively reduce the cost of rural flows.
Create a clean, sensitive market environment for rural areas and make farmers less anxious, and rural consumption grow more and more vulnerable, thus increasing access to and happiness to farmers' consumption.
