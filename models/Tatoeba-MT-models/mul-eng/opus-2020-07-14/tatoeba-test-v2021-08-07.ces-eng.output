I don't feel nervous.
I know a little about the fire.
Mary bought something.
Something tells me Tom's right.
Something's left.
We're ordering something.

You didn't pay attention.
Don't give me that!
Please don't give Tom a false hope.
Don't give it to Tom, he doesn't deserve it.
Don't give it to that bastard!
I recently met Tom here.
I recently met Tom and Mary in the supermarket.
He didn't give in to fear, and that kept him alive.
They don't make any problems because they live five patters on us.
Don't you worry about your notes?
Sunday is the last day of the week.
Don't make me better than I am.

According to the Tatoeby Guide, it is recommended to members that only add or translate in their native language or translate from their native language into their native language.

Education means learning what you didn't even know you didn't know.
Always be ready for the worst.
I'll always protect Tom from people like you.
He's always the first person to blame.
She's always in her room clean.
I always wondered what would happen if I did.

Take a look at the ceiling.
It's moving fast in winter.
Tom's life has changed a lot.
I remember I met him in Paris.
I remember reading about it.
I remember seeing you on the floor.
You remember?
Do you remember how we met first?
Remember when you first kissed me?
Do you remember?
Do you remember the day we first met?

I'll kill you.
I killed two mice once in the morning.
I killed them.
It killed him for processing.
I'm going to put it on the left.
I started writing a new book.
They started arguing about money.
I started reading the book that Tom hired me.
I started reading a new book.
You're starting to break up.
He started explaining what happened.
I spent my life in an incubator.
Be very careful with that.
He's acting like something to him.

The lockdown in the room started to burn.
Let's go!
Let's start a meeting here when Tom's here.
I'll start tonight.
I asked Tom not to do it.
Did you ask for a job in this company?
Did anyone ask me?
I want my money back!
I'm asking for the money back!

There's a big garden behind the house.
He took the game.
The West is still unsolved.
We took horses to the building.
He's missing those shooters.
It's funny.
How long will you be ready to leave?
For what purpose?
What team is Tom playing for?
I'd be interested in what Tom should have changed his mind.

Does that interest you?
You're interested in art?
The forbidden fruit tastes the best.
I bought a new computer.
The dog defeated the teacher.

"I care much about you," she admitted.
Please eat flowers.
The deposit was paid.
He's stuck on it.
Put it under the bed.
She fell in love with a Russian passenger.
Have you been in love with her for the first time?
To be kind is one thing, to take someone else's thing.
I put a gun on the ground.
She's locked up in his bedroom.
Did I close the main entrance?
I've been thinking about having this role right now.
Zanoch's lying.
I don't care about anything.
You paid more than she had.
You paid more than you had.
I paid the payment card.
You paid more than you had.
I'll pay for Tom's list.
Will Tom pay for it?
Please stop the radio.
Please shut down the radio.
Please stop the TV.
It would be dangerous to join Tom in this.
I forgot to tell you about Tom.
Did you forget everything we did for you?
Forget about it, they don't have it.
Forget about this sad experience.
Forget I said it.
You forgot to call Tom, didn't you?
He forgot her name.
I forgot to pick up the label on the label.
I forgot all about it.

Did I write everything correctly?
The rules do not contain oxygen.
I'm the last one to learn the truth again.
I've been playing chess again.
You're lying again.
You came back to your old ways again, Tom.
We'll see Tom again.
I heard someone talk.
I deserve good things.
I deserve to know the truth.
They deserve what they get.
You deserve good things.
We slept.
My heart stopped.
Will anyone stop dealing with people?
He shot himself because of the unhappy love.
I'll shoot him.
I'll shoot him.
I'll shoot both of you.
They dragged her into a coma and raped her.
While I was reading, I phoned.
While Tom was still asleep, Mary was already upstairs.
You can still be with me.
You're not doing anything yet.
Did the police arrest him?
Did you arrest Tom?
Shut the fuck up.
I'm not paying for this.
I won't pay for this.
That's what Tom's trying to do to you.
I can't go to Tom's meeting.
You have no responsibility for Tom's death.
Tom's mistake is that the whole group has been attacked.
I love you for that.
I'm not paid for that.
Three months ago Tom was dead.
They paid me five dollars for that bag.
She's got him.
I'll call you back when I get to the bus stop.
I'll call you later.
I'll call you back later.
I'll call you back later.
Call back.

We got rid of some old stuff.
Take care of the evidence.
She worshipped him.
I worship that ocean.
I love you.
The military industry brings profits, but also patience.
We've got the rest of the day for ourselves.
There's only one day left.

I don't agree to do this to me.
With all my heart, I hope he's happy.

I felt like I was in love with a beautiful girl.
I thought I changed my job.
I thought about the bike.
I thought about a colleague at work.
I thought about Tatoeb.

Tom seems to have lost the meaning of life.
He seems to know everything.
He seems to be neglecting his duties.
Looks like they're losing motive.

You're breaking up here.
She's wearing her face.
We can get a lot of valuable information from this book.
You're out of your mind.
That's why I wouldn't play.
Tom's a man now.
It's a waste of time.

It's usually the other way around.
I used to live alone.
I used to win.
You used to have no hot food every day.
You're used to everything.
