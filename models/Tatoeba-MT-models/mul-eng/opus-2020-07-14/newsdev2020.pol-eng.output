Bosnia and Herzegovina is protesting Croatia's plans on the stockpiling of mining wastes
In the fifth century, the people gathered in northern and western Bosnia in protest against the plans of neighbouring Croatia to store parts of waste from one in the nuclear region near the border with Bosnia and the main river known from natural beauty.
Democrats in the Bosnian city of Novi Grad asked Croatia for plans to build a waste storage warehouse in former military camps in the town of Gora and declared war on the project.
In the facility, wastes from nuclear power would be stored.
Bosnia and Herzegovina, which holds bananas with the letters "The Health of the Future" and "Stop – (the river) We need One", said that the storage of waste can threaten the Union's resources and life of some 250 000 inhabitants.
We have to say NO,
He told the poet Miroslav Drljaca, mayor of the Novi Grad.
We have to fight to protect our way of life and our Union.
Located in Slovenia, Krško electricity built in the 1980s is also located in Croatia.
Representatives of both countries should meet next week to discuss additional waste stocks.
Croatia's public television HRT announced on Friday that Croatia has not yet decided to build its own waste storage warehouse or to pay for the storage of parts of waste in the new building built by Slovenia.
Croatia's Minister for Environment and Energy Tomislav Coric told the journalists that Croatia also has a problem with the elimination of institutional wastes from schools, hospitals and prisons and hopes to find a complete solution.
In Bosnia, officials and residents of each country of the ethnic division were forced to find another location in the country’s area of electricity.
"Why does Croatia, throughout its territory, claim that it is the best place in Bosnia?" he asked Drljaca.
We can't let them down!

US Congress agreed to sell Poland 32 F-35 aircraft
The United States Congress, by the law of 15 days after the approval by the Department of State of any purchase by Poland, did not object to this transaction, which means that the last conditions were met before the start of the purchase negotiations.
The Congress's decision, although it was not surprising, is of great political importance.
"After the approval of the sale by the Department of State, and now by Congress, I see no more serious obstacles," said John V. Venable, former policy director of the Washington Defence, Conservative thought of the Heritage Foundation.
The expert explained that the Federal Government, represented by the Department of State, must inform Congress of each planned arms sale within 15 days of the signing of the contract if the value of such a transaction exceeds 50 million in the case of arms sales to a NATO Member State.
The value of the proposed transaction purchases 32 F-35 thinkers by Poland is estimated at $6.5 billion. This amount includes technical and logistical assistance costs, auxiliary equipment and pilot training.
The main F-35 aircraft supplier – if this transaction is finally finalized – will be an American army group Lockheed Martin, and its subcontractor is a power producer for F-35A group Pratt and Whitney.
Proposals for the purchase of American thinkers of the fifth generation F-35 on behalf of the Polish government were submitted in May by the Minister of Defence Mariusz Blászček.
Poland's offer was discussed in June of this year at the meeting of President Andrzey Dudy with President Donald Trumpe in the White House.
On the implementation of this agreement, if finalised, the representatives of the Pentagon will feel as part of the Foreign Military Sales Programme (FMS).
In the framework of the FMS Poland programme, it has already acquired, among other things, an anti-ractical system of Patriots.
The price of one of the F-35 thinkers at the time Poland made the purchase offer – without weapons and technical assistance – was about 89.2 million dollars.
As U.S. military experts who wanted to maintain anonymity informed PAP, the price given in earlier negotiations was “a maximum price, much higher than the price to be negotiated”.
"The prices fall fairly, at present the price of one F-35 is below $80 million, much less than Eurofighter, which has no F-35 tickets," said Venable.
The PAP speakers expressed the hope that the final transaction negotiations on the purchase by Poland of American warplanes will be completed this year.
The possible share of Polish subcontractors in this transaction – or offset – will be discussed directly with American thinkers F-35.
What is the replacement of the Münchhausen group, which is referred to in the series “Payton Hobarta” on the Netflix platform?
Caregivers and parents with a higher degree of anxiety believe that their child is sick.
The series “Selection of Payton Hobart” is currently available on the Netflix platform.
He tells the story of Payton Hobart, who wants to be president of the United States, but first he has to be the head of a student's own government in his high school.
In Ryan Murphy's series, "American Horror Story" and "Glee", we see Gwyneth Paltrow, Bena Platta and Lucy Boynton.
Without revealing too many details for those who have not yet had the opportunity to see the series, he goes on to the theme of the Münchhausen team – mental illness in the care of those who behave as if the health of the person concerned were affected by physical or mental illness.
There are various types of this disorder, such as the Münchhausen group, which is responsible for causing symptoms of this disease.
The successor of the Münchhausen group is to simulate that the person who remains under our care has certain duration.
It's also called a mental and communicable disease, and it's treated as violence against a child.
It's a rare disorder that usually involves a parent who has an underlying or causing symptoms, so it would seem that his child is sick.
What are the appearances of the Münchhausen team?
The symptoms of this disease may vary, but NHS takes into account the following examples of behaviour:
To convince a medical person that a child who looks healthy, however, feels bad.
Elevation or feeling symptoms.
Falsification of the results to make the child known for disease, e.g. glucose to test the brain, to make it look like the baby has diabetes.
Efficacy of symptoms of disease, e.g. by administering medicines and other substances to children.
How often do the Münchhausen alternates appear?
It is hard to imagine how often this disorder occurs because many cases of disease are not reported.
A study published in 2000 shows that 89 cases of this disorder have occurred in over two years for 100,000 people.
What should you do if there are doubts that a child may be in danger?
Contact the local special services department or call NSPCC child protection information, choosing number 0808 800 5000.
Nigeria: Nalot police at school in Kadunia, evacuation 300 children
Kaduna – Posterunek State Police in Kaduni performed yesterday at Imam Ahmad Bn Hambal school, located in Layin Maidubun Tsumma in Riga, Igabi, arrested seven teachers and evacuated about 300 children.

Each day, parents brought their children food and knew what the conditions were.
We have been particularly disappointed with the presence of police officers and the evacation of children, as well as the removal of the entire food supply provided by parents before the closing of the school.
That's not right, because parents can prove that their children are in bad conditions, as the police say.
He added that the former Police Commissioner Abdurrahman, who once visited the school to check the level of care for children, never had any caution.
He believed that the children were studying the Qur'an and nothing else.
However, police specialist Posterunk ds. Public Relations, Yakubu Sabo, felt that after the government was transferred, children would join their parents.
“They are held in humane conditions in the name of the submission or acquisition of the original knowledge.
A lot of them were close on their backs, which proves they're a bit bit.
That's why we're also looking for a school to get to know its owner," he added.

The murder of two children.
The attempt to kill four children and the whole speech to save their lives.
I am practically convinced that each of you will be punished on several occasions for the life-threatening deprivation of freedom."
It was decided whether it would be a free gift without the possibility of a conditional release.
The winner will be on the west 12th of November.
Business PO Krzysztof Brejz Possy of Caesar's Gmyza
"As a result of the campaign of writing lies, I'm on the ground against Caesar Gmyza," he reported on the Twitter site PO Krzysztof Brejza.
The invitation is due to the announcement by the audience of Caesar Gmyza in the program "Minule 20" on TVP antennas.
One of SokiemzBuraka's leading people is Krzysztof Brejza, who has a great experience in the organization of hate sharing.
"People who are perfectly aware of Mariusz Kozaka-Zagozdo – the holder of the "heyter" profile – are Kirwinski, Budka and Giertych," Gmyz said.
SokzBuraka is a social page and profile with memes and politics.
According to the profile of the title "Seci", the Presbyterians of Kozak-Zagozda are present.
"We have been able to find out that since April, Mr. Mariusz Kozak-Zagozda has been employed in the Warsaw City Office, in the marketing office," the weekly wrote.

Boris Johnson addressed to the police authority in connection with a close relationship with businesswoman Jennifer Arcuri
The competent authority of the IOPC police procedure shall examine whether the prosecution of the investigating prime minister has been authorized to prosecute criminal offences during the proceedings of a public office as a borough of London.
The Council of Great London (GLA) announced that its supervisor had registered "the issue related to the procedure" of the Prime Minister in relation to the charges of preferential treatment of Arcuri to result from their close knowledge.
‘The ‘procedure issue’ can be said when information indicates the possibility of committing a crime’ – he said.
It doesn't mean somehow to prove it.
IOPC will now consider whether it is necessary to examine this matter.
The issue was addressed to IOPC, which deals with the charges against members of the police in England and Wales.
She was transferred to this police monitoring body because Johnson was then acting as Commissioner of Police and Commissioner of Criminal Affairs.
Johnson refused to make any mistakes because of his close relationship with Arcuri.
He said earlier that he applied to the Council of the City of London and would give details on his relationship with Arcuri, but he insisted that the Council “comes to an improper problem”.
The order is followed by the “The Sunday Times” statement that Arcuri, an American who spent seven years in London, received $126,000 from the budget, and was also granted access to three foreign trade missions that were then wanted by the Mayor Johnson.
As a result, during the proceedings, the government frozen a contribution of 100,000 pounds to the Hacker House's Arcuri.
The court is waiting for a difficult question on the verification procedure carried out prior to the recognition of the fund.
The Ministry of Tourism, Matt Warman, told Zambi Gmin that his department's employees had "usually maintained due diligence" and that the company had a British telephone number.
However, according to numerous references to the number, it was transferred to the office in California, where it is currently located at the 34-year-old Arcuri.
A close relationship of the prime minister with a businesswoman was "for a secret police officer".
The decision of the GLA to assign the Prime Minister's case to an independent IOPC police office was met with a disagreement at 10 Downing Street.
According to the source of the environment, the highest level of representation of the government is "a politically motivated act", and its term, prior to the Conservative Party's conference, is "a clear political act".
"The inspector did not provide any evidence confirming the charges, and the Prime Minister did not receive a chance to give him an answer before the release of the press communiqué later on Friday," said the source.
Neither citizens nor the media are able to resort to such a clear political rule.
Today, the newspaper The Standard said that a close relationship between Johnson and a businesswoman from California, who assisted the London Tourism and Promotion Agency, was for the "secret police" workers.
The employees of the London & Partners Agency (L&P) (L&P) were above mentioned that Arcuri received a place during the cross-border commercial outputs of Johnson as a burmist, despite the fact that its company was then not considered “trustworthy”.
Thirdly accused of drug crime in connection with the death of Mac Miller
LOS ANGELES (AP) – As a result of the annual death of rapper Mac Miller, a third man was arrested and sentenced to the death of a drug offender.
According to the court documents, Stephen Walter is considered to be a sales of the dried oxycodon pills produced by fentanyl, which Miller had in his possession before his death in September last year as a result of the accidental overdose of cocaine, alcohol and fentanyl, or a strong opioid responsible for the “epedemia”, which claimed a few thousand human beings in the United States.
Walter is charged with the delivery of a chicken that another man, Cameron Pettit, sold to Miller.
The court documents published on Tuesday reveal that Petitt received drugs from Walter through the entire camp.
Ryan Reavis, who was arrested earlier this week in Lake Havasu City, Arizona, is expected to fulfill the role of the "kurera" Walter, who has provided Petitto's pills.
None of the men mentioned were charged directly about the cause of Miller's death, nor did any of them present a line of defence in his case.
Walter, subject to the 2005 drug exemption, has been arrested and has also been sentenced to five months of deprivation of liberty.
Critics who are concerned about the matter that was first brought to the fourth website dedicated to TMZ Celebrates are hoping that Walter will remain in custody waiting for the trial, claiming that there is a serious risk of the fugitive being charged.
The response to the message left to the automatic secretary of his lawyer has not come from immediately.
Petitto was arrested in the federal court on 4 September and his lawyer rejected his comment.
The words of the novelists of Miller's creations are a clear talk about his depression and drug use, which led him to win fans among the largest hip-hop stars.
From Pittsburgh Miller, who has truly been called Malcolm James Myers McCormick, for two years he has remained in contact with the singer Arian Grande, who ended earlier in 2018.
After his death in the Instagram portal, she published an exciting film with Miller's participation and the "Thank U Next", which she mentioned with love.
Miller is one of the music that has died in recent years with opioid abuse.
Matthew Roberts, a guitarist of the 3 Doors Down group, also died as a result of overdose in 2016, and the presence of fentanyl and hydrocodone was confirmed in his body.
In this article, a change was introduced: the correct spelling of Walter’s name is “Stephen” rather than “Steven”.
9-year-old Nigerians create more than 30 games on mobile devices
9-year-old will create a game of fun in the entertainment game with free application for Scratch 2 programming.
Scratch 2 allows users to create games, animations and stories online or offline.
Since then Basil has generated more than 30 games on mobile devices.
In today's game there's a problem that works according to the program.
The player gets a point every time he grabs a non-uper who gets out of the closet.
I learned to create a game on an accelerated course.
"Now I create them when I wake up," said Basil CNN.
In March, Dad wrote it on a five-year-old accelerated course for children aged 5 to 15.
The course organized by Codefest International was aimed at providing children such as Basil, access to new technologies such as robotics and virtual reality.
The father of the boy, Basil Okpar, says Basil played a lot on mobile devices.
“When he was four, I bought him a tablet because he always changed his phone and played it.
He played a lot at Candy Crush and Temple Run," said CNN's father.
But Basila's interest in the creation of the game grew when he was 7 years old and got a full-time prize for the game.
"One day he played on the tablet, as usual, and was so excited that I was bleeding," said the father.
I said, "You're still playing, aren't you able to think about creating your own games so they can't play?"
By saying these words, I was upset and I didn't think I'd take them seriously," he added.
From that time on, Basil showed an interest in the science of creating his own games, pushing parents to buy a laptop and write it to a course that he knew the basis for creating a game.
Basil, who wants to be a scientist in the future, gives his team titles based on their content.
One of his games, "Mosquito mask", is available in the Google game store.
Africa has the largest population of young people in the world, and, like Basil, this population has leadership in innovation on the continent.
Two Nigerian 12-year-olds were recently celebrated using codes to create jobs sharing their work at home.
In May, Acrobot from the mid-school women's school in Ghana won the Robofest 2019 competition for the programming of workers for the construction of the bridge.
And thanks to the growing investment of giants in technology, such as Google and Microsoft, in Africa, Basil and its allies are on a good path to the coding star career.
Former Presidents of the Republican Party in North Carolina agree to a lie on corruption
Of the five documents submitted in court, it appears that the Presidents of the Republican Party in North Carolina have admitted that he accused federal agents of investigating the corruption of the main political debtor.
According to Robin Hayes, he's gonna have to confess in the future environment.
The document containing the actual basis prepared under the defence agreement and signed by the Lawyer Hayes reveals that Hayes knew that it was a false statement by FBI agents investigating corruption in 2018.
The defense agreement has been maintained, and on the basis of fact, it does not result in the approval of Hayes.
Initially, he was accused of lying talk, corruption, and fraud.
The prosecutors accused the former Hayes Congress of participating in the plan of the insurance company’s management of the campaign to the main in the country of the insurance market regulator in exchange for special treatment.
Director Greg Lindberg and his two fellow members were charged with trying to buy a position of Commissioner Mike Causeya's insurance.
Lindberg is the founder of the insurance and investment firm, one of the main political donors who has transferred over $5 million to national and federal candidates and committees since 2016.
He supported the main objectives and policies of the Republican Party, but also transmitted data to the Democrats.
His lawyer did not respond to a fifth e-mail message asking for a comment.
Hayesa Kearns Davis did not respond to a fifth email message requesting a comment.
Of the five documents submitted, Hayes reported that he lied to FBI agents in August 2018 when he said he didn't talk to Causey about staff of the State Insurance Department.
According to the document containing the actual basis Hayes actually spoke to the Commissioner for Insurance on Lindberg's request for a change in the staff employed by the market regulator.
The prosecutors claim that Hayes also helped Lindberg to organize a meeting with Causey and that he spoke directly to the regulator.
According to the Quartet Act, Lindberg demanded special treatment of his insurance activities and planned to transfer up to $2 million to the Causeya again in 2020.
The complaint is based on the request of the department’s official who controlled Lindberga.
The Republican Causey has reported a series of attempts to corrupt federal agents and has helped them collect evidence on the matter.
He wasn't given any guarantees.
According to the Lindberg report, the Community ordered Hayes to transfer $250,000 to the Causeya campaign during the talks in which Lindberg and Causey were present.
During the conversation Hayes initially protested, saying that the transfer of such a amount of money would draw attention, but as a result of the complaint, he finally took a stand.
"Coolwik, you want to do it all, we will do it," Hayes said under the charge.
"All right, I'll take care of it."
The Federal Prosecutor's Office did not respond to an e-mail request for further information on the agreement.

Part of the Sopocky Street in the Netherlands already after construction
On Tuesday, 24 September, the Sopock Street was dedicated to the operation in the Netherlands.
The total value of this task was 803 thousand gold, from which 26 thousand gold was financed by the FDS, while the remaining amount remained, the contribution of its own resources from the Netherlands and Gmin and the City of the Netherlands.
By means of these measures, it was possible to carry out among other surfaces at a length of 1284 metres along with its extension, a walkway at a distance of 950 metres, a departure and a final work.

Facebook with user self-sustaining tips will hide the number of kisses
During the first time in the world of experimenting to improve user self-response, some of the people who use Facebook will soon not see the number of people who love, react and show video.
The popularity will be hidden and visible only for the author of the post, and this change will be applied to Australia following the similar test implemented on Instagram in July.
A new version of Facebook will also be launched in Australia in the near fifth.
Mia Garlick, director of Facebook's privacy in Australia, said that changes are the result of self-sustainment research and the opinion of mental health experts indicating that the number of kisses can be compared with others.
"The response of many of the groups working with us to fight the ban, as well as the mental health organization, was really positive," Garlick said.
Elevating this number makes people group on the quality of their interactions and on the quality of their content, not on the number of kisses or reactions.
It is expected that sharing with others via the platform will be more pleasant and will not be taken as a waste – she said.
Garlick assured that companies that are supporting Facebook activities will continue to receive the same indicators and observations that were available to them.
She said it was too early to determine whether the test would be extended to other countries, such as the site with Instagram, when the test covered Australia, Canada, Brazil, New Zealand, Japan, Italy and Ireland.
As in the case of Instagram, which belongs to Facebook, there is no indication when the experiment ends and whether the change will be made permanent.
"The initial comments of users on the new rules on Instagram were positive, but at this stage we continue to learn and listen to the opinion," she said.
Speaking of the world experiment site, Garlick said Australia has very active, technically well-known Facebook and Instagram users.
We believe that it is an amazing country that provides us with overwhelming views that indicate whether the new experience is valuable to those who benefit from our services or not.
Frequent: The workers want to be compensated for by the Pilgrims
The frequency which does not, in the event, make a comment on the application of the requests made to that metropolis by Abpa Wacław Depo for the transfer of financial compensation for the service of the independent economy in the Pilgrim season.
The city is offering 1 piece of chicken.
On Friday, he spoke at the press conference with the leader of Wisny Robert Biedronia, who was organized on the leading side of the Light Mountain of the Commons and the Most Holy Mary Panny, the vice president of the city council and candidate to Sejm Łukasz Kot.
As he reported, on the day before, the local SLD council announced an appeal to Abbey Wacław Depo for the transfer of one gold city from each visit to the Common Pilgrim – to support the work of local, municipal, etc.
We accepted an appeal to the Archbishop Depo to help the city, to help us get rid of the pillars, to check the city for the Pilgrims.
"We ask for a transfer to the budget of the symbolic gold city from each pillar.
This city will provide them with a better living conditions in the Commons," the Vice-President of the City Council said.
The comment made by Mr. Mariusz Bacalarz, who was asked to comment on the frequency of the metropolitical comment, was initially prepared by Mr. Mariusz Bacalarz, but then asked – as he suggested – to replace it with information on the content: “We will not refer to the case until the official position of the city council has been obtained.”
According to the project on the part of the often-owned appellant to Depo, "the delivery of financial compensation for the city of Commons for the use of the local waste management system during the Pilgrim season".
"In view of the growing number of people arriving in the Common Pilgrims and the growing costs of the municipal waste management system during the Pilgrim season, given the vision of the city between the inhabitants and the inhabitants, the people, the fishermen and the peacocks, we wish, within the framework of the generally accepted canons, to offer our common good, small child, the Common Commons, to promote participation in the costs of services under the laughing system," the appeal adds.
“To maintain in the appropriate condition the purity of foot-and-mouth long-dry tyres, which are moving simultaneously with small infrastructure, i.e. external waste costs, we present a proposal for a symbolic participation in the public waste management system in the amount of 1 malt from poultry”, it was written.
"In addition to participating in annual costs, which will cover the city's own resources, with regard to the cleanliness and aesthetics of the local area, and also with a desire to emphasize that such cooperation will benefit all parties, we declare that 20% of the amount will be allocated to improving tourism infrastructure, e.g. by increasing the number of available public toilets," said the Council.
They noted that, in addition to the financial issues, their proposals resulted from a number of complaints by the residents regarding the state of the road in which the passengers move.
"In view of the concern about the purity of our city and possible positive effects of cooperation, the City Council of Commons shall appeal to the Archbishop of the Common Customs Tariff for the transfer of financial compensation to the City of Commons for the service of the municipal waste management system during the summer season," the appeal was repeated.
According to information from the Press Office of Jasnei Gory throughout the year, 834 thousands of people participated in this sanctuary in the 200 universal pilgrimages.
About 124 thousand faithful ones arrived at 255 platoons of sand.
More than 8,8 thousand people came to the House of Commons in wheelchairs (133 groups), and 440 (16 groups) in refugee camps.
Less than 20 people reached the sanctuary of the horse, and over 170 Pilgres of the two groups were on wheels.
"Visibility" TVP referred to the Confederation in a statement of the probe
According to a poll carried out by Pollster, 45% of the votes in favour in the elections to Sejm Pis, KO 26%, Lewica 14%, PSL 7%, and Confederation 5%.
The extension of the electoral procedure was even written on the “Super Express” portal for which the trial was conducted.
In the main edition of the “Visibility”, describing the same probe, only four first parties were represented, with the full mention of the Confederation.
Inspector Edyta Lewandowska clearly stressed that only four committees had crossed the electoral line and would enter the Seym.
The TVP also showed a share of the same mandates without taking into account the votes allocated to the Confederation.
It would give the Pis to self-government.
Kristoff Bosak, in his comment on the whole situation, spoke of "public compromise on honesty towards society".
“They started with the phrase ‘the moral revolution’,” he recalled and said that this was a sign of weakness.
In addition, Robert Winnicki wrote on Twitter that the “TVP visibility” in further actions against the Confederation undermines Urban and Michnik.
He also drew attention to the lack of the reaction of the right journalists.
"But let us also look at those who call for mercy.
Those "true", "indefinitely", "incorrigible".
In a few years, they have become a more primitive version of everything they fought at night," he added.

Brother sentenced to life-threatening murder by the social media star Kandeel Baloch
Kandeel Baloch, who became a star through a photo published in social services, was impressed in July 2016.
The brother of the Pakistani social media star Kandeel Baloch was convicted on Friday of her murder and sentenced to life imprisonment for the most famous murder in that country.
Baloch, who won the fame, publishing the ridiculous self-satisfactions – Greek according to Western standards, but in a strong mystical Pakistani thought to be a proponent – was defeated in July 2016.
Her brother Muhammad Waseema was arrested.
A few days later, he said during the press conference that there was no summary of his actions and said that he “of course” had murdered his sister and that her conduct was “unacceptable”.
His lawyer Sardar Mehmood told the AFP that the court in the western city of Multan recognized his client as a wine and sentenced him to life in a long waiting period of time.
"Inshallah (if God permits), will be brought to trial by the Supreme Court," he said.
Previously, Baloch's mother, Anwar May, promised AFP that she hoped her son would be united.
"He's innocent.
It was my daughter, and this is my son," she said.
Baloch's murder took place on the grounds of the world's information services and renewed calls for action against the epidemic of honor killings in which victims, usually women, are killed for broken patriarchal social rules.
Women were shot, baby, they were shot or beaten for crimes such as choosing their own husband or, as Baloch did, bringing their family to the "right" through the manifestation of their own sexuality.
Murders are usually committed by close blood.
According to Pakistani law, Qisas (blood money) and Dayat (Odwet) can ask for the closest sacrifices for forgiveness.
Three months after Baloch's murder, Parliament adopted a new legislation imposing a life sentence for the murder.
However, whether the murder will be recognized as an act of honor remains in the court's hands, which means that the murderer can theoretically resign for other reasons and be united.
In the case of Baloch, her parents at first insisted that their son should not be shown pity in any case.
However, they feel that they can also lose him, change their mind, and say that they want to join him.
The international threat caused by the murder has led the Palestinian State to take a unprecedented step and declare itself a loser with parents, requiring the same concentration of the future.
Baloch is one of the most famous achievements of Baloch is to offer a strip to the Pakistani crew of cricket and to put up a dedicated cleaning sink in Walentinki.
She was criticized and threatened, but many people, including young people, looked at her as a humiliating restriction in a country where the emphasis on becoming a model to Kim Kardashian might be considered a funny and political movement to strengthen the position of women.
The root causes of “honorous” murder are inherited social standards that continue to dominate in South Asia, and in particular it is customary for women to maintain, although men can also be victims.

Anarchia doubles the number of people living in northern and western Nigeria to 40 thousand: UNHCR
On Friday, the United Nations said that the growing violence has led to double the number of people living in northern and western Nigeria to about 40 thousand people in the last four months.
The United Nations Children's Fund stated that concerns created a "new exceptional humanitarian situation", which requires inter-agency efforts to meet up to $35 million by the end of the year.
Babar Baloch, spokesman of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, said that the Islamic group of Boko Haram, which has been ruling in the north of the country for decades, is not responsible for the last attack.
The increase in violence in the Nigerian states of Sokoto, Zamfara and Katsina has been observed during the last 10 months is a rare result of organized armed groups.
"It's a frightening picture of anarchy and uncertainty," said the newspaper on Friday.
He reported frequent reports of rapes, tortures, tortures, murders and sexual assaults on the back of victims, who also destroy homes and stolen property.
Military and police were sent to fight the gangs of criminals in the region.
However, the military has been withdrawn from the fight against Boko Haram and the invasion of the Islamic state in West Africa, which broke out of its former group in 2016.
"Employers don't come with the names of the groups," he said.
They're coming for this with the original stories.
The arrivals in most of the country are moving to the neighboring Nigro.
In his statement, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees said that it is expected that more people will flee to Niger in the coming months together with the deteriorating security situation, particularly in the state of Sokoto.
A new date for the male accused of killing women and 2 children has been identified
A new date of discussion was planned for a man accused of killing the inhabitants of the state of Iowa and her two children from Guatemala.
The Court of Justice of Poland has ruled that 31-year-old Marvina Escobar-Orellan is charged with three murders at the first level, as claimed by the authorities, with a false name originally given by the police: Marvin Esquivel-Lopez.
He didn't admit to guilt.
The police thought he killed 29-year-old Flores-Rodriguez, her 11-year-old daughter and 5-year-old son on the 16th of July in their house in Des Moines.
The Court of Justice concluded that the new date of the proceedings, i.e. 27 January, would give the representative more time to prepare.
The U.S. Immigration Service officials claim that Escobar-Orellan lives in the United States illegally and has been deported twice before the shooting.
In 2010, he was sentenced to illegal entry into the United States.
“The Sun”: Boris Johnson, in the light of the building of the office to reduce requests for Brexit and achieve a compromise agreement with Brussels
Within three weeks of the final visit of the EU leaders among the most important people in the country around the Prime Minister, they are concerned that he does not have enough time to get the most important lessons.
Boris Johnson is faced with the risk of a rebellion by an agency that seeks to reduce requests in connection with the patent and the achievement of a compromise agreement with the EU.
In the negotiations, a new customs system was created, which would be a substitute for the backstop mechanism for Ireland, because Bruksela identified proposals for other provisions offered by Johnson as "unconventional".
Ministers of the Crown expect the EU's decision-makers, who are headed by German Prime Minister Angela Merkel, to offer to the criticised tour guide a compromise as a three-year time limit for the implementation of the backstop mechanism.
Journalists The Sun spoke with three different branch ministers, all of whom are preparing to meet with the prime minister after the annual tour conference next week in Manchester.
They will be welcomed by the Prime Minister of the "aggressive" strategy developed by his close adviser Dominica Cummings, who is trying to use the EU’s bluefinance and threaten to leave the Union without agreement, and then accept the offer made by the Union at the latest.
One of the ministers of the office identified the same judge as the Supreme Court, which was based on the conclusion of the suspension of the Parliament as a "a warning signal" and added: "The only way we can leave the European Union on 31 October is to do so on the basis of the agreement.
We're never going to make arthmetics in Izbie Gmin, who's working on our disadvantage.
The prime minister must now take over and accept what is available.
Violence doesn't pay: it's obviously Cummings' plan burned on the floor.
We can't beat the battle on so many fronts.
The second Minister of the Agency has committed himself to convey to Johnson to try to break the agreement of former Prime Minister Theresy May if he does not say anything else.
The minister said: "If I have to, I will tell the Prime Minister to introduce again the agreement proposed by Theresa May in Izbe Gmin."
There are numerous opportunities for her to make a statement, and it is all very important to finish this.
If we're forced to extend the term, it's the end of Boris Johnson and the end of all of us.
John Major accused Boris Johnson of not treating negotiations seriously.
In the opening talk, the first Minister of Tourism said: “The Prime Minister tells us he wants a deal with the European Union.
But we can't see him sitting in Brussels and working on it.
Instead, he works with the Sczkocian tents, checks the eggs in Wallia and sits with the citizens on the main streets of the city – all in the eyes of the world, as if the campaign of the electoral campaign had already taken place."
The current prime minister admitted yesterday that the contract was still broken and added: “No one should have any merit: to ensure a very long-term agreement. ”
However, the speaker also said that the law of Benna introducing a three-month Brexit Deployment in the absence of the agreement "actually weakens our negotiating position" in Brussels.
He said: “There is no doubt that this law makes negotiations difficult for us, but despite the fact that the Prime Minister, along with his colleagues, is still trying to make progress through hard work."
The Secretary of the Brexit Stephen Barclay is returning to Brussels today, where more discussions will take place with Michel Barnier on the EU side.
They will talk about how the area is functioning for all of Ireland for food and food.
The dog without his nose and his legs is submerged by Instagram.
Perfectly imperfect
The customer was supposed to be successful.
But he managed to stop it.
Suczka was transferred from Romania to Great Britain by Beacon Animal Rescue Centre.
The picture of the dog was published on Facebook.
Kate Comfort fell in love with the animal from the first sight.
"In the beginning, I had difficulty convincing my husband to adopt, because we already had three dogs," she said.
The woman decided to take care of the cat until someone doesn't.
But no one has yet reported.
"The fact that no one wanted her, made me want to take care of her more and more.
She was touched and needed love," Kate said.
At the end of the marriage, Bonnie decided to take it.
"Our Bonnie is perfectly imperfect.
We love her the way she is, and if anyone doesn't like how she looks, it's his problem, not ours," said the woman.
In time, Bonnie became a social media star.
Instagram, it is observed by more than 14 thousand interns.
Lorraine Kelly: I've been told that I'll never do a career on television with a music accent
According to Lorraine Kelly, TV bosses said that because of the actor from Glasgow, "he'll never make a career" as a president.
Referring to his 35-year-old career in the television industry, Kelly, in 59, admitted that before her first appearance on the screen she felt “very depressed”.
"I was just 25 years old and I was very upset," she said.
When I was working in BBC Scotland as a research and research specialist, the chief said that I would never succeed on television with my Glasgov accent.
I went to London to get to know all the TV companies and watch the program before I took over my duties at the Glasgov office.
I'll never forget the story of Bette Davis star conducted by Anne Diamond and Mike Morris of that hand.
I didn't believe I was in the same room with a living legend.
I knew I wanted to stay here.
Before Kelly became an excellent TV correspondent in 1984, she started her career as a local journalist in East Kibride, Scotland.
Then she started running programs such as “GMTV”, “ITV Breakfast” and “Daybreak” to start with her early program “Lorraine”, which he named after her name.
35. The anniversary of your career is a special program that will remind you of your best memories and experiences.
The president said that her long-term course on television is "passion and enthusiasm" and "frequency", adding: "It's hard to work.
To be honest and authentic.
Prepare for programmes and be both interesting and interesting.
When she recalls the media reports that hurt her emotions, Kelly appears to have been "very difficult" for her to have a relationship with the castle in Dunblane.
I didn't realize that many families of killed or injured children were watching our life program from Dunblane the day after the terrible murder of sixteen children and their teachers.
One of the mothers, Pam Ross, whose 5-year-old daughter Joanna was murdered, asked me for a private meeting during which we had been talking in her house for hours.
The whole meeting took place after the silence, and Pam Ross and I will have friends from the moment Johnny's funeral where I took part.
She added that "very difficult" was a report by Kate and Gerry McCannami shortly after their daughter Madeleine was destroyed in 2007, and that "it really looks at their strength and attitude."
They have to deal with the pain because they don't know what happened to their beloved daughter, and in addition, add the worst comments of Internet trolls.
I'm with them all my heart.
The program from the 35th anniversary of Lorraine Kelly's work on television begins at 8:30 a.m. Monday, 30 September at the ITV station.
Zimbabwe: Chiwenga feared commitments
The above-mentioned state official claimed that Vice-President Constantine Chiweng rejected the offer to take the office of President David Mugabe, a non-living President, in his discretion, because he was afraid of commitments to confirm the take-up of the military in November 2017.
As presented last week by The Zimbabwe Independent, Mugabe offered Vice-President Chiwende to take over the presidency during his military negotiations.
However, in the social media, a higher level of government officials announced that Chiwenga did not reject offers of fear, but because he had looked at Mugabe's plan to use it to prove to the world leader and the African Union (AU) that he had actually lost during the transition.
In support of the Twitter portal, which confirmed that the 37-year-old Governor of Zimbabwe had sought to transfer the authority of Vice-President Chiwende, not President Emmerson Mangawae, Jammanda 2, to which the state officials confirmed that he was the highest official in the Office of the President and Council of Ministers, it was said that there were intensive negotiations on this matter at that time.
The authorities said Mugabe contacted Chiweng through one of his envoys when he found out that the government was holding his hand.
The media between the military and the dead president had a higher rank of state officials, three stages.
The official said that among the negotiating participants was President George Charamba, a person who was at the time a member of the Central Organization's Chief Aaron Nheper and a spiritual representative of the Roman Catholic bishop Fidelis Mukonori.
The Chief of the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe, Gideon Gono, was the next element since Mugabe sent him with a single mission to deliver the bids to the president of Chiwende, who was chief of the Zimbabwe Defence Force (SOZ).
A man who, after his death, was considered more than an icon of Africa, was simply trying to get from the U.S. military support, trying to force other African leaders to intervene.
The offer of the President, made by the deceased Chief Defence Force (SSO) of Chiwenze, did not result in the election.
"It was a desperate act to save a situation that took a dangerously early time, removing part of the dead family," wrote the official (Jamunda).
But there was also some political imprisonment that helped the dead to turn the situation completely non-deplomat.
It is sufficient to remind yourself that the witnesses have stated that they did not deny and rejected the constitutional order that would lead to their conflict with the U.S. position on the conversion.
The dead (Mugaba) hoped that the SSO (Chiweng) would be brought in gradually, utterly by interrupting the claims of the leaders that they had not forgotten the constitutional order.
The hope for the dead (Mugab) was that the UA, which, on the other hand, continued to be highly disappointed with the whole situation and how to adapt it to its theoretical taxonomy of conversion, would not have to be a different choice than to describe it as a reverse, so that calling for military intervention would be credible.
In such a spirit, and with such an expression, the offer was made.
The authorities claimed that Mugabe made this move when he felt that the defence forces were no longer ready to protect him.
They said Mugabe was forced to sign a remand list after the driver warned that he was risking a line in Kaddafi's style.
The Chiefs told him they won't turn their guns against the citizens if they're moving to his Blue Roof residence.
And at the same time, Mugabe had two wishes to save his family and prove that the military was over," the officer added.
The temporary SSOs and the witnesses read the premises correctly.
The messenger (Gono) who delivered this desperate message was given an understanding – through a powerful metaphor – that the thi si si si si si si siri vemakapa-makwapa (we belong to the camouflage section), we are not politicians or we are not competing with each other at political level, has claimed a higher level of government officials.
The authorities of the state say that the military has informed military commanders in the region by means of attacks in Zimbabwe that they are not intended to defend Mugabe but to deal with the “criminists” surrounding him.
Mugabe has tried to use the same strategy to restore Mangagw back from a short withdrawal in the Republic of South Africa so that they can talk about the return and success.
In addition to negotiations with the army, Mugabe also sought assistance in the region.
The inhabitants of the South African Republic, which is the key element of the process – not only because of its economic and regional prosperity, but also because of the fact that current President Jacob Zuma was the president of Sadc – refused intervention, but clearly indicated that if the army comes to Mugabe's home as often as it was in the ground, the South African army will suddenly appear in Harare.
"It didn't work because Putin and the African leaders didn't choose this route," said the Independent, a certain informant.
China needs strong leadership or is “missing” as the policy document states
China needs a strong, unfavourable leader of the Communist Party, since otherwise the country is "dissolved" – the government has established a document on the policies issued on Friday in the preceding 70th anniversary of the creation of the People's Republic.
In the White Paper, the Chinese Press Office pointed out that the country's success since the conquest of power by the Communists 70 years ago led to the party's presidency.
China has a large area, it has complex national conditions, but it rarely sees administrative difficulties.
The document reminds us that without the uniform and strong leadership of China, they will move to the side of divisions and disintegration, which will be disastrous for the world.
In resolving problems, the Chinese authorities have long been using the hard hand policy, such as in the case of pro-democratic protests in Beijing in 1989, reasoning that it is necessary to maintain the country's stability.
The strong hand of President Xi Jinping, who is on the side of the world's second year trade as well as the world economy, has strengthened the government of the party since the end of 2012, and has imposed sanctions on those who can question power.
Xi also oversees the military modernization programme that has disappeared from the balance of the region.
The document stated that China did not attempt to export its development model, nor did they want to import any foreign models, leading only to room, not to "hegemonia".
Chinese have no genes like other nations or domination over the world.
In modern times, China has been plagued by great forces, and wars and disturbances have severely affected them as a result of the suffering they have experienced; China will never put up with any other suffering they have experienced.
China is dealing with this year at some time for a country that has been accustomed to the Great War of Trade with the United States and which is facing challenges for the sake of the economy, as well as anti-government protests in China Hong Kong.
The document says that China never "transmitted" its most important interests, nor does it allow anything to damage their sovereignty.
With regard to the trade dispute between Washington, the document stated that "the danger of trade wars and further increase in customs tariffs does not lead to problems".
China has grown up with a full industrial system, a full range of industries, a broad market place and a strong pace of economic development.
The document added that "wars will never weaken her".
China is sure to be able to cope with difficulties, to replace the crisis in new circumstances and to open a new world.
It was also added that the United States should take a reasonable view of China's development, as China does not intend to question the United States position, nor does it want to replace the United States.
The United States can't control China, and it's even less likely that they're maintaining China's development.
The restriction and weakening of other countries and the transfer of national differences beyond the border will not provide the United States with a strong position.
World of Jack Palliweitz: Deep, real faces
The Dubai emeritus is still searching for its own identity, divided between the Beijing tradition, religious radicalism of Islam and extreme progress.
This marked new trends in the world's tourist leader reflects imagery and ambition, easeling the simplicity of the so-called snobic hotels and attracting fortune seekers of investors and traders to the status of tax space.
The internet is an enthusiast to this city of March, which will be an exciting holy luxury and an intense concentration of twenty-one-year-old architecture.
They grew up on the rich in the sands of Eden for those who love the rest, the five-star hotels, the beautiful condition and the base of hundreds of meters above the ground.
Many are attracted by this universal appeal, appreciation of creative hyperactivity and Histeriority for accompaniment.
This is the city whose motto says everything: “Sacrifice, mourn, and observe. ”
And that's almost every step.
But there are also those who can look at the critical Dubai, calling it a city without character.
According to British writer Lawrence Osborne, “the total darkness and contrast between the metropolis has taken on the size of the thin clay. ”
It was transformed into a future nightmare, totally dominated by the Guinness Book of Records, an informal constitution of the emir.
Because there must be more and more comfortable here than anywhere else in the world.
However, there is a lack of something that may be a little transparent in old Europe, but is important for the quality of life.
In Wrocław, Berlin or Madrid, everyone feels like in his home.
And in Dubai, I'm sure not.
Running away from the world of time, I threw off his gold mask, revealing other forms of artificial paradise.
Faces that don't speak loud and don't write.
I'm showing the Azat's nest contrasting with the barren conditions of the God-giver's ethnic dubies, unwritten beduins.
I'm staying in a dark place of poverty, for example, in a ghetto on the outskirts of the city, where, under harsh conditions, the army of Asian workers lives.
This is exactly what they have built during one generation under the adverse conditions of the desert of Manhattan.
They came here with good jobs and the opportunity to give their family a good life, and they stopped gambling.
This tourist will never see it because it could be spent in the air created by the years of Miss Dubai.
The growing criticism of international society makes the issue of labour increasingly difficult for the emir.
Mel C from the Spice Girls team ordered in her home a discussion about diets after her meals with food disturbances
Melanie Chisholm from the Spice Girls team admitted that there is a ban on the use of diet in her home after she herself struggled with eating disorders, eating only fruit and vegetables.
Sports Spice has not been able to eat and “absolutely exercise” over the years because of the pressure of being a famous member of the world's pop group, which has led to later depression and malnutrition.
She now reveals that her life is affected by the way Scarlet raised her daughter, so she “does not allow her to talk about diets in her home. ”
"Scarlet is now 10 years old, and I'm starting to realize that she's more aware of her appearance," said Mel.
"I believe that one of the advantages of experience of eating disorders is that I am very aware of how I am speaking to her.
The use of a positive language has now become my habit.
In a report for the Women's Health Mel magazine, who received the fame in the 1990s as a member of the Spice Girls team, she said that in the days before social media arose, comments on her topic were made on her complex.
"I have tried to look at myself inappropriately, refusing from certain groups of food products, making it more and more serious until I began to feel uncomfortable," he says.
"I was sick, and it's probably been a couple of years."
A photo that was inspired by the world
Polish girls and American documentaryists have given the world a witness to war cruelty.
Legendal photo of Julian Bryana can be seen in Museum II World War II in Gdańsk
"Listen to my story.
I'm talking from the remote town of Warsaw.
I can and must speak on behalf of the Polish people about what happened here.
America has to work, it has to help!", began its radio show documentaryist, photographer, Julien Bryan.
In a tragic, September 1939, he was in the Polish chair, watching the drama of a bombed city and its inhabitants.
His relationship turned out to be a broad escape in the West.
President Warszaw Stefan Starrzyński first helped him, hired a car, but then asked him to leave for his own safety immediately.
Brian wrote a letter to the family in the United States, put it in the embassy's safe, and... he left.
For the next four weeks, he tried to be everywhere where he was going.
400 aircraft and artillery attacked the city almost non-stop.
Bryan's been on pictures of death, suffering, battle to survive in the city's dark.
Before the occupation, he and his embassy staff had been exposed to negative weather conditions.
He didn't stop talking about Hitler's crimes.
He said to the world: “What has happened to Warsaw, the meeting of Paris, London, and even New York. ”
His touching chronicle looked at President Eleanor Roosevelt.
Soon the United States began to prepare for war.
"Dad showed the truth and thus fought against the German propaganda.
They made films glorifying their curiosity.
They said they didn't attack women and children, and people believed them," says Sam Bryan, Julien's son.
Report before the Court of Auditors against the numerous fraud charges
In the face of the threat, the process of failure was carried out by the university team in Delaware, with numerous sexual assaults on the ground.
On Friday, after 10 days of the presentation and hearing of the arguments of the members of the team of prisoners, the 23-year-old Clay Conawaya joined in the polling.
A woman who was 21 years old said Conaway raped her when she went to his house in June 2018.
The event took place three weeks after the close of this two-man friendship on the side of the Bumble meeting and sent a woman through the man's picture on which he presented himself.
The woman is one of the six accused of sexual assault on Conawaya in the years 2013-2018.
It seems that the prosecutor’s plea that the woman had agreed was in vain, as opposed to what she had met.
The defenses call for conflicting relations between women and women, and they say that the woman is probably grieving that she has reached an intimate relationship.
Gold on two balls: Polish rower for millions of gold
Covered with gold rower value millions of gold could be seen on the jubilee, 10th edition on the International BIKE-EXPO Rower Targets.
This is an unusual vehicle printed on the 3D printer.
His constructioner, 30-year-old Adam Zdanowic, just got him a Rower Oskar at the World Exhibition of Custom Rowers in Las Vegas.
- Rower is covered with a gold napkin, under it is the highest silver sample.
It's an extraordinary kiss made by my colleague from Zor.
"It's a chair, they're a pedal, it's a driver, it could be normal for him to drive.
It can develop speed 50 kilometers per hour.
It's an electric wheel," says his designer.
"Karoseria Rower has been printed on 3D printer.
It's six forms of faith.
I came to the idea of this model eating my first bike home a few years ago.
I put him on the map and hid him deep in the trash.
Sucky's been waiting for five years to make it happen.
He's been on his own for three years," adds Adam Zdanowicz.
"It was extremely difficult to hide all the elements under the car.
There are batteries, guides, elements that create construction.
This is hidden under the cart listed in 11 elements on the steel frame.
There's a train in there, too.
The driver for this bike was set up a week before my departure to the United States at the World Rower Station.
At last, I couldn't decide what kind of leader this should be.
She's in transport.
Rower weighs 90 kilograms," he adds.
The covered gold mine was awarded in Las Vegas the most important category of competition "The Best Unique Customs Model".
Film material shows strong pollution of popular tourist sites
So Sydney, surrounded by the opera building, the Circular Quay port, the Luna Park entertainment park and of course the beautiful Harbour Bridge offers its important contribution to $22.9 billion, annually supported in the Australian economy by tourists visiting Sydney.
However, under the bridge is a treasure of truth.
The Sydney port is one of the most affected waterways in the country, with an annual level of pollution equal to about 15 Olympic pools.
These frightening statistics make one of our biggest tourist attractions at the same time one of our coldest waters.
According to the new film material entitled “Sydney Bridge – Up and Down, ” the waters in the most popular city of Australia are full of gaps, plastic chains and bottles, lost bottles and parts of clothing, and even dead animals, and all of this is due to the flood along with the rivers.
However, most of our navigational channels are plastic.
"I'd call it a paradox," says Dr. Katherine Dafforn, deputy director of the study programme Sydney Harbour Research Program, on 27 September, and the publication of this film is intended to take place during World Tourism Day.
The Akwen looks beautiful, but it's one of the most changed and damaged to see the river along our coast.
The CSIRO agency estimates that about 1560 kg of plastic is delivered to our waterways, and most of it is affected by noise channelling.
"After such powerful attacks... it looks pretty tragic," said Dr. Dafforn.
Two-thirds of the waste comes from the riverbanks.
However, as in the case of the rising water problem with Sydney, it is much more serious than the surface of the water, as 70% of the plastic that reaches the ocean at the bottom of the sea.
"I believe that unless it does not take time under the water, you can't really know what's in the deep," said Richard Nicholls, owner of the Dive Centre Manly, pointing out that he and his group are getting out of the water alone about 500 kg of plastic a year.
I think if more people knew (which is under water), they'd just be scared.
It's touching... over half of what we find on the day is plastic nets.
The remaining 50% are things that are at least made from artificial creation.
When you look at the island, it looks beautiful, and people can't believe that the whole plastic and the rest of the garbage are already under the surface.
Jeremy Brown, co-founder and director of Ocean Protection, said there are ways in which people – both local and tourists – can help reduce the amount of plastic and the rest of the waterways.
"It has to start with the source," he said.
We need to reduce the amount of plastic used by us, improve the recovery of materials, and have greater awareness of what we put into the paths that eventually lead to the oceans.
If we destroy the ocean, it's waiting for us to freeze, because 50% of the dust we breathe comes from the ocean.
He's pulling 30% carbon dioxide and our food source.
But we can arrange this package and bring it back to the old light, and it's very simple.
If we kill our oceans, we kill ourselves.
The film material financed by the TOMRA recycling company in its extensive efforts to educate Australians about environmental protection and to reduce the negative impact of consumers on alcohols that are often transmitted to the environment is carried out during the study on the dependence between artificial and mental health, which has been published this month.
A new survey of 546 children between 12 and 18 years of age found that 82% of respondents felt uncomfortable about waste from artificial sources, and 25% of adults were affected by waste from single plastic packaging.
The study revealed that wastes from artificial sources were also a fourth to the size of parents, and 93% of 551 parents surveyed said their concerns were growing related to the number of plastic wastes transferred to the oceans.
Many people who participated in the study said they wanted to do something about waste from artificial creation, but they just don't know how to make significant changes that led to ecological change.
Poland – Slovenia.
Memes after the game of seats in the semi-final ME
It wasn't an easy match.
The Slovenians had a vital publicity on their side, which was effectively deconcentrated by Polish sitters.

Google's making a hole in Poland.
PKO BP partner
Operator Chmuri National, PKO BP and PFR, has included a strategic partnership with Google.
Cooperation will help the Polish company to implement and use the potential for computing fraud technology.
Google Cloud Platform products will be included in the offers of the National Chmuri, and Google will open in Warsaw, so-called Google Cloud region – i.e. the hub of technical infrastructure and software dedicated to customers from Poland and the region of Central and Eastern Europe.
The Google Cloud region will be the first global, public currency installation in Central Europe.
The number of Polish companies was one of the key facilities that were based on the project to create the National Bank of Poland, initiated and developed by the PKO Bank of Poland and the Polish Development Fund, the participants of this company.
The Partnership of National Chomours and Google is another important step on the way that we have taken a failed year ago by announcing the call of the National Chmury Operator.
The objective remains unchanged – the calculation of the Polish economy and the de minimisation of its growth.
"The Polish companies are now getting additional tools for their implementation.
Using them, they increase their chances of advancing to world law, which all of us depend on.
The fact that Google joins their games today is important to strengthen our joint project," says Zbigniew Jajielłó, president of the PKO Bank of Poland.
The Polish Development Fund notes that it is interested in investment projects that support the development of modern businesses and businesses.
"Investment in the National Chmuri National Operator is ideally part of the PFR strategy as an important part of the country's digitalization.
It provides modern and affordable solutions based on chromium architecture.
"I am convinced that this cooperation will also have a positive impact on the development of the Polish IT market and attract the best specialists," adds Paul Borys, president of PFR.
Google Cloud provides advanced technology, products and analytical tools based on leading technical infrastructure, which provides a powerful calculation and data storage service.
Customers in Poland can find all Google Cloud Platform key products such as Computer Engine, App Engine, Google Kubernets Engine, Cloud Bigtable, Cloud Spencer or BigQuery.
Enabling Google Cloud services to offer Chmuri Nationally allows Polish entrepreneurs to use exactly the same advanced technologies that their global competitions use.
However, we will remain under the jurisdiction of Poland and under the control of local regulators," says Michał Potoczek, president of the National Ombudsman.
It adds that the company will be ready for megatrends, such as Internet things (IoT) that are often increasing the demand for the calculation required for the processing of large data collections.

It has already passed through the centre of Warsaw six times to identify how large and diverse society represents the elderly.
Through the Paradise, we have fought harmful stereotypes about the elderly and called for inter-cooling solidarity."
The parade was conducted by a special pipe car that served as a music mobile scene, where it was traditionally already heard by the Warsaw DJ Wika.
The participants in the happy choir, at the second known Warsaw and world events, passed by the Alleys of Jerusalem, ul. Cross to the Place of the Upstances of Warsaw, ul. Mazowieck to the Place of J. Piłsudski, and ul. Royal and Krakow at the University of Warsaw University.
During the course of the march, which involved several thousand seniors representing 300 senior organisations from all over Poland, the colourful Vietnamese delegations were ranked by numerous groups on the road to the march, tours and tourists.
The Leginos participated in the parade of two organized groups in the red and blue-colored companies.
The first representative of the 3rd University of Germany and the Senior+ Club and the second under the name of SAGA, namely the Senior Active Group of Animators.
In the field of the University of Organizers, including the gastronomic and numerous strands of institutions and companies providing services and products to older people to improve their daily life and functioning.
There were medical, cosmetics, culinary, recreation, sports and fashions.
For example, for example, the Stylish Seniors of Seniors by professional Hanny Piekarski and projector Agnieški Erywal, guidance and information on current trends could be obtained in 60+ mode.
In addition, Stoisko offered the best of the sciences of moving on the scene and drawings to the picture.
The cut was the fashion of Stylish Seniors.
The position of the General Assembly of the Senate was the latest issue of the letter and material on the campaign “Stop manipulation – Don’t buy on presentation!”
The next chairs offered cosmetic, handmade, plastic and artistic charms.
A few studies could be conducted and consulted with specialists on health and nutrition issues.
Discussion panels were also organized with participation in: Heleny Norowicz, Beaty Tadli, Marioli Bojarski-Frenc, Tomasza Jacykow or Robert Janowski.
The picnic didn't contain vocal and musical attractions.
The legend of the Polish song – Krzysztof Krawczyk, which led DJ Wika, appeared last night.
Tumanic devil can provide guidance on cancer treatment
Tasman devil may have a key to cancer treatment – researchers of the history of post-opausal detection, which may revolutionize therapy for patients
Medical researchers have found ways to mask some new cell phones
Researchers have found that the same process comes from the demons of Tasman and humans.
There is hope that this discovery will lead to new treatment methods for oncological patients
What do the common demons and the human beings have?
Newborn cells that can become invisible.
Researchers, including Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre in Melbourne, have achieved a long-term discovery that may help in the evolution of the treatment of some neuroscientists if they do not respond to immunotherapy.
It may also contain a key to the treatment of fatal gums within the face that threatens the future of a dangerous demon of the Tamman.
The study has established a way to mask some of the new cell cells both in humans and in bags, using a protein group called the PRRC2, which excludes the marker that would otherwise give a signal to the anti-conformity device to attack the new cell.
This may be the greatest challenge in treating lung cancer, neuroblastos, and the type of skin cancer called cancer from Mercla’s cell.
"The importance of this project lies in the fact that in patients who sometimes develop resistance to immunological therapy, we may be able to reverse this process," AAP senior researcher Mark Dawson from Peter Mac said.
The existing therapy may be administered to re-inject markers called MHC, which allows the immunological system to detect the new cell.
"Possibly it has far-reaching implications for people with lung cancer," said Professor Dawson.
“It is one of the most common diseases on earth.
And maybe we better treat her better.
Researchers also hope that the discovery will ever be used to treat the tammanian devil's face, where innovative cells in a similar way avoid detection.
“It’s unusual that the same process is exactly the same (in the case of novelty in people and the demons in the Tasmans),” said Professor Dawson.
“How difficult it was to treat the dogs of the Tasman devil this time.
But if medicines active in humans can also be used in the demons, there is a possibility that it will help control the disease."
Scientists believe that a really small star orbits a very large planet around it
Scientists are surprised to discover the solar system that is 30 years bright from Earth, which reflects our current understanding of the processes of the creation of the planet, since in this system a large planet is similar to the Joviss around a small star called the red horse.
Artistic illustration of the planet of the GJ 3512b orbiting the central star of the Red Star, published on 26 September 2019.
In general, stars are much larger than even the largest planets that orbit around them.
However, according to scientists in the fourth century, in this case stars and planets differ significantly.
The size of the star named GJ 3512 is about 12% of the size of the Sun, while the mass of the planet that surrounds it is at least half the mass of the Jovis, or the largest planet of our solar system.
"Yes, it's an absolute surprise," said astrophysicist Juan Carlos Morales from the Catalan Institute of Space Research at the Spanish Institute of Space Research, which became a part of the research published in Science magazine.
The discovery is surprising because the theoretical models of the creation of solar systems suggest that the stars of the lower mass of the order become the parent stars for smaller planets similar to Earth or smaller Neptunes.
"In this case, we have discovered a planet of gas type as bright as Jovis's orbiting around a very small star," Morales added.
The planet, which resembles Jovisz consists mainly of gas, discovered using a telescope in the Calar Alto Observatory in Spain.
It surrounds its star after a very elliptical orbit, and full rotation lasts 204 days.
Red balls are small and have relatively low surface temperature.
The GJ 3512 star is not only significantly smaller than the Sun, but at some point it has a size comparable to the size of a very large planet, since it is only about 35% higher than Jovis.
They emit less energy, so they are darker than the sun, and their surface temperature is slightly lower and is close to less than 3800 (steps) of Kelvin (6380 degrees Fahrenheit / 3527 degrees Celsius).
"That's why they have red color," said Morales.
"There are evidence of the existence of a second planet that is currently orbiting around this star, while the third planet could be released from a star-like system in the past, which could translate the elliptical orbit of a planet similar to Jowisz," said Morales.
The planets form from the same interstellar disk of gas and dust that forms the star around which the planets cross.
According to the leading model of the creation of the planet called the model of activity, the object initially forms part of the disk and the gravity of the planet in the early stages of development enables the atmosphere to rise from surrounding gas.
This non-competitive arrangement may explain the competitive model called the gravitational instability model.
"In this case, the protoplanetary disk around the young star may be more massive than we expect and may be cold," said Morales.
This leads to a deterioration of the disk's stability, and therefore some denser areas may appear.
These masses can grow until the time of the fall and the creation of the planet.
Delicate staff responsible for the administration of co-workers of fasol dipu containing methamphetamine
The Office of the Seryfa in Marion's county held Cassandra Medinú-Hernandez, 38 years old, for the administration of co-workers with fasolic dipus containing methamphetamine.
On Thursday, from Albania, 38 years old, Cassandra Ani Medina-Hernandez was charged with the provision of methamphetamine and the use of this substance controlled by another person – both crimes are crimes at the second level.
The complaint was filed on the basis of a 9 September event in the Troftway food store in Jefferson.
In a statement made by the Portal OregonLive.com under an oath pointing to the likelihood of wine of 27 years of age, the suspect's colleague told the successor of the Count Marion that during the lunch break, she saw how Medina-Hernandez did the fascist dip, which she later added.
On the basis of the statement, it is reported that the victim of a crime, which according to what she related, never took metaphetamine, said that “she thought that one of her guests had a strange taste, but did not raise it in any other opinion.”
When she came back to work, she felt she had a broad stomach and she couldn't stand her feet.
According to the Albany Democrat-Herald newspaper, she went to the local hospital where it was found that a fascist dip could contain methamphetamine.
On the basis of the reports of The Smocking Gun, the next network worker from Thriftway said that Medina-Hernandez "sayed that she would add drugs to her food," while another admitted that she was suspected of sending her message, claiming that methamphetamine had reached the fasal deep by accident.
The Wittrina OregonLive informs about the recording from the monitoring of the delicates, which, of course, shows how the body returned to the camera of Medina-Hernandez takes something from the biosthony, is behind the microphone and falls down.
Next, he cleans himself, cleans his nose, comes down to the table, and lays a dip façao in a small paper fashion.
According to the police, the thing she pulled out of Biustonism was probably also on the workshop.
The Oregon Stateman-Journal newspaper reports that workers of the Serbian office now claim that there is no doubt about the fact that customers are being provided with a broken food.
Medina-Hernandez lives in Marion's graveyard – a fine of $520,000.
According to The Smocking Gun, her extensive police card indicates that she was already threatened with violence, robbery, theft of privacy, supply of methamphetamine, theft, possession of methamphetamine and possession of unauthorized weapons.

"Everybody's Talking About Jamie": Casting for the role of Jamie New on West End
The next big West End star is waiting for the discovery, though he doesn't know about it yet.
Music producers "Everybody's Talking About Jamie" are looking for the next Jamie New and are organizing open hearings
The current Layton Williams star is moving with the music on the tour of Britain, so the producers in its place are looking for “extended, undiscovered young performer”.
The hearings in London will take place on 10 October in Apollo Theatre, and candidates hoping to win should prepare 16 tattoos of the "Don't Even Know It", as well as their CVs and portraits.
The hearing will also take place on 8 October in Sheffield, and the next week the producers will be invited to the presentation again.
Producer Nice Burns said: "We are pleased to say that thanks to our fantastic public music, the next three years in Apollo will be a game."
We found a few fantastic young performers who join Layton Williams and Shane Richie during the tour.
By searching for new Jamie, we open up the possibility of this music to strangers who join today’s young employees.
Williams, who moved to the role of Jamie New in the summer and replaced John McCree's first playing role, urged on Twitter "WSYSTKICH boys to send their teams":
This musical tour begins in February, and the exhibitions in West Ende were extended until 29 August 2020.
Musical presents the loss of 16-year-old Jamie New, who wants to go to the ball to finish school in the kitchen.
He doesn't know what the future will bring, but he's sure he'll be a star.
Thanks to the help of the mother and the local legend of the community, the Loco Chanelle finds out its identity, contrasting with the prejudices and careers in the light of the flash.
In this presentation, a documentary by BBC entitled “Jamie. Drag Queen at 16” wrote Dan Gillespie Sells, and the book and lyrics of the song – Tom MacRae.

Marian Banas.
What does KAS do about the head of the NIK?
I buy property for the amount below the market price – the objections that arise in relation to the presidential case of the Supreme Court of the Control of Marian Banasia.
We asked what the treasure is doing in this case in the Krakow Administration's Office and in the Ministry of Finance.
Bertold Kittel, in his report to the "Supervisor" TV, expressed doubts about the statement by the President of the Supreme Court of the Control of Marian Banasia.
Since a few months of the study, the Central Anti-Corruption Bureau is.
The control shall be completed in the second half of October, after parliamentary elections.
As a result of the announcement, Banasz had to rent a stone of 400 square metres and two smaller dwellings.
In total, he received 65.7 thousand gold a year.
The "Superviiser" report revealed that the hotel was located in a truck hired by him for hours.
The head of the NIK was later translated on state television, so he picked up only over 5,000 gold coins a month for rent.
"Gazeta Wiborcza", calling on experts from the real estate assessment, said that it should be 15 thousand gold per month for the stone itself.
"The amount was lower for a simple reason: I concluded a preliminary agreement and just because the buyer had to buy this stone, I agreed to do the following, that the remaining items would be calculated on the sale of the stone," Banas said.
However, doubts arose as to whether such proceedings were not a violation of the law.
Konrad Zawada, spokesman for the Moscow Administration in Krakow, told TVN24 that "the Ministry of Finance is directly involved in this matter".
"Any such question, please direct the Minister of Finance," he added.
The task was explained that in such cases "the actions of the National Administration of the Skarbowa".
The spokesman for the Ministry of Finance Paul Jurek acknowledged that the National Administration of Scarbow itself monitors many things that may arise in the future.
“The National Administration of Scarbowa acts in such a way that it has its own information, as well as it is based in a certain sense on those information that is publicly available.
On this basis, it shall decide whether or not any specific case is to be taken or not," explained the MF.
"Despite the fact that it is binding on all of us in the entire financial sector to cover the treasure secret, we are never told, because we cannot talk about individual matters of a specific taxpayer, a specific person, or a particular company," he stressed, asking about Marian Banasi.
Finance Minister Jerzy Quecianski stressed that "the customs authorities do not transmit this type of information to the public."
"Of course, the whole car is involved in very many similar cases throughout the country," he said.
Secrets of the royal family: there were frequent guests flying by royal plane
In the context of the service obligations of the royal family throughout their lives, they must make their journeys throughout the world.
This usually facilitates a royal plane – a private machine that drives the royal family around the world to important events and events.
It is not surprising that having your own plane is linked to the privileges.
The members of the royal family do not have to stand on the long journeys to rest, do not comply with the limitations on the number of baggage, and can also, as it shows, apply for a permit to guests, including those who are really unspoiled.
According to the recent Prime Minister on Channel 5 of the documentary film, not only the king and the book Philip often travel by royal plane.
During the program entitled “Kingly Flights Secrets”, the king’s pilots have revealed that with the royal family, the Latins often run away from the guests.
Bob Shields said: “Sometimes, along with our very important royal guests, very important royal dogs could fly. ”
It is not surprising that the king could afford to have his beloved daughters accompany him on his journeys, since he is known for his deep attachment to the dogs of the race.
Since the early years of King Elsebeth, he has been a lover of these brilliant creatures and has been listening to that since the time of the crown, he has been the owner of more than 30 crowns.
It is said that in 2007, she had five strokes: Monty, Emme, Linnet, Willow and Holly.
It added five cockers to them: Bisto, Oxo, Flash, Spick and Spain, as well as four dogs that are the cross-section of the cider: Cider, Berry Vulcan and Candy.
The king's aircraft must have had full hands of work.
An employee of the royal house carrying dogs and dogs was seen to meet their needs before they were stopped on the plane – says Sheilds.
It's nice to say that it never happened.
The programme also reveals the increasing number of baggage that the king will take with him during the journey in the context of the performance of the service obligations.
The film Narrator stated: “In 1953 the king took a bag of 12 tons of luggage in his journey of 70,000 miles [70,000 km]. ”
To be able to visualize it better, it's less than two huge suns.
The king, however, is not the only person who has a weakness in fashion.
Similarly, the mayor of Cambridge has his own views about the transport of her guard – it is said that each of her cousins is intended for a personal meeting.

Victims of accidents receive interest
On Friday, a regulation will enter into force which will ensure a substantial damage to the next interest payment – inform the Financial Officer.
On 9 July 2019 on the specific rights of persons injured in the event of the cancellation of the guarantee amount established under the provisions applicable before 1 January 2006.
It concerns persons who were injured before 1 January 2006.
At the time, it was mandatory to decide less than the current guarantee amount, so in some cases the insurance policy had already stopped the rent.
"I am happy with this regulation because our institution has been trying to create a mechanism that will allow for serious damage in cases of financial support from the communication OC or OC to the farmer despite the loss of the guarantee amount," says Alexander Daszewski, legal adviser to the Finance Office.
It was the view of the Financial Bank that this was necessary because it was often very tragic situations involving people in very poor health who could not work, for example, at the same time at the expense of emergency rehabilitation treatment.
Some of them were no longer provided with pensions and increased needs due to the need for further treatment or rehabilitation due to such a guarantee sum on the OC police.
Some of this has been a threat in recent years.
By 1 January 2006, the liability of the insurance undertaking was significantly lower than the present.
Therefore, the problem of withholding the amount of guarantee in previous years was most often affected by people who suffered damage in the 1990s.
The guarantee amounts were very low at the time, and economic conditions caused significant price increases.
"We have also noted that this problem also affected a number of young people who suffered damage during the period when the amount amounted to EUR 350 000 per case.
It is currently EUR 5.21 million for an event, regardless of the number of injured.
So this is a huge difference in the past, and this is why the problem required legislative intervention," recalls Aleksander Daszewski.
It is clear that since the amount of the guarantee which is sometimes overstated, the legislator has accepted that the upper limit of liability of the Guarantee Fund will be the amount of guarantee that will be applicable at the time of the payment of interest to the interest fund.
This principle shall apply if the insurance institution is not obliged to pay interest on the basis of the judgment of a court establishing a maximum amount of guarantee other than that laid down in the EC insurance agreement.
This is in the case of an increase in the amount of guarantee on the basis of Article 3571 of the Civil Code, which makes it possible to modify the existing bond relationship.
"In recent days we have sent letters to people who have come back to us with an intervention request.
We inform them of new powers and of course provide further support in the event of any problems," says Aleksander Daszewski.

Brenda Barattini's punishment for breaking a boy's penis
The case concerns events since November 2017.
As Buenos Aires Times points out, then Brenda Barattini found out that her boyfriend showed her a friend of sex who was born in their bedroom.
28-year-old, who is an architect, explained before the court that a partner thus ruined her life and treated her with no "trophym" that could be praised by friends.
“He has ruined my privacy, my life and career.
It's all gone," she argued.
The residents of Cordoby himself decided to judge justice.
She invited her boy, 42-year-old Sergio F. to bed and told him she was preparing a special surprise.
With the help of the assamite, she sent him eyes after which she pulled him into the segregator and pulled his penis off.
"I felt like I should die.
I didn't see anything.
I tried to get up, pull down and pull over the cell phone to get ready," he said injured.
"I wanted to go out, but she started treating me.
She pushed me through my shirt and hair, not letting me go," he added.
Although Barattini explained that her boyfriend had violated her sexually, she did not try to escape responsibility.
"Please judge justice," she said in the light of the oath.
Finally, she was convicted of attempted murder and sentenced to 13 years in prison.
The state congressman Alabama Jack Edwards died at the age of 91
On Friday, he died an amnesty of the state of Alabama from the party of the Republican Jack Edwards, who served for 10 years and belonged to the first party of the Republicans from the so-called Southern Hemisphere.
The family lawyer said Edwards died in his home in Fairhope after fighting with a new drug dealer.
Edwards was first elected to the U.S. Congress in 1965 as one of the first republics of Alabama's state in the South, thanks to the party's achievements.
At Congress, he earned 10 nominations.
According to a family statement in response to a recent question about what the world would like to leave to its lawyers and lawyers, Edwards replied that he would like to return the loan.
"I hope that my lawyers and my lawyers will grow up in a country where there is a common debate and efforts to resolve the country's problems of return," Edwards said in a family statement.
The Governor of Alabama Kay Ivey said Edwards served his state and country with the highest standards of honesty.
She added that on his part the flag on the Capitol of the state of Alabama will be released to half the mass.
"He was the personal of the real official of the state and was the best man for Alabama.
Our state lost one of the most important policies," Ivey said in a statement.
Michelle Obama called Meghan Markle "inspiration" on Instagram
Michelle Obama expressed a high recognition for Meghan Markle on Instagram on Thursday, calling the Prince Sussex “a powerful leader who breaks the schematics and thanks to which our world is becoming better. ”
The priest and priest Harry, who now had a ten-year royal trip to South Africa with their son, Archer Harrison Mountbutten-Windsor, participated in a meeting with the young man at the beginning of this week, during which he met with the leaders of the Obami Foundation.
"I would like to thank my friend, Her Royal City, Prince Sussex @sussexroal, "a mild leader who is exaggerating the schemes and thanks to which our world is getting better," she wrote the first lady in her enthusiasm.
"Is it meeting with the leaders of the Obami Foundation @ObamaFoundation, or helping girls around the world to gain access to the education they deserve, is an inspiration for many people," Obama added, putting in a picture of the funny Meghan with the foundations leaders.
Meghan made an announcement with Obama for the September release of the British Vogue, a guest edited by former actor of the "Suits" series.
In fact, she was the first woman to talk about parenting and how she changed.
"Be a mother means bringing to the mystery of the art of forgiveness," said Obama.
“Maternalism has taught me that in most of my time my task is to give children space so that they can know the world and become the one they want to be.
Not who I want to be or who I want to be in their age, but who are in the heart.
Both of them, who knew from experience what the press was about to be on the candle, shared with the priest’s advice during the release of Good Housekeeping magazine.
She said, "The pressure that you feel - made by yourself and by others - may sometimes push you."
“So my advice is to relax and not get into anything.
For the first few months in the White House, I spent most of my time caring for my daughters, making sure that they were good at school and made new friends before I dedicated myself to more ambitious work.
I think it's necessary, too.
Hotel Trumpa maintains a permit to sell alcohol despite crying for the owner
WASHINGTON (AP) – The Commission for the Control of Alcohols in Washington has issued a request to verify whether the local Trump International Hotel should lose access to the sale of alcohol as a result of the ownership of the owner.
The Agency managed in the environment that the burden of three shepherds, two raised judges and two rabbis is safe because most of them do not live in the district or have no property in them.
The Washington Post suggests that another reason is that you are trying to forget the hotel's permission to sell alcohol, calling for a ruling in the distribution that says that those who ask for permission to sell alcohol must prove to be "good skill".
In the initial complaint filed last year, it was claimed that President Donald Trump violated the law, and charges of assault and repeated cases of fraud were raised.
The charge was lifted because the permit was granted before it was submitted.
The second complaint was the extension of the permit.
“The Sun”: The current report recognizes the scandals of police services in Cleveland for the worst in Britain
The inspectors considered the SCOMROMIANT SCANDALAMS to be the worst police force in the United Kingdom.
The interim report assessed the work of the police in Cleveland as inappropriate in all areas.
Phil Gormley, chief police inspector of His Royal City, says that in the police services of Cleveland, there was a "significant deterioration" of standards.
New appeals for police services have appeared, with five commanders in the course of six years.
According to the report, the police did not take steps to prevent crime, arrest of suspects and protect the weakest.
Phil Gormley, chief police inspector of His Royal City, said: “Since our last inspection, there has been a significant deterioration of standards."
Commander Mike Veale rejected in January after a year's failure in the light of an investigation into the “strong” case, even though unknown, what he had to do.
Deputy Commander Adrian Roberts was arrested as a result of a growing mistake.
Last year, Inspector Simon Hurwood took the lead in the Commission on the promotion of sexual cooperation.
He left the service.
Burmese Professor Tees Valley Ben Houchen of the Tours said: “It is official confirmation that these services are compromised.
It's time for him to take part in the Home Office department now."
Police commander Richard Lewis said: "I will take full responsibility for the implementation of the police force by changes after it has been made."
We've got a visualization of the skate park!
Are young people really waiting for you?
The older inhabitants are being interrupted by the passage of trains to the hills and valleys, and you are also concerned that there is no suitable place for them in Olava.
Young people from years of age can remember the place to drive on wheels, bicycles, wheelchairs, wheelchairs.
The issue is still going back to our legs.
We've been paying attention to this problem for 10 years.
Last time, there was a complaint about the lack of a skate park.
That's why we're going back to that again and we're gonna ask the office what's going on?
We remember that a few days ago, a woman who was passing by a young man walked in the center.
"I write on behalf of the residents of the block at Piłsudsky so that the situation of the Oław youth can be taken into account," writes Malögorzat.
“The residents of the block called the City Guard several times without success.
On the basis of these daily situations, I send a photo."
We asked others about this.
Most simply claim that young people simply don't have a place to ride in the city, and for years, they have been working hard to find places for themselves.
Under the post on Facebook, there was a string of comments.
We've already written in July that there's a chance that a scate park will be built on the Oław City.
The Burmese reported that the city had been financed by the building of a scathe park.
"The project consulted with the young project together with the permits is ready.
On 28 March, a proposal was submitted to the Ministry of Sport and Tourism for the financing of the "Building Skatepark in Oławi" under the Sport Polska programme.
Total project value: 798 306.00 zł.
Amount of funding requested: 263 440.00
Now we're asking again what stage it is.
"We still have no information on the relationship to discuss what the Ministry of Sport and Tourism has to ask for funding," says Elżbieta Bednarczyk, Head of the European MUM Oława Fund.
"The information received from the staff of the Ministry shows that the final selection of all the tasks under the Sports Programme of Poland should take place in October".
We've also asked for a visualization of the Olavski dike park.
We present her below.
The youth reported that on Saturday (September 28th) they will be receiving signatures on the petition concerning the construction of the ski park in Olavia.
"The growing youth saw the last post on Facebook and found out that they were organizing a collection," writes Mikolaj.
The signatures under the petition will be collected from 12 noon around Lidl's market.
Puchar Polski 2019/20: rescue 1/16 final.
We know couples, hit years ago.
It was one of the most secure rivals in the extraclass.
The largest legend has been the memorial match since the 1996/1997 season.
On June 18, 1997, Legia took over the old stadium at the Lázienkow shipyard in the farthest corner.
Both groups share the point.
The economy had to win, the second of the master's line of vision gave Poland a point.
At 87 minutes, Legia drove 2:0, but within five minutes it reached the ground, and the vision shot three holes and was happy with the title.
The Lódzki club with a run-up of years had become more and more tarapats until he stopped counting in the battle of mystery and fell from the highest level of entertainment.
The last two groups met at this level in 2013/2014.
Legia – on the way to the title – brought two victories – 5:1 in itself and 1:0 in the exit.
Return to Elegant
Now the ships are fighting back to the national elite.
These plans were delayed at least a year, since in the previous games, one of the factories was unable to advance on the extra class package.
As a result, the failure of the century led to the collapse of the framework revolution.
The authorities have changed, finally placed on trainer Marcina Kaczmarka, and in making a further step up the club hierarchy, they are helping to secure the legal battles of Marcin Robak and Mateusz Możdzen.
In the case of Vidzew is a fourth in Table II, but in Pucharze Polski he took up on Tuesday the extra class Čląsk Wrocław 2:0.
The legend of the same size was hidden on the exit of the Netherlands.
Extra-class stars
The only couple composed of the top class representatives in 1/16 finals will create her ŁKS Beniminek and Görnik Zabrze.
The sword of this phase will take place from 29 to 31 October.
In this year, 1/8 finals are still planned ( 3-5 December).
The final will take place on 2 May at the National PGE in Warsaw.
Nancy Pelosi: William Barr "has won" and the investigation within the scope of the commitment must be connected to his tower
We'll never know where we're going.
Now I think we are taking part in trying to hide the facts, and the investigation in this case can be confirmed," said Pelosi in a report to the CNN on Mount Capitol.
"They are doing the work they have started, keeping the facts and time necessary to find them," she added.
With the protocol issued this week by the White House, Trump asked the President of Ukraine to conduct an investigation on former Vice-President Joe Biden, candidate for 2020, and his son.
Trump also asked Zełenski to cooperate in this matter with Barr and his personal lawyer, Rudy Giulian, as a result of the protocol.
Trump refused to do anything wrong.
On Thursday, the CNN reported that national security lawmakers from the Department of Justice notified a complaint notice by the complainant concerning the proceeding of the troops with the participation of Ukraine over a week before the formal notification.
Following a complaint by the Intelligence Community officials, the Department of Justice stated that the telephone discussion on the campaign did not provide criminal investigation.
Asked whether Barr should admit, Pelosi said on Friday, the Intelligence Committee decides who to call the witness.
However, she added that her opinion of Barr “has won it. ”
It's been such a long time.
"On the contrary (Barra) will be replaced by all of this," Pelosi added, referring to the change of Trumpa to his general prosecutor during the July conversation with the leader of Ukraine.
It's interesting that he made decisions on how to handle complaints.
Pelosi acknowledged that he was “very afraid” about the signalist informers who were attacked by Trump on Thursday as spies, suggesting that in the past they had been dealt with by spies.
I think the President's words go beyond irresponsibility, it's dangerous.
Our signalists play an important role in discovering – sending progress to our government, Pelosi said, adding “The words of the President on persons who can provide information on the signal are seriously considering honesty in the government.”
On Tuesday, Pelosi took the historic step of declaring a formal investigation on the enforcement of an act contrary to the law on the basis of the attempt to impose pressure on the leader of the country to obtain political benefits.
The telephone conversation was included in a panel published on Thursday of complaints in which the signalist claimed that Trump had forced his authority to "press Ukraine into interference" during the upcoming 2020 elections.
The signalist also suggested that White House lawmakers were able to remove the record of the communication from the computer system in which they were kept at the needs of the Council of Ministers and to place it in a system designed for information particularly sensitive.

Possible ban on driving over speed for club attacker Crystal Palace Christiana Bentek
The Premier League Christian Bentek star, which has been arrested twice over the last two months for speed-up, violates the ban on driving.
Founder Crystal Palace, 28 years old, admitted to the Bentley brand vehicle at 80 miles per hour on the ground with a cut to 50 miles per hour on the A3 road in Richmond in south-west London on January 20th.
Then, in March in Putney's south-west London photographers registered Belgium eating at 89 miles per hour, which is twice the limit of 40 miles per hour.
Bentette from Kingston Hill from Surrey must not be in the Room Court this morning at Lavender Hill.
He agreed to two steps at the beginning of July in a simplified procedure on which the crimes were more easily condemned at a meeting held by one judge.

Ghana: Kofi Manu concerned with the structure of the Audit Commission
Kofi Manu, the football manager and the representative of the Hasakas Sekondi Club, expressed doubts about the composition of the Verification Commission for the needs of the upcoming elections to the National Football League in Ghana (GFA).
He challenged the inclusion of the Commission President, Frank Davis, adding that he was not satisfied with his participation.
The GNA Sport Manu report questioned whether the Commission's President would be honest, as the outcome of the verification process is in his interest.
The Verification Commission should be composed of neutral outsiders who do not communicate with any of the members and who have not previously shown interest.
For example, Davies employed the NC as a lawyer who wrote to Osei Kwaku Palmer for 10 per cent of payments.
He's also known as the Olympic Olympics.
For these two reasons, he should not be allowed to take a position in the Verification Commission because he is interested in this," he said.
I said that if Fred Papoe, the Director of the Olympic Games, is present before the Commission, there will be a conflict of interest on the part of the President because of his association with the club, suggesting at the same time that if he is in the position of Palmer before the Commission, he will be the subject of prejudice and impartiality.
In accordance with the expectations of the Commission members, they had to start work from yesterday, following the holding of a meeting at the GFA Secretariat in Akre on Tuesday, 19 September, and ending on 4 October.
The Commission's Bureau is Frank Davies, and its members are members of the Consultant ds. of corporate government and lawlor Marian Barnor and Mr Emmanuel Darkwah.
The remaining members shall be Reginald Laryea, Director of Market and Business and Richard Akpokavia, Sports Administrator and Lawyer.
‘SE’: Cornel Morawiecki in a harsh condition in the hospital
Mr. Cornel Morawecki, the legend of solidarity and the father of Prime Minister Mateusza Morawecki, met again at the hospital – informs "Super Express".
The politics is in a difficult state.

He's been feeling better lately.
As Super Express reports, during his last talk with the newspaper, which had a place two weeks ago, the senior Marshal was “in a great way.”
Now, however, the health situation of the Prime Minister's father has deteriorated significantly.
Colonel Moraviecki went to the hospital, and the doctors determine his condition as severe.
The mayor's family told him "SE" that politics is boring and full of witnesses.
The novelty of cancer is not the only disease that Cornel Moraviicke has to deal with.
He also has heart problems and because of chemotherapy, which he goes through, as well as the nerves.
Colonel Moraviecki is elected in the current parliamentary elections on the mandate of the senator in the PS list on Podlasi.

Israel: There is no agreement on the Government of Unity
The two main parties of Israel, the shadow of the Niebeis and the Likud, continued in the fifth negotiations on the call for a government of unity.
The meeting, which took place after the Presidential Mission of the Government of Benjamin Netanyahu, did not produce results.
The discussions considered the possibility of the rotational leadership of both parties in the government and the stay of Netanyahu at the Prime Minister’s position, but, as the Israeli newspaper Haarec said, there was no approach.
The talks will be resumed on Sunday.
The Central Council of the Black and White has announced in the communication that it has submitted its initial submissions.
Legal Licud argues that "he's been involved in his positions," hoping that his leader and current prime minister, Netanyahu, remained at government level, and in the office, he's first in his ultraorthodox policy.
"From the very beginning, it has been known that the Niebesko-Biali do not comply with these conditions," a voice published by them.
In any case, acting solely in the interest of Netanyah, he wants “to bring Israel to the second round of elections”.
The leader of the Blue and White Benny Ganttz rejects the support of the government that would lead Netanyahu, while he was accused of taking part in three corrupt cases on which the prosecutor could formally accuse him of the matter at the meeting.
"Likud and Niebeko-Biali have won a sufficient majority on 17 September elections, which would allow them to join the common governments as natural allies, but will force them to negotiate which none of the parties wished," says the EFE Agency.
President Reuwen Rivlin tried to bring their positions closer together in recent days and proposed a call for a "rotation government", suggesting that the Prime Minister temporarily suspended his duties, which would allow Gantz to hold this position if the charges against Netanyahu were maintained and reformed.
There is no lack of Israeli analysts who believe that things have been in a bad mood.
However, half of the Israelis, as a result of a poll published on the fifth public television, wish to block the political situation in the country by calling the government of unity under the rotational leadership of Netanyah and Gantz.
That is how 50.6 per cent of the Israelis, 32.1 per cent of the respondents, are opposed to this solution.
The probe shows a deep division in Israel's society – on the question of who should first stand at the office, 41.8 per cent of respondents are told about Netanjahu and 40 per cent about Gantz.
In another survey published by the Israeli Hajum, the percentage of government volunteers grew by 63 per cent, 60 per cent against the new election that would be the third year.
In the previous parliamentary elections on 17 September, Gantza won 33 positions in 120 local Knesse, Likud Netanjahu won 32 positions.
Netanyahahu with its traditional and potential allies can count on 55 jobs, while Gantz – 54.
None of the parties collected 61 mandates necessary for the majority.
Tipuric calls for a fight before the final game with the Australians
Justin Tipuric says that "this is the time to check," when Wallia stands in the face of a final game with Australia under the World Cup, which can create their solos in the tournament.
The victory of Walli over the "kangarms" would put this team on the position of a certain factory to win Group D and ensure that they participate in a possible virtual meeting with France or Argentina.
However, if Australia defeats Wallia 14 times during the last 15 meetings, Tipuric and his team will be sent to an old Englishman with an eighth final.
"Let's make the case clear, both teams want to try to go through it and find out for the group," said the Valais fan of Tipuric.
In the past, there were some difficult results, but last summer it was nice to be with them (Australia).
I think they're gonna try hard to get us this victory, and we're gonna need to take it back.
Before we got here, you knew it'd be a big old man.
And now we're here, and it's really time to check.
Valia had only one victory over Australia, New Zealand or RPA in the history of the World Cup – and it was 32 years ago in the third place when the "kangari" took place.
And their overall record under the leadership of chief coach Warren Gatland shows only seven victories in 41 attempts to win the three-fold weights of the southern half.
Valia has been holding thirty lost test games from Australia in November last year, and Tipuric has been preparing to be among the few who are fleeing from this 9-6 prize in Tokyo on Sunday.
Tipuric asked if the team had experienced mental blockade before this victory, adding: “It’s hard to say.
These games are so balanced that maybe... people expect a certain mental block, I don't know.
At the end of the final match, we probably left about 15 points on the box, so the final result seems to be much less than it actually was.
If Wallia gets upset, while the battle of Tipurica with the beloved Australian duo from the third line of the young Michael Hooper and David Pocock will be of major importance during the arrest and release.
Tipuric has performed 67 representations and met with both employees on several previous occasions, so he knows exactly what he is waiting for.
"They are the players who play the seventh world class at all," he said.
When playing against the third-line world class, it's always known that it's going to be a difficult game to play.
These two are still with the best employees in the world.
You know what games you can expect.
Pocock is one of the best players in the world playing defensively, and Michael is a more attacker and probably feels a lot better, because he's always in the right place at the right time.
It's better to play against the best employees in the world and to face challenges than to deal with a third line of milk that's not so good.
It's worth playing against the best, and getting rid of these two, I'm sure you should be in a decent shape.
I wouldn't say it's almost over Sunday, but it's an important game for us in this World Cup.
The impression is an important element.
When we build strength and continue to put forth great effort, we will fly like eagles, and it will be hard to conquer.

"Waffen-SS" Jochen Boehler, Robert Gerwarth, Jacek Mlünarczyk
They were to be the elite organization of the "grandmothers."
They accepted in their ranks those who waited for them.
Can crime be more linked than national identity?
In your country, we will give no further book on military or military issues.
We offer a deep international study on non-German participation in Waffen-SS.
Historians from various countries in Europe are analyzing the positions and motivations of volunteers, reminding themselves of their activities and considering the recruitment processes at the various stages of the war.
Did the Danish division differ from the French?
Where did he get the Ukrainian enthusiasm?
Why was it not possible to create a division formed from Poland itself?
How does the official historical narrative look today about collaboration in the individual European countries?
What happened to the volunteers after the war ended?
Among other things, the book Waffen-SS is based on solid research material.
We have tried to present a more subtle and more ambitious, more accurate picture of cooperation in Europe during the second world war, also trying to break the methodological boundaries of history and the period of events by presenting the authorship report from different countries.... As to the fact that the main victims of this war - forced workers, Jews, jeans, political opponents of Nazi Germany, the Slovak people - are sometimes presented in terms of equal and/or extra-national perceptions, they are essentially from the national perspective (if they do so).
"Total panic" when the White House is struggling with finding arguments about investment
The White House officials are ashamed to think how to open up on Thursdays of the National Investments, and one of the speakers identified in the situation describes the feeling of “a total bank” felt last week because of the lack of a plan of response to the new reality.
It seems that this is “an anxiety, insecurity and anxiety” – one of the people related to the White House described in this way in the Western Hemisphere – that the informant’s charges can seriously harm the president and the people around him.
The person said: “There is no great doubt that nothing is hidden there. ”
The White House officials were still uncertain about how to proceed, not only because there is no obvious plan of action in this situation, but also because the charges are so serious that the standard methods of effective counter-terrorism used by the President in the past may not be affected. "It does not look like what it will be done with the next reporting cycle" – the person said.
Another person who knows the duration of the discussion described the atmosphere prevailing in the White House as a “study situation” with which he and his fellow growing uncertainty that, along with an ongoing investigation into the commitment, it is likely that the president will respond in a way that is irresponsible and will be “hard to resist”.
This opinion is divided by another speaker claiming that the persons in the president's surroundings expect that he will experience more "required" behaviour and that the pressure on him will certainly start to grow with each day of the investigation on investment.
This gives rise to concerns that Trump may present more and more unpredictability and unexpected way of dissuasiveness – it is in the context of the election year, both from the point of view of both the presidential and the election.
Putting the greatest threat to the presidency, Trump turned from the attack to the defense again following a strategy that he considered to be an effective investigation by Robert Mueller on Russia.
He tried to back up his own request to the Ukrainian President for assistance in conducting a survey on his political regimes to turn his attention and turn his attention to the actions of the Democrats and the candidate of the Democrats of Joo Biden and to persuade the informer as a leading party initiatives.
But when many people in the White House were killed in battle after Mueller's investigation, something changed – the consultants and consultants said.
The president, whose reputation is strong, presented the mid-term press conference as a well-known one of the persons identified in the situation.
While Trump was enthusiastic about the question of Russian investigation, it seemed that he did not want to answer the questions about Ukraine – they said.
Some of the representatives of the President believe that it is possible to avoid damage, and some of them are convinced that the informer was not aware of the above-mentioned controversial telephone conversation between President Trumpe and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zełenski – according to them, of his credibility.
And as is often the case when the president is the object of the attack, the fact is that he is alive under his chief advocates in his defense.
But one of the Republican strategies related to the White House shows that the results of the president's support polls are extremely high, and the commitment will not be too high for new sympathies.
"There is no position in the need to concentrate on the President's commitment in the next four months," particularly if it is difficult to implement its legislative programme and takes over in the new cycle of headlines.
Another speaker argues that those who held that impeachment would help the president do not finally understand how his reaction would be unpredictable.
The Martish officials of the White House sought help from the advisers, completing a team of responses to the impeachment.
According to the person I know about the plans, considering that these efforts are in an early stage, it is unclear whether any initiative in the centre of evidence will be taken and what form can be taken.
The person stated that he was convinced that a coordinated legal and communication strategy with the designated leader would be required to conduct an attack on the PR that would be a response to the release of a food signalist report and aimed at stopping democratic actions on the undertaking entrusted by the disclosure of that report.
The speaker noted that the lack of a long-term strategic vision was clear when the Secretary of State of Mike Pompeo and the Secretary of State of the State of Steve Mnuchin indicated that they did not intend to disclose the note describing the discussion with the Ukrainian President, and then 48 hours later it was possible to feel that there was no exit and that the document should be published.
It is expected that the press will now be more than in the course of Robert Mueller's investigation, who has been very cautious and spoke only on charges. One person who can be involved in preparing an answer to the impeachment is Corey Lewandowski, a man from Trupa's dirty job and was the head of the electoral staff – she has testified to the case.
However, Lewandowski told the NBC News that it is not a true suggestion that he would be guided by this action.
"For the last five years, I have done everything I can to support the President and his programme, he said, but I have not participated in any discussions with the President or his group on joining the group in order to reverse the false threat of commitment."
The private lawyer Donalda Trumpa from Mueller's investigation, Jay Sekulow, is also involved in investment activities.
"We are responding to the issues as appropriate" – Seculov replied when he was asked by NBC News about a comment.
The White House now feels the lack of a lawyer experienced in the area of impeachment, such as Emmet Floyd, who worked at Clinton's impeachment and advised White House at the end of Mueller's investigation, went away, and the current councillor, Pat Cipolone, has no such experience.
The White House Strategy speaker stated that the general officials at any time were not planning to engage people or create a centre of evidence, but admitted that there was a need for coordinated, common response and people who could lead a political fight.
Traveller of the Seas line Royal Caribbean went over the repair of 89 million pounds
Explorer of the Seas, belonging to the Royal Caribbean International family, will launch this year on the trip, presenting a completely new look.
After a renewal of $110 million (89 million), the ship is invited to a wide selection of culinary berths from around the world and a rich offer of divorce for the entire family.
This year, the Explorer stops at the most Spanish ports in Italy and Greece, allowing passengers to feel the taste of Central Europe.
When the arrival of the people is over, the ship's crew promises unforgettable sea effects.
By offering a satisfactory offer to each, the Explorer, after refurbishing $110 million, or about 89 million, moved to the passenger ship providing a perfect solution for the entire family.
The impressive technology means that passengers can surf on the floor through advanced surfing simulators or watch a favorite family film using the clouds of the weather, in the midst of a full-time cinema.
However, the most revolutionary attraction is the addition of virtual balconies, which enable the passenger of the cabin to view views on the ocean without needing to go out.
Water lovers are being designed for a new site at the base of the Caribbean Kurt style with water park doors.
The pool is surrounded by beach hammocks and ideal beds for sunrise, and two modernized are often in the hands of people with strong impressions on the floor.
An attractive traveler for passengers every year imposes the number of activities available to the guests during the journey to the destination.
The little adventure Ocean for children is a chance for young members of the family to remember beautiful, and the exclusive place to spend free time for adults offers a great game and a music bag prepared with people over 12 years of age.
If this is not enough, the whole family may be measured in the "studio B" on the ship in the laser tag box with the effect of lighting in the dark, which can also serve as a boat ride on the bed.
During the trip to the Mediterranean, guests will also have the opportunity to get to know exotic tastes from all over the world, depending on the side of the restaurants located on the beach.
Modern Asian cuisine is offered on board in the Izum restaurant, and in the freshly opened Giovanni's Italian Kitchen is served with an inspired novelty view of traditional Italian cuisine.
The rest of the dining points on the floor are served by the American restaurant offering Chops Grille, the Latin bar Boleros, the Schooner Bar and the express bar Johnny Rockets.
Reyes, with the option of seven- or nine-year-olds, is coming out of Rome in May 2020.
As a second European ship belonging to the Royal Caribbean joins in Allure of the Seas, which has recently passed an incredible repair.
After 58-day Metamorphosis Allure, at a cost of 165 million dollars, a travel operator offered guests who had previously made a reservation, a $300-dollar charge for shipping.
“Explorer of the Seas is a fourth ship of the Voyager class, which will undergo transformation in the modernization of the Royal Amplified fleet line.”
A program that requires investment of more than $1 billion, including 10 ships and for four years, improves every aspect of customer satisfaction and introduces a wide range of opportunities: from unrepealed attractions and gastronomics to nightlife.
Devin Nunes accused Democrats of trying to "take a picture of the Trump"
The Congressman Devin Nunes from California is obviously unable to refute the fact that the investigation concerns President Donald Trumpa.
In his fourth defense, the president accused the Democrats of wanting to get a nice picture of the President.
Now, the High Representative's High Representative in the Commission of the Election of Representatives, has set up a high-ranking position during a preliminary hearing of the complainant's complaints, such as when Trump returned to Ukraine to assist in the investigation against the candidate for democracy to President Joe Biden and his son.
The congressman called the Ukrainian scandal "grotessy presentation" of the left and their "medial ass", before he said that the Democrats wanted to see a picture of the president in the Netherlands.
"Democrats in this commission have negotiated with people who, according to them, have been Ukrainians to receive the grave pictures of the Trumpa," said Nunes.
"People can rightly ask why the Democrats are so determined to be the president in charge when they have their chance over the year.
When Nunes finished reminiscently, the political reporter of HuffPost, Jennifer Bendery, decided to see if the Democrats really are trying to... find out.
This time, the only representative of Connecticut, Jim Himes, answered, although we assume that his answer is the truth, confirming that many of his colleagues and colleagues think so.
Portal Mediaite.com suspects that Nunesa's comments on the existence of the "some more popular and unverified information", which are likely to appear in the controversial acts of Steele,
It is celebrated by former British spy Christopher Steele's collection of arrests against Trump, which indicates the probability of the existence of a cassette, which last night shows him a sighting of the power of prostitution in the hotel room in Moscow.
Potential studies on renewable biofuels can help reduce emissions
While in recent years electric cars and Semi Tesli have reduced information services, one issue seems to require renewable energy – aircraft.
However, a professor at Albert University developed a technology that would make it possible for renewable biofuels to be used as air fuel.
Dr. David Bressler is a professor at Albert University at the Department of Agriculture, Life and Environment, who started working on this project in 2003.
Its laboratory produces carbon fuel obtained from fat waste, such as fat from the restaurant, fat from the animal and oil of the river.
Unlike ethanol and other biofuels, this technology can benefit from low-quality oil production, due to the estimated 85% lower carbon emissions than in the case of oil fuels, as well as the use of waste from other industries.
This technology is designed to imitate current hydrocarbons in oil fuels.
"What our technology did in the first generation," said Bressler, "is [in] the creation of hydrocarbons which are identical particles like diesel fuel."
While opening up this new possibility of using biofuels, previously developed biofuels maintained a trend towards destabilization in lower temperatures, which posed a serious risk for high-level aircraft.
"The problem with the fuel aircraft is a little wrong," Bressler said.
It's really worth less than diesel, but it's got higher requirements.
The Bressler laboratory is currently looking at two options for the production of aircraft.
The first option is a low-risk approach that requires additional treatment of carbon fuel and water.
The second option is to continue to work over partly developed chemical properties that will provide fuel stability, even at low temperatures.
"We can experiment with chemical properties in our reactor to try to change them a bit," said Bressler, commenting on another option.
This option is more risky.
The open company created by the University of Alberty, Forge Hydrocarbons, works on product marketing because the airlines, as well as the Canadian and American armies, increase investments in a renewable option.
"They are able to imagine the times in which the situation can be reversed and the fuel tax imposed on them," he said.
They want to replace this alternative, which will be an emergency plan.
Forge is currently running a pilot plant near Edmonton Waste Management Centre and has recently received $4 million from Lockheed Martin as part of an investment aimed at supporting the cost of $25 million of the production plant, which will be located in Sombra, Ontario.
It is expected that the plant will produce about 19 million litres of biofuels annually.
Bressler also notes that the planned coal reduction will result in about 85 per cent, but issues such as transport and fuel production continue to decrease the coal.
"As a technology specialist, Bressler said,
I have a task to develop options that enable us to make informed decisions and many choices."
OUTER CARTON: Next hole in the neck
8 thousand euros and 750 euros lost the residents of the place, thinking that it was helping his nephew who caused the accident.
The incident police reported on the fourth day of the suspect's son.
"To a woman he called in the middle of a man who gave himself for her grandson.
He said he's caused the accident and he needs money.
Otherwise he's going to jail.
In order to help the grandson, she handed down 8 thousand ills and 750 euros to a false police officer who came to her house," said Dr. Dorota Krakowska-Bubillo from the foreign police.
The police are looking for judges and then again calling for caution:
"Each telephone with a request for financial assistance must be verified.
Do not act under emotional and fast influence.
Let's remember that cops don't ask for money and they don't take money.
If we receive a phone with a request for financial support that encourages our views, we should react immediately and inform the police by calling the alarm number 112.
We also appeal to younger members of the family.
Let's talk to our seniors about the dangers, let's tell them how they act.
Please be careful and don't trust those who call and ask for money."
Prime Minister Boris Johnson warns that in the event of the defeat of the Great Britain, the U.S. government is threatening the situation like in Los Angeles, and he himself calls for peace.
One of the chief ministers of the Agency said yesterday evening that the country is threatening "a civil society" if the initial result is questioned by the outcome of the second referendum.
Britain's prime minister of the United Kingdom, from his closest environment, warned that the country is threatening social concerns at the level of the protest of the "golden trucks" in France due to social inequality and the situation in Los Angeles in 1992.
Johnson called for the "relief of the tools" during a turbulent debate on the language of politics, but stressed that the use of the word "responsibility" would not stop.
Despite his appeal for peace, the cabinet minister said "The Times": "There have never been protests in this country such as the 'Gilets Young' demonstrations or the 'Golds' houses in Los Angeles in 1992.
People think it's impossible just because they didn't happen before.
Now they have an example – young guitars – they use encrypted phones that can coordinate the picnics, and there are a few unskilled populist leaders in order to get people to protest.
The inhabitants of Los Angeles were fired after the fire of the Allied mob destroyed four white police officers who killed the blacksmith of Rodney King in 1992.
In this year, the anti-government demonstration in France carrying yellow red camels – yellow young people – has been on the streets of Paris for more than six weeks.
The minister pointed to Johnson's warning in Izbie Gmin and said that if Britain can't get out of the EU, there would be "a catastrophic loss of confidence in our political system".
"If we organise a referendum in which 30 million people are voting and 66% of them will be told about the rest of Great Britain in the European Union, ten million citizens will not be satisfied," said the Minister.
Even if this result ignores 99% of them, we'll have 100,000 people who'll write to their job and who won't give up.
Many don't need to see hundreds of thousands of people on the streets soon.
One of the main ministers of the office added that the country is threatening the "GDP" if the outcome of the first referendum is questioned by the results of the second.
Johnson called for a general election to be held in which the electorate would have to dispute with the Brexit Act.
According to the Prime Minister, there is a risk of an agency building that seeks to reduce demand in connection with patents and achieve this compromise agreement with the EU.

Talk'N"Roll for us.
More than 300 participants listened on Thursday (September 26th) 11 encouraging delegates, including Szymon Holovnia, Krystyna Czubán or Ireneusz Krosny.
It's all under the Talk'N'Roll conference, which took place in Krakow the fifth time.
Talk'N'roll 2019
Enlargement of horizons, talks on value added and joint discussions that may lead to further development.
These goals were set by the organizers of the Talk'N'Roll conference, asking for 11 exceptional delegates, representing very diverse branches and areas of interest, and among them are other people known from the media - Szymona Holovnia, Czubovnian Christian and Irneusz Krosna.
The theme of the current edition of Talk'N'Roll was "Crafting the Future, NEW" and just around creating the future, guests invited to participate in the conference.
The first session was opened by the manager of Sabre Polska, Sebastian Drewecki, who spoke about how the brand that is building around him might have an impact on our future.
Richard Lucas went to the scene to change the public's monitoring of the phenomenon of rejection, saying that it should be accepted if the future is to be created, and Chris Badura has taken on the issue of empathy in the time of the progressive development of technology.
Paula Mascarenhas (VP Sabre) shared insights and techniques that can help manage careers and increase overall satisfactory by finding an appropriate balance between professional and private life.
The second part of the conference opened a multi-stakeholder conversation with Kristin Czubán, who told others about how her outlook on the year changed the teacher’s career in Poland.
One of the most popular voices in the country admitted that today, thanks to development technology, everyone can challenge this profession.
However, it does not consider that over the next few years, man has been completely replaced by technology.
Also after her, Peter Nabeelek had a life-threatening problem in times of information, emotional or electoral pressure, sharing the public's valuable points, such as dating him, and Lukash Lütoch said in his statement what could lead to the next industrial revolution, known as "Provision 4.0".
Playing lessons, learning dancing
The conference's organizers also asked for artistic impressions, calling for an illusion scene, Daniel One.
The third part of the conference opened by Ireneusz Krosny, who first played pantonism public, and then, for example, told about how he managed to maintain the proper balance between his career on stage and his private life.
Szymon Holovnia was also critical of his attendance, stressing the role of time in our life.
The publisher noted that even two minutes can permanently remove the situation and must be ready to use this time.
In addition, Holovnia shared his thoughts on the subject of reality, calling for anecdotes that could cause smiles on the faces of the audience.
Then Adrian Twruszka appeared on the scene, who reviewed the history and objectives of several innovation models and brought them back to the way they are being used today.
At the end of Marcin Slovakia, for example Rubika's bones, he told about the approach to solving problems.
Each of the 11 presidents has certainly proposed something new in keeping with the reality of all those who have the opportunity to look at the events and the life-response and numerous questions to the guests about the great involvement of the public.
The organizers provided a message for all who could not personally participate in the event, and recordings from the pre-election are available on the website.
The courts are right instead of the governments.
"In spite of the lack of sufficient votes to change the Constitution, the majority of the managers have made a number of changes in the state system, creating threats to the protection of the rule of law and the principle of the third-party authority," wrote in the fourth report of the Helsinki Foundation for Human Rights.
The Court of Justice, rather than governments, document among others changes in justice and in the area of protection of fundamental rights and freedoms.
The Helsinki Human Rights Foundation (HFPC) published in the fourth report entitled "The Courts of Law instead of Governments.
Threats to the protection of human rights in Poland in 2015-2019".
The Foundation assesses in the report that in 2015-2019 the largest human rights protection decree in Poland has been applied since 1989.
"Despite the lack of sufficient number of votes to change the Constitution, the majority of managers have made a lot of changes in the state system, creating threats to the protection of the rights and principles of the third-party authorities.
The right to political objectives has been replaced by the rule of law by the rule of law," writes HFPC expert.
What's HFPC's report?
The report records changes in the functioning of justice, independent institutions (such as public media or the Civil Law Ombudsman) and in the protection of fundamental rights and freedoms (including freedom of assembly, women's rights, LGBT people's rights and the right to a decent process).
The report also summarizes a three-year dispute between the Polish authorities and the European Union.
"In the last four years, for the first time and on such a scale, we have observed the use of the right to implement partial party interests.
This was a continuing legal crisis and also a weakening of the entire human rights protection system in Poland," stressed lawyer Marcin Wolny, one of the authors of the report.
Protection of Human Rights
As indicated in the report, in the last four years it has been "systemal changes in both the state and the human rights protection process".
Over the last four years, Sejm has adopted more than 20 legal acts from the point of view of human rights protection.
"The changes were often adopted at a rapid pace, without social consultation and despite threats to the legal environment, the Ombudsman for Civil Law or international organisations," the co-author of the report explained Malgorzat Szulek.
According to the report, the main trends observed over the past four years are: "the weakening of independent institutions (including courts and prosecutors) and the lack of respect for the laws and recommendations of international institutions and the weakening of the protection of human rights".
State bodies have not responded
In particular, the Helsinki Foundation for Human Rights has recognized “these situations in which state authorities have not responded or have simply learned about acts of aggression.”
Foundation experts have noted that some changes have been introduced in the atmosphere of attacks on individual institutions or professional groups or groups exposed to discrimination.
The Foundation points out that the result of State activity in the area of the limitation of the rule of law is a constant struggle of the Polish authorities with the European Union, as well as a number of recommendations from international law firms.
"Not only does the implementation of these recommendations undermine the position of Poland as the leader of the democratic change in the Central and Eastern European region, but the Polish state is also responsible for violating the law of the European Union or the European Convention on Human Rights," we read in the report.
Brother of the Pakistani social media star with respect to killing
Women's rights experts claim that justice is often difficult because of prolonged proceedings, the release of suspects for punishment and the closure of public opinion.
"It's a long time for people to forget," says Farzan Bari, defending women's rights and the first founder in Pakistan of gender studies at the university, and adds that even a wide-ranging case of Baloch's murder has been discussed for over three years.
Although, according to the group fighting for women's rights, it was difficult to establish, in 2018 the Pakistani Human Rights Commission stated that at least 300 cases of such crimes were reported.
Many activists claim that the real number is significantly higher, and a network that promotes the awareness of crimes on the grounds of honor threatens that in Pakistan there are about one fifth of the 5,000 crimes committed every year worldwide.
Poland’s border recording equipment
However, transfers to the country are small because many immigrants arrive outside of Poland on a permanent basis – the fifth ‘Rzeczpospolita’.
The latest report of the Euro-Tax company shows that Poland's average earnings in other European countries resulted in more than 8,6 thousand dollars in 2018, which means that almost a thousand gold has increased by almost 12%.
Euro-Tax "is convinced that the total income of Polish migrant workers in the Union reached a record value of 154.5 billion in 2018, a seven-year period more than a year earlier," we read.
Director of the Research Centre at Warsaw University of Migration, Pavel Kaczmarczyk says that Poland is becoming more and more familiar with the international labour market, where different options are used.
"A growing number of specialists and professionals who are looking for better conditions move from the country to the country, like international corporate workers," the newspaper says.
Some Euro-Taxu clients work in two countries, such as Britain and Germany, throughout the year.
"This is mostly in the RFN in 2018 because 11% of Polish immigrants have increased their combined labour (up to 27 billion).
However, the largest Polish has been made in Switzerland – almost 35 billion evil," we read.
The President of the Euro-Taxu considers that despite the improvement of working conditions in the Polish market, the number of unemployed immigrants is not small.
I continue to believe that in the West and in northern Europe (in Norway) there is often a chance of a few times higher slavery than in Poland.
“And even at the minimum rates in that country, such as in Germany, EUR 9.5 to 11.7 per hour,” the newspaper reports.
The European Parliament notes that Poland is not only on the basis of higher labour, but also because they are on the border.
Many Polishs are leaving behind a border crossing, which is also seen after the smaller transfers of money to the country.
These birthdays were less than a year old.
As economist Tadeusz Christian points out, with the extension of the period of stay beyond the borders of a small group of money-trading people to the country, their height decreases.
"Emigrants draw close to each other," we read in the fifth "Rzeczpopolitie".
Long-term monsoons cause reason and chaos in many regions of India
The monsoon season in India is nearly a month long, and the unspoiled floods cause death as a result of the destruction of many buildings and nests.
Usually in northern India monsun is at the beginning of September, but the average Floods in this month exceeded the standard by 37%.
According to experts from the Indian Meteorological Department, if this situation continues for a few days, it will be the last of a decade's monsoon.
In many parts of the country, the floods are still unspoiled – in the last time in western India, the city of Pune has caused the death of several people and the destruction of buildings.
There's been a storm of houses, people have dug through the streets in the water on the knees, which usually has a place only during monsun's apogeum.
Great floods also occurred in cities such as Kalkuta, Lucknow and Haydarabad.
The result of long-term floods in the northern state of Uttarakhand has destroyed many homes.
Monsun also started to be late.
In many areas water was scarce, so farmers prepared for a possible drought.
The long-lasting monsoon is not beautiful seen by farmers.
That amount of rain isn't normal this time of year.
“With it my crops – and now I have a capturing, fascist, grass and migrating – disappear,” says Prakash Mehra, a farmer from a small economy in Bhimtal in Uttarakhand state.
For consumers, the effect of late and late monsoon also indicates a rise in the price of cebules, i.e. an unexpected ingredient of Indian food.
Cebula, for which 20 rubies were usually paid (0.23 British pounds), currently costs 80 rubies (about 1 British pounds) per kilogram in cities such as Delhi and Bombay.
Festivals and shrines are also threatened.
The next big festival is the October 8 festival of the Holy Dasara, during which Hindus take huge balls, such as the comic, representing Ravana, become a bitter smell and a smile from the "Ramajana" era.
The burning of Ravany symbolizes the triumph of good over evil.
However, given the fact that a similar Ravana was made out of paper, if the monsoon continues, it will be the last of Ravana.

Doodle celebrates 21 birthdays of Google
It would be hard to imagine a world without Google today.
In the searcher we are looking for answers to all the touching questions.
What are we looking for in Google?
"What is it?", "Where?", "How?" and "Where?" is one of the favorite categories that Poland has searched for.
One of the giants, it turns out that last year we were eager to ask about "Where's the bridge?", "How to make the spaghetti?" and "How many fingers have horses?", "How to stop the muscle of fruit?", "How to eat?".
Today, the searcher is dealing today with the first twenty-first generation.
Its users – and in Poland up to 96% of people benefit from "Google's uncle" – welcome special Google Doodle today.
This time it's not animated.
Google remembers his births, showing a static computer with monitor, mouse and keyboard, and on the right, a digital date was printed – as in the 90s picture.
Catalogue of information
The searcher was established for a specific purpose – she had to catalogue all possible information and make it available via the Internet.
Her name is a word game.
It comes from a mathematical term of googol indicating the number of ten raised to a fixed power.
This name was also to reflect the company's intention to index as the largest number of pages from world resources on the Internet.
Google researchers were founded by Sergey Brina and Larry Page in 1996 under their student project at Stanford University.
It was based on a mathematical analysis of the dependence between parties, which worked better than the usual method of recording results based on the frequency of this phrase.
At the beginning of the searcher, the name BlackRub, related to the English word blacklink, indicates the number of pages linked to the result.
Page and Brin set up a company operating under Google Inc. 7 September 1998, and shortly thereafter they launched a similar website google.com.
What's up, Google?
In December 1998, the "PC Magazine" showed information about the extremely high incidence of Google's search results.
Then the company's history seems less like the baiki - the blizzard development with each month, the next market collapse and the increase in company value.
Already in June 2000, the Google's URL index has more than a billion positions, making the work of Page and Brina the world's largest Internet search engine.
The company currently founded by Page and Brina is one of the famous players on the IT market.
So is there another field for development?
"The mission of Google's company is the organization of global information resources to be generally available and useful, although we have made significant progress in this area, it is still a long way ahead of us to achieve this goal," said Peter Zalewski in a conversation with Google Poland.
Frequent contact with pesticides may increase the risk of heart disease and brain damage
A new study suggests that work with the introduction of contact with plant protection measures in large weight may be at high risk of heart failure in later years of life.
This happened in the case of a group of Americans from Japanese origin in Hawaii, which has been studied for over 30 years.
Researchers have found that compared with men who did not work with plant protection measures, those who had greater contact with them were 45% more exposed to heart disease or stroke.
"The study stresses the need for the use of personal protective equipment at the time of contact with pesticides at work and the importance of evidence in medical documentation with such measures in work, as well as the control of standard factors that increase the incidence of heart disease," said Dr. Beatriz Rodriguez.
She's a medical professor at the University of Hawaii in Manoa.
The results are based on data from more than 6,000 men on the Oahu island who participated in the cardiovascular Kuakini Honolulu programme.
As scientists have noted, the results of studies may not apply to women and other populations, since it involved only men of Japanese origin.
Pesticides have a long period of half-life, so their effects on their health can tell themselves many years after contact with these substances.
In this case, the most visible results were observed within 10 years of contact with plant protection substances.
“ After 34 years of observation, ” said Rodriguez, “a man’s relationship with the use of pesticides and heart disease was no longer significant. ”
It was likely because there were more important factors associated with ageing that masked possible causes-effect relationships between contact with pesticides and the incidence of disease in the later years.
Researchers have not found a significant relationship between exposure to small amounts of plant protection measures and increased risk of heart disease or stroke.
Phone speech Zełenski-Trup: Adults who are three big
Washington's policy is a busy week for opening the procedure against US President Donald Trumpo
The political scandal is for the political debitant of the Greens situation that he would like to avoid.
But what do we really know about the Zełenski-Trup affair and will it have long-term effects for the first of them?
At the beginning of the telephone interview, Trump told Zełenskie that the United States is doing more for Ukraine than for the European countries.
Despite the fact that the White House notes are not complete, they describe in detail the attack by Trupa on the German Chancellor Angelj Merkel because the German leaders, together with other leaders of European countries, engage in negotiations instead of presenting concrete proposals.
Controversy prompted Zełenski's response, who admitted to agree with Trump, not 100%, but 1000%.
Zölenski added that both French President Macron and Merkel are not enough to help Ukraine.
This exchange of views led to the decision that policies, in particular the Ukrainian opposition, decided to vote by means of social services.
Peter Poroszenko, former President of Ukraine, said on Twitter that the EU's support "was without precedent".
In other tweets, Poroszenko said it is grateful for the EU's "Russian aggression" support, which included sanctions and financial aid.
Others expressed their concern, including Ukrainian politician Victoria Voysitska, who said: “How can we talk now to Germany and France?"
Then Trump mentioned the military assistance and asked Zełenski to investigate not one but two things: the first about the son of Joe Bidena – Hunter – and the second related to the collapse of the DNA server, suggesting that Ukraine was involved in the hacking attack on the e-mailed Democrats during the elections in 2016.
It is not known whether it describes European relations or whether relations with the French and German leaders will be broken.
I don't want to talk bad about anyone...
We thank everyone who helps us," he said after publishing a record of telephone conversations in New York during the United Nations General Assembly.
Zölenski has to meet with the leaders of Russia, Germany and France at the close of the "normal square", which will take place in October.
Drivers Inspectors were legally united
The court has cleansed Jerzewsky of his crimes.
After six years, Jerzy Wisniewski was finally cleansed of his wounds.
The District Court of Industry cleared Jerze Wisniewski, former head of the Military Inspectorate of the Trade Quality of Plants and Food Articles in Russia, with a view to extending the powers.
The Lubelska prosecutor accused him of violating the provisional Marchal control period at the food-producing oil plant.
He has recently fallen into this case as a legal offence.
The appeal was announced on 12 September.
"The court has held the case against the accused,” confirmed Judge Malgorzat Reiser, judge of the District Court of Industry.
It is the judgment of 14 February issued by the Regional Court of Industry.
Jerzy Wisniewski then commented on Facebouk: “Six years have passed since I was presented by the Appeals Office in Lublin for a series of violations of the rights to telephone calls with Maršalki Podkarpakki's Vojdzidzidwek on 30 April 2012.
The court simply stated that I was innocent and did not break the applicable law at the time.
I was convinced that my phone conversation with Maršálka Podkarpakki was consistent with the applicable law.
The version of the media published in 2013 by the Appeals Prosecutor in Lublin was true and caused irreparable damage both to the food producer and to the loss of the views of my staff in my employees, among the employees and in the local society.
The Court's case against me contains a number of errors, incorrect facts, incorrect legal grounds, not confirmed in fact.
With the help of the CBA in Russia, everything was done to remove me from public and professional life.
I was immediately released from work and left out of financial resources.
I've been staying with my wife for a long time."
Let's remember.
Jerzy Wisniewski has completed the role of a leading trade quality inspector of agricultural and food articles in 2009-2013.
He was dismissed from the position after his sentence was filed in 2013 by the prosecutor in Lublinia.
In his opinion, he had in his phone conversation the immediate leader (Mirosław Karapyta was sentenced to 4 years of deprivation of liberty) for the period of control at the food-producing oil plant belonging to the wife of the former subcarp.
This warning, as the prosecutors from Lublin said, was to cause the owner of the company to know about control and to correct labelings on oil that were incomplete.
Jerzy Wisniewski heard threats of extending his powers, which threatened him until he was three years old.
"I hope that this case has finally reached its end and the court has confirmed my innocence.
I have been convinced from the beginning that I have not done anything wrong, which is now the final confirmation is a legal cause that has led me away from my arrests," comments Jerzy Wisniewski.
White House tried to hide a conversation with Greens.
In a report published on Thursday, the signalist wrote that President Donald Trump, speaking with the President of Ukraine, had taken over the interference of the United States elections, and the White House had tried to hide the record of this conversation.
Presidents of Ukraine and the United States
In an anonymous report on 12 August, a potential intelligence worker, he wrote: “I have been informed by many members of the U.S. government that the president has used his role to address the country’s interference in the elections in 2020 in the United States. ”
“The Tempp used part of the conversation (with Zełenski) to achieve its own interests.
And exactly – he tried to press the Ukrainian leader to take steps that would help the president in the re-election in 2020," a report quoted in The Hill newspaper.
The Ukrainian leader "has been given an understanding" that his contacts with Trump are dependent on whether "will show the will to take the game" in matters where President Rudy Giulian was more precise to inform him.
The author admits that he was not a witness, but stressed that he was specifically informed of its content by “a number of White House officials who had direct information on this subject”, and their reports were covered.
“In the following days after this conversation, I learned from many U.S. officials that very high representatives of the White House have intervened to "break up" all the archival records on this conversation, and in particular the written record that has been prepared, as is usually done, in the critical room of the White House,” we read.
"The High Commissioners of the White House told me that the White House's lawyers "can't remove an electronic record from the information system in which such records are stored.
The record has been transferred to a separate electronic system, which is usually used to store and manipulate information in particular," the author of the report wrote.
“In my assessment these steps testify to the fact that the White House officials have given themselves the matter of what happened during the conversation,” the signalist said.
According to the AP, this document will provide a more prompt procedure for the possible involvement of the President and will also provide valuable information on the evidence that can confirm this report.
The Green White House meeting was made available in the environment, but not on the basis of an electronic record, but on the basis of relationships between people who were witnesses to it.
The content of the report, in the revised version, was published by the Committee of Representatives on the day following the publication of the report.
In addition, on Thursday, the Director of the U.S. Report, Joseph Maguire, announced before the Committee of the Election of Representatives and made an explanation on the way he dealt with the report of the Ombudsman.
Maguire said that the signalist made the right choice and acted as he ordered.
He also stressed that his view of the conversation with Zełenski was an “unforeseen” event.
Democrats in the Committee asked Maguire why he blocked access to the Congress's signalist report; the director of the report said he did not have the right to disclose his content, which is a certain nature guaranteeing that the executive authority was granted.
The part of Maguire's hearing by the Commission was held by closed doors.
On Tuesday, the presidential election of the representatives of Nancy Pelosi announced that, on the assumption that the president had issued a statement to the Ukrainian authorities to damage his potential rival in the next presidential elections, the election of the representatives of the House of Representatives was a follow-up that might lead to the commitment of the troops.
The day after that, she assessed that the record of the Trompa talks with Zełenski confirmed that the President of the United States had broken the rules on elections and security.
Election law in the United States prohibits the use of state aid.
However, the Court of Justice assessed that the president did not violate the right of election. On Thursday, the White House of Stephanie Grisham said that there was nothing "in the discussion" and in the report "there is nothing more than a collection of relations with third-hands and collected together in demand."
"The White House will continue to criticise this history of media and the false narrative promoted by the media of the main nervous system," she added.
Ghana receives two ICAO awards
Ghana received two prestigious awards during its 40th International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) Assembly in Montreal, Canada.
The security award was granted in evidence that Ghana received the highest number of points for Air Safety Control in Africa, i.e. 89.89 per cent in terms of the temporary implementation time (EI).
It reached the end of ICAO's ICVM control on 3 April 2019 in accordance with the United Nations Aviation Safety Agency's General Audit Programme.
The protection award was evidence of the high involvement of the country in the implementation of ICAO standards and protocols for the protection of aircraft and in the Ghany airspace.
The award programme has been developed to support the ICAO initiative No. Country Left Behind.
In addition, 16 other safety and safety certificates and 17 safety certificates were granted to ICAO Member States that have improved their safety and protection standards.
During the award for Ghany, the current Minister of Aviation, Joseph Kofi Adda, Director General of the Civil Aviation Office of Ghana, Simon Allotey, Ambassador Ghany in Canada, Nii Ayikoi Otoo and Director of Ghana Airport Limited, Yaw Kwakwa.
The President of the International Civil Aviation Organization, Olumiywa Benard Aliu, stressed in his speech the need to maintain safety at the airport by Member States.
He stated that “it is important that we constantly remind ourselves that even in the era of aviation security, protection and sustainable development must remain our fundamental priorities”.
On his behalf, Mr Adda noted that the rewards were a great achievement for the State's efforts, as they are complementary to the hard work and productivity of the industry.
He also added that the airport industry has a huge potential for developing the country's economy, saying "the airport has a powerful opportunity to change our lives.
These are the social and economic benefits, but everything is a result of the security and protection that we have been able to achieve."

Trump named Peter Gaynor on the head of FEMA: White House
Peter Gaynor, who serves as the Director of the Federal Crisis Management Agency (FEMA), laughs at the meeting of the Senate's National Budget Security Committee on the proposal of the FEMA for the financial year 2020 at the High Capital Territory in Washington, U.S.A., on 3 April 2019.
WASZYNGTON (Reuters) – White House announced that on Thursday, US President Donald Trump named Peter Gaynor as head of the Federal Crisis Management Agency (FEMA).
Gaynor will be the deputy administrator of the FEMA, the head of the agency, who monitors the government's response to disasters such as hurricanes or forest fires.
The agency worked without an administrator approved by the U.S. Senate since March when it released this position.
Long declined after the United States Department of Safety, which is subject to FEMA, saying that Long had misused public vehicles for vehicles between Washington and his home in North Carolina.
Another candidate for this position, Jeffrey Byard, was excommunicated earlier this month, when the precise verification of his past revealed the charges that he had taken part in a fight in the bar.
The appointment of Gaynora was expected to take place.
To confirm his appointment to this role, the majority of the Senate will be required.
The White House announced that before Gaynor became a substitute for FEMA in 2018, he worked in crisis management in Rhode Island and served in the seabed.
Henrik Ingebrigtsen, Norwegian fugitive, considers the amputation of the arm
The 28-year-old runner specializes in the distance of 1500 metres, gaining the gold medals of Europe's masters in 2012 (Helsinki), September 2014 (Zurich) and Bronze in 2016 (Amsterdam).
He is also a Vice-President of Europe for 5000 metres from 2018 (Berlin).
He explained that it is not a new inclination and that he has already passed one operation immediately after the games in 2016, but the pain has returned, and in this session he has been very violent.
Pain makes me change my pace, and since my body changes, other unnatural burdens follow, and I begin to feel pain in other places, for example in the liver.
For this reason, I couldn't prepare enough for the horrors of the world, and from two weeks of pain it's so strong that I have difficulty putting up balls – said the runner on the NRK TV channel.
The father and trainer, Gjert Ingebrigtsen, admitted that after long discussions with his son, the only solution to not finish the career and participate in the future Olympic Games in Tokyo will be amputation.
It looks like it's the only one, although the drastic solution and the decision has already fallen.
"If a part of the body is suffering, it should be avoided, and Henrik is in fact not so much in need of this arm and in this situation it should be forgotten about the cosmetic aspect," he explained.
Police closing illegal e-paper factory with marijuana in San Gabriel – CBS Los Angeles
EL MONTE (CBSLA) – On Thursday, the police closed an illegal e-paper factory with marijuana in San Gabriel Valley.
At the office building located on the streets of 9600 Telstar Avenue, about 16:37 was constructed, while the police were looking for illegal e-papers for sale containing marijuana and during which a large salt containing cotton oil was found – a concentration of Indian coins.
According to Lieutenant Christopher Cano of the El Monte police officers, they also found equipment used to fill out the heating inputs.
"This process is very dangerous," says Cano.
Cano, who used to work in drugs, says that the distillation of oil used in vaccine products is a potentially vulnerable process.
"The usual electrostatic truth of our arrests may cause the burning of these waves, not only fire but also concentration, even explosions," he says.
“If we have a lot of salts in the room and those like, after one explosion, the next occurs, causing not only fire but also explosions that could take off the surface of the whole complex.
The Office was invited to work together to deal with illegal and potentially dangerous substances.
At present, the value of the products and equipment confiscated is not known.
The detectives say they received an anonymous guide that allowed them to obtain a search warrant, thereby detecting illegal activity.
Followers continue to try to obtain information about who is behind this illegal business.
According to them, the responsible person put an interest in this place because the office was empty.
The investigation continues and officials want to ensure that illegal products have not been found on the street, taking into account the recent article on the injury of smoking.
"People really don't know what products they buy," says Cano.
‘They may be mixed with other harmful chemicals.
This may pose a threat to our society and to our children, so we always keep them in front of us for this kind of thing.
Aphtin is removed from the store.

There is no such option if you take this medicine.
Banknote 19 zł – where to buy collecter banknotes about this nominee?
The nose was named 19 gold, and the vision of Ignace Jan Padrewski appears on it.
At the beginning of October a new banknote will be introduced – the National Bank of Poland informed.
This is the next banknote from the "Independence".
It will commemorate the 100th year of the creation of the Polish Papers.
As recorded in the NBP communication, the banknote will be Ignacy Jan Padrewski.
The date placed on the banknote, 25 January 2019, is the date on which the PWPW was set up on the 100th anniversary of its establishment.
Also, the nominal value, 19 zero, connects to the Year of Creation" - we read in the NBP communication.
The water mark shall present an air display from the first Polish banknote produced in the PWPW after recovery of uncertainty.
The news is a holografic package located on the ground floor.
The front page presents the portrait of Ignace Jan Padrewski, and a styled view of the Orla White Order was presented in addition to the "non-seated" letter.
This letter, quoted by Jósef Piłsudski’s manuscript, is a 100-year-old trademark of the trade recovery by Poland.
In the wild, symbolic brotherhood and victory, the security developed by PWPW - Umbra4Note will be a special form of the crop effect.
The back of the bank note is placed on the back of the gmach Manufacturer of the modern Warszawa pans.
It is built around the PWPW logo for SPARK Live and the opalising package, also visible in UV light as repeated numbers "19" and "NBP" - describes the NBP.
The banknote is to enter the 2nd October of the deal to 55,000 pieces.
One banknote will cost 80 gold.
All coins and banknotes issued by the NCB, including those from the special series, are legally payable in Poland.
However, their nominal value is significantly higher than that which can be achieved on the collective market.
The new owner bought it for 500 thousand dollars, or more than two million gold, for his parents and decided to move the building to Queenstown in Maryland.
The house was transferred to a special platform at the Easton port where it was loaded onto the boat.
From there he crossed the river 50 miles.

We meet with popular writers and books at exceptional prices.
"We're here to break stereotypes.
The people of Subcarpathia say they don't read a book.
We'll show that it's different," she said during a press conference of Marta Poltorak.
And who's going to support reading in Russia this year?
As we have heard, the sister Anastasia appeared on the streets, the first church of Rzečipospolitj, and also: Lukasz Orbitowski, Katarzyna Bonda, Karolina Korwin-Piotrowska and Jacob Čwiek.
This event will take place in Millenium Hall, a major cultural event – 22 and 23 November to the commercial center of the 3rd edition of the Holy Scriptures, one of the most important reading events in the region.
At the market, the most exciting publishers and bookshops from all over Poland will come.

The exhibition of the death row of Elżbiety I in the Hampton Court Palace
The recharged silver nicina made from the most famous twin-stone has been artificially decorated by the haftas representing plant, animal and motility.
For Eleri Lynn, curator of the Historic Royal Palaces Foundation, this meant just one thing.
The wall of a 100-year-old wall on the wall of a small rural church of paraffinic, on which she looked, could be the only lost part of Elsebeth I garden.
Three years after Lynn was hit by an oil tank in Bacton in the Herefordshire County, the lost Elżbiet's son should be found next month at the Hampton Court Palace, near the same places where the king of the Tudor dynasty could carry it over 450 years ago.
The importance of this discovery is that only one element of the XVI permanent juice has survived from the entire collection of royal ashes.
Although there is no compelling evidence that Elżbieta ever wore this dress, three years of research encouraged experts to believe that she had to be part of the royal garden.
"Crebrogues", of course, was legally reserved only for the most important members of the royal court, and the quality of the plants and flowers released, later enriched by eating, dogs, motleys, fish and stranger, indicates that the killer belonged to the most prominent person.
The drought, when it was washed, could cost the equivalent of Tudor's property.
"Moreover, in the 1990s, or at the end of Elżbiet's marriage, she felt the danger of other women at the door and would not tolerate a river carrying such created tanks," says Lynn.
“As a very important statement, I have asked many people from the environment to look at the drought.
I was really happy to see the dress, and they were attracted to it, and they were practically convinced that we had a royal guard in front of us.
Long, renewed life sucks, forced to serve as an altar cloth in the dark St Faith church in Bacton, is not as surprising as it might seem.
Bacton is the story from which Blanche Parry, the closest lady to Elżbiei, who served the king for the rest of her life, and with whom in local legends was the subject of the drama.
Although the drought arose after her death in 1590, experts believe that Elżbieta had to give her family Parry or parafia to Blanche's memory before her death in 1603.
After more than a thousand hours of conservation work, four of which resulted in the longest hand chain with specially colored twin and thin surgical needles, an ultrasound tape on the exhibition next to the exhibition by the Hatfield House portrait "Rainbow Portrait", one of the most recent contemporary paintings representing Elsbiet in a similar suit.
"When you work with historical prints, you really begin to admire the art of people who have done it," says Libby Thompson, the chief of conservation work, most of which has been done to this end in the Hampton Court palace courtyard – the only great place to accommodate some of the priceless palace Goblins.
"Looking at the hat from the front and the back, I began to feel great gratitude for those who did it.
I've never worked on anything so elite.
The exhibition “The Lost Dress of Elizabeth” begins on 12 October in the Hampton Court Chamber
The Fitch Agency confirmed rating Poland with a stable perspective
The Fitch Agency confirmed in the fifth long-term rating of Poland in the currency of the village at the level of "A-" – given in the communication.
The rating perspective remained stable.
"The Fitch Agency refers to strong macroeconomic and well-developed economies that are supported by reasonable economic policy and the strong banking sector," we read in the Ministry of Finance Communication.
As added, Fitch pointed out that Poland was located in the connique cycle, and in 2019-2021 the real growth rate of the Brutto National Product in Poland will be 4.1 per cent, 3.3 per cent and 2.9 per cent respectively.
The Agency estimates that the deficit of the government and self-government sector to GDP in 2020-2021 remains below the limit of 3 per cent, 2.3 per cent, and 1.9 per cent, respectively.
"The rate of government and self-government debt to GDP in 2019 will be 50.5 per cent by the agency and will be lower in the years to come (mean 48.3 per cent in 2020-2021)", we read.
Rating Polski
A series of reviews of the Polish rating of 11 October will end S&P and Moody's.
Rating Poland in the evaluation of the Fitch agency remains the same as published at the end of March 2019.
At the time, the agency confirmed the rating of Poland at the level of "A-" with a stable perspective.
Of the three largest rating agencies, Poland's highest rating of Moody's is ‘A2’.
Rating Polski according to Fitch and S&P is "A-", one level below Moody's.
The perspectives of all assessments are stable.
What's rating?
The rating agencies are set up to help investors assess the risk of their investment activities.
Rating is awarded to companies, banks and state.
In the case of the latter, each assessment shall be subject to economic attractiveness.
Rating is nothing but an assessment of credit credibility.
It is based on decisions on who and how to earn money.
Sometimes such information also suggests that it is best not to give any credit at all, because it is a very risk that money cannot be recovered.
The lower rating is related to the higher risk.
On the other hand, higher risk is a high percentage of credit.
Each assessment must be reasoned and interpreted.
The rating may be manipulated, but in this case the agencies risk loss of reputation.
At this time, over 90 percent of the world's rating services market is controlled by three agencies: Standard & Poor's, Fitch and Moody's.
Each of these uses its own system of assessments.
“Fiveth of the Confederation”: First 1000 plus
"Fiveth of the Confederation", which is the main establishment of the electoral programme, presented on Friday in Kosovo a candidate to Seym from around 40 requesting a mandate from the KWF Freedom and Independence List.
The leader of the Kossalian letter to Seym Krzysztof Chmielewski presented the title “Fiveth of the Confederation”.
"After the first 1000 plus programme for Poland, the second quick and fair trial, the third cultural and public bonus, the fourth national security, the fifth is healthy life," said Chmielewski.
He noted that "police must finally start to work well," which is why the federation wants to cancel the income tax and, as Chmielewski said, "the problem with free tax is going to grow."
"Poland needs to make a choice where they want to save their money on the estate, i.e. PIT zero and voluntary ZUS for all," said the leader of the list on the settings of the 1000 plus programme for Poland.
Instead, Aleksandra Zadencka, starting from the second place of the list, said that "health is increasingly high" food should be "supported by Polish farmers, Polish agriculture", acting on GMO's rights.
As she said, the federation is also spoken of as stopping the “stigmatization of the syllables”.
Zadencka declared support for the "development of a natural resource-use building".
She also spoke on behalf of her group of “good-willed vaccines”.
"It may not be a violation of the right to know agreement," she added.
Further candidates to the Seym from the Kosovo border stressed that the Confederation was “to carry out a profound reform of the judiciary”, which should include dealing with the case by the judge “day by day”.
It was also said that the grant of the world would go to school without self-governance, or, according to them, without additional costs related to the maintenance of officials.
The federation is also “a strong Polish army, based on Polish industry and Polish soldiers”.
The candidates to Seym stressed the need to increase the number of arms.
They also require easier access to weapons.
In economic matters, they stressed the need for "sustainable access to energy".
"We can gasp the coal, we have a lot of geotermal energy, we need to consider again the concept of nuclear power," said Piotr Karpinski fifth on the list.
The head of the Mexican cartel stands for one third of the drugs in the United States
Chicago – just east of the West Side in Chicago CBS News related the early drug situation.
Brian McKnight from the DEA Office showed me what's going on.
In the last year, almost 800 people died of drug overdose in Chicago.
McKnight said "probably 90%" drugs in Chicago come from Mexico.
DEA focuses on the Mexican drug lord, Nemesio Cervantesie, known simply as El Mencho.
"This is the most important priority for DEA and directly for the federal executive bodies in the United States," said Matthew Donahue, head of DEA in Mexico.
The reward for El Mencho is $10 million.
He helped to discover dozens of places in El Mencho's drug labs.
The El Mencho Cartel Jalisco Nueva Generation, or CJNG, is responsible for at least one third of the drugs that lead to the United States by the way of land and sea.
In the view of the Department of Justice, the cartel has produced "tonnes" cocaine, methamphetamine and heroin contaminated with fentanyl.
El Mencho's head is waiting for a reward of $10 million.
As an ironic, he lived in California some 30 years ago, where he was arrested for drug abuse and was finally deported to Mexico.
That's where he created a brutal cartel.
He owns a large amount of weapons, RPG, 50 calibre guns.
Basically, they have their own SWAT team," Donahue added.
El Mencho fearlessly defends his empire, using such measures as the bombing of a Mexican army helicopter, to kill six people or to take part in public news this year.
In recent years the brutalization of the cartel has led to thousands of murders.
According to the statistics of the Mexican government, about 94 murders occur every day.
Mexico's drugs in Chicago are so toxic that they can't be taken without a protective equipment.
In the cocaine pack, the manufacturer's mark is indicated.
For more than one third of them, they lead to the El Mencho cartel.
"It is responsible for sending a terrorist who kills innocent women and children," Donahue said.
So when someone dies, Donahue thinks there's a long chance that drugs come from El Mencho's organization.
Over 67 000 Americans died last year from overdose.
France: 27 years old, President of France and his wife
The 27-year-old man tried to make Emmanuel Macrona and the first lady – says French prosecutor.
The accused shall ensure that they have documents that compromise the presidential pair.
He asked the Head of State for EUR 300 thousand in cash.
A man who was born in Azerbaijan and wanted to work in the police in France claims to have received from a person employed in the Palace of Elizabeth's "survival" documents.
During the hearings, he explained that these documents not only compromise the presidential pair, but their disclosure may pose a serious threat to the security of Macrona and the first lady France.
Instead, he asked for EUR 300 thousand for their return – he also wanted to get an apartment in Paris.
He contacted one of Brigitte Macron's daughters from the previous marriage.
According to the prosecutor, he refused to submit the documents he had mentioned to the police.
He said that the transmission would be medium - but we do not know if these documents really exist.
They were not found during the audition in the residence of this 27-year-old.
The man was subjected to psychiatric tests, but the doctors did not find any serious complications in him.

As part of the recent State of Play, Sony announced that the Prime Minister of The Last of Us will take place in February 2020.

"Fabula is ambitious and has been involved in areas where she was not the only one," he said.
She had to be so wide that she could present this kind of story with both positions.
We didn't intend to create the most comprehensive game, so it just happened.
"Explains our consciousness as long as the possibilities are hidden in this story. They will be a moment when you think you're dying to the end, but imagine that it's just beginning and that there's a completely new division," says Druckmann.
It's such an ambitious game that she didn't put herself on one BluRayu and it's on two plates.
In another place it was found that The Last of Us: Part Two contains one or two Easter egg for adults (information given by Gamestpot).
We're not going to be a dog of surprises, but the Easter Eggs show back to the old school work of Naughty Dog.

Run, fight and fight - Sport
On Saturday, Stomil will take Podbeskida and will want to win.
Stomil's pilots from three cars are inconsolable.
At that time, the Piotra Ządzkowski received seven points because they won with Stalá Mielec and Chojniczánk Chojnice, and in the final match, the free regime fell in Suwałk.
The 18-hour Podbeskid approach is now being exchanged as one of the factories to advance to the Extraclass.
The nearest rivers of Stomila take the fourth place in the table and have a point of view over the team from Olstyna.
Underbessky played six times in this season and played after two victories, remiss and defeats Natomis Stomil feels very well on his property – at the stadium at Al. Piłsudski 69a, Piotra Ządzkowski's team won three times and won.
A total of 17 points were collected together in the tens of columns and are in the top of the table, although after two breaks at the age of the game, there was nothing to say.
"Every change takes time to be a result," explains Peter Skiba.
"Well, in the end something has stopped us, we believed in ourselves, and we can also work under normal conditions.
We just got together on the game in the ball.
They're clean heads, it's a good atmosphere, and everyone knows what to do, because we have a strong school."
On Tuesday, Stomil's pilots withdrew from Puchar Polski Roch Chorazov, but they needed corrections and a series of military reds.
On the south of Poland, Peter Skiba, Grzegorz Lech, and Janusz Bucholc did not leave because the trainer Ządzkowski offered to relax these key players before the Saturday trip to Podbeskid.
In Croatia, however, Jacob Mosakaovski was playing a reconnaissance game, which eventually shot his long - awaited flag.
“It’s always nice to get naked, and I’ve still found that this allows us to play in the guns (Moscowski said at 3:3 in the 119th minute – okay.).
My father was always right and laughed that I couldn't get the glasses, and I always told him I'd shoot at him at such a time when he wouldn't wait."
Moscow now counts back to the basic composition, more than because of the yellow cards it can't play Ołeh Tarasenko.
"After this, I insist on training to be able to play in the first collection," says Moscow.
“In Croatia, I did everything to represent myself as best.
But whether I'm playing or sitting on a reserve seat, I'm going to be as strong as I can support the team.
Because the most important is the team and three points in the game with Podbeskid.
We are certainly looking forward to a difficult meeting in which victory will have to run, run, and fight."
In the middle of the oil defence, Rafał Remiss can still play, which has recently also been attacked, so whether it happens, we'll find ourselves on Saturday, more than the traditional Uzdzkowski coach tries to stay in secret until the end of the court case.
A man raped and murdered his sister.
“You will never see the light of the day.
You'll never breathe fresh air again," said Judge Kevin K. Allen, turning to Alexa Whipple.
"What you have done was so exciting and low that you have to spend the rest of your life in prison," he added.
Five-year-old Lizzie disappeared in May.
Her search lasted five days until Whipple indicated the place to hide the body.
"How could someone do this to his own sister?" asked Dejay Smith, a virgin girl.
"You're the worst person ever to offer," said Alexa Whipple.
"I'd leave everything to meet her again, hug," said the murdered girl's mother.
"Our life will never be the same again," added the woman.
As Fox News reports, 22-year-old Whipple showed no emotions during the hearing.
In the past month, he admitted that he was drunk, used sexually, and murdered a girl.
A male lawyer claimed that his client was raised in an imperfect family.
He should have been tortured like a child.
He also added that Whipple is aware that he has done a terrible deed and is willing to bear the punishment.
A man was sentenced to life without the possibility of asking for release.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced that he would deliver nearly $100 million of additional funds to the dry society.
The programme to ensure money for farmers affected will be extended and the criteria for allocation of additives to the economy will be simplified.
The aid package covers nearly $34 million in support of the drought-affected society initiative, which makes it possible to receive up to $3,000 in urgent cases in cases.
Each of the 13 local self-government areas under the Social Assistance Programme will receive up to $1 million in infrastructure and help to deal with the impact of the crisis.
The new support package is an addition to more than seven billion dollars allocated by the government to the struggle fund.
Frostpunk - a strategic game that connects the production of the type of city-builder with a unique 19th-long society simulator and a cold survival – is close to scheduled for the 11th of October of the premier on consoles.
11 bit studios made every effort to create a strategic game in an intuitional and natural way to play with the console controller.
Frostpunk: Console Edition on Xbox One and PlayStation 4 was therefore built on some basic issues.
Among the changes are the pre-modeled management system and the renewed user interface, including new selection wheels, fast access and convenient groupings available in the building game.
For all the console players who don't know Frostpunka, we've got to put in a cold universe game as a fabular fan:
Frostpunk is a game that deals with staying above the borders of society in which heat means life, and every decision has its price.
The task of the game is to build on the frozen desert city whose heart is a pairs generator.
Now a complex, strategic game, coupled with a rich fabula and uneven survival experience, will be available at the consoles.
Frostpunk: Console Edition will be a real test for your tactical knowledge.
Chinese (In the Name of Love China's Mystery Busters)
documentary film: In China, the number of divorces has increased twice in the last decade.
As a result of this state of affairs, there were three persons in general.
More and more men maintain a marriage relationship, which has led to the formation of a special branch in that country – a professional group of couples who are responsible for managing the marriage of women.

An attempt to invite the Prime Minister to the Czech Republic
A personal trial was carried out before the election meeting with the Prime Minister Matthew Moraweck in the Czech Republic.
“The new state, the vote, the vote, we do not welcome the Prime Minister here!
Let's dance aloud: Ma-te-usz!", he strongly urged the leader.
Unfortunately, the efforts of the enthusiastic leadership did not produce the expected result.
The campaign's in progress.
Politicians go throughout the country, trusting their voters.
The intensive campaign will also be carried out by Prime Minister Mateusz Moraviecki, who is the leader of the Swiss list of Pis is a common guest in this region.
Each meeting is well planned, including the appropriate equipment.
The same was true, and most of all, it had to be in the Peter of Slavic.
Information – a special guest should be invited in a special way.
Before meeting with the Prime Minister, the current manager decided to carry out a general test.
He tried to encourage a mob to scan the name of the head of the government.
“This will not be welcome to me, except for Mr. Matthew's Prime Minister!
More loud, more loud than my droids!", he encouraged the disenchanted.
Unfortunately, the crowd did not give up in the heat of the leader's hot air and suddenly responded to the Ma-te-usz, but the recording of the enthusiasm of the leader makes the noise worse in the network.
Ronald Lee Haskell: A man punished for the murder of his ex-wife in Texas
Ronald Lee Haskell, 39, was sentenced to death in 2014 by Stephen and Katie Stay and four of their five children in Spring, Texas.
The authorities thought he went into the Stayov's house on 9 July 2014, asking to reveal the location of his wife, Melanie Haskell, who was in separation.
She wasn't there, but she was her sister, Katie Stay and her family.
Stephen Stay, 39, Katie Stay, 33, two boys aged 13 and 4 years, and two girls 9 and 7, died when Haskell opened fire, as said the Bureau of Hrabstwa Harris.
He survived only one family member, 15-year-old Cassidy Stay.
The authorities said it was a serious wound, but they managed to heal her completely.
On Thursday, members of the Lava allies refused to defend Ronald Lee Haskell on the basis of inadmissibility.
You're gonna have to go back on Monday to make a statement.
Quantum Internet increasingly closer to reality – ScienceDaily
The results of the U.S. Army survey include an online quota of steps closer.
Such an Internet could offer military security, detection and accuracy of time-consuming access to the traditional approach to network creation.
The Centre for the Advanced Quantitative Transformation of Information of the Military Research Laboratory d'America's Development Opportunities for the Implementation of the Walk of the American Army was looked at by researchers from the University of Insbruck, which managed to achieve record transfer of the state between the material and the light – within 50 kilometers with the use of light cables.
It's a correlation that can arise between kangaroos, such as cubits.
When two cubes are filled and measured by one of them, this will affect the size of the other one, even if the other cube is physically removed.
"These [50 km] are two rows of sizes as far as possible and it is an effective distance to the start of the inter-compute network," said Dr. Ben Lanyon, an experimental physics from the University of Innsbruck and a leading researcher in a project published in Nature, the Quantum Information section.
Intermediate quota networks would be made up of remote networks of physical cubes, which are covered with them despite large physical distance.
Researchers have found that this extension of the state of the apartment is necessary for the creation of a cash internet.
"This demonstration is a step forward in achieving a wide-ranging state of affairs," said Dr. Sara Gamble, co-administering the military programme supporting this investigation.
The quality of the state of the second end already after the passing of the light is too high to meet some of the most difficult applications of the quota network.
The research team began experimenting from the atoms of uweução in the drop of iron.
With the help of lasers researchers, they entered the ion ion's apartment, while encouraging him to take out the photo in which the quota information was recorded.
As a result, quantification of atoms and particles of light have been absorbed.
The challenge is to send a photo of a light cable.
"The photo taken by the fire has a length of 854 nanometers, and it is quickly extinguished by light," said Lanaon.
That is why his group initially sent out a portion of the light through a non-linear crystal marked with a powerful laser change.
The length of the photo file was converted to an optimal value from the point of view of the transmission to a large distance – the current standard telecommunications length was 1550 nanometers.
Then the researchers sent this photo through a 50-kilometre light cable.
Their measurements show that atoms and particles of light continued to be filled even after the length of the file was changed and the distance passed.
"The choice of air means that this result leads to a direct way for the creation of a full network of atomic rays at large physical distances, as the fuel can be combined with the high quality of the "petroleum".
The army is very much interested in the grids built on a large scale based on the application of precise positions, precise navigation and time synchronization," said Dr. Fredrik Fatemi, a military researcher who also co-operates with the programme.
