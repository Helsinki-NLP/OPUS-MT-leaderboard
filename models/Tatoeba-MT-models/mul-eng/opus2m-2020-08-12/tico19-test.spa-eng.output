A rapid increase in coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in the European Union or the European Economic Area and the United Kingdom from 1 January to 15 March 2020
The cumulative incidence of coronary disease cases (COVID-19) shows similar trends in the countries of the European Union or the European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, which confirms that, although in different stages according to the country, the COVID-19 pandemic is progressing rapidly across all countries.
On the basis of the experience of Italy, countries, hospitals and intensive care units should improve their preparation for a patient wave with COVID-19 which will require medical attention and, in particular, intensive care.
On 31 December 2019 a conglomerate of cases of unknown etiology neumonesia in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China was reported.
On 9 January 2020, the Centre for Control and Prevention of Diseases in China reported that the causing agent was a new coronavirus that is now known as coronavirus 2 of severe respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
Since then, the disease caused by the infection with SARS-CoV-2 has been known as coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
The evidence at the date indicates that 80 per cent of people with COVID-19 have mild disease, i.e. a respiratory tract infection with or without pneumonia, and that most of them recover.
In 14% of cases, COVID-19 is developing towards a more serious disease requiring hospitalization, while the remaining 6% of cases develop a critical disease requiring intensive care.
The mortality in patients hospitalized by COVID-19 is 4%.
In this study, we examined trends in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in each country of the European Union or the European Economic Area (EU/EEC) and the United Kingdom (RU) and compared them to those of the province of Hubei, China.
We also compare the current number of cases of COVID-19 in EU/EEA and RU countries with Italy from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
Cases of COVID-19 in EU/EEA and RU countries
After China, COVID-19 continued to spread geographically and the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic in the rest of the world are currently continuing in this country.
On 11 March 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 as a pandemic.
In its issue of 5 March 2020, Spiteri et al. reported on the first confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Europe according to the WHO definition of case.
In the EU/EEA, the first three confirmed cases were registered in France on 24 January 2020 in persons who had returned from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
By 15 March 2020, COVID-19 cases had been detected in the 30 EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom (RU), according to which 39 768 cases and 1727 deaths had occurred between 31 December 2019 and that date alone, of which 17 750 and 1441 deaths had occurred in Italy alone.
Acquisition of the cumulative amount and cumulative incidence of COVID-19 cases
At the European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC), reports of COVID-19 cases reported in each country in the world, obtained only from official sources, such as the Ministry of Health of the Countries, National and Regional Health Authorities and WHO, are updated every day at 8:00 a.m.
These data were used to examine and compare COVID-19 trends in the EU/EEA and RU.
As an indicator of the prevalence of active COVID-19 cases, we calculated the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 cases over 14 days; thus we took into account the natural course of COVID-19 in each EU/EEA and RU country during the period from 1 January to 15 March 2020.
We also present the cumulative number of cases reported in each country by 15 March 2020 at 8:00 a.m., compared with Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 trends in EU/EEA and RU countries
The trends in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 cases over 14 days in EU/EEA and RU countries were generally followed by the province of Hubei (China) (Figure 1).
In the EU/EEA and the RU in general, the COVID-19 cumulative incidence began to increase around 21 February and then significantly increased around 28 February 2020 (complementary material).
This was due mainly to the rapid increase in the number of reported cases in Italy, but all other EU/EEA and RU countries showed upward trends in the CVID-19 similar cumulative incidence (complementary material).
Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of cases of COVID-19 in EU/EEA and RU countries, compared with Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
It points out that by 15 March at 8:00 a.m., 15 other EU/EEA and RU countries had already registered a total number of cases comparable to Italy three weeks earlier or less.
Our results indicate that the number of reported COVID-19 cases is increasing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the RU.
The trends observed in the COVID-19 cumulative incidence suggest that pandemics are progressing at a similar rate in all countries.
This is so despite the different stages in which countries, variations in national public health responses and possibly different definitions of cases in countries and protocols to select patients who should be tested to confirm CVID-19, including delayed tests.
At the beginning of March 2020, doctors in the affected regions of Italy described a situation where 10 per cent of COVID-19 patients needed intensive care, and the media reported that hospitals and intensive care units in these regions had already reached their maximum capacity.
Data on admissions of cases of COVID-19 in a hospital or intensive care unit are currently available at EU/EEA level for only 6 % and 1 % of cases, respectively (there are no data).
However, it should be systematically collected to complement the current monitoring data focused on the number of reported cases and the number of deaths.
A study conducted in 2010-11 showed a significant variation in the availability of intensive care and intermediate care beds in Europe, ranging from 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 in each 100,000 inhabitants in Portugal.
This means that countries can have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 beds of intensive care and average care per 100,000 inhabitants in 2010-11).
Model scenarios relating to the saturation of medical care capacity, with estimates for each EU/EEA country and RU of the prevalence of COVID-19 hospitalization cases associated with a risk >90 % of overcapacity of intensive care beds are provided in the sixth update of the ECDC risk assessment on CVID-19.
Since cases have so far been consolidated in certain regions of EU/EEA and RU countries, and hospitals and intensive care units are normally addressed to a defined regional population, information on cases and intensive care beds should be made available at the level of the Statistical territorial Units Nomenclature 2 (NUTS-2).
Italy's experience and current trends in other countries show that the COVID-19 pandemic is progressing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the RU.
Countries, hospitals and intensive care units should therefore be prepared for a sustained community transmission scenario of SARS-CoV-2 and an increase in the number of patients with COVID-19 requiring medical attention and, in particular, intensive care, as is taking place in the affected regions of Italy.
As indicated in the rapid risk assessment of the ECDC, it is essential to adopt a rapid, proactive and comprehensive approach to delay the spread of SARS-CoV-2, with a change of a containment approach to one mitigation, since the rapid increase in the number of cases may not give sufficient time to decision-makers and hospitals to understand, accept and adapt their response in a manner that is not implemented with anticipation.
The rapid risk assessment will also include the necessary public health measures to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.
There is a short period of opportunity during which countries have the opportunity to deepen their control efforts to curb the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce pressure on the health system.
If this is not done, health systems from other EU/EEA countries are likely to be faced with a wave of patients requiring intensive care in the coming days and weeks.
Coronavirus 2019 disease outbreak (COVID-19), caused by coronavirus 2 severe respiratory syndrome (SARS) (SARS-CoV-2), has so far caused the death of 3,000 people and infected more than 80,000 people in China and other parts of the world, resulting in a disaster for mankind.
In a similar way to its homologous virus, SARS-CoV, which caused SARS in thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 could also be transmitted from malaria and cause similar symptoms through a similar mechanism.
However, COVID-19 has a greater severity and mortality than SARS, but it is much more transmissible and affects more people than young people and more men than women.
In response to the increasing number of publications on emerging disease, the purpose of this article is to provide an adequate and complete analysis of the research topic, which is being developed rapidly.
We will address the main aspects of epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognostication and disease prevention.
Although many questions have not yet been answered, we hope that this analysis will help to understand and eradicate this threatening disease.
The spring festival of 25 January 2020 has become an unheard of and unforgettable memory for all Chinese people who were urged to stay home during the whole festival and for several weeks more due to the outbreak of a new viral disease.
The virus has almost the same name as the coronavirus (CoV) that caused a serious acute respiratory syndrome outbreak (SARS) in 2003; therefore, on 11 February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) called it SARS-CoV-2, and the associated disease was called Coronavirus 2019 disease (COVID-19).
The epidemic began in Wuhan, China and spread rapidly across the country and almost 50 countries around the world.
On 2 March 2020, the virus has caused more than 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19, with more than 40,000 patients with high data and more than 3,000 missing patients.
WHO warns that COVID-19 is the "public enemy number 1" and that it is potentially more powerful than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nei.gov/pubmed/), more than 200 scientific articles on COVID-19 have been published, including their virology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis and treatment, since the first report of 7 January 2020, which identified the sequence of the virus isolated from multiple patients.
The aim of this analysis is to sum up the progress made in research on this new matter that is rapidly developing.
When possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 with SARS and another disease caused by a COV, the respiratory syndrome in the Middle East (MERS, a outbreak in 2012).
We will also consider what is known until now about disease prevention and predictation, as well as some critical questions that have not yet been answered.
Coronavirus has traditionally been considered non-letal pathogens for humans, which mainly cause about 15% of the common colds 4.
In this century, however, we have seen two times with highly pathogenic coronavirus in humans, namely, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which caused an original outbreak in China in 2003, and in Saudi Arabia in 2012, respectively, and soon spread to many other countries with terrible morbidity and mortality.
Therefore, the current COVID-19 outbreak is the third by coronavirus that has been recorded in the history of mankind.
As shown in Fig. 1,1, unexplained neomonia conglomerates of unknown origin were first informed by Wuhan on 31 December 2019 to the National Health Commission of China.
Seven days later, he became aware of the sequence of coronavirus.
On 15 January 2020, the first death case was registered in Wuhan.
Meanwhile, the epidemic was rapidly spread to nearby cities, provinces and countries.
On 20 January, the infection of medical care providers was reported, suggesting that human transmission was possible.
On 23 January, the city of Wuhan was placed in custody and all public transport was suspended.
On 24 January, the first clinical study on disease reported that only 21 of the 41 patients with confirmed cases had been directly contacted by the Wuhan marine market, which was considered the site of infection of an unknown animal source.
On 30 January, WHO declared the outbreak a global health emergency.
At the date of this report, disease has already spread throughout China and almost 50 countries worldwide (Figure 2.2).
As the situation evolves rapidly, the final size and gravity of the bridge cannot be determined yet.
On 11 February 2020, a multicentre study of 8866 patients, including 4021 COVID-19 confirmed patients, presented a more up-to-date description of the following epidemic (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bbbbdA).
The SARS-CoV-2 infected people of all ages, but mainly individuals from 30 to 65 years of age.
Almost half (47.7%) of the infected persons were over 50 years of age, very few were 20 and only 14 were less than 10 years old.
SARS-CoV-2 infected more men (0.31/100 000) than women (0.27/100 000).
The COVID-19 was expanded into conglomerates mostly in Hubei and around it.
On average, they would spend 5 days (from 2 to 9) between the appearance and diagnosis of COVID-19.
The average incubation period was 4.8 days (between 3.0 and 7.2).
The average time from appearance to death was 9.5 days (between 4.8 and 13).
The basic reproductive number (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05) and the adjusted R0 was 2.23-4.82.
The number of people infected increased exponentially before 23 January 2020, which coincides with the mass mobilization period before the spring festival in China.
The mortality of patients with confirmed cases was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10-1.86%), and the adjusted mortality of all patients was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02-4.59%).
The three main risk factors for COVID-19 were gender (male), age (≥60) and severe neumonia.
Coronavirus is a subfamily of large and surrounding viruses that contain an ARN chain of unique meaning.
It can be divided into four genders, that is, alpha, beta, gamma and delta, of which alphacoronovirus and deltacoronavirus are the ones that infected humans.
Glycoprotein (S) of the envelope is combined with its cell receptors, angiotensin 2 converting enzyme (ACE2) and dipeptidil peptidase 4 (DPP4) for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, respectively, and then membrane fusion is produced.
The viral ARN gene is released from cytoplasma; after the replication of the viral gene, the genomatic ARN, along with the glucoproteins of the circulation and the nucleocapside proteins, is vesicles containing viruses, which then merge with the plasma membrane to release the virus.
The first economic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was announced on 10 January 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 has been found to be a new type of beta-coronavirus with a genetic identity of more than 99.98% in 10 successive samples taken from the original site of the broth: the Huanan Sea market.
SARS-CoV-2 is genetically more similar to SARS-CoV than MERS-CoV.
With an electronic transmission microscope, particles of SARS-CoV-2 were found in ultradelgat sections of the human respiratory epithelium.
It was determined that ACE2 is a recipient of SARS-CoV-2, as well as SARS-CoV.
The SARS-CoV-2 protein, however, combines with the SARS-CoV2 human ECE2 more weak than the SARS-CoV, which is consistent with the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes a less serious infection in patients than SARS-CoV.
The SARS-CoV-2 can also form a new short protein coded by the Orf3b and a secret protein coded by the Orf8.
The ORS-CoV-2 Orf3b may have a function in viral pathogenicity and inhibit IFNb’s expression; however, the Orf8 does not contain any known domain or functional reason.
On 18 February 2020, Zhou, et al., revealed the structure of the ECE2's electronic chrymomicroscopy structure of complete human length in resolution 2.9 Å, in conjunction with the B0AT1 amino acid carrier.
They found that the complex, which had open and closed conformity, was gathered as a dam, and that the complex ACE2-B0AT1 can combine two S proteins, which provides evidence for the recognition and infection of the coronavirus.
B0AT1 could be converted into a therapeutic diagnosis for the drug study in order to remove SARS-CoV-2 infection.
The origin and average host
It is known that SARS-COV and MERS-COV were born in shellfishes and were transmitted to humans by means of seals and camels, respectively.
In a phylogenetic comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with other coronaviruses, it was considered that the Murciaellagus is the native host of SARS-CoV-2, since the new virus is identical in a 96% to two similar coronaviruses like SARS of morticulas called bat-SL-CoVZX45 and bat-SL-CoVZX21.
However, it is still unknown what average host helped the virus cross the barrier of species to infected humans, and still diluciated the transmission route.
Ji, et al., proposed to the snakes as carriers of the human musculoskeletal virus, which involved homologous recombination within protein S.
According to a study, researchers from Guangzhou, China suggested that panalines (long hockey mammals that are fed from hormones and are commonly used in Chinese traditional medicine) are a possible average host of SARS-CoV-2 based on a genetic homology of 99% in a found coronavirus in panolins and SARS-CoV-2.
However, a difference of 1 % promoted by the whole of two genes remains a major difference; however, final results are expected to provide concrete evidence (Figure 33).
The physicochemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are still widely unknown.
The SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive in vitro for 48 hours in a dry environment and up to 5 days less than 20 °C with a moisture content of 40-50 %.
The SARS-CoV-2 could have similar properties.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 is sensitive to ultraviolet radiation and temperature at 56 °C for 30 minutes; the ether, ethanol at 75 %, a chlorine disinfectant, perchloric acid, chlorform and other fat solvents, but not chlorhexidine, are effective to disable the virus.
The entire human population in general lacks immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and is therefore susceptible to the new coronavirus.
To date, no detailed study on the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 has been announced.
As a result, we can only apply to previous studies with other coronavirus, particularly SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (fig. (Fig. 4.4).
In general, after the virus invades the host, it is first recognised by the invasive immune system of the host through the master recognition receptors (PRR), including C receptors, Toll receptors, NOD receptors (NLR) and RIG-I receptors (RLR).
Through various means, the virus induces the expression of inflammatory factors, dendritic cell maturity and the synthesis of Type I interferons (IFN) that limit the spread of the virus and speed up macrophatic fagocytosis of viral antigens.
The SARS-CoV protein N, however, can help the virus escape immune responses.
Soon, the adaptive immune response will be taken into account in the fight against the virus.
T lymphocytes, including T CD4+ and CD8+ cells, perform an important function in the defence.
T CD4+ cells stimulate B cells to produce specific antibodies to the virus, and T CD8+ cells directly kill infected cells with the virus.
Cooperative T cells produce proinflammatory cytokines to help the defensive cells.
However, coronaviruses may inhibit T-cell functions by inducing the apoptosis of T-cells.
Humor immunity, which includes supplements such as C3a and C5a and antibodies, is also essential to combat viral infection.
For example, the isolated antibodies of a recovered patient neutralized MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, an excessive reaction of the immune system locally generates a large number of free radicals that can cause serious damage to lungs and other organs, and in the worst cases, the multi-organ failure and even death.
The SARS-CoV-2 infection, characterized by conglomerate appearance, is more likely to affect older people with disabilities and pregnant women.
It is common for people exposed to a large number of viruses or whose immune functions are committed to have a greater risk of infection than others.
The estimated average of the SARS-CoV-2 incubation period is from 1 to 14 days, mostly between 3 and 7 days, according to a study of the first 425 cases in Wuhan.
However, a 1099 study showed that the incubation period was between 3 and 24 days on average.
A more recent study, as described earlier, shows that the incubation period was 4.8 days (between 3.0 and 7.2) based on the demographic of 8866 cases.
It is very important that health authorities adapt the time of effective care according to the more accurate incubation period; this means that asymptomatic infected persons are expected to transmit the virus to others.
As usual, people exposed to the virus or infected should normally remain in contact for 14 days.
Should the quarantine be extended for 24 days?
Fever is often the main and initial symptom of COVID-19, which can be accompanied by no other symptoms or other symptoms such as your dryness, dysnea, muscle pain, sea, headache, throat pain, kidney pain, chest pain, diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting.
Some patients had dysnee or hypoxaemia a week after the disease appeared.
In serious cases, patients evolved rapidly to develop acute respiratory syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis and coagulopathy.
Patients with fever or respiratory symptoms and acute fever, even without pulmonary anomalies in image studies, should be tested for early diagnosis.
A demographic study of late December 2019 indicated that the percentages of symptoms were 98% for fever, 76% for dryness, 55% for dyskinesia and 3% for diarrhoea; 8% of patients would require respiratory assistance.
Similar Halazgos were reported in two recent studies of a family conglomerate and a conglomerate caused by the transmission of an asymptomatic person.
Comparably, a 2012 demographic study showed that patients with MERS-CoV also had fever (98%), dryness (47%) and dysnea (55%) as major symptoms.
However, 80 per cent of them would require respiratory assistance, much more than patients with COVID-19 and in line with the highest mercenary fatality of MERS with respect to COVID-19.
Diary (26%) and chest pain (21%) were also observed in patients with MERS.
In patients with SARS, fever (99%–100%), dryness (29%–75%), dysnea (40%–42%), diarrhoea (20%–25%) and throat pain (13%–25%) were the main symptoms and respiratory care was required in approximately 14% to 20% of patients.
For 14 February, the mortality of COVID-19 was 2% when confirmed cases reached 66,576 worldwide.
Similarly, the mortality of SARS for November 2002 was 10 % in 8096 confirmed cases.
For MERS, according to a June 2012 demographic study, mortality was 37% in 2494 confirmed cases.
In a previous study, it was reported that SARS-CoV-2 R0 was high and increased to 6.47 with a confidence interval (IC) of 95% from 5.71 to 7.23, while SARS-CoV R0 was only oscillating between 2 and 4.
A comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with MERS-CoV and SARA-CoV with regard to symptoms, mortality and R0 is presented in Table 1.1.
The previous figures suggest that SARS-CoV-2 has a more propaganda capacity than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but its profitability is less than the latter two.
Therefore, it is much more difficult to control the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic than the MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
The appearance of conglomerates often occurs within the same family or from the same meeting or vehicle, such as a cross.
Patients usually have prior travel or residence in Wuhan and other affected areas or contact with people infected or patients in the two weeks prior to their arrival.
However, it has been reported that people can carry the virus without symptoms for more than two weeks and that patients with high hospital conditions can again fight the virus, a warning signal that the time of quarantine should be increased.
Patients have a normal or reduced number of white blood cells in peripheral blood (especially lymphocytes) in the early phase.
For example, lymphopenia was observed with a white blood cell content of < 4x109/l, including a lyocytes content of < 1x109/l, and high aminotransferase aspartate levels in 1099 patients with COVID-19.
Hepatic and muscle enzymes and myoglobin levels were high in some patients, and reactive C protein and erythrocyte sedimentation were high in the blood of most patients.
In patients with severe cases, the Dimero-D level, a product of fibrillation present in the blood, was high, and the content of lymphocytes was gradually reduced.
Anomalies are detected in the tortic radiographs of most patients with COVID-19, characterized by shadows or oscillators in bilateral esmeral glass in lungs.
Patients often develop atypical neuron, acute pulmonary injury and acute respiratory difficulty syndrome (SDRA).
When SDRA is produced, uncontrolled inflammation, fluid accumulation and progressive fibrosis seriously affect the gas exchange.
The dysfunction of type I and type II neumocytics decreases the surfactant level and increases surface tension, reducing the ability of lungs to expand and increase the risk of pulmonary collapse.
As a result, the worst findings in tortic radios are often parallel to the maximum severity of the disease.
On 18 February 2020, COVID-19's first pathological analysis demonstrated the decommissioning of neumocytes, the formation of a hyalin membrane and the infiltration of lymphocytes in the interstitution, and multiple-nuclear sinic cells in the lungs of a patient who died from the disease, which is consistent with the pathology of a viral and SDRA infection, and similar to that of patients with SARS and MERS.
The detection of SARS-CoV-2 ARN by a polymerase chain reaction with reverse transcriptase (RT-PCR) was used as the main criterion for COVID-19 diagnosis.
However, due to the high rate of negative errors that could accelerate the epidemic, clinical manifestations for diagnosis (which were no longer based solely on RT-PCR) began in China on 13 February 2020.
A similar situation also occurred with SARS diagnosis.
Therefore, a combination of disease predecessors, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests and radiological findings is essential and imperative for effective diagnosis.
On 14 February 2020, the group Feng Zhang described a protocol for use of the SHERLOCK technique based on CRISPR to detect SARS-CoV-2, which detects synthetic fragments of the SARS-CoV-2 ARN between 20 × 10-18 mol/l and 200 × 10-18 mol/l (10-100 copies per microlitre sample) using a graduated variable within an hour that does not require complex instruments.
Fortunately, the new technique can dramatically increase sensitivity and convenience if tested in clinical samples.
Due to the lack of experience with the new coronavirus, doctors may generally provide support to patients with COVID-19, while testing with a variety of treatments used or proposed prior to treatment of other coronavirus such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and other viral diseases (Table 2.2).
These treatments include current or potential use of antiviral drugs, immunosuppressants, steroids, recovered patients plasma, Chinese medicine and psychological support.
The plasma of patients recovered for treatment is even proposed.
The pharmaceutical companies compete to see who develops the first antibodies and vaccines against the virus.
SARS-CoV-2 mainly attacks lungs at the start and probably also attacks other organs that express the ECE2, such as the digestive device and kidneys.
However, respiratory dysfunction and insufficiency are the greatest threat to patients and the main cause of death.
As a result, respiratory assistance is critical to relieve symptoms and save lives, including general oxygen therapy, high flow oxygen, non-invasive ventilation and invasive mechanical ventilation according to the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms need extracorporal membrane oxygenisation assistance (OMEC), an modified cardiopulmonary bypass technique used to treat potentially fatal cardiac or respiratory failure.
In addition, maintenance of electrolytic balance, prevention and treatment of secondary infections and septic shock, and protection of the functions of the vital organs are also essential in patients with SARS-CoV-2.
Cytocinoma is known to be the result of an excessive reaction of the immune system in patients with SARS and MERS.
The cytokines tortoise is a system inflammatory response form characterized by the release of a series of cytokines, including TNFα, IL-1b, IL-2, IL-6, IFNá, IFNb, IFNG and MCP-1.
These cytokines cause immune cells to release a huge number of free radicals that are the main cause of SDRA and multi-organ failure.
Immunosuppression is essential for the treatment of cytokines, especially in severe patients.
Corticosteroids and tocilizumab, an IL6 receptor monoclonal antibodies body, have been used to treat cytoquines.
Other immunosuppressive treatments for cytoquines are modulation of the immune response directed by T cells; the blockade of IFN-g, IL-1 and TNF; the inhibition of JAK; blinatumomab; a suspension of route 4 of cytoquines signalling, and HDAC inhibitors.
Steroids, such as immunosuppressants, were widely used in the treatment of SARS to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
However, high doses steroids were not beneficial for severe pulmonary lesions in patients with SARS and COVID-19.
Instead, they can cause serious side effects, in particular osteonecrosis, which significantly affects the forecast.
However, careful use of corticosteroids at low-moderate doses has been recommended for a short period for COVID-19 patients in critical conditions.
At the date of this analysis, no efficacy of antiviral therapy has been established.
However, the effectiveness of remdesivir, a nucleotide analogue, administered intravenously in a U.S. patient with COVID-19 has been verified.
Remdesivir is a new antiviral drug developed by Gilead for the treatment of diseases caused by Ebola and Marburg virus.
Subsequently, remdesivir also demonstrated the potential to inhibit other viruses with monocatenary ARN such as MERS and SARS viruses.
On the basis of these, Gilead has provided the composition of China to carry out a couple of trials in people infected with SARS-CoV-2, and there is great hope for the results.
In addition, baricitinib, interferon alfa, lopinavir/ritonavir and ribavirin have been suggested as possible therapy for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, hepatic impairment and other adverse reactions may occur after combination therapy with lopinavir/ritonavir.
Interaction with other medicines used in patients should be carefully monitored.
Plasma of recovered patients and generation of antibodies
The extraction of blood from patients who have recovered from an infectious disease to treat other patients who have contracted the same disease or to protect healthy people so that they do not treat the disease is not new.
In fact, recovered patients often have relatively high levels of antibodies against pathogen in the blood.
Antibodys are an immunoglobulin (Ig) produced by B lymphocytes to fight pathogens and other foreign objects, and recognize certain molecules in pathogens and neutralize them directly.
On this basis, plasma from the blood of a group of patients who recovered from COVID-19 was extracted and 10 patients were injected seriously ill.
Its symptoms improved within 24 hours, accompanied by a reduction in inflammation and viral loads and better oxygen saturation in blood.
However, it is necessary to verify and clarify this in order to propose the method for its use on a large scale until specific therapies are developed.
In addition, given the therapeutic effects, some plasma-related disadvantages should be considered to be detained.
For example, antibodies can overstimulate immune response and cause cytokine release syndrome, which may lead to fatal toxicity.
Concentration of antibodies in the blood is usually low, and plasma demand is high to treat patients in critical condition.
It is difficult to develop and produce specific antibodies with sufficient speed to combat a global pandemic.
It is therefore more important and practical to isolate B cells from recovered patients and identify genetic codes that code effective antibodies or seek effective antibodies against the essential proteins of the virus.
In this way, we can easily increase the production of antibodies.
MCT has been used for thousands of years to treat a variety of diseases in China.
However, its effects depend largely on a combination of several components in a formula that would vary according to the diagnosis of a disease in accordance with the MCT theories.
Most effective components are still unknown or indispensable, since it is difficult to extract and verify such components or their best combinations.
Currently, due to lack of effective and specific treatment for COVID-19, MCT has become one of the main alternative treatments for patients with mild to moderate symptoms or for those who have recovered from serious stages.
For example, it was determined that Shu Feng Jie Du capsules and Lian Hua Qing Wen capsules are effective for the treatment of COVID-19.
The main recovery rates in the treatment of patients with COVID-19 were observed in several provinces of China who used MCT in 87% of their patients, including Gansu (63.7%), Ningxia (50%) and Hunan (50%), while the province of Hubei, which used MCT only about 30% of its patients with COVID-19, had the lowest recovery rate (13%).
However, this is a fairly close comparison, since many other impact factors, such as the number and severity of patients, should be included in the evaluation.
On 18 February 2020, Boli Zhang and his colleagues published a study comparing Western medicine treatment (MO) only with the combined treatment of MO and MCT.
They found that the times needed for the recovery of body temperature, the absence of symptoms and hospitalization were significantly lower in the MO+MCT group than in the MO group alone.
What is more surprising is that the rate of improvement of symptoms (from mild to severe) was significantly lower in the MO+MCT group than in the MO group only (7.4% to 46.2%) and mortality was lower in the MO+MCT group than in the MO group (8.8% to 39%).
However, the effectiveness and safety of the ICT continues to await more well-controlled trials at greater levels and at more centres.
It would also be interesting to characterise the mechanism of actions and determine the effective components of the treatment of MCT or its combinations if possible.
Patients with suspicion or confirmation of COVID-19 generally have a lot of fear of highly contagious and even fatal disease, and people in the past also experience frustration, loneliness and anger.
In addition, the symptoms of infection such as fever, hypoxia and you, as well as the adverse effects of treatments such as corticosteroids, may cause more anxiety and mental distress.
In the early phase of SARS fracture, a series of psychiatric morbidities were reported, including persistent depression, anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotive excitement, psychotic symptoms, delinquency and even suicidal tendencies.
The trace of contact and mandatory care, as part of public health responses to the COVID-19 outbreak, can make people feel more nervous and guilty about the effects of the infection, the quarantine and stigma in their families and friends.
Therefore, attention should be paid to mental health for patients with COVID-19, persons with suspicion and persons in contact with them, as well as to the general public who need it.
Psychological support should include training of multidisciplinary mental health teams, clear communications with regular and precise updates on SARS-CoV-2 and treatment plans and the use of electronic devices and professional applications to prevent close contact between people.
Effective vaccines are essential to break the transmission chain of animal and human reserves infected to potential guests and often supplement antiviral treatment in the control of outbreaks caused by emerging viruses.
Efforts have been made to develop protein S-based vaccines to generate strong and long-term neutralising antibodies that protect against SARS-CoV.
Vaccines with live viruses have been evaluated in animal models for SARS.
However, the in-living effectiveness of these potential vaccines in older persons and lethal stimulation models and their protection against zoonotic virus infection should still be determined before a clinical study is started.
This is probably due to the withdrawal of SARS 17 years ago and no new case has been recorded since then.
On the other hand, there are cases and conglomerates of MERS sporadically in the Middle East that spread to other regions due to the persistence of zoonotic sources in endemic areas.
Vaccination strategies have been developed for MERS using deactivated viruses, DNA plasmas, viral vectors, nanoparticles, particles similar to viruses and recombinant proteins subunits, and some have been evaluated in animal models.
The development of a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 for non-immune people is an urgent and decisive task to control the current pandemic.
However, it is difficult to overcome the difficulties due to the long period (18 months on average) needed for the development of a vaccine and the dynamic variations of coronavirus.
As a new disease, COVID-19 has recently begun to show its full clinical course in thousands of patients.
In most cases patients can be recovered gradually without centuries.
However, as with SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also associated with high morbidity and mortality in patients with severe cases.
Therefore, creating a disease forecast model is essential for health agencies to give priority to their services, especially in areas with limited resources.
Based on the clinical studies reported so far, the following factors may affect or be associated with the predictive of patients with COVID-19 (Table 33):
Age: age was the most important factor for the SARS forecast, which is also true for COVID-19.
The COVID-19 was most observed in persons aged 30 to 65 and 47.7% of these patients were over 50 years of age in a study of 8866 cases, as described earlier.
Patients who would require more intensive care were likely to have side effects and complications and were significantly higher than those who did not require them (with an average age of 66 to 51), suggesting that age was a predictive factor for the evolution of patients with COVID-19.
Sex: SARS-CoV-2 has infected more men than women (0.31/100 000 versus 0.27/100 000), as described earlier.
Concomitants and complications: patients with COVID-19 who require more intensive care are more likely to suffer from acute cardiac injury and arrhythmia.
Cardiac events were also the main cause of death in patients with SARS.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 may also be associated with positive ACE2 collabytes, which may cause hepatic dysfunction in patients with COVID-19.
It should be noted that age and underlying diseases are strongly correlated and can interfere with each other.
Results from abnormal laboratory: Reactive protein C (PCR) levels in the blood reflect the severity of inflammation or tissue injury and have been proposed as a possible predictive factor for disease, response to therapy and final recovery.
The correlation between the PCR level and the severity and predictive of COVID-19 has also been proposed.
In addition, a high level of dehydrogenised lactate (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and creatinine (CK) may also help predict the patient’s evolution.
These enzymes are extensively expressed in several organs, in particular the heart and liver, and are released when tissue is damaged.
They are, of course, traditional markers of cardiac or hepatic dysfunction.
Main clinical symptoms: torax radiography and temporary progression of clinical symptoms should be considered together with other symptoms for predicting COVID-19 clinical developments and complications.
Use of steroids: as previously described, steroids are immunosuppressants that are commonly used as an adjuvant therapy for infectious diseases in order to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
Since high doses of corticosteroids were extended in patients with severe SARS, many survivors developed osteoencrosis with permanent disability and poor quality of life.
Therefore, if necessary, steroids should be used at low doses and for a short period in patients with COVID-19.
Mental stress: as described earlier, during the COVID-19 outbreak, many patients suffered extraordinary stress, since they generally endured long periods of extreme uncertainty and uncertainty, and attended the death of close family members and other patients.
It is essential to provide psychotherapy and long-term support to these patients to help them recover from stress and return to normal life.
According to the demographic studies conducted so far, COVID-19 appears to have different epidemiological characteristics than those of SARS.
In addition to replication in lower respiratory pathways, SARS-CoV-2 can effectively replication in upper respiratory pathways and cause mild or non-symptomatic symptoms in the early phase of infection, such as with other coronavirus that causes common colds.
Therefore, patients infected at an early stage or during incubation period may produce a large number of viruses during their daily activities, making it extremely difficult to control the epidemic.
However, it was considered that the SARS-CoV transmission would occur when patients were seriously ill, while the transmission would most often not occur in the early phase.
However, the current COVID-19 patent is much more serious and difficult to control than the SARS patent.
Great efforts are being made at this time in China, which include the closure of Wuhan and surrounding cities and the Quartet of almost all the population with the hope of interrupting the SARS-CoV-2 transmission.
Although these measures are causing significant economic and other sectors of the country, the number of new patients is decreasing, which indicates the deceleration of the epidemic.
According to the most optimistic forecast, the bridge will have been completed by March and the landing phase will last for 3 or 4 months.
However, some other experts are not so optimistic.
Paul Hunter, et al., believed that COVID-19, which seems to be significantly more infectious than SARS, will not end in 2020.
Ira Longini, et al., created a model to predict the evolution of the epidemic and suggested that SARS-CoV-2 could infection two thirds of the world's population.
A group of Canadians reported that SARS-CoV-2 was detected in both nasal and faring exodus in patients who had recovered and left the hospital 2 weeks ago, indicating that the newly identified virus could become a cyclic episode similar to influenza.
However, promising signals have been seen in China given the decrease in the number of new cases, indicating that current strategies could be operating.
It was originally predicted that the Ebola would cause up to one million cases with half a million deaths.
However, through a quarter and strict isolation, the disease has been controlled.
Like SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 may weaken in terms of infection and eventually expand or become a less pathogenic virus associated with humans.
A comparison of the COVID-19 epidemic with SARS and MERS is provided below (fig. (fig. 55).
SARS-CoV-2 is highly transmissible through tones or noises, and possibly also through direct contact with contaminated materials with the virus.
The virus was also detected in the liver, which created a new possibility of fecal-oral transmission.
A recent 138 case study reported that 41% of cases may have been caused by non-communicable infections, including 17 patients with other previous diseases and 40 medical care providers.
Therefore, precautions should be taken to protect people, especially medical care providers, social workers, family members, colleagues and, in particular, patients or persons infected.
The first line of defense that could be used to reduce the risk of infection is the use of masks; the use of surgical masks and masks with N95 (series number 1860) helps control the spread of viruses.
The surgical masks prevent the fluids of a potentially infected person from being transmitted by air or attached to the surfaces from where they could be transmitted to other persons.
However, only N95 mascarillas (series number 1860) can protect against inhalation of viruses as small as 10 to 80 nm, and only 5 % of viruses can fully enter them; SARS-CoV-2 is similar to SARS-CoV in size and both are about 85 nm.
Since particles can penetrate up to five applied surgical masks, medical care providers in direct contact with patients should use N95 masks (series number 1860) and not surgical masks.
In addition to masks, medical care providers should use insulation bats in order to further reduce contact with viruses.
The viruses can also infect a person through the eyes.
On January 22, 2020, a doctor infected with SARS-CoV-2 despite using a N95 mask; the virus may have entered his body through his infected eyes.
Therefore, medical care providers should also use protective helmets or transparent gloves while working with patients.
For the public in general of affected or potentially affected areas, it is suggested that the population wash their hands with most commonly contaminated jabeons, try to stay at home in a voluntary quarter and limit contact with people who may be infected.
Three feet are considered to be an adequate distance for people to stay away from a patient.
These measures are effective methods of reducing the risk of infection and avoiding the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 appeared as a new virus for the human world, its high approval with SARS-CoV, as reported on 7 January 2020, should have caused great caution in China over its experience with the SARS outbreak in 2003.
However, it was only until 19 January 2020 that the Director of the Wuhan Disease Control Centre calmed the citizens by saying that the new virus had a low incidence and reduced reproductive capacity among humans, and that there would be no problems to prevent and contain disease.
This message markedly eased the public's alarm, especially at a time when the whole country was preparing for the Spring Festival, and the critical time was wasted to contain the disease to the minimum extent in Wuhan.
China's disease control agencies should learn from this difficult lesson and take decisive improvements in the future.
For example, these agencies should be (1) more cautious when making public announcements, since each word is important to citizens and can change their attitude or decisions; (2) more sensitive and responsive to unusual information from clinics instead of waiting for official or medical reports; (3) more restrictive to contain a possible epidemic in their early phase rather than attempting to calm the public; and (4) more regular in implementing appropriate and effective simulations to increase public awareness of epidemic diseases and to test and improve the social response system periodically.
The COVID-19 outbreak caused by the new SARS-CoV-2 virus began in late December 2019.
In less than two months, it has spread across China and about 50 countries around the world at the time of this analysis.
Since the virus is very similar to SARS-CoV and there are also many similarities between the symptoms of COVID-19 and SARS, the COVID-19 fracture has caused SARS re-appearance.
However, there are some notary differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are essential to contain the epidemic and treat patients.
COVID-19 affects more people than young people and more men than women, and pregnancy and mortality are also higher in adults than in young people.
SARS has a mortality greater than COVID-19 (10.91% versus 1.44%).
Patients with COVID-19 transmit the virus although they do not have symptoms, while patients with SARS usually do so when they are seriously ill, which leads to a much greater difficulty in containing COVID-19 propaganda compared to SARS.
This explains, in part, why SARS-COV-2 was promoted much faster and more generalised than SARS-COV.
The regular ARN test for SARS-CoV-2 may give negative effects in some patients with COVID-19.
On the other hand, treated patients can be positive in the virus again.
These results dramatically increase the risk of spreading the virus.
Given the rapid progress made in the COVID-19 investigation, several important issues remain to be resolved, such as:
Where did the SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although a 96% genetic homologies were found between SARS-CoV-2 and two coronaviruses similar to SARS, it is still not possible to conclude that SARS-CoV-2 is derived from the Murciaellas.
What was the kind of animal that transmitted the virus of the original host, say the killers, to humans?
Without knowing the answers to numbers 1 and 2, it is not possible to slow down the transmission effectively, and the bridge can rise at any time.
Although the molecular model and biochemical tests have shown that SARS-CoV-2 combines with ACE2, how exactly does the virus enter into the cells of the respiratory tract and causes subsequent pathological changes?
Is the virus also connected to the cells that express the ECE2 in other organs?
Without clear answers to these questions, it is not possible to achieve rapid and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will the epidemic last?
How does the virus evolve genetically while being transmitted between humans?
Will it become a global pandemic, be exaggerated as SARS or routinely resurfaced as flu?
Although it may take some time, it is essential to find answers to these questions and many others.
However, what it costs, we have no choice to stop the epidemic as soon as possible and return to our normal life.
Zoneotic sources of human coronavirus
Mutation and adaptation have moved the evolution of coronavirus and its guests, including human beings, for thousands of years.
By 2003, it was known that two human coronaviruses caused mild diseases, such as common cold.
Serious acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) have invested the currency in discovering how devastating and deadly human coronavirus infection can be.
The rise of SARS-CoV-2 in central China by the end of 2019 brought Coronavirus back to the centre of attention and surprised us with high transmissibility and reduced pathogenicity compared to its brother, SARS-CoV.
The infection by human coronavirus is a zoonoses and it would be useful for us to know the zoonotic origins of human coronavirus.
The majority of human coronaviruses have their origin in the musculoskeletal glands, in which they are not pathogens.
The average booking guests are also known as some human coronavirus.
Identifying animal guests has direct implications for the prevention of human diseases.
Investigation of interactions between coronavirus and animal hosts could also raise important information on the pathogenicity of coronavirus in humans.
In this analysis, we present a general description of the existing knowledge of the seven human coronaviruses, with emphasis on the history of their discovery, as well as their zoonotic origins and the transmission of species.
Notably, we compare and contrast the different human coronavirus from the perspective of the evolution of the virus and the recombination of the gene.
The current disease epidemic by coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) is analysed in this context.
In addition, the requirements for successful host changes and the implications of the virus's evolution in the severity of the disease are also highlighted.
Coronavirus belongs to the Coronaviridae family, which includes a group of positive monocatenary ARN virus.
These viruses, which host the largest gene, from 26 to 32 kilobs, among ARN viruses, were called "coronavirus" due to their morphology, in the form of a crown that they have under an electronic microscope.
As regards its structure, coronaviruses have unseparated genes that share a similar organization.
About two thirds of the gene contains two large open reading frames (ORF1a and ORF1b), which are translated into replication polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab.
Polyproteins are further processed to generate 16 proteins in structures called nsp1~16.
The rest of the genome contains ORF for structural proteins, including splice (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleoprotein (N).
A series of specific accessory proteins of each line are also encoded by different coronavirus lines.
Based on the difference in protein sequences, coronavirus is classified in four genders (alfacoronavirus, betacoronavirus, gammacoronavirus and deltacoronvirus), among which the betacoronvirus gene contains most human coronavirus and is divided into four lines (A, B, C and D).
The phylogenetic evidence has shown that mammals and rodents are the source of genes of most alfacoronavirus and betacoronvirus, while birds are the main reserve of gammacoronavirus and deltacoronvirus.
For thousands of years, coronavirus has constantly crossed the barrier of species and some have emerged as important human pathogens.
To date, seven human coronaviruses are known.
Among them HCOV-229E and HCOV-NL63 are alphacoronvirus.
The other five betacoronviruses are HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2.
HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 usually cause mild symptoms such as common or diarrhoea.
On the other hand, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and the recently identified SARS-CoV-2 are highly pathogenic and cause serious respiratory infections below a relatively higher number of patients, with a higher probability of developing acute respiratory difficulty syndrome (SDRA) and extrapulmonary manifestations.
The first strain of HCoV-229E, B814, was isolated from the nasal secretion of patients with common cold in the mid- 1960s.
Since then, more knowledge has been gained through exhaustive studies on HCOV-229E and HCV-OC43, which cause auto-limited symptoms.
In fact, until the SARS outbreak, it was a widely accepted concept that human coronavirus infection is generally harmless.
The SARS outbreak that took place in 2003 was one of the most devastating of current history and infected more than 8,000 people, with a severe lethargy of about 10%.
Ten years later, the outbreak of respiratory syndrome in the Middle East (MERS) led to a persistent epidemic in the Arab peninsula with sporadic propaganda to the rest of the world.
The new human coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV), later known as SARS-CoV-2, is the cause agent of the disease epidemic during the 2019 Coronavirus (COVID-19), which has taken over 3120 lives and infected more than 91,000 people on 3 March 2020.
The alarm has been sounded and the world should be prepared for the nearby SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
The seven human coronaviruses have a zoonotic origin in mammals, rats or domestic animals.
Several lines of evidence support the evolutionary origin of all human coronaviruses in the mucous membranes, in which viruses are well adapted and are not pathogens, but present great genetic diversity.
The COVID-19 epidemic has raised huge medical, scientific, social and moral challenges in China and the rest of the world.
Tracking the zoonotic origins of human coronavirus provides a framework to understand natural history, the force force and the factors of the inter-kindal jump restriction.
This could also guide or facilitate the search for the reservation and the intermediate and amplifying animal guests of SARS-CoV-2, which would have important implications for preventing future propaganda.
In this analysis, we present a general description of the zoonotic origins, the transmission between species and the pathogenicity of human coronavirus.
In particular, we highlight and analyze the common theme that human coronavirus parental viruses are normally not pathogens in their natural reserve guests, but that pathogens become pathogens after transmission to a new host.
We have also examined the trend of human coronavirus evolution, in which increased transmissibility often leads to the decline in pathogenicity.
The evolution of the current SARS-CoV-2 bridge is also analysed in this context.
Coronavirus has been known since the late 1930s.
Prior to first insulation of HCov-229E strain B814 from the nasal secretion of patients who had contracted a common cold, different coronaviruss had been isolated in different infected animals such as the pope, the rat, the cow, the cerdo, the cat and the dog.
In the last decade, seven human coronavirus have been identified.
A brief summary of the history of human coronavirus discoveries in chronological order (Table 1) would be informative and informative.
The first strain of HCov-229E was isolated from the respiratory pathways of patients with upper respiratory tract infection in 1966 and subsequently adapted to increase in cell lines WI-38 of the lung.
Patients infected with HCov-229E had common cold symptoms such as headache, dizziness, general malformation and chest pain, with fever and cough in 10~20% of cases.
Later, in 1967, HCOV-OC43 was isolated from organ culture and later passed into lactating rats' brains.
The clinical characteristics of HCoV-OC43 infection appear to be similar to those caused by HCoV-229E, whose symptoms are identical to those of other respiratory pathogens such as influenza A and renovirus viruses.
Both HCOV-229E and HCV-OC43 are distributed worldwide and tend to transmit mainly during the winter season in climates.
In general, the time of incubation of these two viruses is less than one week followed by a period of approximately 2 weeks of disease.
According to a study with human volunteers, healthy people infected with HCoV-229E developed a mild common cold.
Only a few immunocompromised patients had a serious infection of the lower respiratory tract.
SARS, also known as "atypical neumonya", was the first pandemic caused by a well documented human coronavirus in the history of mankind, and the etiological agent is SARS-CoV, the third human coronavirus that was discovered.
The first case of SARS was remedied by the end of 2002 in GuangDong Province, China.
The SARS epidemic resulted in 8096 cases reported with 774 deaths and was proposed by many countries and continents.
In addition to overproducers, it was calculated that each case could occur about two secondary cases, with an incubation period of 4-7 days and the maximum viral load on the tenth day of the disease.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV initially experience mialgia, headache, fever, general malaise and escalophrenia, followed by dysnea, cough and respiratory difficulty as late symptoms.
Lyphopenia, altered hepatic function and elevated creatinine levels are common abnormal results in SARS laboratory trials.
Absorption, spread of epithelial cells and an increase in macrophages are also observed in patients with SARS.
About 20-30% of patients subsequently require intensive care and mechanical respiratory care.
In addition to the lower respiratory pathways, several organs, including gastrointestinal tube, liver and kidney, may also be infected in these serious cases, usually accompanied by a cytokine storm, which could be fatal, particularly in immunodepressed patients.
The virus was first isolated from lung biopsy in heaven by a family member of the initial patient who traveled to Hong Kong from Guangzhou.
Since then, enormous efforts have been made to investigate human coronavirus.
HCOV-NL63 was a child of 7 months of age in the Netherlands by the end of 2004.
Initially, it was determined that it was prevalent in small children, older adults and immunocompromised patients with respiratory diseases.
The presentation of heart, conjunctivitis, fever and bronquiolitis is common in the disease caused by HCoV-NL63.
Another independent study described the isolation of the same virus of a nasal sample taken by a 8-month-old child suffering from pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although it has been identified in the Netherlands, it is actually distributed by the world.
It has been estimated that HCOV-NL63 causes approximately 4.7 per cent of common respiratory diseases, and its maximum incidence occurs early in the summer, spring and winter.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with obstructive laryngitis, also known as a crop.
In the same year, HCOV-HKU1 was isolated from a 71-year-old man who had been hospitalized with pneumonia and bronquioliths in Hong Kong.
In addition to pneumonia and bronquiolitis acquired in the community, HCOV-HKU1 was reported to have been associated with acute asthma exacerbations.
Like HCOV-NL63, HCOV-229E and HCOV-OC43, HCV-HKU1 was found worldwide and caused mild respiratory diseases.
These four human coronaviruses acquired in the community have been well adapted to humans and are generally less likely to change to cause highly pathogenic diseases, although accidents have occurred because of unknown causes, such as in the rare case of a more viral subtype of HCoV-NL63, which has recently been reported to have caused serious infection of the lower respiratory pathways in China.
In general, when these human coronaviruses acquire the ability to transmit effectively and maintain themselves in humans, they also become less virulent or pathogens.
The MERS-CoV was first isolated in 2012 from the lung of a 60-year-old patient who had developed acute pneumonia and renal failure in Saudi Arabia.
Although most of the cases confirmed in the laboratory are originating in the Middle East, cases imported with occasional infection have been recorded to close contacts in several European and Tunisian countries.
Another secondary outbreak occurred in South Korea in 2015 with 186 confirmed cases.
The clinical manifestations of MERS are similar to those of SARS, characterized by progressive acute neuronosis.
Unlike SARS, many patients with MERS also developed acute renal failure, which is currently only associated with MERS among the diseases caused by human coronavirus.
More than 30% of patients have gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhoea and vomiting.
On 14 February 2020, more than 2500 confirmed cases were recorded in the laboratory, with a high literacy of 34.4 %, which makes MERS-CoV one of the most devastating viruses for humans of all known knowledge.
Between mid-December 2019 and late December 2019, conglomerate patients were detected in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, who were retrospectively associated with SARS-CoV-2.
The World Health Organization declared the outbreak of lower respiratory tract infections caused by SARS-CoV-2 a public health emergency of international importance and also called COVID-19 disease.
On 3 March 2020, 90,053 cases have been confirmed around the world, with a gross fatality of 3,4 %.
Notably, literacy in Hubei, China is 4.2%, while outside it is 1.2%.
SARS-CoV-2 causes serious respiratory infection, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which is presented as fever, cough and dysnea.
Diarrhoea has also been observed in some patients.
Neumonia is one of the most serious symptoms and can rapidly evolve into acute respiratory difficulty syndrome.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are very similar because of a high-nucleotide sequence of 82%, they are categorized in different branches of the phylogenetic tree.
The SARS-CoV-2 appears to be less pathogenic, but more transmissible than the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Cases of asymptomatic people infected with SARS-CoV-2 have been reported, which could contribute to their rapid spread worldwide.
By comparing and contrasting SARS-CoV-2 with the other six human coronaviruses, similarities and differences of interest are identified.
First of all, the period of incubation and the duration of the course of the disease by human coronavirus are very similar.
In this respect, SARS-CoV-2 follows the general trend of the other six human coronaviruses.
Second, the severity of COVID-19 symptoms is between SARS-COV and the four human coronaviruses acquired in the community (i.e. HCOV-229E, HCOV-OC43, HCOV-HKU1 and HCOV-NL63).
On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 infection presents characteristics that are more frequently observed in human coronavirus infections acquired in the community, including non-specific or mild symptoms or, even, the absence of symptoms.
On the other hand, a small subgroup of serious cases of COVID-19 is also observed as resulting from the infection by SARS-CoV, although the relationship is slightly smaller.
Thirdly, the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 also shows interesting characteristics of both human coronaviruses acquired in the community and SARS-CoV.
On the one hand, the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 is at least as high as that of human coronavirus acquired in the community.
On the other hand, it remains to check whether the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 decreases after human transitions, as happens with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Finally, like other human coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in effective samples.
If SARS-CoV-2's fecal-oral transmission plays an important role, as in the case of SARS-CoV, at least in some circumstances, it must still be disclosed in future studies.
It is also of particular interest to find out whether SARS-CoV-2 could show steadyness, as is the case with human coronaviruses acquired in the community.
However, the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, including its transmissibility, pathogenicity and sustainable spread after human transitions, will have an impact on the final release of COVID-19.
The four human coronaviruses acquired in the community that cause mild symptoms have been well adapted to humans.
From another perspective, it could also be true that humans have adapted well to these four human coronaviruses.
In other words, both could be survivors of old human coronavirus pandemics.
Coronaviruses have been eliminated from humans causing serious human diseases and humans who have developed serious human coronavirus diseases.
For this to happen, human coronaviruses should be replicated in humans in a sufficient way to allow for the accumulation of adaptive mutations that conflict with host restriction factors.
In this sense, as long as the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak continues, and more people are infected, it will be more likely that it will be fully adapted to humans.
If appropriate, its human transmission would be difficult to stop by means of quarantine or other infection control measures.
For many years, the four coronaviruses acquired in the community have been circulating in human populations and have caused common colds in people with immunocompetence.
These viruses don't need an animal reserve.
In contrast, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV highly pathogens have not adapted well to humans and their transmission between humans is unsustainable.
They need to keep and spread in their zone reserves and seek opportunities to promote possible human objectives, possibly through one or more intermediate and amplifier guests.
SARS-CoV-2 has similar characteristics both to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and to the four human coronaviruses acquired in the community.
It is highly transmissible as human coronaviruses acquired in the community, at least for the moment.
However, it is more pathogenic than human coronavirus acquired in the community and less pathogenic than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
It remains to see whether it will be fully adapted to humans and will circulate between humans without a reservation animal or intermediate host.
Before analysing the animal origins of human coronavirus, it will be useful to consider the definitions and characteristics of the evolutionary, natural, reserve, intermediate and amplifiers of human coronavirus.
An animal acts as an evolutionary host of a human coronavirus if it hosts a closely related antagonist who shares a high level of nucleic acid sequence.
The antistral virus is usually well adapted and is not pathogenous in this host.
In a similar way, a reservation guest is staying at a human corona virus continuously and for a long time.
In both cases, the guests are naturally infected and are the natural guests of human coronavirus or their parental virus.
On the other hand, if human coronavirus is introduced into the middle host immediately before or almost at the same time as its introduction into humans, it is not well adapted to the new host and is often pathogenous.
The average host can act as the zoological source of the infection in humans and perform the amplifying function of the host by allowing the virus to be replayed transiently and then transmitted to humans to increase the scale of infection in humans.
A human coronary virus may cause an infection in the terminal host if it cannot sustain its transmission to the middle host.
On the contrary, human coronaviruses can also adapt to the average host and even generate long-term anaemia.
In this case, the average guest becomes a nature reserve guest.
Epidemiological data revealed retrospectively that the original case of SARS had been contacted by hunting animals.
Further studies on seroprevalence indicated that animal traders had a higher prevalence of IgG anti-SARS-CoV compared to the general population.
Civets of masked palm trees (Larvata Padua) and a dog map in live animal markets were the first identified carriers of viruses similar to SARS-CoV that are almost identical to SARS-CoV.
This was indirectly supported by the fact that no further cases of SARS were recorded after all of the market residents were killed.
However, it was reported that wild or grass-roots farms were largely negative in SARS-CoV, suggesting that mixed palm trees only acted as an amplifier medium host, but not as a natural reserve of SARS-CoV.
Notably, since 80 % of Guangzhou's different animals have anti-SARS-CoV antibodies, the possibility of several small mammals also act as amplifying intermediate guests of SARS-CoV cannot be eliminated.
They all seem to be terminal guests of SARS-CoV.
Follow-up searches of SARS-CoV's natural animal host revealed a closely related caronavirus called CV HKU3 Rhinolophus-related carcinoma CoV (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3), which exists in Chinese hierarchical fungi.
These murders are positive in anti-SARS-CoV antibodies and the SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3 gene sequence.
This and other carcinoma coronavirus shares a sequence of nucleic acids of 88-92 % with SARS-CoV.
These studies have laid the basis for the new concept of the hosting of emerging pathogens in humans.
Several coronaviruses similar to SARS (SL-CoV) have also been identified in mucous membranes, but no one, except one called WIV1, can be isolated as live virus.
Human angiotensin 2 converting enzyme (ACE2) is known to be the SARS-CoV receptor.
It was demonstrated that the WIV1 obtained from a fecal sample of shellfish used the ACE2 as a receptor for entering cells.
Surprisingly, patients with convulsive SARS were able to neutralize HIV1.
To date, WIV1 is the most closely related strain of SARS-CoV in mucous membranes, which shares a 95 per cent nucleotide sequence approved.
Despite the high level of approval between these two viruses, it is generally believed that the WIV1 is not the immediate parental virus of SARS-CoV and that the killers are not the immediate reserve host of SARS-CoV.
According to phylogenetic analysis, the MERS-CoV is classified in the same group as the CV-HKU4 murciélago and the CV-HKU5 murciélago.
CoV-HKU4 and MERS-CoV use the same host recipient, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) for the virus entry.
Arn polymerase-dependent Arn-MERS-CoV sequences are phylogeneticly closer to their beta-coronavirus antibodies identified in Europe and Africa.
To date, you can't find a live MERS-CoV in wild shells.
The MERS-CoV and its closest relatives, the CoV-HKU25 of the mucusélage, share a single nucleotide sequence of 87 %.
However, the murciélago could not be the immediate booking guest of the MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East have shown that the drummers are seropositive in early neutralising bodies of MERS-CoV specifically, just like the original Middle East camels in several African countries.
An MERS-CoV live-like virus found in humans was isolated from the dynasty nasal of drummers, which is even more supportive of the camels acting as well as well as well-believing MERS-CoV reserve guests.
It should also be noted that mild symptoms have generally been observed, but a massive spread of the virus in infected camels for research with MERS-CoV.
Notably, infected camels spread the viruses not only by respiratory route but also by facal-oral route, which is also the main route of spreading viruses of the mucous membranes.
However, there are still questions, since many confirmed cases of MERS do not have prior contact with camels prior to the occurrence of symptoms, which is reasonably attributed to transmission between humans or unknown transmission routes involving unknown animals that host MERS-CoV.
The SARS-CoV-2 shares a 96.2% nucleotide homology with a cornovirus of fungi, RatG13, isolated with aphine Rhinolophus.
As in the case of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the difference between SARS-CoV-2 and RTG13 is too large to assign a parental relationship.
In other words, Murciaellages may not be immediately reserved guests of SARS-CoV-2 unless they are present in the future coronavirus of practically identical Murciellas.
The average animal guests of SARS-CoV-2 should be among the wild species sold and killed on the main market in Huanan, with many of the initial cases of COVID-19, indicating a likely event of animal transmission to human beings.
Several recent studies based on the metagenomic sequencing have suggested that a group of risk-related small mammals, known as pancreas (Javanica Manis), could also be hosted by anti-SARS-CoV-2.
The genes of this new coronavirus of panolins share a nucleic acid sequence of 85-92 % with SARS-CoV-2.
However, they are equal to closely related to RTG13, with an identity of about 90 % at the level of the nucleotide sequence.
They are grouped into two sub-lined viruses similar to SARS-CoV-2 in the phylogenetic tree, one of which shares a more union domain to the receptor (RBD) similar to SARS-CoV-2, with a sequence of amino acids of 97.4 %.
In contrast, SARS-CoV-2 RBD and RTG13 are more divergent, despite a higher degree of sequence approval throughout the genome.
A previous study in sick panulins also reported the detection of viral contaminants in lung samples, which also resulted in associated with SARS-CoV-2.
This study adopted different methods of collection and manual treatment to generate a partial gene sequence comprising around 86.3% of the complete viral genome.
We cannot eliminate the possibility that the panpolin is one of the average animal guests of SARS-CoV-2.
However, there is currently no evidence to support a direct origin in the SARS-CoV-2 panolin due to the sequential divergence between SARS-CoV-2 and beta-coronavirus of panolins related to SARS-CoV-2.
In addition, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RTG13 is even smaller than that between SARS-CoV-2 and beta-coronavirs of panolines related to SARS-CoV-2.
The evolutional path of SARS-CoV-2 in mulciélages, panalines and other mammals must still be established.
Although the highest sequence approval was found in the RBDs between SARS-CoV-2 and panpolin, the betacoronvirus associated with SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-2 and RTG13 share the highest total gender sequence.
It is highly speculative that the high level of similarity between the RBDs of the betacoronavirus of panolins related to SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 is due to the convergence evolution mediated by selectivity.
A counter-proposal advocates a combination of beta-coronavirus panolines related to SARS-CoV-2 and RTG13 in the third wild animal species.
As an incentive force in evolution, the recombination is extended between betacoronvirus.
A conclusion has not yet been reached on the immediate zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2.
In addition to highly pathogenic human coronaviruses, the zoonotic origin of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 were also studied.
The phylogenetic evidence indicated that both HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E could have originated from ceronavirus, while the parent viruses of HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 were found in rats.
A Coronavirus called ARCoV.2 (Coronavirus of the Apalache Mountains) detected in a three-color rubella in North America was reported to have a close relationship with HCoV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCOV-229E was genetically related to another corneal virus called Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, which was detected in Ghana, although it has also been suspected of being intermediate guests.
For more clarity, the knowledge gained up to the time of the animal origins of known human coronavirus is summarized in figure 1 and Table 2.
The phylogenetic analysis has provided evidence of human coronavirus transmission events among species in history.
When HCOV-OC43 crossed between species until humans were infected from game animals in 1890, a pandemic of respiratory infection was registered.
Previous transmissions between HCoV-229E species are not known with such accuracy.
Alfacoronavirus has been found closely related to HCoV-229E.
Among them is a alphacoronvirus of alpacas.
Several lines of evidence support the transmission of the virus of malaria directly to humans.
First of all, unlike alpine trees, humans could contact the mucous membranes in a shared ecological nest.
Instead, humans have close contact with the alpines.
Secondly, alphacoronovirus is a variety of non-patogens associated with HCoV-229E muciellas, while alphacoronovirus alpacas has caused a outbreak of respiratory disease in infected animals.
Finally, alfacoronavirus has not been found in wild animals.
Therefore, the possibility that alpacas acquire alphacoronvirus related to HCOV-229E in humans cannot be ruled out.
In fact, Munciélagos are the direct source of pathogenous viruses in humans, such as the virus of anger, Ebola virus, Nipah virus and Hendra virus.
Of course, it would not be too surprising that the killers transmit HCoV-229E directly to humans.
Alternatively, while alfacoronaviruses act as HCoV-229E genetic aberration, alpacas and droidians could act as intermediate hosts that transmit viruses to humans, in particular in the case of MERS-CoV.
The MERS-CoV serves as an excellent example of transmission between species, from ruminants to drummers, and from drummers to humans.
The evolutional origin of MERS-CoV in the shells is discovered with its initial identification, and has also been supported by subsequent findings.
It is obvious that mucous membranes contribute, with a profuse aerobic strain of viruses, to the exchange of genetic fragments between species and the transmission of species between species.
Longevity, densely populated colonies, close social interaction and high flight capacity are all favourable conditions that make the killers in the ideal "virus promoter".
On the other hand, the MERS-CoV has been introduced into the drummers for decades.
It is well adapted to these camels, which have become an intermediate guest, to be a stable and natural reservation host.
MERS-CoV causes very mild disease and maintains a relatively low rate of mutation in these animals.
Its sporadic transmission to humans is an accident and humans continue to be a terminal guest of the MERS-CoV, as the transmission is unsustainable.
Compared to the role of the camels in the transmission of the MERS-CoV, the role of the panolines, if any, in the transmission of the SARS-CoV-2, is different.
In particular, panolin betacoronavirus is highly pathogenous in panolins.
It is possible to be a terminal host of betacoronavirus related to SARS-CoV-2, such as cevets in the case of SARS-CoV.
Several possibilities for transmission between SARS-CoV-2 species of animals to humans should be confirmed or discarded in future studies.
First of all, the musculoskeletal glands could be the replacement host of a virus related to SARS-CoV-2, almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.
Humans could share the ecological snow with the mulciels, through the killing or carbon mining.
Secondly, panapolines could be one of the average amplifier guests where a virus related to SARS-CoV-2 had recently been introduced.
Humans contract the virus through slaughter and consumption of dog meat.
Many mammals, including domestic animals, may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.
An antibody study is needed in domestic and wild animals.
Thirdly, as mentioned above, the combination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 could have occurred in a third species that has been in contact with both the musculoskeletal and panaulins.
The search for SARS-CoV-2 animal origins continues.
Apart from the different types of animal guests, three main factors in viral terms also play an important role in facilitating the crossings of species by coronaviruses.
Firstly, their exchange rates are relatively high in the replication of the NRA.
Compared to other monocatenary ARN viruses, estimated coronavirus exchange rates could be considered "moderate" to "high", with an average replacement rate of ~10-4 substitutions per year, per site 2, according to the adaptation phase of coronavirus to new guests.
Coronavirus has a read-test exorbitant exorcise whose elimination results in extremely high mutatis mutatis mutandis and attenuation or even inviability.
Curiously, it is known that the nucleotide analogue emdesivir eliminates the replication of coronavirus by inhibiting this exoribonuc acid and ARN-dependent polymerase.
Remdesivir is one of the most promising anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents that have been tested in clinical trials.
However, coronavirus exchange rates are about a million times higher than those of their guests.
In addition, the rate of mutation is often high when coronaviruses are not well adapted to the host.
Compared to SARS-CoV, which has a high rate of mutation, the SARS-CoV-2 mutation rate appears to be lower, suggesting a higher level of human adaptation.
It is to be hoped that he has already adapted to another host near mankind.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, this also applies to MERS-CoV, which is well adapted to drummers.
In theory, genetic derivatives are unlikely to make vaccines and antivirals against SARS-CoV-2 disappear quickly.
Second, the long-term RNA gene of coronaviruses performs additional plasticity in the modification of the gene for mutations and recombination and thus increases the likelihood of evolution among species, which promotes the presence of new coronavirus when appropriate conditions are given.
This is supported by the single open reading frames and the functions of the proteins encoded towards the direction 3' of the gene.
Thirdly, coronaviruses alternate randomly and frequently during the replication of the ARN through a single "copy-choice" mechanism.
In a guest acting as a mixing vehicle, the chain change occurs frequently during the transcription of CRN.
Full-length and subgenome ARN highly homologous could be combined to generate new coronaviruses.
A phylogenetic evidence of natural recombination has been found in HCOV-HKU1 and HCOV-OC43, as well as in animal coronavirus, such as SL-CoV morciélago and CoV-HKU9 morciélago.
HIV-Husped interaction with transmission
In addition to the three viral factors mentioned above, the viral interaction with the host recipient is another key factor that affects the transmission of species.
At present, the combination of SARS-CoV is taken as a typical example, which has also shown positive selection evidence in inter-species transmission events.
Based on the comparative analysis between isolated strains of SARS-CoV from humans and animals, it is believed that SARS-CoV is experiencing rapid adaptation to different guests, particularly with mutations in the S protein RBD.
In general, the S-protein RBD of a coronavirus interacts with the cell receptor and is carefully selected by the host's antibody response.
In SARS-CoV, RBD is found in amino acids 318 to 510 in S1 fragment, which binds to human ACE2 and its viral input adapters.
The SARS-CoV RBD is able to recognize the ACE2 receptors of several animals, including mucous membranes, citadel, rat and carrot, which allows transmission between virus species.
In fact, it was observed that only 6 amino acid residues were different from the isolated strains of human viruses and civetes in the RBD and 4 of them were found on the basis of union to the receptor for interaction with the ACE2 receptor.
SARS-CoV of lead has K479N and S487T mutations in its RBD, which could increase the effectiveness of the interaction of spige protein with the ACE2 receptor.
In other words, these two amino acid substitutions could be essential for the adaptation of the virus to humans.
It should be noted that SARS-CoV-2 shares the same cell receptor with SARS-CoV.
A 30 % difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in S1 protein S unit implies that the affinity of S protein with human ACE2 may have changed.
In fact, an electronic chromoscopy study indicates the affinity 10 to 20 times greater than that of the human ECE2 and SARS-CoV protein S.
It will also be of interest to determine whether any other receiver could be necessary for the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Surprisingly, HCOV-NL63 also joins the ECE2, but with a different part of the S.
There are many other human coronavirus receptors, such as aminoeptidase N in HCoV-229E and sialic acid 9-O-acetylated in HCoV-OC43.
They may also be responsible for the successful adaptation of these coronaviruses in humans after the transmission of species from their animal hosts.
In addition to cell recipients, the result of transmission between species of human coronavirus is also determined by other factors of host dependence and restriction.
The differentiation of these host proteins between humans and natural reserve hosts of human coronavirus, such as fungi, drummers and rodents, could constitute an obstacle to the transmission of species.
Human coronaviruses should use the host dependency factors and subsidize the host restriction factors in order to ensure that transmission between species is successful.
In this respect, the molecular determinants in this important area of virus-hushed interaction must still be identified and identified.
A full range of dependency and host restriction factors for SARS-CoV-2 could result in an objective research using advanced CRISPR technology.
The appearance of new human coronavirus: we're from zero
The diversity of rubella coronavirus provides numerous opportunities for the emergence of new human coronavirus.
In this sense, ceronaviruses of muciélagos act as the genetic aerobic of human coronaviruses.
In addition, rapid mutations and genetic recombination also contribute to the evolution of human coronaviruses and constitute two important steps in this process.
For example, the acquisition or loss of new protein coders has the potential to radically modify viral phenotypes.
Among SARS-CoV's accessory proteins, ORF8 has been considered important in human adaptation, since there have been isolated viruses of malaria related to SARS-CoV, but it has been determined that different ORF8 proteins are coded.
There was a elimination of 29 characteristic nucleotides of SARS-CoV in isolated strains at the beginning of the epidemic in humans.
This elimination divides the ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b, and is believed to be an adaptive mutation that promotes the change of guests.
In addition, SARS-CoV has possible predecessors of combination with alpha and gammacoronavirus lines, in which a large number of smaller recombinant regions have been identified in the ARN-dependent polymerase ARN.
Recombinations were also identified in nsp9, most of nsp10 and parts of nsp14.
Similarly, it has been demonstrated that the epidemic MERS-CoV suffered combination events between different lines, which occurred in tragedies in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, recombination events have also been observed in other human coronaviruses, in which human coronaviruses are coronaviruses with other animal coronaviruses in their non-structural genes.
It should also be warned that artificial selection can contribute to unwanted changes in viral genes, which most likely results in the release of the virus from the selection pressures carried out by, for example, the host immune system.
One example of these effects is the loss of a full length ORF4 in the HCov-229E prototype strain, due to a elimination of two nucleotides.
Although an intact ORF4 virus infection in mucous membranes and cams related to HCoV-229E could be observed, alphacoronovirus of alpacas has a single nucleotide insert, which results in a frame change.
Finally, although not least important, the evolution of new human coronaviruses is also driven by the pressure of selection in their reservation guests.
No symptoms were detected or mild symptoms were detected when cornavirus mucilages were infected, indicating the mutual adaptation between coronavirus and mucous membranes.
The mucous membranes seem to be well adapted to anatomical and physiological coronavirus.
For example, defects in the activation of the proinflammatory response in the mucous membranes effectively reduce the pathology caused by coronavirus.
In addition, the activity of natural killer cells in rubellas is deleted due to the positive regulation of the inhibitory receptor of natural killer cells NKG2/CD94 and the low level of expression of Class I molecules of the higher histocompatibility complex.
Furthermore, the high level of oxygen reactive species (ROS) generated from high metabolic activity of mucous membranes could eliminate the replication of coronavirus and affect the reading test of exorribonucleic acid, resulting in the selection pressure for the generation of highly pathogenic strains when introduced into a new host.
More pathogenic coronavirus strains could also evolve by combination, leading to the acquisition of new proteins or protein characteristics for host adaptation.
Consequently, it is not a case that three new human coronaviruses have appeared in the last two decades.
Coronaviruses are not pathogens or cause mild symptoms in their reservation guests, such as marciellas and camels.
They are energetically recuperated without causing a strong immune response from the guest.
In this context, the secrets are why there are asymmetrical carriers and what causes serious cases of infection in humans.
Serious symptoms are mainly due to hyperactivation of immune response and cytokines, while stronger is immune response, more severe is pulmonary damage.
On the other hand, in asymptomatic carriers, the immune response has been separated from the replication of coronavirus.
The same immune response dispersion strategy could have beneficial effects on anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapy.
Interferon response is particularly strong in the mucous membranes.
Therefore, the administration of type I interferon at least in the early phase of infection by SARS-CoV-2 in humans should be beneficial.
In addition, the activation of NLRP3 inflammation in the mucous membranes is defective.
According to this reasoning, the inhibition of NLRP3 inflammase with MCC950 could be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
The appearance of SARS-CoV-2 follows the general line leading to the appearance of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Although there has been a beta-coronavirus of muciélagues that shares a 95 % nucleotide approval with SARS-CoV, there is also a corona virus of muciélagues that shares a 96 % nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV-2.
Although it has been established that the animals and other animals of the markets host identical viruses to SARS-CoV, immediate intermediate guests of SARS-CoV-2 have not been identified.
Betacoronavirus has been found to be highly homologous to SARS-CoV-2, which indicates that panaliens could act as one of the intermediate guests or that panaliline betacoronaviruses could bring gene fragments to the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
Although there are questions, there is no evidence that SARS-COV-2 is made by man, whether deliberately or by accident.
Coronavirus has recovered protagonism due to the recent outbreak of SARS-CoV-2.
The study of coronavirus in fungi and other animals has profoundly changed our perception of the importance of zoonotic origins and animal reserves of human coronavirus in human transmission.
There has been great evidence that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 originated in the massacres and transmitted to humans through intermediate guests.
Since SARS-CoV infection is caused by contact between humans and animals in the markets, closing the frozen markets and killing the civilians in them could have been effective to prevent the SARS epidemic.
Following this same reasoning, bananas should be removed from the frozen markets in order to prevent zoonotic transmission, taking into account the discovery of several betacoronavirus lines closely related to SARS-CoV-2.
However, if and how SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to humans through panaulins and other mammals, it is still due to dilucated in future research.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been in the drummers for a long time.
These camels are an important transport tool as well as a major source of meat, milk, leather and wool for the local population.
They are widely distributed by the Middle East and Africa.
It is therefore impossible to sacrifice all camels to control MERS, as was done in China with wild animal markets to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
In order to prevent frequent outbreaks of MERS, an integrated approach should be taken to develop effective vaccines against MERS-CoV for camels, in combination with other infection control measures.
Since we are not able to eliminate these viruses, new genotypes may appear that cause outbreaks.
A variety of zoonotic coronaviruses, they are circulating in wild state.
In particular, coronaviruses with zoonotic potential are very different.
There are great opportunities for these zoonoses to evolve and recognizable, which would lead to the emergence of new coronavirus that are more or more communicable in humans in the future.
The culture of wild animals in some parts of China should be abandoned to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
From the bad experiences with SARS, MERS and COVID-19, a better preparation and response plan should be adopted.
In fact, many viruses have existed on the planet for a very long time.
They remain in their own natural reserves until there is an opportunity to promote themselves.
Although the musculoskeletals have many characteristics that favour the spread of viruses, human contact with the musculoskeletal and other wild species can be minimised if the population is educated to get rid of them.
Continued monitoring of mammals is necessary to better understand the ecology of coronavirus and its natural guests, which will be useful in preventing the transmission of animals to humans and future outbreaks.
In conclusion, the most effective way to prevent viral zoonoses is to keep humans away from the ecological nests of the natural reserves of zoonotic viruses.
Several pieces are still missing in the zoological origin of SARS-CoV-2.
First of all, if the mucous membranes transmit an anti-SARS-CoV-2 virus to the lungs, it will be interesting to examine what circumstances the mucous membranes and panaliens could share the same ecological nest.
Secondly, if the pollutant plays a more direct role in human transmission, it must be determined how humans enter into contact with the pollutant.
Thirdly, if a third mammals act as the true host medium, it must be distinguished how it interacts with the different species, including humans, mammals and penguins.
Finally, since many mammals, including domestic animals, could be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, monitoring and experimental infection should be carried out.
It is expected that the SARS-CoV-2 or its parental viruses that are almost identical are identified in their natural guests in the future.
Continued research in this area will highlight the evolutional route of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, with important implications for the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
It is necessary to update the diagnosis criteria of the "susceptible houses" and "confirmed houses" of COVID-19
On 6 February 2020, our team published a quick guidance for diagnosis and treatment of infection by the new Coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV), which included our experience and is a good reference to combating this pandemic worldwide.
However, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge gradually increase on the basis of the results of ongoing research and experience in clinical practice; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also continuously updated.
In this letter, we responded to a comment on our directive and provided the most recent diagnosis criteria for "supposed case" and "confirmed case" according to the latest Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Treatment of COVID-19 (seventh edition) published by the National Health Committee of the People ' s Republic of China.
In December 2019, the new Coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV) caused a outbreak, which is now officially known as Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the virus was called Coronavirus 2 of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
On 11 March 2020, WHO qualified COVID-19 as a pandemic.
To combat the infection by SARS-CoV-2, our team developed a quick advice guide published online at Military Medical Research on 06 February 2020.
He's been getting a lot of attention since it was published.
However, it should be noted that COVID-19 is a new disease, our awareness and our knowledge gradually increase based on the results of ongoing research and experience in clinical practice; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also continuously updated.
For example, the Guidelines for the Diagnostic and Treatment of COVID-19 published by the National Health Committee of the People ' s Republic of China (http://www.hnc.gov.cn/), between 16 January 2020 and 3 March 2020, have published a total of seven editions and some contexts have changed considerably.
Now, our director received a comment from Zhou et al., they presented a simple classification proposal based on their clinical experience.
His work added new evidence for our guidance and also constituted a valuable reference to this pandemic around the world.
We support your important work and express our appreciation.
However, its work also needs to be updated according to the latest Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Treatment of COVID-19 (seventh version of the test) and recent studies.
According to the seventh edition (3 March 2020), in order to confirm a suspicious case, it is necessary to combine any point of the characteristics of epidemiological predecessors with two points of clinical manifestations for extensive analysis, or three points of clinical manifestations should be fulfilled if there are no clear epidemiological precedents:
Epidemiological background: (1) travel or residence in Wuhan city and rural areas, or other communities where cases of COVID-19 have been reported in the last 14 days prior to the occurrence of symptoms; (2) contact history with infectious cases of SARS-CoV-2 (with positive nuclear acid test); (3) contact history with patients with fever or respiratory symptoms in Wuhan city and aldage areas, or other communities where cases of COVID-19 have been reported in the last 14 days prior to the occurrence of symptoms; (4) contact history with confirmed cases groups (≥ 2 cases with fibrosis or symptoms of ostetric acids, ostetrics, ostetrics, ostetrics, osciary symptoms.
Clinical manifestations: (1) fever or respiratory symptoms; (2) characteristics in images of infection by COVID-19; (3) total white blood cells showing a content of normal, decreased or reduced lymphocytes at the early stage.
The diagnosis of a confirmed case should be based on a suspicious case with some feature of pathogenic or serologic evidence as follows: (1) test of reaction in real-time polymerase chain positive for SARS-CoV-2; (2) sequence of complete viral gene showing high homogeneity to new coronaviruses; (3) positive outcome for specific IgM antibodies and IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in a serum test; or change of specific IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 negative to positive, or increase in title ≥4 times more in the recovery phase than in the acute phase.
We can see that the real-time polymerase response test to detect nuclear acid in blood samples or respiratory tract samples was added to the second (18 January 2020) and third (22 January 2020) editions.
The detection of blood samples was added to the fourth (27 January 2020) and fifth (8 February 2020) editions; and then the serologic tests were added to the seventh edition.
{NS}
In addition, there is more and more evidence to remind us that we should be careful with atypical asymptomatic and symptomatic patients.
Therefore, Zhou et al. flow charts should be updated, since they classified the person without clinical symptoms as "low risk".
The score system should also be checked in other clinical studies and practices.
In conclusion, we hope that more direct evidence will arise and we ask the readers to send us their comments.

Bangladesh reports five new deaths due to COVID-19, the largest in one day
Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths yesterday because of COVID-19 in one day.
It's the greatest number of deaths in one day due to the virus.
To date, Bangladesh’s Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) reported that the number of cases of infection registered included 114 active cases and 33 recovered cases remaining in their homes.
A total of 17 dead have been registered.
At an online information session, the IEDCR director, Dr. Meerjady Sabrina Flora, said the victims were four men and a woman.
According to Dr. Meerjady, two cases were more than 60 years old, two between 51 and 60 years old and one between 41 and 50 years old.
He also said two of the victims were from Dhaka.
On 11 March, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared pandemic COVID-19.
A hospital officer told Anadolu Agency, a local news agency, that one of the missing was Jalal Saifur Rahman, director of the Bangladesh Anti-Corruption Commission, who was serving at the Kuwait Maitree Hospital.
On Saturday, in an online video announcement, the Minister for Transport by Street and Puentes de Bangladesh, Obaidul Quader, said that public transport would be suspended for more time than originally planned, until next Saturday.
This suspension of public transport had initially begun on 26 March and was expected to end on Saturday, 4 April.
The transport of essential products, such as medical supplies, fuel and food, was still permitted.
The first cases of COVID-19 infection in Bangladesh occurred on 8 March, were two men who returned from Italy as well as one woman.
By March 19, these three had already been recovered.
More than a million infections by SARS-CoV-2 worldwide
On Thursday, the total number of cases of coronary viral infections SARS-CoV-2 exceeded one million worldwide, according to data from the University of Johns Hopkins.
At least 52,000 deaths were related to COVID-19, the disease caused by coronavirus.
The tenth took place on the same day that Malawi confirmed its first infections by coronavirus and Zambia had its first death related to coronavirus.
North Korea said on Thursday that it was one of the few countries without coronary virus infection.
Yesterday, the World Health Organization reported 1,051,635 confirmed cases, including 79,332 cases in the twenty-fourth hours before 10:00 p.m., Central European Time (UTC-0800), on 4 April.
In the United States, more than 244,000 cases of coronavirus were recorded, linked to at least 5900 deaths.
CBS News reported, citing the data of the University of Johns Hopkins, that Wednesday there were more than 1,000 deaths in the United States due to coronary infections.
Worldwide, countries have announced more stringent measures to prevent the spread of disease.
The Thursday, Sergei Sobayinin, the mayor of Moscow, extended the city's closure until 1 May.
At the national level, President Vladimir Putin stated that the Russians would continue to earn their wages without going to work until 30 April.
The Portuguese Parliament voted to extend the state of national emergency for 15 days; the vote was adopted with 215 votes in favour, ten abstentions and one vote against.
Saudi Arabia extended the stay rates in the sacred cities of The Meca and Medina all day; previously, the stay rate was only between 3:00 p.m. and 6:00 p.m.
Thailand planned to implement a stay call between 10:00 p.m. and 4:00 p.m.
The governor of Ohio, Mike DeWine, announced that the state had extended its order to stay home until 1 May.
Supermarkets in Australia lower trade-by-trade hygienic paper limits
On Sunday and Saturday afternoon, Australian supermarket chains Woolworths and Coles reduced their purchase limits of hygienic paper to two and a transaction package in all the country's supermarkets, respectively.
Monday, ALDI also applied the limit of a package.
These restrictions were published as messages in the boxes and on the lines Facebook pages.
It was reported that consumers were being provided with COVID-19 because people had to be self-assessed.
Wednesday, Woolworths also limited the purchases of hygienic paper to deliver home to a package by request.
These changes were introduced after the previous restriction of four packages by transaction applied by Woolworths and Coles on 4 and 5 March, respectively.
Coles, in his press release of 8 March, reported that, with the application of the restriction of four packages, "many supermarkets even exhausted the product within an hour of delivery", and said that the request "did not have prior", while ALDI, in a Facebook publication on Tuesday, said it was "unexpected".
Sales went up with a "strong increase" last week, according to a voice of Woolworths.
Costco supermarket in Canberra also limited the amount to two packages last week.
To alleviate further the shortage, Coles requested larger packages to suppliers and increased delivery frequency, Woolworths ordered additional existences, while ALDI made available for a special offer of planned Wednesdays.
Russell Zimmerman, executive director of the Australian Retalilers Association, said that minorities are trying to increase their existence, but the restrictions on local assembly on truck delivery schedules make it difficult to do so.
An increase in production costs is envisaged, according to suppliers trying to meet demand, and less tenders.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that after the early release of stocks, some supermarkets could not make the special offer of Wednesdays.
In a report in News.com.au, Dr. Gary Mortimer, a retail sales expert at the University of Technology of Queensland, said that supermarkets provide all night long stocks.
He stressed that the hygienic role is a broad article, which creates a low number of existences in numbers, and, when it is exhausted, leaves a wide space empty in the stalls, which intensifyes the sense of lack.
Coles and Woolworths have the idea of [that] if there were a large amount of article in the stalls, if products such as hygienic and disinfectants could [compared] and have large amounts, probably minimizing the panic, Russell Zimmerman said by ABC News.
The recyclable hygienic paper manufacturer Who Gives to Crap said the past Wednesday that exhausted the existences.
Kimberly-Clark, who manufactures Kleenex's hygienic paper, and Solaris Paper, who manufactures Sorbent, noted that they were working 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, to keep supply, according to the report in News.com.au.
Domain.com, an real estate site, reported that some property sellers offered free hygiene role to the first tenderer in Melbourne, when they were less subsisted because the buyers had free time at the end of the long week of the Worker Day.
The edition of NT News's Thursdays, a journal printed in Darwin, included an eight-page card designed to cut and use as a hygienic paper.
Supermarkets initially reacted to restrictions, according to ABC Australia's report of 3 March, in which they said they did not have plans to impose restrictions on purchases.
Russell Zimmerman added that other products also have a lot of demand, including mascarillas, disinfectant, dry products, liquid japanese and Harina.
Similarly, outside Australia, on Sunday afternoon it was observed that the online British supermarket Ocado limited purchases of the Andres hygienic paper to two packs of 12 rolls.
The World Health Organization declares pandemic COVID-19
Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared pandemic the outbreak of COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.
Although the word "pandemia" refers only to the magnitude of the spread of a disease, not to how dangerous are specific cases, WHO stressed the need to motivate Governments to take action:
All countries can still change the course of this pandemic.
If countries detect, test, try, trace, identify and mobilize their inhabitants in response, said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director General of WHO.
We are very concerned, both at alarming levels of propaganda and severity, and at alarming levels of inaction.
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, director of the Centers for Control and Prevention of Diseases in the United States, the pandemic "has no precedent".
In statements published by CNN in February, "in addition to influence, no other respiratory virus has been traced from appearance to continued global propaganda".
Ghebreyesus expressed a similar opinion, and he said, "We have never seen a pandemic caused by a coronavirus before."
"And we've never seen a pandemic that can be controlled at the same time," he added.
The new pandemic situation arises after WHO's decision in January to declare the outbreak an emergency of public health of international importance.
The director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergias and Infectious Diseases, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said about the outbreak, "in conclusion, it will improve".
Until Thursday, Associated Press reported there were at least 126,000 cases of COVID-19 worldwide, and more than 4600 deaths.
Coronavirus pandemic 2019-20 is a disease pandemic in 2019 (COVID-19), caused by Coronavirus 2 of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
The outbreak was identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, and a public health emergency was declared of international importance on 30 January 2020 and was recognized as a pandemic on 11 March 2020.
On 10 April 2020, some 1.61 million cases of COVID-19 were reported in 210 countries and territories, and some 97,000 died as a result.
About 364,000 people recovered.
It was estimated that the fatality rate per case is 4% in China, while at global level it is between 13.04% in Algeria and 0.08% in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include fever, cough and lack of air.
The complications may include severe respiratory difficulty neuron and syndrome.
The time from exposure to the appearance of symptoms is usually about five days, but it can vary from two to fourteen days.
No specific antiviral vaccine or treatment exists.
The primary treatment is symptomatic therapy and support. The recommended preventive measures include washing your hands, covering your mouth with the tosser, keeping away from other people and controlling and self-associating people who are suspected of being infected.
The authorities around the world responded by implementing travel restrictions, forty-five, drop-offs, safety controls at work and closures of installations.
The pandemic has caused a serious global socio-economic change, the post-marketing or cancellation of sports, religious, political and cultural events, and the generalized lack of supplies increased by panic-induced purchases.
Schools and universities closed at national or local level in 193 countries, which affected about 99.4% of the world's student population.
Wrong information was spread about the Internet virus, and there were incidents of xenophobia and discrimination against Chinese people, other persons with East and South-East Asian background and other areas with significant virus cases.
Due to the reduction in heavy-duty travel and closures, a reduction in air pollution and carbon emissions has been observed.
On 31 December 2019, the health authorities in Wuhan, China (the capital of the province of Hubei) informed a group of cases of unidentified pneumonia, and an investigation was started early in January 2020.
The cases, in most cases, were related to the largest maritime market in Huanan, so it was thought that the virus had a zoonotic origin.
The virus that caused the outbreak is known as SARS-CoV-2, a recently discovered virus closely related to caronaviruses of the mucous membranes, panaline coronavirus and SARS-CoV. Subsequently, it was discovered that the first person suspected of showing symptoms was sick on 1 December 2019, and that person did not have visible connections with the latest market group.
Of the first group of cases reported in December 2019, it was determined that two thirds had a market link.
On 13 March 2020, an unverified report from South China Morning Post suggested that, on 17 November 2019, a 55-year-old person from the province of Hubei could have been the first. On 26 February 2020, WHO reported that, as new cases, according to reports, decreased in China but suddenly increased in Italy, Iran and South Korea, the number of new cases outside China had first exceeded the number of new cases within China.
There may be a considerable number of unreported cases, especially among those with milder symptoms.
On 26 February, relatively few cases were reported in young people, and those 19-year-olds and minors represented 2.4% of the cases worldwide. Patrick Vallance, the United Kingdom's chief scientific adviser, believed that 60% of the British population would have to be infected before an effective collective immunity could be achieved.
Cases refer to the number of persons subjected to COVID-19 tests and who obtained a positive result confirmed under official protocols.
As of 23 March, no country had carried out tests in more than 3 per cent of its population, and many countries had official policies not to perform tests in persons with mild symptoms such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland.
A study published on 16 March revealed that, until 23 January, an estimated 86% of COVID-19 infections had not been detected and that these unregistered infections were the source of 79% of the cases recorded.
A statistical analysis published on 30 March estimated that the number of infections in Italy was significantly higher than the reported cases.
The initial estimates of the basic reproductive number (R0) for COVID-19 were from 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the Control Centres and the Prevention of Diseases in the United States determined that it could be 5.7.
Most people with COVID-19 will recover.
For those who do not, the time spent from the development of symptoms to death has been between 6 and 41 days, being the most common 14 days.
On 10 April 2020, approximately 97,000 deaths were attributed to COVID-19.
In China, about 80 per cent of deaths were reported to people over 60 years of age and 75 per cent had pre-existing diseases, including cardiovascular diseases and diabetes. Official death records for COVID-19 pandemics generally refer to missing persons who gave positive results in COVID testing, according to official protocols.
It is possible that the number of actual deaths due to COVID-19 may be much higher, since it may not be included in those who have failed without the evidence, for example in their homes, in the homes of elders, etc.
Part data from Italy revealed that the number of additional deaths during the pandemic exceeded the official record of deaths by COVID in a factor of 4-5 times.
A voter from the U.S. Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) admitted "We know that [the number of deaths declared] is an estimate", a statement confirmed by the anecdotic subcontinent reports in the United States. This estimate is common in pandemics, such as the H1N1 swine flu pandemic of 2009. The first confirmed death took place in Wuhan on 9 January 2020.
The first death outside of mainland China occurred on 1 February in the Philippines, and the first death outside Asia occurred in France on 14 February.
On 28 February, outside of mainland China, more than one dozen deaths were recorded in each of Iran, South Korea and Italy.
On 13 March, more than forty countries and territories had reported deaths on all continents except Antarctica. In general, several indicators are used to quantify mortality.
These numbers vary according to the region and time, and are influenced by the number of trials, quality of the health system, treatment options, time spent from the initial outbreak and characteristics of the population, such as age, sex and general health. The proportion of deaths on cases reflects the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed within a given time period.
According to statistics from the University of Johns Hopkins, the world rate of death on cases is 6.0% (97 039/617 204) from 10 April 2020.
The number would vary according to the region.
In China, death rate estimates for cases decreased from 17.3% (in those with symptoms from 1 to 10 January 2020) to 0.7% (in those with symptoms after 1 February 2020). Other indicators include the rate of fatality per case, reflecting the percentage of persons diagnosed as a result of a disease, and the rate of fatality by infections, reflecting the percentage of infections (diagnosed and undiagnosed) who died from a disease.
These statistics do not have a specific deadline and consider a specific population from infection to the resolution of the case.
Some academics have tried to calculate these numbers for specific populations.
The Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine of Oxford University estimates that the literacy rate for pandemic infections is between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The higher estimate of this range is consistent with the results of the first random test for COVID-19 in Germany, and a statistical study that analysed the impact of the tests on the estimates of the randomity rate by case.
WHO says the pandemic can be controlled.
The peak and the final duration of the bridge are uncertain and can vary according to location.
Maciej Boni of the State University of Pennsylvania said, "Infectious bridges, if they are not controlled, generally stabilize and then begin to decrease when the disease remains without guests available.
But at this point, it is almost impossible to make any reasonable forecast of when that will happen."
The chief medical adviser to the Government of China, Zhong Nanshan, argued that "may end in June" if it could be mobilized to all countries to follow the WHO recommendation on measures to stop the spread of the virus.
On 17 March, Adam Kucharski of the London School of Health and Tropical Medicine stated that the SARS-CoV-2 "will be circulating, possibly for one or two years".
According to the study of the Imperial College directed by Neil Ferguson, physical distance and other measures will be necessary "until a vaccine (probably 18 months or more) is available".
William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University said, "I think it's unlikely that this coronavirus, given that it is transmitted so easily, disappears completely" and "can become a station disease, which is repatriated every year".
The virulence of recovery would depend on collective immunity and the magnitude of mutation.
The symptoms of COVID-19 may be relatively non-specific and the people infected may be asymptomatic.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and your dryness (68%).
The less frequent symptoms include fatigue, spout production in breathing pathways (flame), loss of sense of the olfato, lack of air, muscle and limb pain, chest pain, headaches, schalophrenia, vomiting, haemotypes, diarrhoea or cianosis. WHO claims that approximately one of the six people is seriously ill and has difficulty breathing.
According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) of the United States, emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing, pressure or pain persistent in the chest, sudden confusion, difficulty in awakening and blue in the face or lips; immediate medical attention is recommended before these symptoms occur. The major progression of the disease can cause severe neumonia, acute respiratory difficulty syndrome, sepsis, septic shock and death.
Some people who are infected may be asymptomatic, do not present clinical symptoms, although the results of the test confirm the infection, researchers therefore advised that those who have close contact with infected persons should be monitored and carefully examined in order to remove the infection.
The Chinese estimates of the proportion of asymptometic people are slightly higher than 44%.
The usual incubation period (the time between infection and the occurrence of symptoms) covers one to 14 days; it is more often than 5 days. As an example of uncertainty, the estimate of the proportion of people with COVID-19 who lost their sense of ophthalmology at the beginning was 30% and then decreased to 15%.
There are still some details on how the disease is spread.
The disease is believed to be spread mainly during close contact and through small cats that are produced by tossing or talking; the close contact is considered to be a distance of 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
According to the studies, without covering the mouth, drops can be moved from 4.5 metres (15 feet) to 8.2 metres (27 feet).
Some have suggested that the virus can also be transmitted through small drops that remain in the air for longer periods, which can be generated by talking. In addition, respiratory drops can be produced during relief, including speaking, although the virus is generally not transmitted by air.
The gothites can enter the mouth or nose of the people who are near or, possibly, enter the lungs.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and cardiopulmonary re-immation (RCP), may cause respiratory secretions to be aerosolated and therefore air-producing.
You can also spread when you touch a contaminated surface, including your skin, and then touch your eyes, nose or mouth.
Although there is a concern that can be transmitted through the hexagonals, this risk is considered low.
The Government of China denied the possibility of oral fecal transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The virus is more contagious during the first three days after symptoms appear, although propaganda may be possible before symptoms and in more advanced stages of the disease occur.
People had positive results in the disease trials up to three days before symptoms appeared, which indicated that transmission was possible before significant symptoms developed.
There are only some reports of asymptomatic cases confirmed by the laboratory, but some countries have identified an asymptomatic transmission during contact tracking investigations.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) maintains that, although it is not fully clear how the disease is spread, in general, one person is infected with two or three others. The virus survives from hours to days on the surface.
In particular, it was determined that the virus is detectable for up to three days in plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel 304, one day in cartridge and up to four hours in copper.
This, however, varies according to humidity and temperature. Positive results were obtained in COVID-19 tests performed in males and other animals.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to human beings, although the British authorities recommend washing hands after contact with animals, as well as after contact with other areas that may have affected infected persons.
Coronavirus 2 of the severe respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) is a new virus, which was first isolated from three people with neumonia associated with the acute respiratory disease group in Wuhan.
All features of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are found in the coronaviruses related to nature. Outside of the human body, the virus dies when contacting jabone, which dissolves its protective environment. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
It is thought to have a zoological origin.
Genetic analysis revealed that the coronavirus is genetically grouped with the betacoronvirus gene, its subgeneral sarbecovirus (line B) together with two stems derived from the mucous membrane.
At the level of the complete genome, 96 % is identical to other caronavirus samples (BatCov RatG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers discovered that there is only one difference in amino acids in certain parts of the gene sequences between panolinic viruses and human beings.
To date, the comparison of the complete gene indicated that the coronavirus of the panolins and SARS-CoV-2 share, as a maximum, 92% of the genetic material, which is not sufficient to show that the pancreas are the intermediate host.
The virus infection can be temporarily diagnosed on the basis of symptoms, although, in the last instance, it is confirmed by the reaction in the polymerase chain with reverse transcriptase (rRT-PCR) of infected secrets or by computerized tomography images.
According to a study conducted in Wuhan in which the reaction in the polymerase chain was compared to computerized tomography, computerized tomography is much more sensitive than the reaction in the polymerase chain, although less specific, and many of the characteristics in the images match the processes of other diseases and neurons.
Since March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends "don't use computerized tomography as a method of detection or as a first line test to diagnose COVID-19".
WHO has published several ARN test protocols for SARS-CoV-2, the first of which was published on 17 January.
The test uses the polymerase chain reaction with real-time reverse transcriptase (rRT-PCR).
The test can be performed in blood samples or respiratory samples.
The results are generally available within a few hours or days.
In general, this test is performed with a nasopharyngeal hesophageal, although it can also be used for the throat. Some laboratories and companies are developing serological tests, which detect antibodies.
On 6 April 2020, none of these demonstrated that it was necessary to approve its generalised use.
In the U.S., a serological test developed by Cellex was approved for emergency use by certified laboratories only.
The characteristic features in the images of computerized radiographics and tomography (TC) of symmetrical persons include glass-delossed asymmetric peripherals and missing plural drops.
The Italian Radiology Society is compiling an international database on the results obtained in confirmed case images.
Due to overposition with other infections such as adenovirus, the diagnosis of unconfirmed images by reaction in polymerase chain has a limited specificity in the identification of COVID-19.
A broad study conducted in China compared the results of computerized torax to those of the polymerase chain reaction and demonstrated that although the diagnosis by images is less specific for infection, it is faster and more sensitive, which suggests its view as a detection tool in areas affected by the epidemic.
Convulsive neuronal networks were developed based on artificial intelligence to detect features of the virus in images, both with radiographs and computerized tomography.
The strategies to prevent the transmission of the disease include maintaining a good general personal hygiene, washing your hands, avoiding touching your eyes, nose or mouth with your hands without washing them before, and turning or touching on an unskilled panel and pulling the panel directly into a waste container.
It is recommended that those who may already be infected use a public surgical mask.
Physical distance measures are also recommended to prevent transmission. Many Governments have restricted or advised all non-essential journeys from and to countries and areas affected by the outbreak.
However, the virus has reached the Community deployment phase in many parts of the world.
This means that the virus is spreading within the communities, and some members of the community do not know where or how they have been infected, and it is recommended that medical care providers who visit someone who might be infected take standard care, contact precautions and use eye protection.
The use of mobile phone location data by Governments with this purpose has raised concerns about privacy, and Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations have issued a statement to require limits on this type of surveillance.
Several mobile applications for voluntary use have been implemented or proposed, and on 7 April 2020, more than a dozen groups of experts were working on privacy-related solutions such as using Bluetooth to record user presence on other mobile phones.
Users then receive a message if they were in close contact with someone who gave positive results in COVID-19 testing. They are circulating wrong ideas about how to prevent infection; for example, nasal washing and oral enjugation garages are not effective.
There is no vaccine against COVID-19, although many organizations are working to develop one.
Hand washing is recommended to prevent the spread of disease.
The CDC recommends that people wash their hands frequently with water and soap for at least twenty seconds, especially after using the bathroom or when they have visible dry hands; before eating and after smelling the nose, tossing or sweating.
This is because, outside of the human body, the virus dies when it enters contact with jabone, which decomposes its protective bubble.
The CDC also recommended the use of an alcohol-based disinfectant with at least 60 % of alcohol in volume when no water and soap are available.
WHO recommends that people avoid touching their eyes, nose or mouth with their hands without washing them before.
The surfaces can be detached with several solutions (in the period of one minute after exposure to the disinfectant on an stainless steel surface), including ethanol at 62–71 %, isopropanol at 50–100 %, sodium hypochloride at 0,1 %, hydrogen peroxide at 0.5 % and powdered at 0.2–7.5 %.
Other solutions, such as benzalconium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate, are less effective.
The CDC recommends that, if a case of COVID is suspected or confirmed in an installation such as an office or custody, all areas such as offices, bathrooms, common spaces, shared electronic equipment, such as tablets, touch screens, keyboards, remote controls and automatic cassettes that have been used by sick persons.
Health organizations recommend that people cover their mouth and nose with a flexible code or with an indistinguishable panel to thaw or rot, and that they want the panel immediately.
It is recommended that those who may be infected use surgical masks, since the use of a mask can limit the volume and distance used by the respiratory gates spreading by speaking, waving and tossing.
WHO issued instructions on when and how to use masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, " using a mask can reduce [of] people's tendency to touch their face, which is an important source of infection without adequate hand hygiene."The use of masks has also been recommended in people who care for someone who might have the disease.
WHO has recommended the use of masks by healthy people only if they are at high risk, for example, those who care for a person with COVID-19, although it also recognizes that using masks can help people avoid touching their face.
Several countries have begun to promote the use of public masks.
In the U.S., CDC recommends the use of non-medical masks made of screen. China specifically recommended the use of dispersible medical masks by healthy members of the public, especially when they are in close contact with other people (1 meter (3 feet) or less.
Hong Kong recommends using a surgical mask to take public transport or to be in competitive places.
Thailand's health officials recommend that people make screen masks in their homes and wash them daily.
The Czech and Slovak Republic prohibited access to public spaces without using a mask or covering the nose and mouth.
On 16 March, Vietnam requested that all people use a mask when in public spaces to protect and protect others.
The Government of Austria demanded the use of masks by all persons entering a supermarket.
Israel requested that all residents use public masks.
Taiwan, which has produced ten million masks per day since mid-March, on 1 April it demanded the use of masks by passengers on interurban trains and buses.
Panama imposed mandatory use of masks for free air, while also recommended the manufacture of made masks at home to those who cannot buy them.
Mascarillas have also been used generally in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social distance (also known as physical distance) includes measures to control the infection designed to prevent the spread of disease by minimizing close contact between people.
The methods include 40 travel restrictions and school closures, workplaces, stadiums, theaters and commercial centres.
People can implement social distance methods by staying in their homes, limiting travel, avoiding competitive areas, using health forms that do not include contact and physically distance from other people.
Many Governments now require or recommend social distance in areas affected by the outbreak.
The maximum number of meetings recommended by U.S. government agencies and health organizations was reduced rapidly by 250 people (if there was no known spread of COVID-19 in a region) to 50 people, and subsequently 10 persons.
On 22 March 2020, Germany banned public meetings of more than two people. Adults and those with underlying diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, hypertension and immune systems have a greater risk of suffering from serious diseases and complications, and the CDC recommends that they remain in their homes as far as possible in the areas of the community affected by the outbreak. At the end of March 2020, WHO and other health agencies began to replace the term "social distance" by "physical distance" to clarify that the objective is to reduce physical contact while maintaining social connections, whether virtual or remote.
The use of the term "social distance" has had an impact on the assumption that people should adopt a complete social isolation instead of encouraging them to keep in touch with other people through alternative means. Some authorities have published guidelines on sexual health for use during the pandemic.
These include recommendations only to have sexual relations with a person living with whom you do not have the virus or symptoms of the virus.
Autoalization was recommended at the home of those who were diagnosed with COVID-19 and those who suspected of being infected.
Health agencies have published detailed instructions on appropriate self-assessment. Many Governments have demanded or recommended self-care of entire populations in the affected areas.
The most stringent self-care instructions were issued for those belonging to high-risk groups.
People who may have been in contact with someone with COVID-19 and who have recently traveled to a country or region with generalised transmission are advised to make autoquarent for 14 days from the date of the last possible exposure.
The strategies to control a bridge are containment or removal and mitigation.
The content is carried out in the first stages of the outbreak and is intended to identify and isolate infected persons, as well as to introduce other measures to control infection and vaccines to prevent the spread of disease to the rest of the population.
When it is no longer possible to control the spread of disease, efforts are transferred to the mitigation phase: measures are taken to curb the spread and mitigate its effects on the health system and society.
A combination of containment and mitigation measures may be adopted at the same time.
The removal requires more extreme measures to reverse the pandemic by reducing the basic number of reproduction to less than 1. Part of controlling the outbreak of an infectious disease involves attempting to reduce the epidemic peak, which is known as planning the epidemic curve.
This reduces the risk of breaking up health services and allows more time for the development of vaccines and treatments.
Non-pharmaceutical interventions that can control the outbreak include personal preventive measures such as hand hygiene, use of masks and self-care; Community measures aimed at physical distance, such as closure of schools and cancellation of massive competition events; Community commitment to promote acceptance and participation in such interventions; and environmental and surface cleanup measures. In China, more drastic measures were taken to contain the outbreak when its severity became evident, for example, the implementation of 40 per cent in whole cities and the imposition of strict travel bans.
Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus.
South Korea implemented massive and localized detection assessments, and issued warnings on the movements of infected persons.
Singapore provided financial support to the infected people who decided to make up for and inflict great damage on those who did not.
Taiwan has increased the production of masks and sentenced the accumulation of medical supplies. Simulations in Britain and the United States show that mitigation (which reduces the spread of the epidemic but does not stop it) and removal (which reverses the growth of the pandemic) have major challenges.
The best mitigation policies could reduce the maximum medical care demand in two thirds and deaths by half, but still generate hundreds of thousands of deaths and collapse of health systems.
It may be preferable to remove, but it should be maintained throughout the whole period of time that the virus is circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine is available, if it occurs first), since the transmission is reactivated rapidly when the measures are flexible.
Long-term intervention to remove the pandemic involves social and economic costs.
There are no specific antiviral medicines approved for COVID-19, but efforts are being made to develop them, which includes testing of existing medicines.
Taking free selling medicines for the cold, drinking liquids and relaxing can help relieve the symptoms.
According to pregnancy, oxygen therapy, intravenous fluids and respiratory support may be required.
The use of steroids can improve results.
Several compounds are being investigated which were previously approved for the treatment of other viral diseases for use in the treatment of COVID-19.
WHO also indicated that some "home and traditional remains" can alleviate the symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.
WHO describes the increase in capacity and adaptation of medical care to the needs of patients with COVID-19 as a key response measure to the disease.
The ECDC and the WHO Regional Office for Europe have provided guidance to primary health care hospitals and services for the redeployment of resources at different levels, including focusing laboratory services on COVID-19 tests, canceling alternative procedures where possible, separating and isolate positive patients in COVID-19 and increasing the capacity of intensive care through staff training and the increase in the number of respiratory and beds available.
There are several theories about where the first case (the so-called zero patient) could have originated.
The first case known as the new coronavirus can be resumed on 1 December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei, China.
Over a month, the number of cases of coronavirus in Hubei increased gradually.
These were mainly linked to the largest market in Huananan, which also sold live animals, and one theory is that the virus comes from one of these animals; or, in other words, it has a zoonotic origin. On December 26, a series of cases of unbeknownst cause neurons were observed by Dr. Zhang Jixian at the Hubei Provincial Hospital, who informed Jianghan's CDC of Wuhan on December 27.
On December 30, a group of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital warned their colleagues about a "coronavirus similar to SARS".
The police arrested eight of these doctors, including Li Wenliang, for spreading false rumors, and another doctor, Ai Fen, was arrested by his superiors for giving the alarm.
Subsequently, on 31 December, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission issued a public note and informed WHO.
In early January, enough cases of unexplained pneumonia had been reported to health authorities in Wuhan as a way to initiate an investigation. During the first stages of the outbreak, the number of cases doubled approximately every seven and a half days.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus was spread to other Chinese provinces, contributing to the migration through the New Chinese Year and the fact that Wuhan is a transport centre and an important railway crossing.
On 20 January, China reported around 140 new cases in one day, including two people in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
The following official data show that by January 20, 2020, 6174 people had already developed symptoms. On March 26, the United States has exceeded China and Italy with the largest number of confirmed cases in the world. On April 9, 2020, more than 1.61 million cases have been reported worldwide; over 97,000 people have fallen and more than 364,000 have recovered.
About 200 countries and territories have had at least one case.
Because of the pandemic in Europe, many countries in the Schengen area have restricted free movement and established border controls.
National responses have included containment measures, such as 40 (known as housekeeping orders, shelter orders in the area or border), and landings. On 2 April, around 300 million people, or about 90 per cent of the population, are in some type of detention in the United States, more than 50 million people are confined in the Philippines, about 59 million are confined in South Africa and 1300 million are confined in India.
On 26 March, 1700 million people around the world were in detention, which increased to 2600 million people two days later, about the third part of the world population.
The first confirmed case of COVID-19 was withdrawn on 1 December 2019 in Wuhan; an unconfirmed report indicates that the first case occurred on 17 November.
On 26 December, Dr. Zhang Jixian observed a group of cases of unknown cause neurons, and his hospital informed Jianghan's CDC of Wuhan on 27 December.
The first genetic tests of patients samples on 27 December 2019 indicated the presence of a coronavirus similar to SARS.
On 31 December, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission issued a public note.
The WHO was informed on the same day.
While these reports were being made, the police warned doctors in Wuhan to "distribute noises" on the bridge.
The Chinese National Health Commission initially stated that there was no "clear evidence" of human transmission.
At the end of January, the Chinese Government launched a drastic campaign, later described by the Secretary-General of the Chinese Communist Party, Xi Jinping, as a "popular war", to contain the spread of the virus.
As described as "the largest quarter in the history of humanity", on 23 January a health cord was announced that prohibited travel inside and outside Wuhan, this extended to a total of 15 cities in Hubei, and affected totally about 57 million people.
The use of private vehicles in the city was prohibited.
The New Year's celebrations (January 25th) were canceled in many places.
The authorities also announced the construction of a temporary hospital, the Huoshenshan Hospital, which was completed in 10 days.
Later, another hospital, Leishenshan Hospital, was built to receive more patients.
In addition to the new hospitals built, China also converted 14 other facilities in Wuhan, such as convention centres and stadiums, into temporary hospitals. On 26 January, the Government implemented further measures to contain the COVID-19 outbreak, which included the release of health statements for travelers and the extension of the spring festival holiday.
Universities and schools were also closed throughout the country.
The regions of Hong Kong and Macao have implemented a number of measures, especially with regard to schools and universities.
Remote work measures were established in several parts of China.
Travel restrictions were implemented inside and outside Hubei.
Public transport was modified and museums were temporarily closed throughout China.
The control of public movement was implemented in several cities, and it has been estimated that some 760 million people (more than half the population) faced some type of restrictions on free air emissions. Following the start of the global phase of the outbreak in March, the Chinese authorities took strict measures to prevent the "import" virus from other countries.
For example, Beijing has imposed a mandatory 14-day quota for all international travelers entering the city. On 23 March, in mainland China only a case had been transmitted at national level in the previous five days, on this occasion, through a passenger who returned from Istanbul to Canton.
On 24 March 2020, Chinese Prime Minister Li Keqiang reported that the dissemination of cases transmitted at national level was largely blocked and that the bridge had been controlled in China.
On the same day, the travel restrictions were flexible in Hubei and Wuhan, two months after the restriction was imposed. On 26 March 2020, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China announced that the entry of visa holders or residence permit would be suspended from 28 March without specific details on when this policy would end.
Those wishing to enter China should request visas in Chinese embassies or consulates.
The Government of China encouraged companies and factories to reopen on 30 March and provided economic incentives packages for their firms. The State Council declared a day of struggle to begin with a national three-minute silence on 4 April at 10:00, in line with the Qingming Festival, although the Central Government asked families to submit their respect online to meet the physical distance in order to avoid the breach of COVID-19.
On 20 January 2020, it was confirmed that COVID-19 was proposed from China to South Korea.
On 20 February, the country's health body reported a significant increase in confirmed cases, mainly attributed to a meeting in Daegu of a new religious movement known as the Church of Jesús Shincheonji.
It is suspected that Shincheonji's devotees who visited Daegu since Wuhan were the source of the bridge.
On 22 February, of the 9336 followers of the church, 1261 or about 13% reported symptoms. On 23 February 2020, South Korea declared maximum alert.
More than 2000 confirmed cases were reported in Korea on 28 February, which increased to 3150 on 29 February.
All South Korea's military bases remained in place for forty years after the tests confirmed that three soldiers gave positive response to the virus.
The hours of the airlines were also affected, and therefore changed. South Korea presented what was considered to be the world's largest and best-organised programme to do virus detection tests in the population and isolate infected persons, as well as identify and identify those who were in contact with them.
The detection methods included the mandatory self-reporting of symptoms by people recently arrived from other countries through mobile applications, drive-thru centres to perform virus detection tests with results available on the following day and increased diagnostic capacity to be able to test up to 20,000 people every day.
South Korea's programme is considered a success in controlling the bridge despite not adopting the quarter in entire cities. South Korea's society was initially polarized with regard to President Moon Jae-in's response to the crisis.
Many Koreans signed requests to demand Moon's destruction for what they considered an ill-handling by the Government, or well, to praise their response.

The United Kingdom's response to the first virus emerged as one of the most vulnerable countries, and until 18 March 2020, the British Government did not impose on its citizens any form of social distance measures or massive quota.
As a result, the Government received criticisms from the apparent lack of speed and intensity in response to public concerns.

On 23 January, in response to the decision of the central authorities to implement a ban on transport in Wuhan, WHO representative Gauden Galea stated that, although "expectively not a recommendation made by WHO", it was "an important indication of the commitment to contain the epidemic at the place where it is most concentrated" and said that "it was not prior to the history of public health". On 30 January, following confirmation of the transmission of human beings out of China and the increase in the number of cases in other countries, WHO declared the outbreak an emergency of public health of international importance (SPII), the sixth SPIII since the first time the measure was invoked during the pollination pandemic in 2009.
WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom said that the ESPIL should be "at risk of global propaganda, especially for low and medium-income countries without solid health systems".

This virus may be on its way and we must be prepared," stressing that appropriate response measures could help the world avoid "the worst".
Ryan also said that current data did not ensure that public health officials declared a global pandemic, and he pointed out that such a statement would mean that "we are basically accepting that all human beings on the planet will be exposed to that virus".
On 11 March, WHO declared pandemic the outbreak of coronavirus.
The Director-General said that WHO was "very concerned about alarming levels of spread and severity and alarming levels of inaction".

Some Chinese officials, for example, Zhao Lijian, have resigned a prior recognition of the outbreak of coronavirus in Wuhan, in favour of conspirative theories about the origin of COVID-19 in the U.S. or Italy.
The U.S. Donald Trump administration has referred to the coronavirus as "Chinese virus" or "Wuhan virus", and said that "China's censorship has over-fooded a virus that has now become a global pandemic", which, in turn, has been identified by some critics as racism and "distraction" of the failure of its administration to contain the disease".
The Daily Beast received a telegram from the U.S. Government that described a strategy of communications with apparent origin in the National Security Council, and called the strategy "All About China".
We have been told that we are trying to deliver this message in any way possible, including press conferences and television shows. "Communication media such as Politico, Foreign Policy and Bloomberg have said that China's efforts to send help to countries affected by the virus are part of a propaganda to gain global influence.
The European Union's external policy representative, Joseph Borrell, warned that "there is a geopolitical component that includes a struggle for influence through propaganda and generosity policy".
Borrell also said that "China is aggressively pushing the message that, unlike the United States, it is a responsible and reliable partner".
China also requested the United States to lift its sanctions against Syria, Venezuela and Iran, while reports indicate that it had sent assistance to these two last countries.

The Italian newspaper La Stampa cited an anonymous "high-level political source" which claimed that 80% of Russia's aid was "useless or of little use for Italy".
The source accused Russia of undertaking an offensive "goopolitical and diplomatic seduction".
The President of Lombardia, Attlio Fontana, and the Italian Minister for Foreign Affairs, Luigi Di Mayo, destroyed the periodic reports and expressed their appreciation.
Russia also sent a cargo aircraft with medical assistance to the United States.
The spokesman for Kremlin, Dmitry Peskov, said that "when offering help to US colleagues, [Putin] assumes that, when US manufacturers of materials and medical equipment cover impulse, they can also correspond if necessary."

The Secretary-General of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, Kate Hudson, criticised the 2020 Dedefender: "In the current public health crisis, it threatens not only the lives of the United States troops and the various European countries involved, but also those of the people of the countries in which they operate." The Iranian Government was very affected by the virus, with about two dozen members of the infected Parliament, as well as other current and previous political figures.
On 14 March 2020, Iran's President, Hassan Rouhani, wrote a public letter to world leaders to ask for help, and said that his country was struggling to combat the scourge due to lack of access to international markets as a result of United States sanctions against Iran. The bridge prompted the requirement that the United States adopt common social policies in other rich countries, such as universal medical care, universal child care, paid family license and higher levels of funds for public health.
Political analysts predicted that it could negatively affect Donald Trump's re-election possibilities in the 2020 presidential election. Diplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea had deteriorated due to the pandemic.
South Korea criticised Japan's "quietly ambitious and passive efforts" after Japan announced that any person from South Korea would remain in custody for two weeks at sites designated by the Government.
South Korea's society was initially polarized with regard to Moon Jae-in's response to the crisis.
Many Koreans signed requests for Moon's disappearance, which they considered to be an ill-handled weapon by the Government, or rather to praise its response. The pandemic has allowed countries to adopt emergency legislation in response.
Some commentators have expressed concern that Governments could strengthen their control of power.
In Hungary, its Parliament voted to allow Prime Minister Viktor Orbán to rule by decree in an undefinable manner, suspends Parliament and the elections and punishes those who are deemed to have spread false information about the virus and the management of the crisis by the Government.
Coronavirus was responsible for the outbreak of several cases of supply shortage, as a result of the largest use of equipment worldwide to combat outbreaks, panic-induced purchases and interruptions of logistics and manufacturing operations.
The Food and Drug Administration of the United States has issued warnings about the shortage of medicines and medical equipment due to the greatest demand for consumers and the interruption of suppliers.
Several localities also presented panic-induced purchases that left the remaining essential products vacuumes, such as food, hygiene paper and bottled water, which caused the lack of supplies.
The technology sector, in particular, has been warning about delays in electronic product shipments.
According to WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom, the demand for personal protection teams increased 100 times.
This demand generated an increase in prices up to twenty times the normal price and also caused delays from four to six months in the supply of medical articles.
It also caused a lack of staff protection teams around the world, and WHO warned that this would put health workers at risk.
In Australia, the pandemic provided a new opportunity for purchasers to sell Australian products in China.
The activity has created a lack of formula for babies in some supermarkets and was subsequently prohibited by the Australian Government. Despite the high prevalence of COVID-19 cases in northern Italy and the Wuhan region, and the subsequent demand for food, none of these areas were affected by the acute lack of food.
China and Italy's measures against the accumulation and illicit trade of essential products have been successful and have avoided a sharp shortage of food that has been predicted in Europe and North America.
North Italy, with its important agricultural production, has not had a significant reduction, but prices could increase, according to sector representatives.
Food stocks were only temporarily empty, even in the city of Wuhan, while Chinese government officials released raw meat reserves to ensure adequate food for the population.
Similar laws exist in Italy which require food producers to maintain reserves for these emergencies.
The damage to the world economy was felt in China: according to a periodic report of 16 March, the Chinese economy was very affected in the first two months of 2020 due to measures taken by the Government to stop the spread of the virus, and minor sales fell by 20.5%.
As continental China is an important economic and manufacturing centre, the viral outbreak has been considered a major threat of destabilization for the world economy.
Agathe Demarais of The Economist Intelligence Unit has predicted that markets will remain volatile until a clearer picture of the potential consequences emerges.
In January 2020, some analysts estimated that the economic consequences of the global growth epidemic could overcome those of the 2002-2004 SARS outbreak.
An estimate of an expert at the University of Washington in San Luis indicated an impact of more than $300 billion on world supply chains that could last for up to two years.
According to the report, the Petroleum Exporting Countries Organization (OPEC) remained "revealed" after a strong fall in oil prices due to China's smaller demand.
On 24 February, world values markets fell due to a significant increase in the number of COVID-19 cases outside of mainland China.
On 27 February, due to growing concerns about the coronavirus outbreak, several U.S. Bursatile Indexes, including the NASDAQ-100, the S&P 500 Index and the Dow Jones Industrial Average published their most pronounced fall since 2008, the Dow fell 1191 points, the largest one day since the 2007-08 financial crisis.
The three indexes ended the week with less than 10 %.
On 28 February, Skopje Ratings GmbH confirmed the sovereign credit rating of China, but maintained a negative outlook.
Action was recast on the basis of the fears of the coronavirus, the largest fall occurred on 16 March.
Many consider it likely that there is an economic downturn.
Economist Mohamed El-Erian commended the timely emergency measures of the central states and banks.
Central banks are responding faster than they have responded to the financial collapse in 2008.
Tourism is one of the most affected sectors due to travel bans, the closure of public places that include travel attractions and the recommendation of Governments not to travel anywhere in the world.
As a result, many airlines have cancelled flights due to the lowest demand, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines and Qantas, while the British regional airline Flybe collapsed.
The impact on cruise companies has never reached a level before.
Several railway stations and transshiprs terminals have also been closed.
The epidemic coincided with the Chunyun, an important time of travel related to New Year's holidays.
Several events involving large crowds were canceled by national and regional governments, including New Year's festivals, while private companies also closed their tourist stores and attractions, such as Hong Kong and Shanghai Disneyland.
Many tourist events and attractions of the New Moon Year have been closed to avoid massive concentrations, including the prohibited city of Beijing and the traditional festivals of the temples.
In 24 of the 31 provinces, municipalities and regions of China, the authorities extended the New Year's holiday until 10 February, and ordered that most workplaces should not be reopened until that date.
These regions represent 80 per cent of GDP and 90 per cent of country exports.
Hong Kong raised its level of response to the highest infectious disease and declared an emergency, closed schools until March and cancelled their New Year's celebrations. The minority sector was affected at global level, with reductions in attention hours or temporary closures.
The visits to minorities in Europe and Latin America decreased by 40%.
North American and Middle East minorities experienced a drop from 50 to 60 per cent.
This also resulted in a 33 to 43% fall in the pedestrian transit to commercial centres in March compared with February.
The operators of commercial centres around the world imposed additional measures, such as major hygiene, thermal scanners to control the temperature of buyers and cancellation of events. According to an estimate by the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, the pandemic-induced recession could leave between 14 and 22 million people in an extreme poverty situation in Latin America who had remained in that situation without the pandemic.
In January and February 2020, during the highest point of the epidemic in Wuhan, about 5 million people in China lost their jobs.
Many of China's nearly 300 million migrant rural workers were kidnapped in their homes in the provinces of the interior or arrested in the province of Hubei. In March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and requested government assistance.
The coronavirus outbreak could cost 47 million jobs in the United States and the unemployment rate could reach 32%, according to estimates from the Federal Reserve Bank of San Luis. The restriction in India has left tens of millions of Indian migrant workers (which receive daily wages) unemployed. According to Angus Reid Institute survey, 44% of Canadian households experienced some type of unemployment. About 900 000 workers lost their jobs in Spain since the imprisonment began in mid-March 2020.
During the second half of March, 4 million French workers applied for temporary unemployment benefits and 1 million British workers applied for a universal credit plan. Nearly half a million companies in Germany have implemented short-term work schemes subsidised by the Government, known as Kurzworking, for their employees.
The German short-term labour compensation scheme has been adopted by France and Great Britain.
The sectors of secular arts and cultural heritage were deeply affected by the pandemic, which had an impact on the operations of organizations and on people, both employed and independent, around the world.
The cultural and artistic sector organizations tried to carry out their mission (often funded with public funds) to provide the community with access to cultural heritage, to maintain the safety of its employees and the public and to support artists when possible.
By March 2020, museums, libraries, exhibition sites and other cultural institutions had closed down, and their exhibitions, events and exhibitions had been canceled or postponed.
In response, great efforts were made to provide alternative services through digital platforms. Another recent consequence and which increases an accelerated rate of disease is the cancellation of religious services. Important sports events and other social events, such as music festivals and concerts, technology conferences and fashion trends.
The film industry also suffered interruptions. The Vatican announced the cancellation of the Holy Week celebrations in Rome, which took place during the last week of the Curesma Christian prison season.
Many dioceses have recommended that older Christians stay in their homes instead of attending Mass on Sundays; some churches offered religious services through radio, live Internet or television, while others offer space to pray from the car.
After the Roman Catholic Diocese of Rome’s decision to close its churches and chapels and with the Plaza de San Pedro empty of Christian pilgrims, other religious bodies also canceled their services and limited public concentrations in churches, mosques, churches, temples and garlands.
The Ministry of Health of Iran announced the cancellation of Friday's posters in the areas affected by the outbreak and then closed the monasteries, while Saudi Arabia prohibited the entry of foreign migrants and their residents to the sacred places in La Mecca and Medina.
The pandemic has caused the most significant change in the world's sports calendar since World War II.
Most of the major sports events were cancelled or postponed, among other things, the UEFA Championships League 2019-20, the First League 2019-20, the Euro 2020 UEFA, the 2019-20 season of the NBA and the 2019-20 season of the NHL.
The robot interrupted the plans of the 2020 Olympic Games, which were originally programmed to begin at the end of July; the International Olympic Committee announced on 24 March that the event "will be reprogrammed for a date after 2020 but not after the summer of 2021". casinos and other games around the world closed and online poker tournaments were postponed or canceled.
This has led to many internet users, many online gambling sites have reported significant increases in their new registration rates. The entertainment industry has also been affected, several music groups have suspended or canceled concerts.
Many large theaters, such as Broadway's, also suspended all the shows.
Some artists have explored ways to continue producing and sharing their work via the Internet as an alternative to the traditional live show, such as live live concerts or the creation of "festivals" on the Internet so that artists can interpret, distribute or publish their work.
Online, many Internet memes were spread over the coronavirus, as many resort to humor and distraction in the midst of uncertainty.
Since the outbreak of COVID-19, there has been an increase in prejudices, xenophobia and racism against people of Chinese descent and East Asian descent, and people in the areas of Europe, the United States and other countries where the situation is critical.
Fear, suspicion and hostility have been observed in many countries, particularly in Europe, East Asia, North America and the Asia and the Pacific.
February reports (when most cases were still limited in China) have documented racist feelings in several groups around the world that expressed that Chinese deserve the virus or were receiving what they considered to be a fair repression.
Some countries in Africa have also seen an increase in ancient feelings.
Many residents of Wuhan and Hubei have reported discrimination on the basis of their regional origin.
Chinese and those in areas affected by the virus have received support, both online and outside.
Following the progress of the outbreak towards new countries where the situation is critical, the people of Italy, the first European country that experienced a serious outbreak of COVID-19, could also be subjected to suspicion and xenophobia. Citizens of countries such as Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea initially signed applications to prevent Chinese entry into their countries in an effort to stop the disease.
In Japan, the hashtag #ChinaDontComeToJapan was a trend on Twitter.
China, in addition to other Asian people in the United Kingdom and the United States, has reported higher levels of racist abuse, as well as aggression.
The president of the United States, Donald Trump, was criticized for referring to the coronavirus as "Chinese virus", a term that many critics considered racist and ancient.
Protesters in Ukraine attacked buses transporting Ukrainian and foreign evacuations from Wuhan to Novi Sanzhari.
According to reports, students from northeastern India, who shared a border with China and studied in the main Indian cities, suffered acutely from coronavirus outbreaks.
The president of the state unit of Bharatiya Janata party in Western Bengal, Dilip Ghosh, said that the Chinese had destroyed nature and "that's why God came from them".
China's consulate in Calcutta then condemned the comments and said they were "errones". In China, they increased xenophobia and racism towards non-Chinese residents as a result of the pandemic, and were described as "foreign Basura" and intended for "dwelling".
Many periodicals with payment walls have removed them for parts or whole of their coverage of coronavirus.
Many scientific editors published scientific articles related to the patent available with open access.
Some scientists have chosen to share their results quickly on pre-print servers such as bioRxiv.

The laboratory tests for coronary disease by 2019 (COVID-19) and associated SARS-CoV-2 virus include methods to detect the presence of the virus and those that detect antibodies produced in response to the infection.
The presence of viruses in the samples is confirmed by the reaction test in the polymerase chain with reverse transcriptase, which detects the coronavirus ARN.
This test is specific and is designed to detect only the ARN of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
It is used to confirm very recent or active infections.
Antibody detection (serology) can be used for both diagnosis and population monitoring.
Anti-body tests show how many people have had the disease, including those who had too mild symptoms such as to inform them or who were asymptomatic.
Based on the results of this test, a precise mortality rate of disease and collective immunity in the population can be determined.
Due to limited testing by March 2020, no country had reliable data on the prevalence of the virus in its population.
As of 23 March, no country had performed more than 3 per cent of its population, and there were major variations in the number of trials carried out in the different countries.
This variation is also likely to have a significant impact on the literacy rates for reported cases, which are likely to be very high in some countries.
Through the reaction chain of polymerase with real-time reverse transcriptase (rRT-PCR), the test can be performed in respiratory samples obtained through several methods, including nasopharyngeal hesopharyngeals or spout samples.
The results are generally available within an hour of up to 2 days.
The response test in polymerase chain with reverse transcriptase carried out with pharyngeal hesopathes is only reliable in the first week of the disease.
Later, the virus may disappear in the throat, but it continues to multiply in the lungs.
In persons infected with the test during the second week, as an alternative, sample material can be obtained from the deep parts of the respiratory tract through a injection chain, or it can be used tossed into the tosser (spute).
One of the first polymerase chain reactions was developed in Charité, Berlin, in January 2020, using the polymerase chain reaction with real-time reverse transcriptase (rRT-PCR), and was the basis for the 250 000 kits distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
On 23 January 2020, the United Kingdom had also developed a test. On 28 January 2020, the South Korean company Kogenbiotech developed a SARS-CoV-2 detection kit based on the reaction to the clinical degree polymerase chain (PowerCheck Coronavirus).
In China, BGI Group was one of the first companies to obtain the emergency approval of the National Administration of Medical Products of China of a SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic kit based on the response to the polymerase chain. In the United States, the Control Centres and Disease Prevention (CDC) are distributing their diagnostic response panel in a chain of real-time cross-sectional polymerase for the new Coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV) to public health laboratories through the International Reagent Resource.
One of the three genetic tests in the previous versions of the test kits generated inconclusive results due to defective reactives, and an impact on the performance of tests in the CDC in Atlanta; as a result, on average, less than 100 samples were processed per day during February 2020.
The reliability of the two-component tests was not determined until 28 February 2020, and since then it was allowed that the state and local laboratories began to carry out tests.
The Food and Drug Administration approved the test under an emergency authorisation. U.S. commercial laboratories began testing in early March 2020.
On 5 March 2020, LabCorp announced the availability at national level of COVID-19 tests based on the reaction to the polymerase chain with reverse transcriptase.
Similarly, on 9 March 2020, This Diagnostics provided evidence for COVID-19 at national level.
No limit has been announced; collection of species and processing should be carried out in accordance with the requirements of the CDC.
In Russia, the COVID-19 test was developed and produced by the VECTOR State Research Centre for Virology and Biotechnology.
On 11 February 2020, the test was registered by the Federal Medical Attention Watch Service. On 12 March 2020, Mayo Clinic was reported to have developed a test to detect the infection by COVID-19. On 13 March 2020, Roche Diagnostics received the FDA's approval for a test that could be performed within a 3.5-hour high volume, which allowed a machine to perform approximately 4128 tests in a 24-hour period.
On 19 March 2020, the FDA issued an emergency authorisation for Abbott Laboratories for a test on Abbott's m2000 system; FDA had previously issued similar authorisations for Hologic, LabCorp and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On 21 March 2020, Cepheit also received an FDA emergency authorisation for a test which lasted about 45 minutes.
The FDA has approved a test using the isotermic amplification technology of nuclear acids instead of the polymerase chain reaction.
As this does not require a series of different temperature cycles, this method can provide positive results in just five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
Currently, about 18,000 of these machines are in the United States and Abbott are planning to increase production to perform 50,000 tests per day. In Taiwan, a test is being developed using a monoclonal antibody that is specifically linked to the nucleocapside protein (N protein) of the new coronavirus, with the hope that it can deliver results within a period of 15 to 20 minutes as fast as an influenza test.
In March 2020, the review of publications concluded that "torax radiographs have low diagnostic value in the first stages, while the results of TC [computed tomography] can be obtained even before symptoms appear".
The typical features in the TC include bilateral multi-lobar opacities in glass illustrated with a peripheral, asymmetric and later distribution.
As the disease progresses, subpleural domination, impregnation pattern and consolidation develops.
According to a study conducted in Wuhan, at the point of origin of the current pandemic, where the reaction in the polymerase chain was compared to computerized tomography, computerized tomography is much more sensitive than the reaction in the polymerase chain, although less specific, and many of the characteristics in the images match the processes of other diseases and neurons.
Since March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends "don't use computerized tomography as a method of detection or as a first-line test to diagnose COVID-19". Since March 2020, CDC has recommended the reaction to polymerase chain as an initial review.
Part of the immune system's response to the infection is the production of antibodies, including IgM and IgG.
These can be used to detect infection in people about 7 days after symptoms appear, to determine immunity and population surveillance. Analysis can be carried out in central laboratories or by testing at the point of attention.
Automated high-performance systems in many clinical laboratories may carry out these analyses, but their availability will depend on the production rate of each system.
For analysis in central laboratories, only one peripheral blood type is used, although serious specimens can be used to follow the immune response.
For tests at the point of attention, a single type of blood is usually obtained through a puncture in the skin.
Unlike the reaction methods in the polymerase chain, no extraction step is required prior to the analysis. On 26 March 2020, the FDA appointed 29 entities that provided notification to the agency as appropriate and can now distribute their anti-body tests.
On 7 April 2020, only one test has been approved by the FDA under an emergency authorisation. At the end of March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics received Europe's approval for their test kits, which can detect IgG and IgA antibodies against the virus in blood samples.
The ability to perform tests is of several hundred samples within the time limit and therefore is much faster than conventional response test in the viral ARN polymerase chain.
Antibodys can generally be detected 14 days after the start of the infection. In early April, the United Kingdom discovered that none of the antibody test kits it bought were good enough to use them.
Hong Kong has created a program in which suspect patients can stay in their homes, "the emergency department gives the patient a tube for specimen", the patient skips in the tube, sends it and receives a short-term result. The British NHS announced that it is implementing a pilot program to analyse suspected cases in their homes, which removes the risk of the patient being infected if he goes to the hospital or the need to disinfect an ambulance if one is used. In the trials in driving-through centres for COVID-19 of suspicious cases, a health professional takes samples with appropriate precautions.
The driving-through centres have helped South Korea do some of the fastest and most extensive tests in any country. In Germany, the National Association of Health Insurance Doctors said on 2 March that it had a capacity for approximately 12,000 tests per day in the ambulance environment and that 10 700 people had been tested last week.
Health insurance assumes costs when the test is ordered by a doctor.
According to Instituto Robert Koch, Germany has a general capacity to carry out 160,000 tests per week.
On March 19, tests were offered through the drive-through system in several major cities.
As of 26 March 2020, the total number of tests conducted in Germany was unknown, as only positive results were reported.
A first laboratory survey revealed that, in the natural week of 12/2020, at least 483,295 samples had been analysed in total, including the week of 12/2020, and 33 491 samples (6.9 %) were positive results for SARS-CoV-2. In Israel, researchers at the Institute of Technion and Hospital Rambam developed and tested a method to analyse samples of 64 patients at the same time, consisting of grouping samples and only doing more analysis if the combined sample was positive. On February 5, 2020, BGI opened an improvised emergency detection laboratory of 2000 square metres called "Huo-Yan" (China: fire , or "Fire by more than 10 thousand samples").
With the construction, which was supervised by the founder of BGI, Wang Jian, and which took 5 days, the model showed that the cases in Hubei had been 47% higher and that the cost of dealing with the quarantine had been doubled without this capacity for testing.
Following Wuhan's lab, Huo-Yan laboratories were immediately built in Shenzhen, Tianjün, Beijing and Shanghai, in a total of 12 cities in China.
On 4 March 2020, the total daily production was 50,000 trials per day. Multi-plexed open source designs provided by origami analysis were implemented that allow to evaluate up to 1122 samples of patients for COVID19 using only 93 analyses. These balanced designs can be used in small laboratories without the need to use liquid manipulation robots.
In March, the lack and insufficient number of reactivities affected massive trials in the European Union and the United States.
This led some authors to explore samples preparation protocols involving the heat of samples at 98 °C (208 °F) for 5 minutes to release ARN genomes for further testing. On March 31, it was announced that United Arab Emirates was now undergoing more human-detection tests of coronavirus per person in its population than any other country, and was headed to increase the level of testing to cover the majority of the population.
This was achieved through the combination of drive-through capacity and the purchase of a mass production laboratory at the level of the Group 42 and BGI population (based on its emergency detection laboratories "Huo-Yan" in China).
Built in 14 days, the laboratory has the capacity to perform tens of thousands of reaction tests in polymerase chain with reverse transcripts per day and is the first in the world of this magnitude that works outside China.
Various test forms have been developed that address different parts of the genetic profile of coronavirus in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The World Health Organization adopted the German formula for kits which sent low-income countries with no resources to develop their own kits.
The German formula was published on 17 January 2020; the protocol developed by the U.S. Control and Disease Prevention Centres was not available until 28 January, which delayed the evidence available in the United States. China and the United States had problems with the reliability of the pilot kits at the start of the outbreak, and these countries and Australia were unable to provide sufficient kits to meet the demand and recommendations of health experts on testing.
On the contrary, experts say that the great availability of South Korea's evidence helped to reduce the spread of the new coronavirus.
The Government of South Korea has achieved its capacity for testing, mainly in private sector laboratories, over several years.
On 16 March, the World Health Organization requested increased testing programmes as the best way to reduce the progress of the COVID-19 pandemic. The high demand for evidence due to the widespread spread of the virus caused delays in hundreds of thousands of trials in U.S. private laboratories, and supplies of hysophatic and chemical agents were exhausted.
In March 2020, China reported problems with the accuracy of its test kits.
In the United States, the test kits developed by the CDC had "defects"; the Government then removed the bureaucratic barriers that had prevented private testing. Spain bought test kits to the Chinese company Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but obtained unnecessary results.
The company explained that incorrect results could be due to incorrect collection of samples or misuse of kits.
The Ministry of Spain said that it would remove the kits that had dropped wrong results and replace them with a different test kit provided by Shenzhen Bioeasy. The 80% of the test kits that the Czech Republic bought in China were given incorrect results. Slovakia bought 1.2 million kits in China, which became unnecessary.
Prime Minister Matovic suggested that they should be thrown into Danube. Atesh Kara, of the Turkish Ministry of Health, said that the test kits that Turkey bought in China had a "high error rate" and did not "use them". The United Kingdom bought 3.5 million test kits in China, but at the beginning of April 2020 it announced that they did not serve.
Tests, complemented by a quarter of those who had achieved positive results and the identification of persons with whom they had contacted who had been positive in SARS-CoV-2, provided satisfactory results.
Researchers working in the Italian city of Vo, where the first death occurred by COVID-19 in Italy, carried out two rounds of tests throughout the population of about 3400 inhabitants, with about ten days of difference.
About half of the people who had achieved positive results had no symptoms, and all cases detected were reported in forty.
With the restriction of travel in the municipality, this completely eliminated new infections.
With the intensive traceability of contacts, travel restrictions from abroad, testing and quarantine, the 2020 Coronavirus pandemic in Singapore has progressed much earlier than in other developed countries, but have not applied extreme restrictions such as the forced closure of restaurants and minority facilities.
Many events were canceled, and on March 28, Singapore began recommending residents staying in their homes, but schools were reopened shortly after the holiday on March 23.
Other countries have also controlled the pandemic with intensive tracking of contacts, travel restrictions from abroad, testing and 40, but with less stringent restrictions, such as Iceland and South Korea.
According to a statistical study, countries that have performed more tests, relative to the number of deaths, have lower literacy rates, probably because these countries have more capacity to detect people who only have mild or no symptoms.
WHO recommends that countries which do not have the capacity to carry out tests and which have national laboratories with limited experience in COVID-19 send their first five positive samples and their first ten negative samples for COVID-19 to one of the 16 WHO reference laboratories for confirmatory tests.
Of the 16 reference laboratories, 7 are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
In the following table, the "Possible as % of Tests" column is influenced by the country's test policy.
A country that only performs tests in people entering hospitals will have a higher number of positive as a percentage of evidence than a country that performs tests in all citizens, whether they show symptoms or not, the other issues are equal.
Hand washing, also known as hand hygiene, is the action to wash hands with a view to eliminating moisture, fat, microorganisms or other undesirable substances.
The wash of hands with jabon constantly in certain "critical moments" during the day prevents the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhoea and cholera, which are transmitted by facal-oral route.
People can also be infected with respiratory diseases, such as influenza or common cold, for example if they do not wash their hands before touching their eyes, nose or mouth (i.e. mucosal membranes).
The five critical moments during the day in which it is important to wash your hands with soap include: before and after the defection, after cleaning a child’s throat or changing your clothes, before feeding a child, before eating and before preparing or handling raw meat, fish or poultry meat.
If no water or soap is available, hands can be cleaned with censorship. The World Health Organization recommends washing hands:
Before, during and after preparing meals.
Before and after taking care of a sick person.
After changing clothes or cleaning a child who used the bathroom.
After smelling the nose, tossing or kicking.
After touching animals, food for animals or animal waste.
Medical hygiene concerns health practices related to medical procedures.
Washing hands before taking medicines or medical attention may prevent or minimize the spread of diseases.
The main medical purpose of hand washing is to remove pathogens (bacterials, viruses or other microorganisms that may cause a disease) and chemicals that may cause damage or disease.
This is particularly important for people who handle food or work in the medical field, but it is also an important practice for the general public.
Hand washing has many health benefits, including minimizing the spread of influenza, coronavirus and other infectious diseases; preventing the infectious causes of diarrhoea; reducing respiratory infections;
and reduce the rate of child mortality in children at home.
A study conducted in 2013 showed that improvements in hand washing practices can result in small improvements in growth in children under five years of age.
In developing countries, infant mortality rates related to respiratory and diarrheic diseases can be reduced by introducing simple changes in behavior, such as washing hands with soap.
This simple action can reduce the mortality rate by almost 50% of these diseases.
Interventions that promote hand washing can reduce diarrhoea episodes in approximately one third, and this is similar to providing drinking water in low-income areas.
The 48% reduction in diarrhoea episodes can be related to hand washing with apples. Hand washing with apples is the most effective and economic way of preventing acute diarrhoea and respiratory infections, such as automatic behaviour adopted in homes, schools and communities around the world.
The neuron, an important acute respiratory disease, is the main cause of mortality in children under five years of age, and lives of an estimated 1.8 million children per year are spent.
Diarrhoea and pneumonia together represent nearly 3.5 million child deaths per year.
According to UNICEF, turning hand washing with apples before eating and after using the bath into a dried habit can save more lives than any vaccine or medical intervention, which would reduce almost half the deaths per day and to a quarter of the deaths due to acute respiratory infections.
In general, hand washing is integrated with other hygiene interventions as part of water, sanitation and hygiene programmes (WASH).
Hand washing also protects against impetuousness, which is transmitted through direct physical contact.
A small harmful effect of hand washing is that its frequent performance can cause cutaneous damage due to the resurgence of the skin.
According to a Danish study conducted in 2012, excessive hand washing can cause a skin injury that causes pizza and makes the skin become known as an eczema of hands or dermatitis, which is particularly common in health workers.
Too common hand washing is also considered one of the symptoms of constipative obsessive disorder (TOC).
There are five critical moments during the day when hand washing with apples is important to reduce the oral-fetal transmission of diseases: after using the bath (orientation, defect), after cleaning a child’s neck (change clothes), before feeding a child, before eating and/or preparing or handling raw meat, fish or poultry meat.
Other occasions where a proper hand washing technique should be used to prevent the transmission of diseases include before and after treating a cut or wound; after swallowing, tossing or swallowing the nose; after touching animal waste or handling animals; and after touching garbage.
In many countries there is a low rate of hand washing with apples.
A study on hand washing in 54 countries conducted in 2015 concluded that, on average, 38.7% of families practiced hand washing with apples. A study conducted in 2014 indicated that Saudi Arabia had a higher rate of 97%; the United States was about half a 77%; and China had a lower rate of 23%. Currently, there are several methods for changing behavior, to increase the adoption of hand washing with apples at critical times. The grouping of children in school at certain times of the day is an option in developing countries to incorporate hand washing into children’s behavior.
The "Effective Health Care Programme" implemented by the Department of Education of the Philippines is an example of action to promote children's health and education.
Disappearing twice a year, in addition to washing hands with soap every day, brushing teeth daily with fluorinated, is the basis of this national program.
It has also been implemented successfully in Indonesia.
The elimination of skin micro-organisms improves by adding Japan’s or deterging water.
The main action of Japanese and miners is to reduce barriers to solution and increase solubility.
Only water is ineffective to clean the skin because fats and proteins, which are components of organic matter, are not easily dissolved into water.
However, a reasonable flow of water facilitates cleaning.
The solid apple, due to its reusable nature, can contain bacteria acquired in previous uses.
Some studies that analyzed the transfer of contaminated solid iron bacteria concluded that the transfer is unlikely, as bacteria are injected with foam.
However, the CDC states that "the liquid japon is preferable with disposal controls that do not involve the use of the hands".
The antibacterial jabeons have been actively promoted to a conscious public of health.
At present, there is no evidence that the recommended disinfectants or antiseptics are used to store antibiotics resistant by nature.
However, antibacterial jabeons contain common antibacterial agents, such as triclosan, which have an extensive list of resistant organisms.
Thus, although antibacterial jabeons do not preserve antibiotics resistant strains, they may not be as effective as they are promoted.
In addition to the surfactant agent and protecting the skin, sophisticated formulas can contain acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid) as well as pH regulator, benzoic acid with antimicrobial activity and more conditions for the skin (a true alee, vitamins, mental, vegetal extracts). An extensive analysis of the University of Oregon School of Public Health indicated that common jabonies are as effective as the antibacterial jabonies for the consumer that contain triclosan to prevent disease and eliminate the bacteria of the hands.
The pleasant hot water to wash hands is not enough to remove bacteria.
The bacteria grow much faster at body temperature (37 °C).
However, Japanese water is more efficient than frozen Japanese water to remove natural oils that retain soil and bacteria.
However, contrary to popular belief, scientific studies have shown that the use of tibia water has no effect on the reduction of the microbian load in the hands.
A hand disinfectant or an antiseptic for hands is a waterless agent for hand hygiene.
At the end of 1990 and in the first part of the 21st century, workers for non-waterless and alcohol-free hygiene (also known as an alcohol-based solution, antiseptic solution for hand washing or hand disinfectants) began to acquire popularity.
The majority is based on isopropyl alcohol or ethanol formulated with a heavy agent such as carbon (acrylic acid polymer) in a gel, or a inhibitor like glycerin in a liquid, or foam for easy use and to reduce the effect of alcohol resurgence.
Adding diluted hydrogen peroxide increases antimicrobial activity. Hand disinfectants containing between 60 and 95% of alcohol at least eliminate germs effectively.
Alcohol-based disinfectants remove bacteria, bacteria resistant to various medicines (SARM and ERV), tuberculosis and some viruses (including HIV, herpes, VSR, renovirus, vaccine, influenza and hepatitis) and dogs.
Alcohol-based disinfectants containing 70 % alcohol remove 99.97 % (a reduction of 3.5 logarithms, similar to a reduction of 35 decibels) of bacteria in the hands 30 seconds after application and 99.99 % (a reduction of 4 to 5 logarithms) of bacteria in the hands 1 minute after application. Hand disinfectants are more effective against bacteria and less effective against certain viruses.
Alcohol-based disinfectants are practically ineffective against the norovirus virus (or Norwalk), the most common cause of infectious gastroenteritis. adequate antiseptic or alcohol-based solution should be used to freeze or cover both hands.
The palm and the back of both hands, between the fingers and the limbs of each finger, are flushed for about 30 seconds until the liquid, foam or ice is dried.
The fingerpoints should also be washed well, spraying them in both arms. The U.S. Control and Disease Prevention Centres recommend washing hands before hand disinfectants wash their hands, especially when their hands are visiblely dry.
The increase in the use of these agents is based on their ease of use and rapid action to eliminate micro-organisms; however, they should not be used as replacement for adequate washing of hands unless water or soap is available.
The frequent use of alcohol-based disinfectants may dry the skin unless emulsants or hydrants are added to the formula.
The effect of alcohol degradation may be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin or other emulsions to the formula.
In clinical trials, alcohol-based disinfectants containing emulents caused a much lower irritation and dryness of the skin than Japanese or antimicrobial detectors.
Allergic dermatitis by contact, contact urticaria syndrome or alcohol hypersensitivity or the additives present in alcohol-based solutions are very rare.
The minor tendency to cause irritant dermatitis by contact was attractive compared to washing hands with water and jaboon.
Despite its effectiveness, waterless agents do not remove organic matter from their hands, but simply disinfect them.
For this reason, hand disinfectants are not as effective as water and soap to prevent the spread of many pathogens, since pathogens remain in their hands.
The effectiveness of alcohol-free disinfectants depends to a large extent on the ingredients and formula, as well as historically, has been much smaller than alcohol and alcohol-based solutions to freeze.
More recently, formulas using Benzalconium chloride have a persistent and cumulative antimicrobial activity after application, unlike alcohol, which decreases after repeated use, probably due to progressive skin reactions.
Many people in low-income communities can't buy apples and use instead of censorship or land.
Censors or land may be more efficient than water alone, but less efficient than apples.
One concern is that if soil or cenus are contaminated with microorganisms, this can increase the spread of diseases instead of reducing them.
Like the japanese, censorship is also a disinfectant agent, since, in contact with water, it forms an alkaline solution.
WHO recommended using censorship or arena as an alternative to japanese when there is no japanese.
The correct washing technique recommended by the U.S. Control and Disease Prevention Centres to prevent the transmission of diseases includes the following steps:
Wash your hands with running water tibia or cold.
The current water is recommended because sealed water containers can be contaminated, while the water temperature seems to be no different.
Wash your hands to form foam with a generous amount of jab, including the hands drop, between your fingers and below your cheeks.
The apple removes the germs of the skin, and studies indicate that people often wash their hands more gently when they use apples than when they use water alone.
Repeat for at least 20 seconds.
Restricting creates friction, which helps to eliminate skin germs, and restricting for longer periods removes more germs.
Swallow well with current water.
Injury in a container can be contaminated by the hands again.
Dry with a clean towel or leave it dry in the air.
The wet and soft hands become more easily contaminated. The most frequently forgotten parts are the thumb, the mucus, the areas between the fingers and under the windows.
Artificial grapes and the esmelling of discarded grapes can accommodate micro-organisms.
It is often recommended that wet lotion be avoided by hand washing; dry skin can cause cutten damage that may increase the risk of transmission of infections.
Several economic options can be used to facilitate the washing of hands when there is no current water or jaboon, for example, to pour water from a wet pool or a cyclists with suitable alternatives or use censorship if necessary in developing countries. In situations where there is a limited supply of water (such as schools or rural areas in developing countries), there are solutions to store water, such as "home flues" and other economic options.
A home flu is a simple technology consisting of using a suspended rod of a snake and a leg-operated palm to turn a small amount of water over the hands and an apple in a bar.
The effective drying of hands is an essential part of the process of hand hygiene, but there is a certain debate on the form of more effective drying in public baths.
More and more research is showing that paper towels are much more hygienic than electric hand dryers that are found in many bathrooms.
In 2008, Westminster University, London, conducted a study sponsored by the European Tissue Symposium paper to compare the levels of hygiene offered by paper towels, hot air dryers and more modern air dryers.
After washing and drying hands with the hot air dryer, it was found that the total number of bacteria increased, on average, 194 % in the teeth and 254 % in the palms.
Drying with the air dryer resulted in an average increase in the total number of bacteria by 42% in the teeth and 15% in the palms.
After washing and drying hands with a paper tool, the total number of bacteria decreased, on average, by 76% in fingernails and 77% in palm trees. Scientists also performed tests to determine whether there was the possibility of cross contamination by other users of the bathroom and the bathroom as a result of each type of drying method.
The air dryer, which aired from the unit at speeds, is said to be 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), managed to supply the micro-organisms of the hands and the unit and, potentially, to other users of the bathroom and the bathroom environment up to 2 metres away.
The use of a hot air dryer promoted micro-organisms up to 0.25 metres away from the dryer.
Paper towels did not show a significant spread of microorganisms. In 2005, in a study conducted by TÜV Protod und Umelt, different hand drying methods were evaluated.
The following changes were observed in the bacterium account after hand drying:
There are many manufacturers of different hand dryers, and hand dryers have been compared to dryers with paper towels.
Washing hands with disinfecting towels for hands is an alternative during travel, when no water or soap is available.
The alcohol-based disinfectant must contain at least 60 % of alcohol.
The washing of doctors became very mandatory after Hungarian doctor Ignaz Semmelweis discovered its effectiveness (in 1846) to prevent diseases in a hospital environment.
There are electronic devices that provide comments to remind members of hospital staff who wash their hands when they forget.
A study showed a decrease in infection rates with its use.
The washing of the hands of doctors is done for at least 15 seconds, with plenty of water and jabon or gel to form foam and restrict all parts of the hands.
Hands should be restricted together by interlacing the fingers.
If there are remains under the grapes, a kernel can be used to remove them.
Since germs can stay in the water in their hands, it is important to wash them well and dry them with a clean toilet.
After drying, paper towels should be used to close the water (and open any exit door if necessary).
This prevents your hands from being contaminated by these surfaces again.
The purpose of hand washing in the medical care environment is to eliminate pathogenous microorganisms ("Germans") and avoid transmission.
According to the New England Journal of Medicine, the shortage of hand washing continues to exist at unacceptable levels in most medical environments, where many doctors and nurses usually forget to wash their hands before touching patients and thus transmit microorganisms.
A study showed that the correct washing of hands and other simple procedures may reduce the rate of blood flow infections related to catheter in 66%. The World Health Organization has published a paper showing the washing of hands and washing of standard hands in medical care sectors.
The preliminary version of the organization's manual for manual hygiene can also be found on its website so that the public can comment.
Whitby and others carried out a relevant review.
Commercial devices may measure and verify the hygiene of hands if evidence of compliance is required.
The World Health Organization has "Five moments" for hand washing:
after exposure to blood or body fluids
before an asceptive work and
After treating patients, the combination of antiseptic chemicals in the jabon (jabones "medicine" or "antibacterial") entrusts it with the possibility of elimination to the hand washing agent.
This removal may be necessary before surgery or in environments where the antibiotic resistant organisms are very common. To wash your hands before surgery, you need to count with a flu that can be opened and closed without touching it with your hands, a little chlorhexidine or iodine for washing, sterile towels to dry your hands after washing, a sterilized cap to cool your hands and another sterilized instrument to clean up under the grapes.
All joys must be removed.
This procedure requires washing the hands and fronts up to the neck for 2 to 6 minutes.
You don't need to wash for a long time (10 minutes).
When injecting, it must be avoided that the water of the front lines returns to its hands.
After washing, hands dry with a sterilized bread and a surgical bat is placed.
To reduce the spread of germs, it is better to wash your hands or use an antiseptic for hands before and after treating sick people.
In order to control infections caused by staphylococococcal in hospitals, it has been verified that the maximum benefit of hand cleaning is in the first 20% of washroom and that very little additional benefit is obtained when the frequency of hand hygiene increases by more than 35%.
The washout with common jabone results in more than one third of the incidence of bacterial infections transmitted to food compared to the washout with antibacterial jabone. By comparing the washing of hands with an alcohol-based solution with the washing of hands with an antibacterial jabon for an average period of 30 seconds in each case, it was observed that the alcohol fractate reduced by 26 % to the contamination of bacteria than the antibacterial apple.
However, water and jaundice are more effective to reduce H1N1 influenza virus and Clostridium spores difficult of hands than alcohol-based disinfectants. Measures to improve the hygiene of hands in health care centres can include training staff on hand washing, increasing availability of alcohol-based disinfectants and written and oral reminders to staff.
More research is needed on which of these interventions are the most effective in the different health care environments.
In developing countries, hand washing with soap is considered an economic and fundamental tool for achieving good health and even good nutrition.
However, the lack of a reliable supply of water, soap or facilities to wash hands in homes, schools and places of work makes it a challenge to achieve universal washing conduct.
For example, in most rural areas of Africa, there are very few calls to wash your hands around public or private holidays, although there are economic options to build hand washing stations.
However, the low wash rates of hands can also be the result of prolonged habits and not of lack of soap or water.
Promoting hand washing with apples can influence policy decisions, increase awareness of the benefits of hand washing and cause long-term behavioural changes in the population.
In order for this to work effectively, it is necessary to follow up and evaluate.
In a systematic review of 70 studies, it was observed that community approaches are effective to increase the washing of hands in the PRBM, while social marketing campaigns are less effective. An example of promoting the washing of hands in schools is UNICEF's "Three Stars" approach, which encourages schools to take simple and economic measures to ensure that students wash their hands with soap, including hygiene requirements.
When minimum standards are reached, schools can pass from one to three stars, finally.
The construction of hand washing stations can be part of the promotion campaigns for hand washing that are taking place in order to reduce child diseases and mortality.
The World Day of Manos Lavender is another example of awareness campaign that seeks to achieve a change in behavior. As a result of the 2019-2020 Coronavirus pandemic, UNICEF has promoted the creation of an emoji for hand washing.
Few studies have considered the overall profitability of hand washing in developing countries in relation to avoided AVADs.
However, an analysis indicates that promoting the washing of hands with soap is much more effective than other water and sanitation interventions.
The importance of hand washing for human health, in particular for people in vulnerable circumstances, such as mothers who just gave light or soldiers to hospitals, was recognized for the first time in the mid- twentieth century by two of the pioneers of manual hygiene: Hungarian doctor Ignaz Semmelweis, who worked in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, English, the "founder of modern nursing".
At that time, most people still believed that infections were caused by unpleasant tears called miasmas.
In the 1980s, food-borne disease outbreaks and health-care-related infections led the U.S. Disease Control and Prevention Centres to promote more active hands hygiene as an important way to prevent the spread of infections.
The flu outbreak in 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 made many countries more aware of the importance of washing hands with soap to protect themselves from these infectious diseases.
For example, in Germany, maps were placed with "correct techniques to wash hands" along the public bathrooms and bathrooms of office and airport buildings.
The phrase "to wash your hands" is a statement that you do not want to be responsible for something or to share the complexity of something.
It has its origin in the Bible passage of Matthew in which Pontius Pilate laid his hands before the decision to cross Jesus Christ, but has become a much broader term of use in some English communities.
In Shakespeare's Macbeth, Lady Macbeth began to wash her hands in a conscious attempt to clean up an imaginary weakness, which represented her guilt over the crimes she had committed and which had induced her husband to commit.
It has also been observed that after remembering or reflecting on non-ethical actions, people tend to wash their hands more often than others and tend to appreciate more elements for hand washing.
In addition, those persons who have been allowed to wash their hands after such reflection are less likely to engage in other "cleanliness" compensatory actions, such as a volunteer.
Religions recommend washing hands with hygienic and symbolic purposes. The washing of symbolic hands, with water, but without jabion, is part of the washing of ritual hands in many religions, such as Buddhism, Hinduism, the Tevila and the Netillat Yadayim in Judaism, the washing in Christianity and the Jews in Islam. Religions also recommend washing of hygienic hands, especially after certain actions.
Hinduism, Judaism and Islam are forced to wash their hands after going to the bathroom.
And Hinduism, Buddhism, Judaism, and Islam are forced to wash their hands before and after each meal.
Risk controls at work before COVID-19
Risk control at work before COVID-19 refers to the application of occupational hygiene and safety methodologies in risk control for the prevention of coronary virus 2019 (COVID-19).
The appropriate risk controls at the workplace depend on the workplace and the workplace and are based on a risk assessment of exposure sources, the severity of the disease in the community and the risk factors of workers who may be likely to acquire COVID-19.
According to the U.S. Department of Safety and Occupational Health (OSHA), jobs with fewer exposure risk have minimal working contact with the public and workers, for which basic infections prevention measures are recommended, including hand washing, the recommendation that workers stay at home if they are ill, respiratory hygiene standards and maintenance of a clean and clean working environment.
Medium exposure risk work includes those in which frequent or close contact is required with persons who are not known or suspected to have COVID-19 but who may be infected by current Community transmission or by an international journey.
This includes workers who are in contact with the general public, such as in schools, working environments with a lot of people and some large-scale retailing environments.
Risk controls for this group, in addition to basic infection prevention measures, include ventilation with high-efficiency air filters, protective covers and individual protection equipment available if there is a person with COVID-19.
The OSCE considers that workers of health care and funeral services, exposed to people who are known or suspected to have COVID-19, have a high risk of exposure, which increases to very high if they conduct procedures that can generate aerosals in persons who are known or suspected to have COVID-19 or take or manipulate samples of these persons.
The appropriate risk controls for these workers include engineering controls, such as negative-pressure ventilation rooms, and individual protection equipment suitable for work.
COVID-19 bridges can have several consequences in the workplace.
Workers may lack work because they are sick, because they have to care for others or because they are afraid of possible exposure.
It is possible that trade patterns change, both in respect of what goods are requested and the means of purchasing those goods (such as buying in hours that are not picky, by means of domestic shipping services or by winding-up from the car).
Finally, shipments of articles from areas severely affected by COVID-19 could be interrupted. A plan of preparation and response to infectious diseases can be used to guide preventive measures.
The plans address the levels of risk related to various workplaces and work activities, including exposure sources, risk factors arising from domestic and community environments and individual workers' risk factors such as age or chronic medical injuries.
They also describe the necessary controls to address these risks and contingent plans for situations that could arise as a result of the outbreaks.
Preparation and response plans for infectious diseases may be subject to national or regional recommendations.
Among the objectives of the response to a broken down include reducing transmission among staff members, protecting people who are more likely to suffer from adverse health problems, maintaining trade operations and minimizing adverse effects in other entities of their supply chain.
The severity of the disease in the community in which the company is located affects the measures taken.
The risk control hierarchy is a widely used framework for occupational hygiene and safety to classify risk control according to its effectiveness.
If the risks of COVID-19 cannot be eliminated, the most effective controls are engineering controls followed by administrations and, finally, individual protection equipment.
Engineering controls involve insinuating employees of the risks associated with work without resorting to the behaviour of workers and can be the most profitable solution to implementation.
Administrative controls are changed in working policies or procedures which require action by the employer or employer.
Individual protection teams are considered to be less effective than engineering and administrative controls, but they can help prevent some exposures.
All types of individual protection equipment shall be selected according to the hazard to the worker, placed as appropriate (e.g. breathing), used properly and systematically, reviewed frequently, received maintenance, replaced if necessary and cleansed, cleaned and stored or disposed of correctly to avoid contamination.
According to the U.S. Department of Occupational Health and Security (OSHA), work with less exposure risk has minimal working contact with the public and working partners.
Basic infections prevention measures that are recommended for all workplaces include deep and frequent hand washing, the recommendation that workers stay at home if they are sick, respiratory hygiene standards that include tossing and drying, the provision of paper panels and containers for wastes, the preparation for work or scheduled shifts if necessary, the refusal of workers to use tools and equipment and maintenance of a clean and clean working environment.
The immediate identification and isolation of persons who may be infected is a fundamental measure to protect workers, clients, visitors and others at work.
The Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend that employees with acute respiratory disease symptoms stay in their homes until they stop having fever, fever signs and any other symptoms during at least 24 hours without taking medication to relieve symptoms or reduce fever; that disease licensing policies are flexible and allow employees to stay at home to care for a sick family member, and that employees know these policies.
According to OHA, work at average exposure risk includes those who require frequent or close contact at least six feet (1.8 m) with persons who are not known or suspected to have COVID-19 but who may have been infected by SARS-CoV-2 due to the Community transmission of the time around the company's location, or because the person has recently made an international trip to a place with generalised COVID-19 transmission.
These include workers who are in contact with the general public, such as in schools, working environments with a lot of people's attention and some minor sales environments of large size. Engineering controls for this group and higher risk groups include the installation of high-efficiency air filters, the increase in ventilation rates, the installation of physical barriers such as transparent plastic covers and the placing of a valve for the care service. The administrative controls for this group and the higher risk groups include recommending that workers remain at home, replace meetings by virtual communications, that they are no longer confined to their wheelchairs.
Workers in this risk group must rarely use breathing.
If a person is sick on a plane, appropriate controls to protect workers and other passengers include separating the sick person from the other person at a distance of 6 feet, appointing a member of the crew to approach the sick person and offering him a mask to the sick person or asking him to cover his mouth and nose with paper panels when he is tossing or shaking.
Cabin crews should use non-sustainable surgical gloves to treat a sick passenger or to touch potentially contaminated body fluids or surfaces and, perhaps, individual protective equipment if the sick passenger has fever, your persistence or difficulty breathing.
Gloves and other waste items must be disposed of in a bag for dangerous biological residues and contaminated surfaces must be cleaned and disinfected later. In the case of commercial navigation, such as cruisers and other passenger ships, risk controls include post-marketing, self-insuring and immediately informing the medical center of the presence of fever or other symptoms while on board.
In the case of schools and child care centres, CDCs recommend short-term closure to clean or disinfect if an infected person was in school building, regardless of Community transmission.
When Community transmission is minimal or moderate, social distance strategies can be implemented, such as canceling excursions, assemblies and other mass meetings, such as physical education classes or choirs or meals in the dining room, increasing room space between the dopeters, scaling in and out hours, limiting non-essential visits and using a separate place for children with flu-like symptoms.
When there is a significant transmission in the local community, in addition to social distance strategies, there may be considered to be the cancellation of classes. For police personnel carrying out daily routine activities, the CDC considers that immediate health risk is low.
Officers of the police forces are advised to contact persons who have a confirmed diagnosis or COVID-19 suspects who follow the same rates as emergency medical personnel, including the use of personal protection equipment.
If there is close contact during a detention, workers shall clean and disinfect their work belt and equipment with an aerosol or household cleaning toilets before re-use them and follow the standard operating procedure for the contents and disposal of the personnel protection equipment and the contents and washing of clothing.
The OSCE considers that certain health workers and nurses are within high or very high exposure risk categories.
Among the high-risk exposure work are those of delivery workers, support, laboratory and medical transport who are exposed to patients with confirmed diagnosis or suspected COVID-19.
They become very high exposure risk work if workers conduct aerosol generation procedures in patients with confirmed diagnosis or COVID-19 suspects or take or manipulate samples of these patients.
Some procedures for the generation of aerosols are intubation, induction procedures for you, bronchoscopyes, some dental procedures and examinations or invasive sampling.
High-risk exposure morning work includes those in which workers are involved in the preparation of the bodies of people who had COVID-19 or who were suspected of having it at the time of death; they pass a very high risk of exposure if they commit autopsies. Additional engineering controls for these risk groups include insulation rooms for patients with confirmed diagnosis or suspected COVID-19, even when they are undergoing aerosol generation procedures.
The specialised ventilation with negative pressure may be appropriate in some areas of medical care and breastfeeding.
Samples should be manipulated by taking Biosafety Level 3.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that patients entering different waiting rooms be separated depending on whether they are suspected or not to have COVID-19. In addition to other types of personal protection equipment, OSHA recommends the use of masks for those people who work up to 6 feet of patients who have been infected or suspected of being infected by SARS-CoV-2 and for those who carry out aerosol generation procedures.
In the United States, N95 breathers with a filter mask approved by NISH or above should be used in the context of a written comprehensive respiratory programme including tests of medical adjustment, training and examinations.
Other types of mascarillas can provide more protection and improve the worker's comfort. WHO does not recommend the use of protective monies, since COVID-19 is a respiratory disease, not one transmitted by body fluids.
WHO only recommends the use of a surgical mask for the classification staff of patients entering.
For those who take respiratory samples from patients with COVID-19, they pay attention or carry them without conducting aerosol generation procedures, WHO recommends the use of surgical masks, gauzes or facial protector, bats and gloves.
If an aerosol generation procedure is performed, the surgical mascarilla should be replaced by a N95 or FFP2 respiratory tract.
Given that the provision of personal protection equipment is insufficient, WHO recommends minimizing the need to use them, replacing them by telemedicine, physical barriers such as transparent windows, limiting access to the room of a patient with COVID-19 only to those involved in its direct attention, the use of the same mask without withdrawing it while providing attention to several patients with the same diagnosis, monitoring and coordination of the supply chain of personal protection equipment and encouraging the use of masks by asymetics.

ASSESSMENT: [Covid-19] Lighten up the load and prepare us for the future
DATE/RENEWAL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES: 14 March 2020, 00:24 h, universal time coordinated
Licension: CC0: No reserved rights
This month, we are in unique circumstances.
The COVID-19 epidemic highlights our global human interconnection and the responsibilities we have with each other.
The challenges presented do not have before them, but we know that our best response to empathy, cooperation and overall Community construction is consistent with the core of this organization.
The friendship and concern we have seen among all our colleagues in e-mails, calls and conversations is a great validation of how incredible the people we have been able to work with.
I couldn't feel more gratitude and pride than all of you were my friends.
Last week someone shared with me the appreciation she felt for our work.
They reminded me of how important it is for the world to be able to reach Wikipedia at this time and the powerful symbol that is the fact that this critical resource remains online and available to all.
His work makes this possible, whether by keeping the sites in operation, helping our partners to get their pay or to keep our communities safe.
The world needs the information Wikipedia provides today more than ever.
This is a moment when not only do what we do but the way we do it will have a profound effect on the world.
Because of the importance of this mission and its role in this, from this coming week, we will make some important adjustments to the way we work together.
Adjustments to our work and our timetables
As Robyn mentioned earlier, team C met last night to talk about our approach and our timetable for the next few days and months.
In this discussion, we consider what we thought would be an appropriate response to what we are facing and which would be the best way to maintain the organization's sustainability at this time.
To a greater extent, we wanted to eliminate stress and support our long-term mission.
If you need to reduce the speed, it's okay.
For all staff, contractors and contract workers:
our daily work expectations will be about 4 hours per day or 20 hours per week, until next warning.
We are not declaring a holiday; if you can work in a more normal hour, this would be of great benefit to the mission.
However, the world is an indispensable place now, and whether you have to care for your loved ones, buy or go to the doctor, our priority is your well-being.
We're not taking account of your hours.
If she's sick, don't work.
Although we shouldn't have to say it, we say it.
It is not necessary to ask for permission for disease or free time paid; just report to your manager and help your team review the calendars and timetables to ensure that key areas of work are covered.
(If you receive a positive diagnosis of COVID-19, advise Bryan, T&C Operations, that T&C can help with support and ensure that the management is both in its situation).
People who work for hours will receive the full payment.
As we have said, we renewed our commitment to our contractors and staff members working on time.
All will be paid on the basis of their normal working hours under normal circumstances.
This also applies if he is sick and can't work.
If he wants to work, he has our support.
Many people use work as a way to channel their stress with the world around us.
What we do can be incredibly thankful, especially in these times.
Again, this is about your personal care.
What we ask is that they communicate with their manager so that we know what to expect and we can adapt correctly.
Some work is considered essential.
There are some things we need to keep doing.
The Trusted Site Engineering Teams, Human Resources Operations, Trust and Security and Fund Recovery, among others, carry out critical work that may require additional support.
We will start a process with all departments to assess the current objectives and modify our approach in order to support what is essential for our mission.
There are enough tasks for all of us; the only difference is that we will all focus on the most important projects.
To reduce the speed this day won't hurt us tomorrow.
We don't plan on "double the hours to put us on the day" when the pandemic is over.
It will not be expected to work extra hours to meet deadlines that are no longer realistic.
We accept that circumstances have changed and we will work to set new targets and deadlines when appropriate.
What happens to the APP, or Annual Planning?
To adjust us to our new reality and expectations of daily working hours, we plan to adjust the timetable for the delivery of our Annual Planning 2020-2021.
Our intention is to propose an extension of our 2019-2020 plan which devotes more time to the budget so that employees can prioritize critical work, personal care and care of loved ones while we adapt to the needs of those who need or wish to work with a reduced time in the coming weeks.
This extension of our timetable significantly reduces current planning and pressure loads across the organization.
We will present our proposal to the Council next week and will inform the delegations and teams only of the next steps we will have confirmation.
Thanks to the APP team for its leadership in this situation.
State, exhibition and cleaning of the office
Last week we realized that one of our colleagues at San Francisco's office could have been exposed to COVID-19 virus.
However, as a precautionary measure, we hired an antiviral cleaning team to disinfect all areas of San Francisco's office.
They used an antiviral solution for hospital use to disinfect all surfaces, in addition to the reception and lifters that go to our room.
The building has adopted its own duty-care protocol using products that support the safety of its employees.
We are confident that the office will be well prepared when we decide to return.
Our DC office is in a WeWork, which has shared its protocol for COVID-19 with us and all staff members in DC offices.
Since last week, our DC office has transferred its operations to a completely remote environment in accordance with the rates shared with San Francisco.
As some of our friends in New York City already know, we also talked about renting a place in Brooklyn.
These discussions are still underway, but they may be delayed.
Some of our fellow workers work remotely for the first time.
Our colleagues who have been working in a remote way since then know that this mode requires adaptation, so they provide the following suggestions:
Limits the duration of meetings to intervals of one or two hours as maximum.
If longer sessions are required, consider how to section them over the course of several days.
clearly defines the meeting with a list of topics and sends reading material with anticipation.
Use the video by default, using tools such as Google Docs and Zoom to facilitate live collaboration and connection.
Designs a leader to moderate each meeting, a person who controls questions in the chat and list of speakers, and someone who helps take notes (or takes notes in collaboration).
Send an e-mail message to technical support if you need some comfortable earrics.
Use the refund of well-being for refrigerators.
Join #remoties channel in Slack to talk to your peers about distributed work
The RR. HH. Operation Team is analysing rates on ergonomics based on web seminars to support the increase in the work distributed throughout the Foundation.
Last week we asked all beneficiaries of Community grants to cancel public events funded by Wikimedia, such as the editorials, until WHO declared the end of the pandemic.
We informed you that we understood that our request for cancellations and other restrictions could hinder the fulfilment of its part of the activities agreed for the grant and that there would be no penalty for continuing or modifying those objectives.
Next week we will follow up with additional rates in Wikimania and other Community and regional thematic conferences.
The general feeling of the community at the global level seems to be, in part, sadness over interruption and, in part, relief from the clarity and capacity to focus on its own communities, both Wikimedia and others.
In the future, CRT will be working to establish a page in Meta-Wiki in order to provide you with space to the community to monitor the impact and to follow up on our communications with them.
Keep in touch with COVID-19 issues
We will send you an invitation through your calendars for the next Thursday, 14:00 p.m., universal time coordinated 07:00 p.m., Pacific time for a special staff meeting.
We will take advantage of this opportunity to share additional news, answer their questions and spend time connecting each other.
We're together in this and we're available to help in the way we can.
Meanwhile, you can continue to find information about this e-mail message and all additional essential information related to COVID-19 in Office Wiki.
CRT will keep these updated pages and all information in one place.
We are also working to maintain regular communications with staff living in countries that are currently severely affected.
If you have any question about travel, events, an important workflow, some cover problem or anything you may need to help, do not hesitate to notify CRT and work with them.
We're here to help provide support and work as a link when necessary.
If they have confidential or sensitive matters, send an e-mail to Bryan Juden, Director of International Global Operations of RR. HH.
None of these changes should be regarded as leaving our work and our obligations.
Instead, it is a recognition that our work and our obligations are likely to be adapted in a way that has not yet happened.
These are the measures that we believe are necessary to support each other in order to continue working, to give our movement the necessary support and to provide the world with the service it trusts.
Our planned work will continue there for us when the time comes.
For now, it is time to support each other and take place for the important work that will come in the coming weeks and possibly in the coming months.
We need all of you to make this possible and therefore we need to take care of and care for their families so that they can be found in the best possible state when the need arises.
Now, please lift your hands and don't touch your face!
Katherine, CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M and Tony S) and the rest of the team of Leaderazgo (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janeen U, Lisa S, Robyn A, Ryan M and Toby N).
The converting enzyme of angiotensin 2 (ECA2) is an enzyme attached to the external surface (cell membranes) of the lungs, arteries, heart, kidneys and instincts.
ECA2 contravenes the activity of the associated angiotensin converting enzyme (ECA) by reducing the amount of angiotensin II and increasing angiotensin (1-7), which makes it a therapeutic diagnosis for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. ECA2 also serves as a starting point for certain coronary viruses.
The human version of the enzyme is generally called HECA2.
Angiotensin 2 converting enzyme is a metaloenzyme containing zinc and is located on the surface of endothelial cells and other types.
The ECA2 protein contains a N-terminal domain of peptidase M2 and a C-terminal carrier kidney amino acids.
ECA2 is a single-cell protein of type I, with its enzymaticly active domain exposed on the surface of lungs and other tissues.
ECA2's extracellular domain is eliminated from the transmembranal domain by another enzyme known as sedase and, as a result, the solvent protein is released in the blood stream and eventually excreted by the urine.
ECA2 is present in most organs: ECA2 is attached mainly to the cell membrane of type II pulmonary alveolar cells, to the enterocytes of the lactating stomach, to the venous and endothelial cells and to the blood cells of the lisso muscle of most organs.
The ECA2 Marn expression is also found in the cerebral cortex, the stratified body, the hypothalamus and the encephalic trunk.
The main function of ECA2 is to counter ECA.
ECA excavates angiotensin I hormone and forms angiotensin II, which is vasoconstrictive.
In turn, ECA2 expands the amino acid carboxylic terminal phenylalanine of angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolyses it to form vasodilator angiotensin (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ECA2 may also close several other peptides, including [des-Arg9]-bradiquine, aplin, neurotensin, dinorphine A and graine.
ECA2 also regulates the traffic of members of the SLC6A19 neutral amino acid carrier and has been associated with Hartnup's disease.
As transmembranal protein, ECA2 serves as the main entry point for certain coronavirus including HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (the virus that causes SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19).
More specifically, S1 protein binding of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 with ECA2 enzymatic domain on the cell surface results in endocytosis and virus transmission along with endosome enzymes within the cells.
This entry process also requires the preparation of S protein by the host's TMPRSSS2 protease, the inhibition of which is currently being investigated as possible therapy. This has led to certain assumptions that reducing ECA2 levels in cells may help to fight infection.
However , several professional associations and regulators have recommended continuing ECA and standard BRA inhibitor therapy .
A review with systematic metaanalysis published on 11 July 2012 found that "the use of ECA inhibitors was associated with a significant 34% reduction in the risk of neumonia compared to control cases".
In addition, "Neumonia risk is also reduced in patients who received treatment with ECA inhibitors and who had a higher risk of neumonia, in particular those with cerebrovascular accident and heart failure.
The use of ECA inhibitors was also associated with a reduction in the mortality associated with pneumonia, although the results were not so solid for the general risk of pneumonia".
Recombinant ECA2 (rhECA2) seems to be a new therapy for acute pulmonary injury and seems to improve pulmonary hemodynamics and oxygen saturation in the leukees with acute respiratory difficulty syndrome induced by lipolysaccharides.
The average life of rhECA2 in human beings is approximately 10 hours and the start of action is 30 minutes plus the 24-hour effect (length) transition.
Several findings suggest that rhECA2 could be a promising medicine for those people with intolerance to classical inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system (SRA inhibitors) or in diseases where the circulating angiotensin II is high. The infusion of rhECA2 was evaluated in clinical trials for the treatment of acute respiratory trouble syndrome.
The COVID-19 applications are software applications for mobile devices designed to assist with the tracking of contacts in response to the 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic, i.e. the process of identifying people ("contacts") who might have been in contact with a infected person.
Several applications were developed or proposed with official support from the Government in some territories and jurisdictions.
Several frameworks have been developed for the creation of contact tracking applications.
Privacy concerns have been raised, in particular with regard to systems based on the tracking of the geographical location of the users of the application.
There are less invasive alternatives, such as using Bluetooth signals to record a user's proximity to other mobile phones.
On 10 April 2020, Apple and Google announced jointly that they would integrate the functionality to approve such applications based on Bluetooth directly on their iOS and Android operating systems.
In China, the Chinese government, together with Afaha, has implemented an application that allows citizens to check whether they have been in contact with people with COVID-19.
It is already in use in more than 200 Chinese cities. In Singapore an application called TraceTogether is being used.
The application was developed by a local TI community, launched as an open code application and will be granted to the Government. In Northern Macedonia a "StopKorona!" application based on Bluetooth was launched to track exposure to potentially infected persons and provide a quick response to health authorities.
The application was developed by the Ministry of Communication and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
On 14 April 2020, the application was waiting for the approval of Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
On 12 April, the Government informed that the communication tracking application was in an advanced development phase and would be available for its implementation in the coming weeks. A similar application was planned in Ireland and France ("StopCovid").
Both Australia and New Zealand are considering applications based on the TraceTogether application and the BlueTrace protocol of Singapore. Russia plans to introduce a geoperimetry application for patients living in Moscow and have received a COVID-19 diagnosis designed to ensure that they do not leave their homes.
Ross Anderson, professor of Cambridge University Security Engineering, presented several practical problems with application-based systems, including positive errors and possible lack of effectiveness if the application is limited to a small part of the population.
In response to concerns about the spread of misleading or harmful "coronavirus" applications, Apple limited the types of organizations that can add coronavirus-related applications in its App Store to "official" or trust-only organizations.
Google and Amazon have implemented similar restrictions.
Privacy defenders expressed their concern about the effects of massive surveillance through the applications of coronavirus and in particular whether the infrastructure created to deal with the coronavirus pandemic will be detonated once the threat occurs.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations submitted a communication to require limits to this type of surveillance.
The organizations established eight conditions for government projects:
monitoring should be "legal, necessary and proportionate";
monitoring and monitoring extensions should have exclusion clauses;
the use of data should be limited to objectives related to COVID-19;
security and anonymity should be protected and there should be evidence of such protection;
digital surveillance should avoid exacerbating discrimination and marginalisation;
any exchange of data with third parties should be defined in the laws;
protection against abuse should be implemented and citizens' rights should be established to respond to such abuse;
The significant participation of all " relevant stakeholders", including public health experts and marginalized groups, will be required. The Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Without Frontiers (Reporter ohne Grenzen, RSF) of Germany also published control lists.
The proposed plan by Google/Apple aims to address the problem of persistent monitoring by withdrawing the tracking mechanism of its operating systems when no longer required.
In some countries, a network-based tracking was used, instead of applications, which eliminated both the need to download an application and the ability to avoid tracking.
In Israel, network-based tracking was approved.
Network-based solutions that have access to gross location data present potential problems of significant privacy.
However, it is not necessary for all systems with central servers to have access to personal location data; several privacy protection systems have been created that use central servers only for communication (see section below).
In South Korea, a system was used which is not based on an application to carry out the trace of contacts.
Instead of using a specific application, the system collected trace information from various sources, including mobile tracking data and credit card transaction data, and combined them to generate warnings through text messages for potentially infected persons.
In addition to using this information to alert potential contacts, the Government has also made information on the location available to the public, which is allowed due to major changes in the privacy laws of the post-MERS in that country.
This information is available to the public through various applications and websites. Some countries, including Germany, considered using centralised and privacy protection systems.
On 6 April 2020, details have not yet been published.
The trace of contacts with privacy protection is a well-established concept, with a large number of published research that is at least up to 2013. On 7 April 2020, more than a dozen groups of experts were working on privacy-related solutions, such as the use of low-energy Bluetooth (BLE) to record a user's proximity to other mobile phones.
However, PEPP-PT is a coordinated effort that contains both centralised and non-centralised approaches and is not a single protocol. Decentralised protocols include decentralised proximity tracking to preserve privacy (DP-PPT/DP-3T), temporary contact numbers (TCN, previously known as contact numbers, CEN) and protocols and mechanisms for mobile communications tracking for privacy protection (PACT), among others.
In these protocols, personal identification data are never out of the device, and all matching occurs on the device.
The MIT Media Lab Privacy Group has been developing SafePaths, a platform for the use of techniques that protect privacy when collecting and using location data or route intersection to track the spread of COVID-19.
It is based on a study of the technical report "Applications Without Control: How to Maintain Personal Privacy During an epidemic", published in March 2020. Another similar effort is the SafeTrace platform of Enigma MPC, a company that develops privacy technologies that was also originally based on MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrace uses secure hardware technologies that allow its users to share sensitive location and health data with other users and staff, without compromising the privacy of such data.
On 5 April 2020, several groups united about what was essentially the same approach and with highly appropriate protocols formed the World TCN Coalition with a view to reducing fragmentation and allowing global interoperability of tracking and warning applications, a key aspect to achieve broad adoption.
On 9 April 2020, the Government of Singapore announced that it had opened the BlueTrace Protocol code used by its official government application.
On 10 April 2020, Apple and Google, companies that control the IOS and Android mobile platforms announced an initiative for tracking contacts that, according to their assurance, would protect privacy, which is based on the combination of low-energy Bluetooth technology and privacy protection encryption.
They also published the specifications of the main technologies used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system is intended to be implemented in three stages:
implementation of tools for Governments to create trace applications of official coronavirus to protect privacy
integration of this feature directly into iOS and Android. Google and Apple are planning to address the problems of persistent adoption and surveillance by first distributing the system through updates to the operating system and then withdrawing them from the same way as the threat has occurred.
b'Reperfilation (also known as repositioning or therapeutic change) is the re-adaptation of an approved drug for the treatment of a disease that is not for which it was originally developed.
This is in line with scientific research currently seeking to develop safe and effective treatments for COVID-19.
Other research lines include the development of a vaccine against COVID-19 and the transfer of convalescent plasma. SARS-CoV-2 has approximately 66 chemical proteins, each of which has multiple link sites.
The analysis of these union sites provides a reasonable basis for the project to develop an effective antiviral drug against COVID-19 proteins.
Among the most important diana proteins of SARS-CoV-2, the protein similar to the papina, the polymerase ARN directed by ARN, the helicase, the S protein and the ADP-riphosphatase are found.
Hussein A. A. et al. studied several components of medical interest that then optimised and analyzed to identify the similarity of its main chain with the most approved drugs in order to accelerate the development of a powerful drug against SARS-CoV-2 in its preclinical study and recommend it for the design of a clinical study.
Chloroquina is an antipaludic drug that is also used against certain autoimmune diseases.
On 18 March, WHO announced that related chloroquine and hydroxyroquine would be among the four drugs that would be studied in the clinical trial Solidarity.
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that the tests of New York state with chloroquine and hydroxyroquine would begin on 24 March. On 28 March, the FDA authorized the use of hydroxyroquin sulphate and chloroquin phosphate by an urgent authorisation (USA).
Treatment has not been approved by the FDA clinical trial process and is authorised according to one U.S.A. only as an experimental treatment for urgent use in patients who are hospitalized but who cannot receive treatment in a clinical trial.
The CDC said that "the use, dose or duration of hydroxyroquine for the prevention or treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection" is not yet established.
Doctors have said they use the drug when there's no other option.
A Turkish research team in Istanbul conducts a small study on the use of chloroquine in combination with zinc, vitamin A, vitamin C and vitamin D.
At Duke University and Oxford University, there are large studies in progress.
The College of Langone Medicine of NYU is conducting a study on the safety and effectiveness of the preventive use of hydroxyroquine.
Chinese clinical trials in Wuhan and Shenzhen demonstrated that favipiravir was "clearly effective".
Thirty-five patients in Shenzhen showed negative mean 4 days, while the duration of the disease was 11 days in 45 patients who did not receive it.
In a study conducted in Wuhan in 240 patients with neumonia, half received favipiravir, while the other half was administered with imifenovir.
The Italian Medicines Agency reminded the public that the existing evidence supporting the drug is weak and preliminary.
On 2 April, Germany announced that it would buy the drug in Japan for its reservations and that it would use the military to deliver the drug to university hospitals, where it will be used to treat patients with COVID-19.
According to the South China Morning Post, Shinzo Abe has made proposals to the Trup Administration on the purchase of the drug. The drug may be less effective in serious cases of disease if the virus has already been multiplied.
It may not be safe for pregnant women or try to design.
A study of lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra), a combination of lopinavir and ritonavir antibodies, concluded that "no benefits were observed".
The drugs were designed to prevent the replication of HIV by combining protease.
A team of researchers at the University of Colorado is trying to modify the drugs to find a component that is linked to SARS-CoV-2's protection in the scientific community, criticism has emerged about the allocation of resources to the rehabilitation of specifically developed drugs for HIV/AIDS.
WHO included lopinavir/ritonavir in the International Solidarity Test.
The remdesivir was created and developed by Gilead Sciences as a treatment for Ebola virus and Marburg virus infections. Gilead Sciences later discovered that remdesivir had in vitro antiviral activity against multiple filviruses, neumvirus, paramixovirus and coronavirus.
An antiviral treatment problem is the development of resistance through mutations that can result in more serious disease and transmission.
Some pre-tested initial studies suggest that remdesivir may have a high genetic barrier to resistance. Several clinical trials are underway, including two hospitals at Cleveland University; one for people with moderate disease and one for those with a more serious disease.
There are three clinical trials of intravenous vitamin C for patients who are hospitalized and severely affected by COVID-19; two placebo-controlled (China, Canada) and one without control (Italy).
The state of New York began testing with the azithromycin antibiotics on March 24, 2020.
Japan’s National Centre for Global Health and Medicine (NCGM) is planning a clinical trial with Teijin’s Alvesco (cyclicalsonida), an inhalable corticosteroid for asthma, as treatment for asymptomatic patients infected by the new coronavirus.
An angiotensin 2 converting enzyme form is underway and 200 serious patients treated in Denmark, Germany and Austria will be enrolled to determine the effectiveness of treatment.
Researchers at the Montreal Heart Institute in Canada are currently studying the role of colchicine in reducing inflammation and pulmonary complications in patients with mild symptoms of COVID-19.
The study, called COLCORONA, is registering 6,000 adults over 40 years of age and older with a COVID-19 diagnosis and mild symptoms that do not require hospitalization.
Pregnant women who are pregnant or who do not have a harmful anti-conceptive method are not eligible.
A number of anticoagulants are being evaluated in Italy.
The low molecular weight heparin is widely used to treat patients, so the Italian Medicines Agency published quotations on their use.
On April 14, a multicentre study was announced in Italy with 300 patients investigating the use of sodium enoxaparin at preventive and therapeutic doses.
As SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, scientists are paying great attention to the re-adaptation of antiviral drugs developed for previous outbreaks of SROM, SRAG and the West Nile virus.
Ribavirin: ribavirin was recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 in accordance with the seventh edition of the Chinese tariffs
Umifenovir: umifenovir was recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 in accordance with the 7th edition of Chinese potatoes
These are some treatments that have been identified for possible adaptations to COVID-19 treatment:
Tocilizumab (blocks IL-6): approved by China.
{NS}
with a vaccine against COVID-19 is a hypothetical vaccine against coronary virus 2019 (COVID-19).
Although no vaccine has completed clinical trials, there are many ongoing attempts to develop that vaccine.
At the end of February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said that it did not expect a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes the disease, within 18 months.
In April, five possible vaccines were in phase I safety studies.
COVID-19 was identified in December 2019.
An important outbreak was spread by the world in 2020, which triggered considerable investments and research activities to develop a vaccine.
Many organizations use published genes to develop possible vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.
As set out in April, the requirements of the ECPI initiative for the development of a vaccine are speed, manufacturing capacity, scale implementation and global access.
In April, CEPI scientists reported that 10 different technological platforms were being investigated and developed in early 2020 to create an effective vaccine against COVID-19.
Among the days of the main platforms for security studies in phase I are the following:
nuclear acid (ADN and ARN) ( phase I developer and possibly vaccine: Modern, mRNA-1273)
Viric vector ( phase I developer and possible vaccine: CanSino Biologicals, adenovirus vector type 5)
According to ECPI scientists reported in April, in total, 115 possible vaccines are at the initial stages of development, 78 of which are confirmed in active projects (79 according to the Milk Institute) and 37 others are announced, but few information is available (if estimated to be planning or developing).
A phase I or II trial conducted preliminary safety and immunogenicity tests, usually random, is controlled by placebo and performed on several sites, while more precise and effective doses are determined.
Phase III trials often involve more participants, including a control group, and evaluate the effectiveness of the vaccine to prevent disease, while controlling the adverse effects that occur at the optimal dose.
Of the 79 active development vaccines (confirmed at the beginning of April 2020), 74 were not yet evaluated in humans (continued in the preclinical investigation).
About 24 January 2020 in Australia, the University of Queensland announced that it was investigating the potential of a vaccine with a molecular subject that would genetically modify viral proteins to stimulate immune response.
About 24 January 2020 in Canada, the International Vaccine Centre (VIDO-InterVac) of the University of Saskatchewan announced the beginning of work in a vaccine and hopes that human trials will begin in 2021.
Projects for the development of vaccines were announced at the Centre for Control and Prevention of Diseases in China on 26 January 2020 and at the University of Hong Kong on 28 January.
About January 29, 2020, Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies, led by Hanneke Schuitmaker, announced that they had started developing a vaccine.
Janssen is developing an oral vaccine with its biotechnology partner, Vaxart.
On March 18, 2020, Emergent BioResolutions announced a manufacturing association with Vaxart for the development of the vaccine.
On February 8, 2020, the OncoGen laboratory in Romania published a document with a design for a vaccine similar to that used in treatment with neo-angeric vaccines against cancer.
On 25 March, the head of the research institute announced that they had completed the vaccine synthesis and were starting tests.
On 27 February 2020, a grantee from Generex, NuGenerex Immuno-Oncology, announced that it was starting a project to create a li-key peptide vaccine against COVID-19.
They wanted to produce a possible vaccine that could be tested in humans "in 90 days".
On 5 March 2020, the University of Washington in San Luis announced its projects to develop a vaccine.
On 5 March 2020, the United States Army Medical Research and Material Command at the Forte Detrick and Walter Reed Army Institute of Research in Silver Spring, both in western Maryland, announced that they were working in a vaccine.
About March 10, 2020, Emergency Biosolutions announced that it had joined Novamax Inc.
in the development and manufacture of a vaccine.
The partners also announced plans for a clinical trial and phase I trial for July 2020.
On 12 March 2020, the Ministry of Health of India announced that it was working with 11 islanders and that, despite rapid progress, it would take at least one and a half years to develop a vaccine.
On 12 March 2020, Medicago, a biotechnology company in the city of Quebec, Quebec, reported on the development of a particle similar to coronavirus with partial funding from Canadian Health Research Institutes.
The possible vaccine is at the laboratory research stage and human tests are expected to begin in July or August 2020.
Earlier that week, The Guardian reported that U.S. President Donald Trump had offered CureVac "'great amounts of money for exclusive access to a vaccine against COVID-19'" before the German Government resigned.
On 17 March 2020, the U.S. pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced an association with the German company BioNTech to develop jointly a vaccine based on ARNm.
The possible vaccine based on ARNm BNT162 is currently in clinical trials and clinical trials are expected to begin in April 2020.
In Italy, on 17 March 2020, Takis Biotech, an Italian biotechnology company, announced that it would have the results of preclinical trials in April 2020 and that human testing of the possible final vaccine could begin in the autumn.
In France, on 19 March 2020, the Coalition for Innovation in the Epidemic Preparation (CEPI) announced an investment of USD 4.9 million in a vaccine research alliance against COVID-19 including the Pasteur Institute, Themis Bioscience (Vienna, Austria) and Pittsburgh University, leading to the total investment of CEPI in the development of a vaccine against COVID-19 to USD 29 million.
The other ECPI partners for the development of a vaccine against COVID-19 are Moderna, Curovac, Innovio, Novax, Hong Kong University, Oxford University and Queensland University.
On 20 March 2020, Russian health officials announced that scientists began testing in animals of six possible vaccines.
Researchers from the London Imperial College announced on 20 March 2020 that they were developing an ARN vaccine with self-replication against COVID-19.
The possible vaccine developed within 14 days of receipt of the Chinese sequence.
At the end of March, the Canadian Government announced funding of CAD 275 million for 96 medical research projects to counter COVID-19, including a large number of possible vaccines in Canadian companies and universities such as the Medical and Saskatchewan University initiatives.
More or less at the same time, the Government of Canada announced the use of CAD 192 million specifically to develop a vaccine against COVID-19, with plans to create a "national vaccine bank" with several new vaccines that could be used if another coronavirus outbreak occurred.
On 2 April 2020, researchers at the University of Pittsburgh Medical College announced the evidence of PittCoVacc, a possible vaccine against COVID-19, in rats and said that "the S1 subunit vaccines administered by SARS-CoV-2 administered by MNA received powerful responses from the specific antibodies (in rats) that were evident two weeks after vaccination".
In Canada, on April 16, 2020, the University of Waterloo's Faculty of Pharmacy announced the design of a possible DNA-based vaccine as a potential nasal duster.
Using bacteria, DNA will be designated to reproduce within human bacteria and produce inoculated particles similar to the virus, which can stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
In March 2020, the Government, the industrial sector and three U.S. universities gathered resources to access IBM supercomputers, along with computer resources in the Hewlett Packard Enterprise cloud, Amazon, Microsoft and Google.
Some vaccines have specific effects.
This means they can benefit beyond the disease they prevent.
Another randomized trial in Australia seeks to register 4170 health workers.
The vaccines being developed may not be safe or effective.
Initial research to assess the effectiveness of vaccines with specific animal models of COVID-19, such as the transgenic rattling expressed by ECA2, other laboratory animals and non-human primates, demonstrates the need to account for level 3 biosafety measures for the handling of live viruses and international coordination to ensure standardized safety procedures.
Vaccines against SRAG and SROM have been tested in non-human animal models.
By 2020, there is no cure or vaccine that protects against SRAG that has proved to be safe and effective in humans.
According to research publications from 2005 to 2006, the identification and development of new vaccines and medicines to treat SRAG was a priority for Governments and public health agencies around the world.
When SROM was generalised, it was believed that existing research on SRAG could be a useful model for the development of vaccines and anti-MERS-CoV infections.
In March 2020, one anti-SROM vaccine (based on DNA) completed phase I clinical trials in humans, the other three were ongoing, all of which are viral vector vaccines, two adenoviral vectors (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac) and one MVA vector (MVA-MERS-S).
Publications in the social media promoted a conspirative theory that the COVID-19 virus was known and there was already a vaccine.
The patents mentioned by various publications on social media refer to existing patents for genetic sequences and vaccines for other coronavirus strains, such as SRAG coronavirus.
b'Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by the Coronavirus of acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms include fever, fatigue and difficulty breathing.
Other symptoms are fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhoea, throat pain, loss of the olfactory and abdominal pain.
The time that passes between exposure and start of symptoms is usually about five days, but it can vary between two and fourteen days.
Although most cases result in mild symptoms, some progress towards viral neumonia and multi-organization.
On 17 April 2020, more than 2.24 million cases were reported in 210 countries and territories, with more than 153,000 deaths.
More than 568 000 people have recovered. The virus is mainly spread among people during close contact, usually through coughing, coughing or talking.
Although these gouts are produced when peeling, they usually fall to the floor or on the surface rather than be infected in long distances.
People can also be infected by touching a contaminated surface and then touching the eyes, nose or mouth.
The virus can survive on the surface for up to 72 hours.
It is more contagious during the first three days after the start of symptoms, although propaganda is also possible before symptoms and late stages of the disease appear. The standard method for diagnosis is the reaction in the polymerase chain with real-time reverse transcription (rRT-PCR) of a nasopharyngeal hesopharyngeal hesopharyngeal.
The use of masks is recommended for those suspected of having the virus and its caregivers.
The recommendations on the use of masks for the general public vary. Some authorities recommend not to use them, others recommend that they be used, while others require their use.
Currently, there is no specific antiviral vaccine or treatment against COVID-19.
Local disease transmission has been recorded in most countries of the six WHO regions.
Those who are infected by the virus may be asymptomatic or have symptoms similar to those of the flu, such as fever, cough, fatigue and difficulty breathing.
Emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing, pain or persistent pressure in the chest, confusion, difficulty walking and face or blue lips. If these symptoms occur, it is recommended to seek immediate medical attention.
It is less common to observe symptoms in the upper respiratory pathways, such as dizziness, nasal caste and chest pain.
Gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea have been identified in variable percentages.
Some cases in China initially presented breast-feeding and palpitations.
In some cases, the disease progressed to pneumonia, multi-organization and death.
This is called incubation period.
The COVID-19 incubation period is usually five to six days, but may vary from two to fourteen days.
97.5% of people with symptoms do so within 11.5 days of infection.
The role of these asymptomatic carriers is still not fully known; however, preliminary evidence suggests that they can contribute to the spread of disease.
The proportion of people who are not infected with symptoms is currently unknown and are being studied. The Centres for Control and Prevention of Korean Diseases (KCDC) reported that about 20% of confirmed cases continued asymptomatic during hospitalization.
The National Health Commission of China began to include asymptomatic cases in daily cases on 1 April. Of the 166 infections on that day, 130 (78%) were asymptomatic when the trial was carried out.
Both the sponge and the salva can have large viral loads.
Speaking in high voice frees more gates than speaking with a normal volume.
A study in Singapore found that not opening the mouth to the tosser can make the gothites travel 4.5 metres (15 feet).
Although the virus is not often air transmission, the National Academy of Sciences has suggested that the transmission through biological aerosols is possible and explained that air collectors in the corridor outside people's bedrooms gave positive results in viral ARN.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and cardiopulmonary reanimation (RCP), may lead to the aerosolation of respiratory secrets and consequently air transmission.
Although there are concerns about the possibility of being spread by the genes, it is believed that the risk is low. The virus is more contagious when people have symptoms; although propaganda is possible before the symptoms begin, the risk is low.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) explains that although it is not quite clear how easily one person is exposed, a person is usually infected with two or three more. The virus survives hours or days on the surface.
In particular, the virus was detected for one day in the carton, up to three days in the plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304), and up to four hours in products with 99 % copper.
However, this would vary according to humidity and temperature.
The apple and the detector are also effective if they are used properly. The apple products degradation the protective lipid layer of the virus and disable it, in addition to removing it from the skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions, such as benzalconium chloride and chlorohexidine glucanate (a surgical disinfectant), are less effective. In a Hong Kong study, salt samples were taken on an average two days after hospitalization.
In five of six patients, the first sample had the highest viral load. In the case of the sixth patient, the highest viral load was observed on the second test day.
The acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, which was first isolated from three people with neumonia associated with a group of acute respiratory disease cases in Wuhan.
All characteristics of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are found in related nature coronaviruses.
Outside of the human body, the domestic jabune kills the virus, since it returns its protective bubble. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
The lungs are the most affected organs by COVID-19, due to the virus entering the host cells through the converting enzyme of type I angiotensin 2 (ECA2), which exceeds the alveolar cells of type II of the lungs.
The virus uses a special surface glycoprotein called "peplomer" to connect with ECA2 and enter the host cell.
In 12% of the people who were hospitalized in Wuhan, China, acute heart disease was identified, which is more common in serious illness.
Cardiovascular symptoms rates are high due to systemic inflammatory response and immune system disorders during the disease evolution, but acute myocardial injury can be related to ECA2 receptors in the heart.
ECA2 receptors have a high voice in their heart and participate in their operation.
A high incidence of thrombosis (31%) and venous thromboembolism (25%) was detected in ICI patients with COVID-19 infection and may be related to a prognostical malformation.
Although SARS-COV-2 has a tropical effect on epithelial cells that express ECA2 of respiratory tract, patients with severe COVID-19 have systemic hyperinflammation symptoms.
In particular, it was observed that GM-CSF secretive T lymphocytes are associated with the recruitment of IL-6 secretive monocytics and severe pulmonary pathology in patients with COVID-19.
In autopsies, lymphocyte infiltrates were also reported.
WHO has published several test protocols to detect the disease.
The standard test method is the reaction in the polymerase chain with real-time reverse transcription (rRT-PCR).
The test is often performed in samples of respiratory pathways obtained through a nasopharyngeal hesopharyngeal; however, samples of nasal or spoutal hesopes can also be used.
In general, results are available within a few hours or two days.
Blood tests can also be used, but two blood samples should be taken with two different weeks and the results have very low immediate value.
Chinese scientists managed to isolate the strain of coronavirus and published the genetic sequence so that world laboratories could develop independently of evidence of reaction in the polymerase chain (PCR) to detect infection by the virus.
On 4 April 2020, anti-body tests (which can detect active infections and if the person has been infected in the past) were developing but were not widely used.
The experience in China with the tests has shown that the precision is only 60 to 70%.
The FDA in the United States approved the first immediate diagnosis test on 21 March 2020 for use at the end of that month. Diagnostic rates published by the zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University would suggest methods to detect infections based on clinical characteristics and epidemiological risk.
Bilateral multilobular glass opacities with peripheral, asymmetric and later distribution are common in the initial stages of infection.
As the disease progresses, subpleural domination can occur, pattern in ordered impregnation (lobular septal enlargement with variable alveolar filling) and consolidation.
Few data are available on microscopic lesions and COVID-19 physiopathology.
The main pathological results of autopsy are:
Macroscopy: pluritis, pericarditis, pulmonary consolidation and pulmonary oedema
Four types of severity of viral neumonia may be observed:
mild pneumonia: pulmonary oedema, neumocitis hyperplasia, atypically large neumocitis, interstitial inflammation with lymphocyte infiltration and formation of giant cells with multiple nucles
severe neumonea: spread alveolary injury (DAD) with exposed peripheral alveolars.
DAD is a cause of acute respiratory difficulty syndrome (SDRA) and severe hypoglycaemia.
neumone in treatment: organisation of exudes in alveolare veins and interstitial pulmonary fibrosis
Blood: disembodied intravascular coagulation (CID); leucoerythroplastic reaction
Preventive measures to reduce infections include staying home, avoiding places with many people, washing hands with water and soap often by at least 20 seconds, having good respiratory hygiene and avoiding touching eyes, nose or mouth without washing hands.
The CDCs recommend covering the mouth and nose with a torso or thaw panel and, if there are no panels, use the inner part of the code.
Appropriate hand hygiene is recommended after touching or waving.
CDC has recommended the use of screen taps in public places, one of the reasons for limiting the transmission by asymptometic people. Social distance strategies seek to reduce contact between people infected with large groups by closing schools and places of work, restricting travel and canceling multi-tudinal public meetings.
Distance rates also indicate that people must keep a distance of 6 feet (1.8 m).
There is no effective medicine to prevent COVID-19. As no vaccine is expected until 2021, as soon as a key part to control COVID-19 is trying to prevent the epidemic peak, which is known as "planning the curve".
The CDC also recommends washing hands often with water and jabs for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom or when the hands are apparently dry, before eating and after sunning the nose, tossing or wringing.
They also recommend the use of an alcohol-based disinfectant that has a minimum of 60 % alcohol, but only when there is no water and soap available on occasion. For areas where hand disinfectants are not easy to obtain, WHO provides two formulations for local production.
In these formulations, antimicrobial activity results from ethanol or isopropanol.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to help eliminate bacterial spores in alcohol; "it is not an active substance for antisepsia of the hands".
Glycerol is added as an amusing.
Support is provided to patients, which may include rehydration, oxygen therapy and treatment for other affected vital organs.
CDC recommends that those who suspect that they have the virus use a simple mask.
Oxigenation by extracorporal membrane (OMEC) has been used to address the problem of respiratory failure, but benefits are still being analysed.
To improve immunity, personal hygiene and lifestyle and healthy nutrition have been recommended.
Support treatments can be useful for those who have mild symptoms at the initial stage of the infection. WHO and the National Health Commission of China have published recommendations for the care of people who are hospitalized with COVID-19.
Intensificationists and neurologists in the U.S. have compiled recommendations from various agencies on a free resource, the IBCC.
As of April 2020, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19.
For the initial treatment of symptoms, some medical professionals recommend paracetamol (acetamine) instead of ibuprofen.
Caution should be exercised to minimise the risk of virus transmission, especially in health care environments when procedures such as intubation or manual ventilation are conducted.
The CDC recommends health care professionals who care for people with COVID-19 to place the patient in an air infection isolation zone (AIIR), in addition to using standard precautions, contact precautions and precautions to avoid air transmission. The CDC highlights the rates for the use of personal protection equipment (EPP) during the pandemic.
The recommended teams are bats of EPP, mascarilla, anti-protectors and medical gloves. When available, respiratory (instead of mascarillas) are preferred.
The N95 masks are approved for industrial environments, but the FDA authorised their use by an urgent authorisation (USA).
They are designed to protect against particles in the air such as dust but do not guarantee effectiveness against a specific biological agent which is not specified in the product indications.
When there are no masks available, CDCs recommend the use of protective helmets or, as a last resort, household masks.
Most COVID-19 cases are not serious enough to require mechanical or alternative ventilation, but a percentage of cases are.
This type of respiratory support is actively being studied for people who are hospitalized with respiratory failure related to COVIDA-19 and there is already some evidence that intubation can be avoided with a high flow or positive bibretion channel in respiratory pathways.
It is still unknown whether any of these two benefits people in critical status.
Some doctors prefer to use invasive mechanical ventilation when available because this technique limits the spread of aerosol particles compared to the high flow nasal channel. Serious cases occur mainly in adults (up to 60 years of age and, in particular, over 80 years of age).
Many developed countries do not have enough head beds in hospitals, which limits the capacity of the health system to manage the sudden increase in serious cases of COVID-19 that require hospitalization.
A study in China found that 5% was admitted to intensive care units, 2.3% needed mechanical support for ventilation and 1.4% fell.
In China, approximately 30% of people who were hospitalized with COVID-19 eventually transferred to ICU.
Mechanical ventilation becomes more complex when a patient with COVID-19 develops acute respiratory difficulty syndrome (SDRA) and oxygenation is increasingly difficult.
Respirators need different types of pressure control and PPTE to maximize oxygen supply, while the risk of pulmonary injury associated with respiratory and neumotorax is minimised.
The oldest breathers may not count with high PPTE.
The investigation of possible treatments began in January 2020 and several antiviral drugs are in clinical trials.
The remdesivir seems to be the most promising.
Although the development of new medicines may last until 2021, several medicines that are already being tested are already approved for other uses or are in advanced tests.
Antiviral medicines can be tested in people with severe disease.
WHO recommends that volunteers participate in efficacy and safety tests of possible treatments. The FDA granted temporary authorisation to convalescent plasma as experimental treatment in cases where the person's life is at serious and immediate risk.
It has not been submitted to the clinical studies necessary to demonstrate whether it is safe and effective for a disease.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile application to deal with the disease outbreak.
Users must enter their name and identification number.
The application may detect "close contact" and therefore a potential risk of infection through surveillance data.
Each user can also control the status of three other users.
If a possible risk is identified, the application not only recommends self-containment but also alerts local health officials. The analysis of mobile information macrodata, facial recognition technology, mobile phones monitoring and artificial intelligence are used to track people infected and those who were in contact with South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli Government allowed security agencies to trace data from the mobile phones of persons suspected of having coronavirus.
The measure was taken to strengthen the Quartet and protect those who can contact infected citizens.
Also in March 2020, Deutsche Telekom shared summary data from the location of telephones with the German federal agency Robert Koch Institute to investigate and prevent the spread of the virus.
Russia implemented face-to-face recognition technology to detect fulfillments of the Quartet.
Regional Health Commissioner Giulia Gallera said that mobile phone operators have informed him that "in all forms, 40% of people continue to move".
The German Government carried out a 48-hour weekend hackation with more than 42,000 participants.
In addition, Estonia's President, Kersti Kaljulaid, made a global request for creative solutions to the spread of coronavirus.
People may feel anxious about the quarantine, travel restrictions and the side effects of treatment or fear of infection themselves.
The BBC quoted Rory O'Connor as saying: "The growing social isolation, loneliness, concern for health, stress and economic problems are a perfect threat to the mental health and well-being of people."
The disease may follow a mild evolution with little or no symptoms, so it will seem like other diseases of the upper respiratory tract, such as the common cold.
Light cases are usually recovered within two weeks, while serious or critical people can stay for three to six weeks to do so.
Pregnant women may be at risk of contracting a serious COVID-19 virus, according to data from other similar viruses such as SRAG and SROM virus, but COVID-19 data are insufficient. In some people, COVID-19 may affect lungs and cause pneumonia.
In the most severe cases, COVID-19 can quickly progress to the water respiratory difficulty syndrome (SDRA) which causes respiratory failure, septic shock and multi-organ failure.
The complications associated with COVID-19 include sepsis, changes in coagulation and cardiac, renal and hepatic damage.
The change in coagulation, in particular the increase in protombin time, has been reported in 6% of patients treated with COVID-19; while the change in renal function is observed in 4% of this group.
About 20 to 30% of people with CODIV-19 have high hepatic enzymes (aminotransferases).
According to the same report, the average time between the beginning of symptoms and death was ten days, with five days of hospitalization.
However, for patients transferred to ICU, it took an average of seven days between hospitalization and death.
In an initial case study, the average time from first symptoms to death was 14 days, with a total interval of 6 to 41 days.
In a study by the National Health Commission (NHC) in China, the mortality rate among orphans was 2.8% and among women was 1.7%.
Histopathological examinations of post-mortem lung samples show widespread alveolar damage with cell fibromyxoid exudations in both lungs.
Viral cytopathic changes were observed in the neumocitis.
The picture of lungs was similar to the acute respiratory difficulty syndrome (SDRA).
In the 11.8% of the deaths reported by the National Health Commission in China, heart damage resulted from high levels of troponin or cardiac parlor.
According to the United States in March, 89 per cent of hospitalized persons had a pre-existing condition, and the availability of medical resources and socio-economic aspects of a region could also affect mortality.
The estimates of mortality by affection vary because of these regional differences, but also due to methodological difficulties.
Insufficient reporting of mild cases can lead to overestimated mortality rates.
However, the fact that deaths are the result of cases committed in the past may indicate that the current mortality rate is underestimated.
The smokers had 1.4 times more likely to suffer severe symptoms of COVID-19 and approximately 2.4 times more likely to need intensive care or fail compared to non-smoking. They are concerned about the long term of this disease.
The Hong Kong Hospital Authority found a decrease of 20 to 30 per cent of lung capacity in some people who recovered from the disease, and lung images suggest an organ impact.
This can also cause the syndrome after intensive care after recovery.
By March 2020, it was unknown whether previous infections had generated an effective long-term immunity in people who had recovered from the disease.
Immunities appear to be possible, based on the behavior of other coronaviruses, but cases recovered from COVID-19 have been reported which subsequently gave positive effect to coronavirus.
These cases are believed to be an improvement in a persistent infection and not a re-infection.
It is considered that this virus is natural and animal origin by means of an interesting infection.
The real origin is unknown, but by December 2019 the spread of infection was almost entirely due to human transmission.
A study of the first 41 confirmed cases of COVID-19, published in The Lancet in January 2020, indicated as the first date of the start of symptoms on 1 December 2019.
Official WHO publications reported that the first demonstration of symptoms was on 8 December 2019.
In general, several measures are taken to quantify mortality.
These figures vary regionally and in time, in addition to being affected by the volume of tests, the quality of the health system, treatment options, the time spent from the initial outbreak and the characteristics of the population, such as age, sex and general health.
By the end of 2019, WHO assigned the CIE-10 emergency disease codes U07.1 to deaths with confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 and U07.2 to deaths with a COVID-19 clinical or epidemiological diagnosis without confirmation of a SARS-CoV-2 infection laboratory. The fatality rate reflects the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed at a given time interval.
Based on the statistics of the University of Johns Hopkins, the overall literacy rate is 6.9% (153 8222/2 240 191) until 17 April 2020.
The number varies from region to region. Other measures include the literacy rate in patients diagnosed (CFR), which reflects the percentage of people diagnosed dying from a disease, and the rate of literacy in infected persons, which reflects the percentage of people infected (with or without a diagnosis) who die from a disease.
These statistics do not depend on time and follow a specific population from infection to case resolution.
Although not all infected persons produce antibodies, the presence of these may provide information on how many persons have been infected.
At the centre of the bridge in Italy, Castiglione d'Adda, a small town of 4600 inhabitants, 80 (1.7%) have already fallen.
In Gangelt, the disease spread during carnival festivals and affected the younger ones, causing relatively low mortality, and it is possible that not all deaths by COVID-19 have been classified as such.
Moreover, the German health system has not gone beyond that.
In the Netherlands, about 3% of the population have antibodies, according to blood donors.
It has been confirmed that 69 (0,004 per cent of the population) died from COVID-19.
The impact of the pandemic and the mortality rate are different for orphans and women.
Mortality is higher between varons in studies conducted in China and Italy.
The greatest risk of varons is for those in their 50s, and the gap between varons and women is closed only at 90 years of age.
In China, the mortality rate was 2.8 in arms and 1.7 in women.
The exact reasons for this gender difference are not known, but genetic and behavioural factors may be due.
Immunological differences based on sex, the lowest number of women smoking and the fact that varons have corrosive infections, such as hypertension, could have contributed to a more early age to the higher mortality rate in rats.
In Europe, 57 per cent of the infected persons were varnishes and 72 per cent of the wounded by COVID-19 were varons.
As of April 2020, the U.S. Government does not track sex information on COVID-19 infections.
Research shows that viral diseases such as Ebola, HIV, influenza and SRAG affect foreigners and women differently.
A higher percentage of health workers, in particular nursing staff, are women, and they have more exposure to the virus.
The World Health Organization announced on 11 February 2020 that the official name of the disease would be "COVID-19".
WHO Chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explained that CO refers to crown, VI to virus, D to disease and 19 to the date on which the outbreak was discovered: 31 December 2019.
The name was chosen to avoid references to a specific geographic location (e.g. China), animal species or group of persons, in accordance with international recommendations on the name to prevent stigmatization. The virus causing COVID-19 is called coronavirus of severe respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-COV-2).
WHO also uses "COVID-19 virus" and "COVID-19 virus responsible" in public communications.
It is common to use "coronavirus" to refer to both disease and virus.
During the initial outbreak in Wuhan, China, it was common to refer to the virus and the disease as "coronavirus" and "coronavirus of Wuhan".
In January 2020, WHO recommended 2019-nCov and respiratory disease for 2019-nCoV as temporary names for the virus and disease, in accordance with the 2015 indication of non-use of sites in the name of the virus and disease.
Official names COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were issued on 11 February 2020.
Due to the limitations of capacity in standard supply chains, some digital manufacturers are printing health material, such as nasal hesopos and respiratory parts.
For example, when an Italian hospital suddenly needed the valve of a breather and the supplier could not deliver it at the required time, a local emergency company carried out reverse engineering and printed the 100 valves needed during the night.
Following the initial outbreak of COVID-19, there were theories of conspiracy, false information and disinformation about the origin, scale, prevention, treatment and other aspects of the disease that were spread rapidly by the Internet.
It would seem that humans can transmit the virus to some other animals.
The study found no evidence of viral replication in cervids, potatoes or chicken.
There are no medicines or vaccines approved to treat the disease.
Government organizations, academic groups and sector researchers are carrying out international research on vaccines and medicines for COVID-19.
In March, the World Health Organization launched the "Solidard trial" to assess the therapeutic effects of the four most promising antiviral compounds in terms of effectiveness.
There is no vaccine, but several agencies are actively developing possible vaccines.
The previous work on SARS-CoV is being used because SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 use ECA2 receptors to enter human cells.
Three vaccination strategies are under investigation.
First, researchers are trying to develop a complete virus vaccine.
The use of this virus, whether inactive or dead, aims to generate a rapid immune response from the human body to a new infection by COVID-19 virus.
A second strategy, subunity vaccines, seeks to create a vaccine that makes the immune system sensitive to certain subunits of the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, such research focuses on S protein that helps the virus to get into the ECA2 receptor.
A third strategy is nuclear acid vaccines (ADN or ARN vaccines, a new technique to create vaccines).
The experimental vaccines of any of these strategies should be studied to determine their safety and effectiveness. On March 16, 2020, the first clinical trial of a vaccine with four volunteers in Seattle began.
The vaccine contains an infinite copy of the virus genetic code that causes disease. It has been suggested that anti-body improvement is a potential challenge for the development of vaccines against SARS-COV-2, but this is controversial.
In April 2020, there are more than 300 active clinical trials.
Seven studies have evaluated already approved treatment for paludism, including four studies on hydroxyroquine or chloroquine.
Re-adapted antiviral drugs are most of the Chinese research, including nine phase III trials on re-disappearing in several countries and should report to the end of April.
In April 2020, a dynamic review of clinical development on vaccines and potential drugs against COVID-19 was under way. Several antiviral medicines for the treatment of COVID-19, including: remdesivir, chlorocine and hydroxyroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir and lopinavir/ritonavir in combination with interferon-beta.
As of March 2020, there is evidence of the effectiveness of remdesivir.
Clinical improvement was observed in patients treated with the compassionate use of remdesivir.
Clinical trials are being carried out in phase III in the United States, China and Italy. Chloroquina, previously used to treat malaria, was studied in China in February 2020. The results were preliminary.
However, there are requests for peer reviews for research.
The health authorities of Korea and China recommend the use of chloroquina.
However, although the Wuhan Institute of Virology recommends a daily dose of one gram, it indicates that the double dose is very dangerous and could be fatal.
On 28 March 2020, the FDA issued an urgent authorisation for hydroxyroquin and chloroquine to distinguish doctors from patients with COVID-19. The seventh edition of the Chinese tariffs also includes the use of interferon, ribavirin or imifenovir against COVID-19.
The preliminary data indicate that high doses of ribavirin are needed to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
It has been recommended that more in-live studies of nitazoxanide be conducted after determining that low concentrations inhibit SARS-CoV-2. The studies have shown that the initial S protein swab of S which is performed by type 2 TMPRSS2 transmembratory serum (TMPRSS2) is essential for the entry of SARS-CoV-2 through interaction with ECA2 receptor.
Chloroquine and hydroxyroquine studies with or without azithromycin have important limitations that prevent the medical community from taking these treatments without further studies. Oseltamivir does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and does not have a known role in the treatment of COVID-19.
The release of cytokines can be a complications of the last stages of COVID-19 severe.
There is evidence that hydroxyroquine can have properties that prevent cytokine release. The National Health Commission of China included tocilizumab in treatment rates after completion of a small study.
It is in a non- randomized national trial in phase II in Italy after observing positive results in people with severe illness.
It is expected that, in combination with a serum ferritin blood analysis to identify cytokine releases, these effects, which are believed to be the cause of death of some people infected, are expected.
The FDA approved the receptor antagonist of Interleukin-6 based on previous cases for the treatment of cytokine release syndrome against steroids induced by another cause, T-Car T lymphocytes treatment in 2017.
To date, there is no un randomized evidence that tocilizumab is an effective treatment for CRS.
The transfer of purified and concentrated antibodies produced by the immune system of those who have been recovered from COVID-19 to people who need them as a passive non-vacuum immunization method is under investigation.
This strategy was adopted with SRAG with non-conformity results.
Viral neutralization is the expected mechanism of action through which passive treatment with antibodies can defend against SARS-CoV-2.
However, other mechanisms are possible, such as cell cytotoxicity dependent on antibodies or phagocytosis.
Other forms of passive treatment with antibodies, for example, are being developed using manufactured monoclonal antibodies.
The production of convalescent serum, consisting of the liquid part of the blood of recovered patients and containing specific antibodies against this virus, could be increased to achieve a faster distribution.
Coronavirus disease, a closely related group of syndromes
Li Wenliang, a doctor at Wuhan Central Hospital, who later died from COVID-19 after raising awareness about the spread of the virus.
