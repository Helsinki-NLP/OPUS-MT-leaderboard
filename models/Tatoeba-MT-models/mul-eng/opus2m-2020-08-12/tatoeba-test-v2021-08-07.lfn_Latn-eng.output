You're gonna kill us all.
You're gonna kill us all.
You're my brother.
You're not Brazilian, are you?
But you're not welcome.
We don't welcome you.
You're sad.
You're sad.
You're so kind.
You're so kind.
No problem.
You're out.
Your ears are beautiful.
Your mother is very beautiful!
Your parents are in fashion.
Looks like you're messing with me with my brother more.
You must not use the word "ge" as an insult.
You must not use the word "ge" as an insult.
You must not use the word "ge" as an insult.
You're supposed to sell your designs because they're really great.
We must use an element when we mount a motorcycle.
You stole my heart.
You're okay, aren't you?
You're gonna freak out the words of my mouth.
Do you ever love her with a woman?
You'll find other words you can help us.
You're gonna live soon enough.
