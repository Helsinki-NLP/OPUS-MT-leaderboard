Members of the Welsh Assembly are concerned about what will be "associated with maps"
Some CHA fears the recommendation to change the name of their office to the ‘Member of the Welsh Parliament’ (MWP).
This recommendation was made through plans to change the name of the Assembly to Parliament Wells.
THE whole political spectrum is worried that it can make fun of it.
One CHA of the labists said his group was worried about the Romans with Twp and Pwp.
For readers beyond the Welsh border: "twp" means "unmovable" and "pwp" means a failure.
CHA from the Wells Party stated that his group in general was “not satisfied ” and offered alternatives.
One of the world’s conservatives said that his group was “unwarranted” about the change of name, but pointed out that MWP could quickly become a “mappet”.
In this context the word 'w' is similar to the English word 'u' in Yorkshire.
The Committee of the Assembly, which is now drafting legislation to change the name, noted: “The final decision on the new name of the members of the Assembly will certainly be taken by the members themselves. ”
The Wells Self - Government Act of 2017 gives the Welsh Assembly the right to change its name.
In June the Commission published the results of the public discussion of the proposals, and the name of the Assembly in Parliament was widely supported.
As for the name CHA, the Commission proposes to call them "members of the Welsh Parliament", i.e. WMP, but the MWP option received the highest public support.
Of course, the CHA offers alternatives, but efforts to reach agreement may lead to problems with the main Elin Jones, who should be given a bill for a few weeks.
The reform legislation will include other changes to the work of the Assembly, including the rules governing the separation of the CHA and the structure of the committee system.
THE final vote will take place on their new name when they are discussed by law.
Macedonians will vote in a referendum on the change in the name of the country
On Sunday the election will be held on whether to change the name of the country to the Republic of Northern Macedonia.
The vote was organized in order to resolve a long - term dispute with neighboring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
The Affinians have long claimed that the name of their northern neighbors is a claim in Greece, and they have repeatedly spoken against Macedonian members of the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President George Ivanov, speaking against a referendum on the name change, said that the results of the vote would be ignored.
However, the speakers to the referendum, among which Prime Minister Zoran Zeev says that the change in the name is simply a price that needs to be paid for EU and NATO entry.
The calls of St. Martin are silent because the churches of Harlem are experiencing difficult times
"The old people I met say there was a bar and church here in every corner before," said Mr. Adams.
Now there is nothing else."
He thinks that the disappearance of bars can be understood:
"In our time people are socializing differently.
At least it is no longer such a local toilet where they go on a regular basis.”
As for the churches, Adams is afraid that the money from the sale of assets will not last as long as the leaders expect, and “they will soon appear where they started. ”
The churches, he added, could replace homes with condoms, and there would be people who would not help the saints who remained nearby.
"The majority of people who buy condoms in these houses will be white," Adams explained, "so this will speed up the day when all these churches are closed, because it is unlikely that most people who move to condoms will be their descendants."
Both churches were built by white communities before the black metropolis was formed: The metropolitan church was built in 1870 and the St. Martin — ten years after it.
The crown was the methodist community that came out in the 1930's.
The black community that was conducting the procession soon acquired the right to own the building.
St. Martin moved to the black community under the direction of a similar John Howard Johnson, who led the fight of retail dealers on 125th Street, the main street of Harlem, who did not want to hire blacksmiths and raise them to service.
In 1939 a fire badly damaged the building, but Johnson’s father wanted to restore it and set it up a coal mine.
Similar to David Johnson, his son and successor to Johnson's father in St. Martin, he proudly called it "the call of the poor".
An expert who played on the Caribbean in July called it "cultural treasure" and "exchangeable historical instrument".
This expert, Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the first in the world to be played by black musicians, Dionysio A. Lind, who spent 18 years in the larger realm of the Riverside church.
According to Mr. Merrevezer, there was no replacements for him in St. Martin.
What's going on in St. Martin over the last few months is a complex story of architects and organizers, some of which were held by church leaders, others by the Episcopal Episcopal Episcopal Episcopal.
In July, the Council, a leading parishioner of Mirjana, wrote that it was concerned that the epirth would “try to spend ” the joy of not participating in the hire of architects and organizers who had sent the eprahic.
Some parishioners complained that there was no window on the part of the Epic.
Acula was traumatized by a 13-year-old boy who ran after the Lobsters in California.
According to officials, on Saturday, the shark attacked a 13-year-old boy and raped him.
An attack took place about 7: 00 a.m. near the beach of Bicon in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told the KSWB-TV channel in San Diego that on Saturday morning he had already spent nearly half an hour with his friends when he heard that the boy wanted help, and together with the group came to him to get out of the water.
At first, Hammel thought it was just getting caught up in the lobby, but then he realized that the boy was shouting: “I’ve been tried!
They have put me to the test."
As soon as he reached the boy, he saw that his key was completely broken.
"I called everyone to get out of the water, "In the water of the shark!" Hammel added.
The boy was transferred to a gintocrylic hospital at the Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he is in critical condition.
The type of shark that has been attacked is unknown.
Captain Larry Jaels told the media briefing that a few weeks ago in this area he noticed the shark, but it was established that it was not relevant to dangerous types of sharks.
Jailz added that the victim suffered from trauma at the top of the tube.
For 48 hours, the government has closed access to the beach from the beach of Ponto in Casablada to Swama in Encinati.
He noted that there are more than 135 kinds of sharks in this area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's planning to go out on the British space market
Sainsbury's is going to compete with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams by means of space-like islands like those in the universe.
As part of a forced exit to the British cosmetic market, the cost of 2.8 billion pounds of sterlings (the increase continues when sales of clothing and household goods are reduced) increases in cosmetics will be protested in 11 shops throughout the country. The next year, if the idea is successful, the islands will appear in other stores.
Investments in space are related to the fact that supermarkets are looking for ways to use the field space that was previously used under television, microchip and household goods.
In Sainsbury's, they said that they would double the range of cosmetics and propose to 3,000 goods, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The existing L'Oreal, Maybeline and Burt's Bees are getting more space: there are brand zones, like those in stores on almost Boots.
The Supermarket also updates the Boutique Space Assortment: Most of the goods presented will now not be protested against animals, which are increasingly required by young buyers.
In addition, the retail retailer Fragrance Shop is protesting his flights in two Sainsbury's stores: the first flight was opened in Crodon, northern London, last week, and the second was in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Internet shopping and shopping for small amounts of food each day in small shops will require supermarkets to report additional efforts to connect visitors.
Mike Kupe, executive director of Saninsbury's, said their stores would become more universal because the supermarket network is trying to resist Aldi's and Lidl's discounts with more services and non-food goods.
Sainsbury's opens the Argos departments in hundreds of their stores, as well as open a number of Habits departments. Sainsbury's bought both networks two years ago and says it increased sales of food goods, as well as made both networks more profitable.
The previous attempt to update the cosmetics and pharmaceuticals department failed.
Sainsbury's tested collaboration with Boots at the beginning of the 2000s, but she ended up after arguing about how to divide income from appetite into supermarkets.
The new strategy appeared after Sainsbury's sold his appetite business (281 appetites) Celesio, owner of Lloyds Pharmacy network, for 125 million pounds of sterling three years ago.
They agreed that Lloyds would help to add an expanded range of luxury leather brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four shops.
Paul Mills-Hix, commercial director of Sainsbury, said: “We have changed the appearance of our outer islands with space to make the atmosphere more pleasant for buyers.
We also invested in specialized consultants who could give advice.
The range of brands we present is called for to meet any needs, and the pleasant situation and convenient places of location mean that we are now an attractive place to buy cosmetics, which will become a competition for the old way of buying."
Peter Jones was "dissolved" because Hallie Willowby was out of the agreement worth 11 million pounds of sterling
The "Ligvo Dragon" star Peter Jones "dissolved" because television broadcaster Holly Willowby agreed with his brand of goods for life (the value of the deal is 11 million pounds of sterling) to focus on new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV
Willowbie doesn't have time for a home suit and Truly accessories.
Business money was linked to the Goop Gunett Peltrow brand.
The 37-year-old director of this Morning program announced his entry into Instagram.
Holly Willowby brought the "Ligvo Dracon" star, Peter Jones, to the point that at the last moment she came out of their profitable business of life to focus on new successful contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Gerela reports that Jones "distinct" when a gold girl from the television came into contact during a forced meeting at the Johns's business district headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, her new deal with 1.5 million pounds of sterling means that she no longer has enough time to dedicate her to their common brand of Truly clothes and accessories.
This business was linked to the Goop Gunett Peltrow brand and had to double Willowby's article, which is estimated at 11 million pounds of sterling.
When 37 - year - old Willowby reported in Instagram that he was leaving Truly, Jones flew out of Britain to one of his restrooms.
“ Truly was no doubt the main priority of Holly, ” reported the source.
He had to become her long - term future for the next few decades.
Willowby’s decision to leave the business made it difficult for all interested parties.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday, almost prior to the start.
At the headquarters in Marlow, there's a lot of stuff ready for sale.
Experts believe that the entrance of the former This Morning, one of Britain’s most highly prized stars, could cost millions of companies through large investments in goods (from underpants and candles to clothes and household clothes) and create further delays in running.
It can also mean the end of a long friendship.
The mother of three children, Willowby and her husband, Dan Boldwin, were close to Jones and his wife, Tari Kapp for ten years.
Willowby and Kapp created Truly in 2016, and 52-year-old Jones joined as head of the government in March.
In addition to celebrating the festival, Jones has ruled 40 percent of the shares of the Bolduin company, which is operated by television industry.
Willowby will become Ambassador of the M&S brand and will replace Anthony Macparttlin as I'm A Celebrate on ITV.
Sourcelo, who approached Jones last night, said: “We won’t comment on his case. ”
"And then we fell in love"
He was critical of the media for a comment that would be considered “non-presiding ” as well as for a very positive attitude toward North Korea’s leader.
"Why did President Trump go to such great proceedings?,"
said Trump, imitating the voice of the next newsman. —
I did not go to any steps."
He noted that who was interested in the second meeting after Trump called their first meeting in Singapore in June to a great step toward the denuclearization of North Korea.
But the negotiations on denuclearization went into the earmarked corner.
More than three months after a red summit in Singapore, a leading North Korean diplomat, Ri Young Ho, told world leaders at the UN General Assembly that North Korea does not see "the appropriate response" from the United States to its first deployment.
Instead, he noted that the United States continues to receive sanctions aimed at supporting pressure.
In speaking out in his own tongue, Trump was much more optimistic.
“ We have a good relationship with North Korea, ” he said.
We were going to fight in North Korea.
Millions of people would be killed.
Now we have such a wonderful relationship.’
He said that his efforts aimed at improving Kim’s relationship led to positive results: the end of the rocket tests, the release of the hostages, and the return of the rest of the American military personnel.
He also protected his extraordinary approach when he spoke of his relationship with Kim.
"It's so easy to act as presidential, but instead of 10,000 people on the street trying to get into this battle stage, we have about 200 people standing right there," Trump said, pointing to the crowd right in front of him.
The tsunamis and earthquakes in Indonesia destroyed hundreds of dead islands
In particular, after the earthquake in Lombo, international non - vulnerable organizations were said to be in need of help.
Although there have been more than 10 percent of the population of Lomboka, the national disaster has not been announced, and this is a prelude to international aid.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they have made it clear that they are not looking for international assistance, so it is difficult," said Mrs. Sumbung.
Although the Return of the Children collects a command to travel to Paul until it is not known if foreign personnel are able to work in the area.
Mr. Sutopo, representative of the national disaster relief agency, said that the Indonesian government is assessing the situation in Paul to determine whether to allow international organizations to provide assistance.
In view of what is happening regularly in Indonesia, the country remains extremely unrecognizable to nature’s heat.
In the province of Ache there are tunnels built, but they are not of any nature for other harbors.
The absence of a serious warning about tsunamis in Paul’s day was evident, although the warning was likely effective, likely to help the dead.
Moving between the many Indonesian islands is not just at the best time.
The damage caused by these disasters is even more complex.
The medical ship that lived in Lombok to treat the victims of earthquakes is swimming to Paul, but it can reach a new disaster at least three days later.
President Jack Wiiddo made improvements in Indonesia’s infrastructures on the basis of his election campaign and increased road and rail costs.
But the lack of funding has created problems for Mr. Joe’s administration, who is planning to rehabilitate next year.
Mrs. Joko also emphasizes the long - term interconfessed enemy in those parts of Indonesia, where the majority of Muslims chose a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed, tens of thousands were thrown out of their homes as a result of the resistance of Christian and Muslim gangs to the streets using swords, spears, rifles, and other primitive weapons.

I also ask everyone, especially taxi drivers, who could take something from the video recorder, to contact us because the information on these videos can be very important for our investigation."
The police officer confirmed that the woman whose body had been found was living in Birkenhad and was found in the house.
Today, on the second half of the day, friends who think they know a woman came to the crime scene to ask where she was found this morning.

The state of Cromwell near Parliament becomes a new memory that suffers from "recording history"
The removal of the status would be due to the destruction in the Taliban style of many of England's cultural and religious artifacts performed by its fanatical Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Society called Mr. Cricka's proposal "mature" and "an attempt to re-write history".
John Goldsmith, head of the Cromwell Society, said: "By taking into account the current debate on the removal of the status quo, what Oliver Cromwell's status at the Westminster Palace has become a blend has been irrevocable."
Economies during the British Civil War did not perform either Cromwell himself or at his command.
Cromwell may not have been responsible for the actions of his predecessor Thomas in the first century.
The great statue of Cromwell Skulptor William Hamo Torneycroft is a testimony to the trend of the 19th century and part of the history of becoming, which, many believe, is still worthy of respect.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Many people probably consider Cromwell a protector from the outside press, in his case, of course, monarchy.
Whether such an idea is completely accurate is the subject of historical debates that are taking place.
There is no doubt that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century has defined the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is one of the most famous positions that represents one side of this conflict.
His achievement as Lord-Protector should also be marked and respected."
The killer's pig has lost a Chinese farmer to death
According to local media reports, the farmer was attacked and killed by a pig on the market in southern China.
A man who was only identified by the name of Yuan was found dead in blood with a broken artery near the market in Lebanon, the province of Guajicho, reported the South China Morning Post on Sunday.
In Sydney, China, on May 30, 2005, a pig is being vaccinated in a pigyard.
It is reported that in the middle he went out with his twin brother from the nearby province of Yunnan to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, the brother found his dead brother and saw that the door of the prison was open.
The brother noticed that there was a large cabin with blood on the floor.
The medical expert confirmed that a 249-kilogram caban destroyed the farmer until his death.
“ My twin brother’s legs were in the blood and were turned into blood, ” said the two - tribe brother who suffered with the name Vu, who was quoted as being quoted as Guiyang Evening News.
The record of the security cameras showed that John entered the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to accommodate his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The beast that killed a man was not part of John’s half brother or half brother.
The Market Manager told Evening News that when the police collected evidence at the scene, the pig was closed to prevent its attack on people.
It is acknowledged that I am the seven who are Juan and the market administration discussing the death penalty.
It is rare, though, that cases of snake attacks have been reported in advance.
In 2016 the pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts and hit a man with critical injuries.
Ten years before that pig weight of 295 pounds [295 kg], the egg farmer was pressed into the tractor until the farmer’s wife was not afraid of the animal.
After a farmer from Oregon ate his own pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba said CBC News that pigs were usually not aggressive, but the taste of blood could be a "trigger".
"They're just playing.
They're like children, very sensitive... they don't want to hurt you.
You should simply treat them with proper respect, ” he said.
The remains of the hurricane Rosa will bring widespread floods to the southwestern United States
As it has been predicted, hurricane Rose is weakened by moving over the colder waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, in the near future, Rosa will bring rain with its branches north of Mexico and south-west of the United States.
Rose had a small wind speed of 137 km per hour (this hurricane category 1) at 5:00 a.m. on Sunday and was 620 km south-west of Punta-Evgina, Mexico.
It is expected that Rosa will go north on Sunday.
At that time over the Pacific Ocean, a contribution is being made to the east of the U.S. coast. As Rose approaches the South of California on Monday in the shape of a tropical storm, she begins to pump a strong tropical vegetarian in the north to the south of the United States.
On Monday, Rosa will bring up to five inches [25.4 cm] of rain in some parts of Mexico.
In the near future, tropical heat, which is linked to the nearby volcano, will cause strong floods in the southwestern part of the country.
In this area from 2,54 to 10,2 inches [2,54 - 10,2 cm] of rain causes dangerous floods, empty rivers, and the possibility of drying out in the desert.
A strong tropical storm will result in an increase in the number of accidents between 5 and 7.6 cm per hour, especially in some parts of the south of Nevada and Arizona.
5-10.2 cm of rain is expected in some parts of the south-west, especially in the considerable area of Arizona.
The liquid particles are likely to worsen when the conditions are severed by the widespread nature of tropical rain.
We are happy not to go to the desert, as possible tropical waste.
Heavy rain can cause cannons to melt down, and the gases will bring in the damages of wind and dust.
In some parts of northern California’s coast, the approach will cause heavy rain.
The number of accidents can exceed 1,27 cm, which can result in a weak flow of garbage and roads.
This will be the first liquid in the region in the rain season.
Some broken tropical wastes will begin to approach Arizona late on Sunday and in the morning on Monday, and at night on Monday and Friday rain will become more widespread.
A strong rain will go over For Corners from the center.
In October, intense temperatures can be observed throughout the United States, since Arctic is colder, but tropical temperatures remain quite warm.
Sometimes this leads to severe temperature fluctuations in short distances.
The week will be a wonderful example of the relatively low temperatures in the central part of the United States.
It's almost 7 degrees difference between Kansas City, Missouri and Omahah, Nebraska, and also between St. Louis and De Mouns, Iowa.
Over the next few days, the summer heat is again trying to return and expand.
It is expected that in a large area of central and eastern America, temperatures will be 27 degrees Fahrenheit [- 27 ° C] from the south to some of the north.
The temperature in New York can reach 27 degrees Celsius per second, about 12 degrees Fahrenheit [12 ° C] above the average temperature.
According to our long-term weather forecast, there is a high probability of an increase in average temperatures in the eastern part of the United States in the first half of October.
More than 20 million people have watched a hearing on Bretta Cavano’s case
Four times more than 20 million people on the six television networks have been watched by the impressive testimony of a candidate to the position of Supreme Court judge Brett Cavano and Christine Blaise Ford, a woman who accused him of sexual violence, which appeared to have happened in the 1980s.
The political opposition continued, the channels interrupted planned programs to report on the last news of Friday: an agreement prepared by Senator Arisone Jeff Fleek to conduct a one-week investigation into charges.
Ford told the Senate's Court Committee that she was 100 percent sure that Kawano was drinking her drink and trying to get off her clothes at dinner at the senior school.
Cavano, in his emotional testimony, said that he was 100 percent convinced that it was not.
It is unlikely that on Friday more than 20.4 million people were watching what Nielsen's research company reported.
The company calculated the average audience of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
It was not possible to get data directly from other networks that also showed listening, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
In Nielsen, too, there are problems with measuring the number of people watching television in offices.
For comparison, then the audience size is similar to the audience that is seen by the play-off series match or the Oscar premium.
Fox News Channel, whose views were strongly supported by Cavano’s mission, was the leader of all the channels during the entire day’s hearing, with an average number of 5.69 million spectators, recorded in Nielsen.
ABC was the second of 3.26 million spectators.
According to Nielsen, CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC - 2.94 million, MSNBC - 2.89 million, CNN - 2.52 million.
The interest remained high after listening.
Flyk became the central role of the fifth drama.
After that, on Friday morning, CNN and CBS cameras identified how protesters were shouting at Flickr when he tried to go to the elevator to listen to the Court's hearing.
He stood with his eyes open for a few minutes, during which his layman was transferred directly to CNN.
“ I am standing right in front of you, ” said one woman.
Do you think he's telling the truth?
They said to him, "You have authority over us, and we have authority over many women."
Flyk reported that his office had published a statement and, before closing the letter, added what he would say to the committee’s audience.
All cable and broadband channels said that they would be transferred directly hours later when the Court Committee had to vote on the candidature of Cavano to vote for the Senate in full.
Fleck said he'd do this only if he knew that the FBI was looking at a complaint against a candidate next week, which requires a democratic minority.
Flyka partially convinced his friend, Senator-Democrat Chris Kuns.
After a discussion with Kunsa and then with several other senators, Flyk made a decision.
The choice of Flickr had an impact, since it was evident that the Republicans would not have votes to appoint the candidacy of Cavanos without investigation.
President Trump initiated an FBI investigation into the defendant against Cavanaugh.
British Prime Minister Teresa May accuses critics of "political games" around Bressit
In an interview with the Sunday Times Prime Minister Teresa May, she accused the critics of her plans to leave the European Union in "political games" with future British and national interests.
On September 29, 2018, Prime Minister of Great Britain, Teresa May arrived at the conference of the Conservative Party in Birmingham, Great Britain.
In another interview with Terezie's interview on the first page of the newspaper, her former prime minister, Boris Johnson, criticized her so-called Czechs plan on Bressit, saying that proposing Britain and the EU would target one "absolutely absurd".
Who shot Wade Sims: The police arrested Dayton Simpson for suspecting the death of a player at the University of Louisiana
The police arrested a suspect in a shooting that led to the death of Wade Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player from the University of Louisiana.
The 20-year-old Dayton Simpson was arrested and sent to the police department in Baton Rouge.
The authorities published a video of the controversy between Simsom and Simpson, and the police said that Sims lost his eye during the war.
According to a related CBS TV WAFB, the police removed the crime scene and noted that Simpson's DNA had been found on them.
When Simpson was questioned, the police reported that he had admitted that he had shot Wade.
According to the lawyer, his salary was $350,000.
The East Baton Rouge office opened on Friday a preliminary statement indicating that the cause of death is a fire wound to both the head and the neck.
The Department expresses its appreciation to the police department for the search for refugees from the state of Louisiana, the state police station, the South University police and local citizens for the investigation that led to the arrest.
The sports director of the University of Louisiana, Jo Alleva, thanked local law enforcement authorities for their “anxiety and desire for justice. ”
Samsu was 20 years old.
Forvard grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball at the University of Louisiana.
During the last season, its average result was 5.6 ballasts and 2.6 teams.
On Friday morning, a basketball coach at the University of Louisiana City, Will Wade, said that the command was "damaged" and "shocked" by Wade's death.
“ It’s what worries you all the time, ” said Wade.
Volcanic eruptions in Mexico
The populace of Popocabettel reaches the southern regions of Mexico’s capital.
The National Natural Disaster Prevention Center on Saturday urged Mexicans to stay away from the volcano, since the crater started activity and 183 gas and soil emissions were registered within 24 hours.
The center followed a number of noises and mails.
The picture on social media shows the thin skin of the ashes on the lobby of cars in Mexico’s neighborhoods, such as Hochimillo.
The geologists noted the increased activity of the volcano, which is 45 miles (72 km) south of the capital, after the earthquake, 7.1 hit central Mexico in September 2017.
Volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
The police met with the Catalan separatists in front of the polls for independence
Six men were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after protestors who were acting independently met with the police department. Thousands joined protestors' demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of the Catalan division vote.
The proseparatist group in masks where specialists controlled them with eggs and fur color, which created dark clouds of chicken in the streets where tourists were most commonly called.
The police used the police to stop the aggression.
After a few hours, a group of independent people who complained, "We won't forget, we won't forgive."
According to a local press report, 40 people were helped by the simple traumas suffered during protests.
The year after the referendum on October 1, which Madrid recognized as illegal, is marked by Catholic separatists, the tension in the region that desires independence remains high.
The election was largely determined by independence, but the vote was weak, since most opposition to the division were opposed to voting.
According to the Catholic government, almost 1,000 people were injured in violent encounters last year as a result of police efforts to stop voting in electoral districts throughout the region.
The independence groups spent the night on Friday in an attempt to prevent demonstrations in support of the national police.
The demonstration took place, but it was forced to follow another route.
68-year-old Narcissian Termes, an electrician who participated in a separatist protest with his wife, said that he no longer had any hope that Catalonia could get independence.
"Last year we survived one of our best moments.
I watched my parents cry out for joy that they can vote, but now we are in a corner. ”
Despite the importance of life, but very difficult to win the regional elections in December last year, the Catholic parties which are independent were unable to keep the momentum of this year because many of their most famous leaders are in voluntary exile or in prison awaiting trial for their participation in the referendum and further declared independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanism that took a protest to support the police on the phone, said that the conflict was caused by both sides of the conflict.
“ The marriage is getting stronger, ” he said.
On Saturday, Orion Hunkers, one of the nine Catholic leaders who are in a follow-up isolate since the end of last year, announced that he will be voting for the European Parliament next year.
"The status of a candidate at European elections is the best way to condemn the regression of democratic values and repression we observe from the Spanish government," he said.
Londoners: The men were arrested after the car went into the house.
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 were arrested after the car several times entered the house in London.
The incident took place at the Ballinagard-Crescent at 4:30 p.m. at the British standard time.
Detective Bob Blemmings noted that the door was damaged and the building itself.
It is possible that at some point in the car, they were shot out of the aircraft.
Mangi's hit provided the "Livingstone" victory over "Rangeers" with account 1-0
The first valley of Dolly Mangi in the "Livingstone" has become a triumph
A high school student in Livingstone denounced the Rangers and brought Steven Gerard a second score of 18 games as the director of the Aybros club.
The fall of Dolly Mengi proved decisive: command Harry Holta was up to one level with the Hibernian.
Commander Gerard won no victory on his way out to Premier League this season, and next week he plays with the leaders of Harts from which she leaves at eight o'clock.
Before this, the fourth Rangers will accept the Rapid Vidney within the European League.
At that time, Livingstone continued to move on to six games in the district, and Chief Coach Holt had not won any prizes since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingstone offers the chance of giving incapacitating guests.
Commander Holta was supposed to be long before they were killed because their directness is causing the Rangers all the problems.
Scott Robinson passed through the defense, but he hit the door long, and then Alan Lettgo knocked on the door after he had pushed and accepted the attack by Craig Halkett at the door he had made with his head.
The lords were pleased that they allowed the Rangers to play before them, and they knew that they could solve the problems of standardized guests.
And there was a decisive wave of death.
The Rangers missed a free strike, and Livingstone made an opening, Declan Galler and Robinson acted against Meng who took the sword and killed it from the criminal center.
By this time, the Rangers had ruled as a ruling sword, but the protection of the peasants of the field had proved to be unstoppable for them, and Liam Kelly's doorman was no longer concerned.
This trend continued in the second stage, although Alfredo Morelos was able to hit Kelly.
Scott Pittman's attack took place at the foot of the Rangers Major Godine McGregor. Litgo hit the door in another standard combination of Livingstone.
The sailors were constantly flying into the punishment of Livingstone and were constantly neutralized, and two applications on the panel — after Halkett’s attack on Glenna Middleton — were fired.
Livingstone phenomenon: analysis
Alasday Lamont from BBC Scotland at Toni Macaroni Arena
Fenomenal game and results "Livingstone".
They all played differently, they continued to increase their expectations of this eastern trajectory.
Their style of game and composition has not changed practically after returning to the highest level, but should be given to Holt's due for how he mobilized the team after his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett played a grand, well - organized defense, and Menga forced Connor Goldson and Joe Worral to remain vigilant.
The Rangers, however, had no inspiration.
They used to play very well under the guidance of Gerard, but now they are far from being in touch with those standards.
They didn’t have enough last match — only once they missed the field guard — and that was something like the warning for the Rangers, which was found in the middle of the table.
Erdotan received a lot of attention in Kelney
On Saturday (September 29th), when the Turkish and German leaders met in Berlin, there was a smile and a blue sky.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, aimed at restoring relations between NATO allies.
Among them were issues such as human rights, freedom of the press, and Turkey’s accession to the EU.
Then Erdogan moved to Kelna to open a huge new dream.
The city is home to the most Turkish population beyond the Turkish border.
The police didn't allow 25,000 people to meet in front of the meeting, but many of the president's guests were still around to see him.
Hundreds of protests against Erdogan — including many Kurds — have also forced themselves to hear what they have to hear, condemning Erdogan’s policy and the German government’s decision to invite him to the country.
Bilateral protests testify to the uniqueness of the guest, some of whom German Turks called heros, and others as dictators.
Road accident in Depford: A passenger died in a car crash
A bicycle driver died in a car crash in London.
The accident took place near the Bezivid Street and Evelyn Street crossing the narrow road in the Deptford area in the southeastern city about 10:15 a.m. in the British standard time.
The car stopped, and paramedics arrived at the scene, but the man died.
This accident occurred a few months after another passenger died after running from an accident on the Chalanders Street, about 1.6 km from a Saturday accident.
The London police said he was working on a man’s establishment to inform his closest relatives.
The traffic has been banned and bus routes have been changed, and car drivers are advised to avoid this area.
Long-Lartine Prison: Six Prisoners Under Attack · Global Voices
Six prison staff were injured as a result of a man-in-law strike, the prison administration reported.
Her Majesty Long-Lartin prison in Woostershire began about 09:30 a.m. for the British standard time on Sunday and still lasts.
In order to stop the infection, started by eight prisoners and placed in one wing, a special section of Tornado was called.
Officials were given medical assistance in connection with the minor facial injuries that occurred.
The representative of the prison service commented: "In order to resolve the incident in the prison of Her Majesty Long-Lartin, a specially prepared prison staff has been arrested.
Six employees received medical assistance in connection with traumas.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and we clearly understand that the police will be sent to the police and that the length of their stay on the streets can be extended."
Her Majesty Long Lartine prison has more than 500 prisoners, including the most dangerous offenders in the country.
It was reported in June that the prison chief was sent to the hospital after the attack.
In October last year, the police were summoned to the prison to stop serious disturbances during which prisoners were attacked by billions of prisoners.
Uragan Rosa is threatening Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake Sites by means of floods (can be useful in vulnerable areas)
Tropical depression rarely strikes Arizona, but it can occur at the beginning of the next week, as the remaining hurricane of Rose is heading south through the desert, creating a risk of floods.
The National Weather Service has already issued warnings about the floods on Monday and Tuesday in the territory of West Arizona to South and East Nevada, South-East California and Yuti, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It is expected that Rosa will go straight through Phoenix on Tuesday, and on Monday evening she will be raining.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix noted on Twitter that only ten tropical cycles have saved the status of tropical heat or depression within 200 miles (322 km) from Phoenix since 1950,
and Catrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles (64.4 km) north of Arizona.
According to the latest estimates of the National Centre of hurricanes, in the region of Mogollon-Rome in Arizona, it is expected to be from 5.08 to 10.16 cm and up to 15.24 cm of land.
Other areas of the south-west desert, including the central part of the Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, are likely to be from 2,54 to 5,08 cm west, possibly up to 10,16 cm.
Where there is no risk of flooding, Rosie’s rain can be a blessing because the region suffers from drought.
Although bees are a very serious problem, some of these evils are likely to be beneficial because the south-west is now experiencing drought.
According to the U.S. Center for Disease Control, at least 40 percent of Arizona’s territory suffer from extreme drought, which is the second highest category of drought, reports weather.com.
First of all, the path of the hurricane Rose leads to drought on the Mexican peninsula of South California.
Rosa, still in force on Sunday morning with a maximum wind speed of 137 km per hour, is 620 km south of Punta Evgenia, Mexico, and moves north with a speed of 19.3 km per hour.
The cherries meet with more colder water in the Pacific and thus weaken.
Thus, it is expected that in the case of tropical heat on the day or in the evening, hurricanes will cause drought in Mexico.
The number of accidents in some parts of Mexico may be significant that poses a significant risk to crops.
“It is expected that the total number of incidents from South California to the north-west Sonori will be 7.62 to 15.24 cm, possibly up to 25.4 cm,” reports weather.com.
Next, Rosa will go north through Mexico as a tropical storm, reach north of Arizona early in the morning as a tropical depression, which will continue through Arizona, and later in the afternoon, she will reach southern Yuti.
"The main danger expected by Rosie or her remnants is the very heavy rain in South California, the North-West Sonora and the South-West of the American Desert," reports the National Centre for hurricanes.
It is expected that these rains will lead to life - threatening floods and floods in deserts, as well as droughts in mountain areas.
Attack in Midsomer-Norton: Four persons arrested who had been shot for murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested for suspicion of murder after they found a 16-year-old boy with knife wounds in Somerset.
An early teenager was found in the Exxelsier-Terras area in Midsomer-Norton about 4:00 a.m. on the British standard time Saturday.
He was taken to a hospital where he remained in a stable.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and 20-year-old men were arrested last night in the Radstock area, reported by the Eivona and Somerset police.
The police are asking everyone who can have any video of these events on the phone.
Tripp says that Cavano "tolerance and anger" of the Democratic Party
“ The Cavano vote is a voice against the ruthless and violent tactics of the Democratic Party, ” said Trump at the rally in Wiling, West Virginia.
Tripp said that the Cavano "endurance and anger" of the Democratic Party during the entire process of lifting.
Cavano witnessed before the Congress in four, independent and emotionally opposed Christine Blaise Ford’s conviction that he had been sexually violent over her for decades when they were teenagers.
Ford also gave a witness to the hearing of the charges against her.
On Saturday, the President said that on that day “the American people saw the closeness, character and courage” of Cavano.
“ A vote by the Cavano court is one of the most perfect lawyers of our time, a lawyer with an uneducated public service experience, ” he said to a group of delegates in West Virginia.
The president made a note of Cavano’s withdrawal when he spoke of the importance of the Republican elections.
"In five weeks, one of the most important choices in our life will be made.
I don’t run, but I really run,” he said.
That's why I'm fighting for great candidates everywhere."
Tripp claimed that the mission of democracy was “to resist and stop. ”
It is expected that the first key procedural vote in the Senate on the candidacy of Cavano will take place on Friday, CNN said one of the leaders of the Republican.
Hundreds of people have died from earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia, and the number of victims increases
At least 384 people died, many fell into the ocean when giant waves swept across the beach as a result of intense earthquakes and tsunamis on the Indonesian island of Solaves, the country’s government declared on Saturday.
Hundreds of people were resting at the beach festival in Paul’s city on Friday when they stood up to six feet (18 feet) above the ground, killing many at death and destroying everything on their way.
The tsunamis occurred after an earthquake of 7.5 degrees Fahrenheit [- 7.5 ° C].
"When the tsunami hit yesterday, people were still busy on the beach and didn't start running, and they became victims," said the Indonesian agency's representative at Jakarta Sutopo Purvo Nugroho, president of the disaster relief agency (BNPB).
"It wasn't just tuna, it was driving cars, trees, buildings, it hit everything on the dry ground," Nugrocho said, adding that, before hitting the coastal line, the tsunamis crossed the open sea at 800 km/year (497 km/year).
To survive the tsunami, some people walked down the trees and survived.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Aerophotosms published by a disaster relief agency show that many buildings and shops are destroyed, bridges are destroyed and destroyed, and water is flooded.
Posts in the coastal city continued on Saturday.
A number of earthquakes have occurred in areas where 2.4 million people live.
The Indonesian Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPPT) stated that the energy released by a major earthquake on Friday was 200 times more than the nuclear bomb fired at Hiroshima during World War II.
The geographical location of the city, located at the end of a long, narrow bay, could have contributed to the power of tsunamis, says the agency.
Nogroho called the “large - scale ” disaster and noted the destruction of thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centers, and hotels.
The bodies of some victims were found under the walls of the destroyed building, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing without a message.
Noah observed that victims and injuries could be more than 300 km (190 miles) along the coastal line north of Paul in the area called Donggal, which is closer to the earth’s epicenter.
"Communication lines were completely damaged, and we didn't get any information," said Nogrocho.
More than 300,000 people live there, says the Red Cross, and adds that its staff and volunteers have gone to the affected areas.
“It’s already a tragedy, but it can become much more, ” says the report.
The agency received a broad criticism on Saturday that it did not report that the tsunami hit Paul, although official figures said that the minutes had arrived at the time marked by the warning.
On the ammo that people shared in social networks, it is evident that a man at the top of the house utters shocking warnings about the approaching tsunamis on the street under the building.
Within minutes, the wall of the water reached the shore, taking along buildings and cars.
Reuters could not verify the framework reality immediately.
The earthquake and the tsunami caused a serious evasion of electricity that had damaged the connection around Paul, which made it possible to coordinate the operation of the tunnel.
Soldiers began sending vandal planes with help from Jakarta and other cities, reports the authorities, but evacuated people still need food and other items of primary need.
The city airport has been opened for aid only, and it will be closed by October.
President Jack Wiiddo was to visit the evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
The number of tsunamis in Indonesia exceeds 800.
That's very bad.
The workers of the World Vision organization from Donghali reached the city of Paul, where they were hiding in the bronze tents set up at their office, but on the way they saw the destitution scenes, said Mr. Doseb.
“ They told me they saw a lot of destroyed houses, ” he shared.
That's very bad.
Even when relief groups began to take decisive action from disaster relief, some complained that foreign humanitarian workers were not allowed to travel to Paul with great experience.
According to Indonesian rules, funding, provision and provision of staff from the border may only begin if the place of disaster is declared by the national disaster zone.
This hasn't happened yet.
“ It’s still a disaster at the level of the province, ” noted Aulia Ariani, a representative of the Indonesian Red Cross.
As the government says, "All right, this is a national disaster," we can accept international assistance, but this status is not given until it is given."
The other night, after the fifth earthquake and tsunami, and the friends and family of those who had not yet been found, were still hoping that their presence would become a miracle that would enthralled these clouds of natural disasters.
On Saturday, the little boy got out of the canal.
On Sunday the rescuers found a woman who was lying under a stone with her mother’s body next to her.
Hendon Subbandon, trainer of the Indonesian National Paraplanerism team, trained two missing paraplanners to participate in the Asian Games that took place earlier this month in Indonesia.
Other parapolanists who came into the trap at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mrs. Mandage, were his disciples.
“ As an elder in paraplanerism, I have my emotional burden, ” he said.
Mr. Hendon relates how a few hours after the news of the destruction of the Roa Roa Hotel, which was spread among the parapolanists, he unexpectedly sent a message on WhatsApp's Opposers Paul, who participated in the beach festival.
However, his message was marked by only one horn, not two horns.
“ I think this means that the message was not delivered, ” he said.
The thefts took $26,750 during the filling of the Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, the theft took $26,750 into the Brink worker who had booked a banknote in Newport on the Levee, reported in the Newport Police Department.
The car was empty in a pleasure complex and was ready to add more money, wrote Detective Dennis McCarthy in the newspaper.
While he was busy, another man ran back to Brink’s colleague and stole a bag of money that was assigned to fill.
The Witnesses noticed a number of suspects who fled the crime scene, but the police did not indicate the number of incidents.
Anyone who has information on these persons should contact the Newport police under number 859-292-3680.
Canyon West: Reper changes its name on E
Reper Kanya West changes his name on E.
On Saturday, when he announced his change in Twitter, he wrote: “Before officially known as Kanya West. ”
41-year-old West was sometimes called E, and he used it as a shortcut for his album released in June.
The change occurred earlier in his show Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to present his new Yandhi album.
At the show, he replaces the singer, Arian Grande, who has canceled his participation for “emotional reasons, ” reports the director of the show.
It's not just a short summary of the current professional name, West said it had a religious meaning for it.
"I believe "he" is the most popular word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means "you," said West at the beginning of this year, discussing his album's name with the Big Boy student radio.
So I'm you, I'm us, I'm us.
Canyya, which means "one", was just like, "Yes" -- it's just a representation of our good, bad, dirty stuff.
The album is more of a reflection of who we are.
Kanya is one of several famous rappers who changed their name.
Sean Combs, previously known as Puff Daddy, P.D.D. and Daddy, this year he announced that he had chosen the names Lava and Bracer Lava.
His last colleague, J.J. Z., also experimented with a defiction and great letters.
Mexico President Andrés Manuel Lopez promises not to use the army against civilians
The newly elected President of Mexico, Andrés Manuel Lopes, promised never to use an army against civilians.
On Saturday on the Tlatelollco area, Lopes Obrador promised "never use an army to freeze the Mexican people".
On October 2, 1968, the army fired a peaceful demonstration on the ground, killing about 300 people, and then throughout Latin America, left student spirit was established.
Lopes Obrador promised to support young Mexicans by providing monthly grants to those who are studying and opening up more free state universities.
He noted that unemployment and lack of access to education lead young people to criminal groups.
The United States should double funding in the field of artificial intelligence
Since China is increasing its activity in the field of artificial intelligence, the United States should double the amount they spend on research in this area, considering the investment and practice in the CHI Kai-Fu Lee area that was working on Google, Microsoft and Apple.
These comments were made after various parts of the U.S. government made statements about the CHI, although there is no formal strategy in the US.
In the meantime, China presented its last year's plan: it wanted to become No. 1 by innovations in the CHI field by 2030.
"The double budget for the CHI research would be a good start, given that all other countries are far away from the United States, and we are preparing for the next CHI phase," said Lee.
The double funding could double increase the probability that the next major achievement in the CHI area will be made in the United States, Li said during the CNBC interview this week.
Lee, whose book "The Chinese People of China: Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month, Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the director general of the Sinovation Ventures Foundation, which invested in Face++, one of the most famous Chinese companies in China.
In the 1980s he worked at the University of Carnegie Mellon on the Chinese system, which played the best American player in Otello, and later was the executive director of Microsoft Research and the president of the China branch of Google.
They noted previous technological struggles by the U.S. government, such as the Robotics Challenge Agency for Advanced Defence Research (DARPA), and asked when they would be next to help identify future prospective participants.
Researchers in the United States often have to work hard to win government loans, says Lee.
"It's not China taking academic leaders, it's corporations," he noted.
Facebook, Google, and other technology companies in recent years have come to light from universities to work on the CHI.
According to Lee, changes in immigration policy can also help the United States to increase its efforts in the CHI field.
"I think the Green Card should automatically be offered to scientists in the CHI area," he said.
The State Council of China published its Plan for the Development of the Art of a New Generation in July 2017.
China's National Natural Science Fund is providing funding for people working in academic institutions, such as the National Scientific Fund and other U.S. government organizations, which lowers the quality of academic work in China, Lie said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Ministry of Defence has established a Joint Centre for Art Intelligence, which aims to connect industrial and academic partners, and White House has announced the creation of a Special Committee on Art.
Also this month in DARPA, 2 billion dollars was announced for investment in the AI Next initiative.
With regard to the National Scientific Foundation, it is now investing more than $100 million a year in the CHI research.
Among other things, the U.S. legislator who wanted to create the Commission from the national safety of artificial intelligence has not taken any steps over a few months.
Macedonians vote in referendums on the change in country names
The people of Macedonia voted on Sunday at a referendum on whether to change the name of the country to the “Republic of Northern Macedonia”, which would allow for a multi-year confrontation with Greece, which blocked the possibility of membership in the EU and NATO.
Greece, which has a province named Macedonia, claims that the name of the northern neighbor is a claim in its territory and has imposed veto on the entry of Macedonia into NATO and the EU.
In June, two governments signed an agreement on the basis of a new name proposed, but nationalist opposition to the agreement claimed that this change would disrupt the ethnic identity of the majority of Macedonians.
President George Ivanov said there would be no vote on the referendums, and the campaign of the boycott raised doubts as to whether there would be a 50 per cent minimum voter who would allow the referendum to be taken into account.
The question in the newsletter is, "Do you support NATO and EU membership under the terms of agreement with Greece?"
The representatives of the change in the name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zeev, claim that this is the price that Macedonia, one of the countries created after the fall of Yugoslavia, deserves to be paid for access to bodies such as the EU and NATO.
"I have come today to vote for a future country, for young Macedonians, so that it can live freely under the auspices of the European Union, because it means a safer life for all of us," said 79-year-old Oliver Georgievski in Skopje.
Although the voting results do not have legal obligations, enough Members of Parliament have said that they support it to make a decision.
Two thirds of the votes in Parliament will be required to change the name.
The National Electoral Commission stated that no reports of violations had been received until 13:00.
However, the threshold was only 16% compared to 34% of the last parliamentary elections in 2016 when 66% of registered voters dropped their ballots.
"I've come to vote for my children, our place in Europe," 62-year-old Gioze Tanevski said in Skopje's capital.
On September 30, 2018, in Strumicia, Macedonia, Prime Minister Zoran Zayev, his wife, Zorika and his son Dusko gave their vote in the referendum on the change in the name of the country, opening the way for entry into NATO and the European Union.
Before Parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov was preparing a small stage and setting up a table for ideas organized by those who will fight the referendum.
"We are NATO and the EU, but we want to come there with a proud head, not through the service door," Kavardarkov said.
We are poor countries, but we have dignity.
If they don't want to take us as Macedonia, we can turn to others, such as China and Russia, and become part of European-Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zeev believes that NATO membership will make many necessary investments in Macedonia, where unemployment is over 20%.
"I believe that the majority vote mainly because more than 80% of our citizens are going for the EU and NATO," Zeev said after the vote.
He pointed out that the result would be a confirmation of their future.
According to the study published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute of Political Studies, 30 to 43% of voters will be enrolled in the referendums, which is less than a necessary step.
According to another study conducted by the Macedonian Telma, 57 per cent of respondents are scheduled to vote on Sunday.
Seventy percent of them said they'd vote for it.
In order for the referendum to be recognized as effective, the vote should be 50% plus one vote.
The defeat of the referendum will be the first major hit by the policies of the Western government since its beginning in May last year.
See: Serhio Aguero from Manchester City goes through all the defenses of Briton and kills the goal
Serhio Aguero and Rahim Sterling went to Briton's defense and brought the Manchester City victory with account 2 to 0 on Saturday at the Ethihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Hol Aguero's 65-minute race seemed ridiculous.
The Argentinian attacker got his passport in the center of the field at the beginning of the investigation.
He walked between three Britons and entered the open field.
Then Aguero realized that he was surrounded by four greens.
He went to one of the guards, followed by a few more on the border of Briton.
Next he made a dog on the left when he saw Sterling.
The English forvard made the first touch on the punishment to give the sword Aguero, which his right booted him to the right side of the door, to defeat the giant Briton Matthew Ryan.
"Aguero has some leg problems," said the newspaper manager, "Site" Pope Guardiol.
We agreed he'd be playing 55 or 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We're glad he's lost his neck at this point."
But the initial victory of the heavenly-black in this game of Premier League provided Sterling.
It happened at 29 o'clock.
Aguero got a sword deep in Briton.
He sent a beautiful hunting dog along the left wing of Leroy Sane.
Leroy made several dots and continued to make the Sterling dog toward the next stage.
Forvard left a sword in the door like once before he woke up across the border.
The site will meet Hoffenheim at the group stage of the League of Champions at 12:55 on Tuesday at the Reyn-Nekkar-Arena Stadium in Zinsigma, Germany.
Sherner wants to take her eyes off Rocos
Since the Washington Nasionals team came out of playoff, there were no major reasons to wait for the tour start.
But the opposition of Shercer is expected to go to the Peter Hill on Sunday in the match against Colorado Rokis on conditions that Rokis will still have difficulties coming out to play. Now Rokis at a game ahead of Los Angeles Dogers in the National League of West.
"Rocos" has at least a field card to win with account 5-2 over "Nasionals" on Friday night, but they still want to sign the title of the first division.
"Even though we're playing neither, at least we'll be able to drop the sword, knowing how the viewers are leading here in Denver, and the other team will probably be playing at the highest level I've ever seen in this year.
Why would I not want to take part in this conflict?
"Nasionals" still announces who will be the starter on Sunday, but it is reported that they want to be Shercher.
The dancer for which it's going to be the 34th start was on Thursday having a peaching session and can play on Sunday, his usual way out.
The Washington right has 18-7 results from 2,53 ERA and 300 lines in 220 2/3 innings in this season.
Mitingi Trapa in West Virginia
The president spoke of the situation around his candidate to Supreme Court Brett Cavano when he spoke of the importance of the intervention of the Republicans in mid-term elections.
"All we have done will be placed on the map in November.
Five weeks later, one of the most important choices in our life will be made.
It’s one of the great, big ones — I’m not running, but I’m really running, so I’m fighting for great candidates wherever I can, ” he said.
Tripp continued: "You see this terrible, terrible radical group of Democrats, you see this happening right now.
And they're firmly set to return power using any means, you'll see subterfuge, corruption.
For those who suffer from them, through whom we have to go through to gain power and control, they want power and control, we are not going to give them."
A mission of Democrats, he said, "to resist and stop".
"And you will see it in the last four days," he said, calling Democrats "good and bad, good and bad."
He mentioned the Senate's Court Committee, calling Senator Dayan Fünstein on behalf of the Senate, which caused the audience to express discontent.
"Do you remember her answer?
You got a document?
Well, that's what.
No, well, no, I'm waiting -- it was really the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Leiborist Party is no longer a large church.
It does not belong to man who is walking even to direct his step. ”
When the Momentum activists in my local party voted to condemn me, it was almost hopeless.
Finally, I am the last of those Members of Parliament who have been told that they are not happy, and that's all because we're expressing our opinion.
To my colleague at Parliament, Joan Ryan was treated almost the same way because she was firmly opposed to anti-Semitism.
I was convicted of not agreeing with Jeremy Corbin.
The importance of a responsible economic policy on national security, on Europe, these issues are ironically similar to those that Jeremy did not agree with previous leaders.
"We want meetings to be inclusive and productive" in a report on the meeting of the Nottingham East.
Most of the Friday evening meetings of the General Committee for my eight years as a local member of Parliament of the Liberals were the same.
Unfortunately, many meetings today have a completely different tone, and the promise of “more kinder and softer” policies has long been forgotten if they have already begun to do so.
It becomes even more evident that the Leiborist Party does not allow different views, and each opinion is assessed from the position of whether it is acceptable for the party’s leadership.
This began soon after Jeremy became a leader, and colleagues with whom I seemed to have similar political views began to expect me to turn to 180 degrees and accept positions I would never agree with, whether national security or the only EU market.
Every time I do public speaking — and it doesn’t matter what I say — this is why there is a tendency to attack on social networks with calls for rejection, the trial of central politics, I'm told I shouldn’t be in the Leiborist Party.
And it's not just my experience.
I know I've been happier than some of my colleagues because I've been attracted to comments that are usually political.
I am impressed by the professionalism and determination of my colleagues who are dealing with the flows of sexual or racist attacks every day, but they never give up.
One of the most disheartening aspects of this political era is that equal abuses have become normal.
Jeremy Corbin stated last week that the Leiborist Party should develop a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer such a large church, and with each movement of "independence" or a change of party rules.
For the past two years, I have received much advice, and I have been called not to say so loud, so that “it was all right. ”
But I didn't get involved in politics.
I joined the lobbyists 32 years ago, and I was still in school because because of the lack of attention from the government of Tetcher my class was literally dissolved, since then I would like to improve the quality of public services for those who need them most, whether the local councillor or the government minister.
I have never hidden my policy, including in recent elections.
No one in the Nottingham East supported my political views and differences with today’s leadership.
For those who have caused Friday events, I just want to say one thing: in situations where the country is heading towards Brexit, which is damaging to households, businesses and public services, I don't understand the desire to spend time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Leiborist Party.
Actually, I have another message, but not for the Noting Momentum, but for my voters, both members of the Leiborist Party, and no: I swear by what I'm serving you, and I promise that no threats to me and no political opportunity will make me act according to what I consider to be the best interests of all of you.

"Eir" 38 - 17 "Melrouz": unimplemented "Eir" climbs up
The last two attempts may have produced some final results, but, of course, "Eir" has earned a triumph in today's great entertainment match in Scotland.
Now they're holding the table, that's the only impossible command of ten.
In the end, the wonderful defense and improved ability to use the opportunity give both the master and the trainer Peter Merche the right to be satisfied.
"Even though we've been testing our games, and we're still not able, so I have to be content," he said.
Robin Kristi from Melrouz commented: "I'm giving the right Air," they used better opportunities than we do."
Grant Anderson's trial at the 14th minute, carried out by Frasie Klimo, led to "Eir" ahead, but the yellow card for Scottish Captain Rory Guza, published by Verríors, allowed Melrouz to show the figures, and Jason Baggot used an unrealistic attempt.
The climate of the "Eir" leadership by using the pen and directly before the bridge made and implemented the solo test, which gave account 17-5 for "Eir"
But Melrose started the second team well, and Patrick Anderson's attempt, carried out by Baggot, reduced the gap to five eyes.
Then there was a pause due to the serious trauma of Ruarid Knott, who was released from the field on his feet, and from Eir’s restaurant came forward through the trial of Stafford McDowell, who was realized in the climate.
Captain Blair McFerson then had a yellow card, and Melrose again forced another player to pay for an unrealized experiment by Bruce Colvin under the threat of pressure.
The lords returned, but when Straan Hatchinson received a yellow card to capture the climate without a sword from the line of the penal governor, Macferson made a tachdown behind the "Eir".
The climate realized what he did almost immediately after the restaurant, after which Kyle Roy got David Armstrong's hit in the box and sent the flanker Gregor Henry to the fifth attempt to try the master's team.
It seems that the "All More" series star is set up on a new career in the restaurant
It seems that the Ford Kiran series is set up on a new career in hospitality. This conclusion can be made after it has become known that he is the director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC television series, the script he writes about and he takes off with former comedy partner Greg Hemfield.
Duet announced that the next nine series would be the last in the series, and it seems that Kirnan plans to live after Craigling.
According to the official record, he is the director of the company Apionmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on this story, although a source in Scottish Sun insisted that Kirnan wanted to enter the "increasing restaurant business" of Glasgow.
"Our Sea": Inland Waterway Bolivia is expected to open its way to the Pacific Ocean
The mariners patrol the fleet headquarters in La Pasi.
The population buildings raise an ocean-blue wave.
Sea bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are painted by a device: “We are on our right.
We must return it."
In Bolivia, which has no access to the sea, there is still a memory of the loss of the coastal line that came to Chile in the bloody conflict of the 19th century through natural resources, and there is also the desire to sail back into the Pacific.
These hopes are probably stronger now than they have been in recent decades because Bolivia is waiting for an international court decision on October 1 after five years of trial.
"In Bolivia there is an impulse, there is a spirit of unity and peace and, of course, it looks forward to a positive outcome," commented Roberto Caldavia, a painful diplomat.
Many patients will observe the ICU decision on large screens across the country, and they hope that the Hague tribunal will take action for Bolivia's benefit, which, after a decade of peaceful Chile talks, will lead to negotiations on the granting of Bolivia's sovereign exit to the sea.
Here Morales, the charismatic native president of Bolivia, who met with opposition to his trial the following year, also expressed great hopes for a decision that will be announced on Monday.
“ We are very close to returning to the Pacific, ” he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that the court will either decide for the benefit of Bolivia, and if this happens, there is little to change.
The United Nations body based in the Netherlands has no jurisdiction to judge the Chilean territory and has observed that there will be no possible negotiations.
The decision taken by the ICU only six months after the final arguments were given indicates that the case was “not difficult”, said Pas Zarate, a Czech expert from international law.
Bolivia’s case had not been asked, the last four years could have helped to resurface.
"The question of access to the sea has been used by today's disease management," Zarate said.
The Morales Ritual Warfare destroyed the rest of Chile’s kindness, allowing it.
Bolivia and Chile will continue the dialogue at some point, but then it will be very difficult to discuss it.
Two countries did not exchange messages since 1962.
The recent president, Eduardo Rodriguez Welltz, a representative of Bolivia in the Hague, did not agree that the court’s decision was extremely rapid.
On Monday, Bolivia will have “the extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile and the opportunity to put an end to 139 years of differences by getting a mutual advantage, ” he said.
Calsadia also denied that Morales — one of the most popular presidents of Latin America — used marine issues as political militia.
"The disease will never deny its right to access the Pacific," he added.
This is an opportunity to see that we must leave the past behind."
North Korea says nuclear disarmament won't happen if it can't trust the United States.
North Korea's prime minister, Ri Young Ho, says that his country will never give up its nuclear weapons for the first time until it can trust Washington.
Ri was present on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the United States to fulfill the promises expressed during the Singapore summit by the leaders of the rebels.
His comments appeared when U.S. Secretary Mike Pompeo appears to be on the way to reinvigorating nuclear diplomacy, which took more than three months after the Singapore summit with Kim Chen Ina.
Ri says that the belief that continuing sanctions and opposing the US declaration of the end of the Korean war will once put North Korea on the knees is “an inexhaustible dream. ”
Washington is afraid to accept a declaration before Phanyan takes significant steps to get rid of it.
Who and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second meeting.
But there is widespread scepticism that Phanyan is seriously concerned about rejecting his arsenal, which is likely the only way to guarantee his safety.
Pompeo plans to visit Pinyan next month to prepare for the second meeting between Kim and Trump.
In Paris fashion shows, the last trend of massive mass collections that has already been directed to the main streets of your city
If you want to expand your collection of hats or completely hide from the sun, you've found what you need.
The designers Valentino and Tom Brown demonstrated a number of excentrificent main collections in the style of oversais from the spring to the spring of 2019 on the slopes of the nearby Paris week.
The very impenetrable hats were filled with Instagram this summer, and so - called designers had already sent their magnificent creations across the floor.
Valentino saw an extravagance flight hat with a wide - eyed pair of fields that covered the heads of models.
Among other accessories are decorated with expensive brown stone, capillary hats and even capillaries, but they are not to keep their head warm.
Tom Brown also demonstrated the range of original masks — very early before Helwin.
Many of these multicolored masks had protective losses and were more remembered by Hannibal Lecter than by high fashion.
One creation called for an arrangement for underwater swimming with a tube and an eyebrow, while the other seemed like a line of seawater that was scattered.
And if you support this serious fashion application, you're lucky.
Stylers say that huge hats can go out on the main streets of your city.
Overseas cables came into mode through La Bombay, a Solomonic cable with a wide range of 60 centimetres, which they saw on all sides: from Riana to Emily Ratajkovsky.
The cultural brand, which stands behind a very unprofessional hat that could be seen everywhere on social networks, offered peace another creation: a Solomonese beach bag of size almost as a model in the buyer that she brought.
A sum of yellow-red ruffy with ruffy brown and white leather handy was the central element of the La Rivera collection in 2019's Jacquemus brand in Paris' weekly fashion.
Popularist Luke Armitaz told FEMAIL: "The next summer, I expect to see large hats and beach bags on the main streets of the city, as the design has affected so great that it will be difficult to ignore the overseering."
John Edward: Language Knowledge is a responsibility for the world's citizens
Independent schools in Scotland support high education standards, and in 2018, there was a resurgence of experiments that complement individual and collective success in sports, art, music, and other areas.
These schools, which teach more than 30,000 students throughout Scotland, are presented by the Scotlandn Council of Independent Schools (SWS), are eager to provide the best level of service for students and their parents.
Independent schools are designed to prepare students for further and higher education chosen by them, as well as to make them citizens of the world.
As a education sector that can develop and implement an individual school program, we see that today’s languages continue to be popular and desired in school.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you talk to a person who understands the language, she understands it.
If you talk to her in her native language, she'll take it from her heart."
It is a powerful reminder that we cannot use only English if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
The final results of this year's studies show that in independent schools, language is leading to rating items with the best ratings.
In general, 68 percent of the students who studied foreign languages received the A.
The data gathered at 74 CHNS schools showed that 72% of the students received high school A from China, and 72% from German students, 69% from French students, and 63% from Spanish students also received A.
This suggests that independent schools in Scotland view foreign languages as vital life - styles that children and young people will no doubt need in the future.
Languages as an object of choice are now presented in the same way as NTIM objects (scientific, technical, engineering and mathematics), as well as in independent school programs and other establishments.
The survey conducted by the British Commission on Employment and Skills in 2014 showed that 17 per cent of the reasons why employers cannot cover vacancies related to language skills are not available.
That's why language skills become more and more necessary to prepare young people for a future career.
Since more and more prospective positions require language knowledge, these skills are needed in a globalized world.
Regardless of the chosen career, if someone learns another language, he'll have real advantage in the future, because it's the habit of living.
The possibility of direct contact with people from other countries automatically gives a person who rules over competitors in a number of languages.
According to YouGov, a survey of more than 4,000 adults in the United Kingdom in 2013, 75 percent could not speak a foreign language well enough to support the conversation, while French was the only language spoken by two percent (15 percent).
That is why investment in language education is now important for today’s children.
Learning a number of languages, especially in the developing world, will provide children with more opportunities to find a full - time job.
In Scotland each school will study its own language.
A number of schools focus on more classical modern languages, while others will present languages that are most important to Britain from the 2020 perspective, such as Chinese or Japanese.
Regardless of your child’s interest in independent schools, you will always be able to choose a number of languages to study them with qualified instructors.
Scotlandn independent schools are trying to create a educational environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills needed to achieve success regardless of what they have prepared for them in the future.
There is no doubt now that international business languages continue to have a vital role to play in the future country, so this must be reflected in education.
Modern languages must truly be considered as "the customs of international communication".
Independent schools will continue to make this choice, diversity, and the perfection of the Scottish youth.
You have to do it.
John Edward is the director of the Scotland Board of Independent Schools
Libron Debates With Lakers in San Diego
Fantas who want to see the first start of Libron James for Los Angeles Lakers are almost waiting.
Lakers trainer Luke Walton announced that James would play on Sunday in the first premier match against the Dever Naggets in San Diego.
The minute he'll play, he won't be decided.
"It's gonna be more than one and less 48," said Walton on Lakers' official website.
Reporter Lakers Mike Trudell said that James will play a limited number of minutes more quickly.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his plan for six games in Lakers.
"At this stage of my career I don't need pre-session games," he replied.
Mitingi Trapa in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is starting a series of pre-mier meetings from Wiling, West Virginia.
It's the first of five planned meetings for the next week, including meetings in the friendly developed states between Tennessee and Mississippi.
The final vote for the candidate proposed by him to the Supreme Court is postponed, and Trump wishes to form support for the future Middle East elections because the Republicans are at risk of losing control of the Congress after the vote in November.
What time is it to meet Trapa today in West Virginia and how to view it on the Internet?
Mitting Trappa in Wiling, West Virginia planned for 19 hours in the morning today, Saturday, September 29, 2018
You can watch the tape in West Virginia online below in the direct ephemeral on YouTube.
The trumpet probably refers to the forced hearings that took place this week from a candidate to the Supreme Court of Bret Cavano, who is charged with sexual harassment, and to adjourn the Senate's vote for a week until the FBI's investigation took place.
But the main objective of this series of meetings is to help the Republicans choose the people before the November elections.
President Trampa said that these five meetings next week focused on "activation of volunteers and visitors, as the Republicans are trying to preserve and expand the majority they have in the Senate and the House of Representatives," Reuters reports.
"The control over Congress is so critical for its agenda that the president will go to any more states, as it is nearing the busy pre-compression season," said Reuters, a representative of the company Trampa who did not want to name it.
At the Wesbanko Arena stadium in Willing City today, guests from Ohio and Pennsylvania, as well as the Mediterranean from Pittsburgh, report West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday's visit will be the second one in the last month on the trip to Trapa to West Virginia, in which he gathered more than 40% of the votes in 2016.
Tripp is trying to help a candidate from the Republicans to the Senate of the West Virgin Patrick Morris, whose rating is based on the results of the tests.
“ It’s bad for Morris that the president is coming to pick up his rating in trials, ” commented Reuters Simon Heder, a politician from the University of West Virginia.
Kubok Ryder 2018: US team set up to fight and fulfilled the hope of the previous week's singles
After three sessions that ended with a unilateral victory, the following Saturday’s forces can become the same thing that had been missed by this Kubk Ryder.
The Chinese empulsion is a well - thought - out sports concept in which players really believe, especially in similar conflicts.
So when do they say the impulse works?
"They were in front of six eyes, and now at four, so I think we take it a little bit like impulse," Jordan Spite said when he got in.
Europe, of course, has four eyes ahead and twelve more in the game.
Americans, says Spit, feel a bit of wind in their winds, as well as a lot of encouragement to them, not in the final form of Spita and Justin Thomas, who played together all day, and each made three eyes out of four.
Back with his killer shots from the thi-meading to the green shows an example.
These fierce bells of celebration became more vocal when he took a decisive turn in his circle and weighed the account on the fourth match after he and Thomas stood on two eyes.
His trip, which allowed them to win a match for 15 moons, met with a similar call, which tells you that the American team doesn’t seem to exist.
“ You really have to work hard and worry about your own match, ” said Spit.
That's all each of these players left right now.
18 months to become known.
The only players with more eyes than Spit and Thomas in the last two days are French Molinary and Tommy Flywood, the undisputed story of Kubka Ryder.
It is unusual, but the magic couple from Europe has four out of four and cannot admit a mistake.
"Moluwood" was the only couple who didn't make gods on Saturday after lunch, they could also avoid gods on Saturday morning and after lunch on Friday and at nine last moons on Friday morning.
This race and the way their energy appears to be running towards this bloody crowd and back, it makes them believe that they win on Sunday and that there will be no more popular players except Flywood or Molinary to boost Europeans' potential victory when the sun comes up over Le Golf National.
He wants to be on different moons at the same time.
However, to talk about European triumphs until early in life.
Bob Watson and Webb Simpson had a conversation with Sergio Garcia, a heroine of morning formulas when he was in a fight with Alex Noren.
One god and two gods on the first nine moons brought the Spanish and Swedish to the moon that they could never choose from.
On Sunday, however, no one will help you get out of the moon.
For example, for example, it is very interesting to observe the relationship between the participants in the money, the advice they give, the advice they do not give, and the interesting observation of how the strategy can change in one purpose.
Europe as long as it plays better than a team and has a significant advantage in the last day, but this forum has also shown that the U.S. team is going to fight, where some, especially Americans, are suspicious.
Europe leads with account 10-6 on the last day of Cuba Rider
At the end of the day, Kubka Reider Europe will have a solid advantage because after Saturday's forums and forums, it is ahead of the United States with account 10-6.
The inspired poets Tommy Flitwood and the French Molinary received two victories over the distant Tiger Woods, and now on the Le Golf National they have four wounds.
The European team of Thomas Bourne, who was trying to return the trophies they lost two years ago at Haseltine, dominated the American team in the morning forums with account 3-1.
The U.S. had made more resistance in the forums and had won two matches, but they could not speed up the break.
Commander Jim Furrick needs eight eyes in 12 weeks to save the trophies.
Flywood, the first European novelist who beat four eyes later, while he and Molinari (including Mollywood) were only the second pair who picked up four eyes in the first four matches in the story of Kubka Ryder.
When Woods and Patrick Reed went to the forums, they gathered to win the South Woods and New American Brison Deshambo with even more effective 5ta4.
Woods, who pulled out two matches on Saturdays, demonstrated a random panic of geniuses, but now he lost 19 of his 29 matches in football and forsomnia and seven teammates.
Justin Rose, who did not participate in the morning forums, returned to his partner Henrik Stanson in the forums to win a victory with account 2ta1 from Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, who is the first and third in the world ranking.
Europe has not been able to do anything more than this pleasant fresh day in the southwestern part of Paris.
The three main winners Jordan Smith and Justin Thomas set the standard for Americans on Saturday with their two eyes.
They won a decisive 2ta1 victory over the Spanish John Ram and Ian Paulter in the forums and later beat Pauler and Rory McClera with account 4t3 in the forums, losing the first two moons.
Only two times in the history of Kubka Ryder's team returned with a defect in four eyes in the singles, although the Furic team needed only one night to save the trophies.
After two days, however, the contract on Sunday seems to be out of force.
North Korea says "no case" will be fired unilaterally without trust
The North Korean Minister of Criminal Affairs said on Saturday that the continuation of sanctions would deepen distrust of the United States and that under such circumstances the country would never be able to refuse its nuclear weapons.
Ri Young Ho told the UN General Assembly every year that last year North Korea has used "sound measures of good will" such as the end of nuclear and missile tests, the demolition of a nuclear-tested miner and the obligation not to distribute nuclear weapons and nuclear technologies.
"So, we don't see an appropriate response from the United States," he said.
"Without trust in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances we will never be the first to be in a unilateral state."
And while Rí repeated the well-known complaints of North Korea against Washington's "increasing" approach to denumeration, it was said that North Korea would be rewarded for its progressive steps, its statement showed that it did not ignore the unilateral denuclearization that Phanyan had done in the past.
Rey referred to a joint statement by Kim Chen Ina and Donald Trappa on the first in history between the real US President and North Korea's leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim called for work on "the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula", and Trump promised North Korea's security assurances.
North Korea wants the formal end of the Korean war between 1950 and 53 years of age, but the United States said that Phanyan had to first refuse nuclear weapons.
Washington also challenges the challenge of weakening the strict international sanctions on North Korea.
"The United States insists on denuclearization at the beginning" and increases pressure by means of sanctions to achieve its goal strongly, and even oppose "the declaration of end of war," said Ray.
"To think that sanctions can put us on the knees," the sudden dream of those who don't know us.
But the problem is that continuing sanctions deepens our mistrust."
Rey did not mention the plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, on which the U.S. leader voted at the UN at the beginning of the week.
Instead, the Minister drew attention to the three meetings of Kima and South Korean leader Muna Che Ina over the last five months and added: "If South Korea were to be a party to this question of denuclearization, rather than the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not be in such a deaf corner."
Despite this, the tone of Ri's statement was quite different from the one he told the General Assembly that the target of North Korea's rocket on the mother's part of the United States was inevitable after Mr. Evil President Trump called Kim a "human-racquet" who wanted to commit suicide.
This year in the UN Trap, which threatened the “complete destruction” of North Korea last year, commended Kim for her courage in using radiation measures, but said that much more is needed and sanctions should remain in force until North Korea's nuclearization.
In the middle of the trip, he noted that he does not set up a time frame for this period: "It takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn't matter."
China and Russia claim that the UN Security Council should reward Phanyan for the steps taken.
However, US Secretary Mike Pompeo said to the UN Security Council on Thursday: "The implementation of Security Council sanctions must continue with energy and indiscriminately until we see the full, final, confirmed duplication."
The Security Council has unanimously increased its sanctions against North Korea in 2006 with a view to blocking the financing of nuclear programmes and ballistic missiles in Pakistan.
Pompeo met Ri at the UN General Assembly Colinary and then said that next month he was visiting Phanyan again to prepare for another summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his final journey has failed.
He left Phanyan in July and commented that progress had been made, but after a few hours North Korea condemned him for “gangster requirements. ”
During the meeting with Muna this month, North Korea promised to develop a rocket complex and a nuclear complex if the United States uses "the appropriate measures".
He said that Kim said he needed "relevant steps" are security guarantees that Trump promised in Singapore and steps to normalize his relationship with Washington.
Harvard students have a course on how to get enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year gave all his students more sleep, and this is an attempt to fight the growing culture of learning circulatory all night after coffee.
The lecturer noted that the number one university students in the world are often unaware of when it comes to the basis of how to care for themselves.
Charles Chesler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a professor at the Women's Hospital Brigham, has developed a course that he believes is the first such course in the United States.
He decided to start a course after giving his lecture on the effects of sleep deprivation on learning.
Finally, a girl came to him and said, "Why are you telling me this right now, at the final stage?"
“ She told me that no one had ever told her about the importance of a dream that surprised me, ” said an interpreter from The Telegraph.
The course that was first introduced this year gives students the basis for helping them to achieve academic and sporting results as well as to improve overall well - being.
Paul Barreyr, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and the director of medical services at the university, said that the university had decided to introduce a course after it had been shown that students were seriously deprived of sleep during the week.
The hour course includes a number of interactive tasks.
In one section there are pictures of rooms in the gym where students click on coffee cups, chairs, coaches and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light, influence sleep deficit on sports indicators, as well as the importance of routines related to sleep.
Another section discusses how chronic sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, stroke, depression, and cancer.
Next, a map of an interactive icon field encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
"We know it won't change the behavior of students mythically.
But we think they have the right to know, just as you have the right to know about the consequences of smoking cigarettes for health," added Professor Chesler.
The culture of pride for “sleeping all night ” is still there, it adds, and it also notes that modern technologies and increasing pressure on students mean that the problem of sleep deprivation is growing.
A good - quality dream must be a “secret weapon ” for a student to fight stress, fatigue, and anxiety, even with weight loss, as sleep escapes the brain into a state of hunger that causes constant physical hunger, he said.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californiaian who studies chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Chesler to make a course after he enrolled in one of his other courses last year in Harvard during the first year.
He said that the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to create a new course for the whole camp.
Next step, he is expected to turn to all the experts, asking for a similar training program to come into the competition facility.
Professor Chesler recommends that students be reminded of the need to sleep, as well as the need to set up an elevator and be involved in the course of the harmful influence of “green light ” that is emitted by electronic screens and lighting lamps and may damage the circular rhythm that causes sleep problems.
Livingstone 1 - 0 Reingers: Gol Mangi is upset by the guys of Gerard
The Rangers survived a series of extenuation attacks: the fall of Dolly Mangi brought by the various teamman Steven Gerard a defeat with account 1 to 0 from Livingstone.
The Aybrox command wanted to win its first win in the final match after the summer triumph over St. Johnston with account 4-1, but Commander Harry Holt won the second prize as manager of 18 games.
Menga died seven minutes before the break, and the Rangers, who had no inspiration, did not seem to be able to balance the account.
Now the Rangers are down to the sixth position, and the Livingstones are up to the third, and only the Hibernian.
In addition, the Rangers may have been another discomfort, as linsman Kalum Spence was forced to process the head wound after having been removed from the guest sector.
Gerard made eight changes in his team, which once changed his mind to Eire in the south end of the Scottish League.
Holt released the same “Live 11, ” which took one eye into Harts last week, and was impressed by how his trained boys put up with each step.
Perhaps the Rangers were headed for the ruling sword, but Livingstone worked more with the captured sword.
They were supposed to kill everything within two minutes of the game, when the first pass of Manga in the free zone allowed Scott Pettman to hit the door of God's Magregor, but the defendant was making this great chance by sending a sword over the door.
The deep free strike by Keagan Jacobs came by shipper Craig Halkett, but his defense partner Alan Litgo hit the back floor
The Rangers were actually controlled, but on the last third, there was more hope than belief in their game.
Alfredo Morelos certainly felt that he should have a right to the penelitis at the mark four hours after meeting with Steven Lowelles, but the referencer Steven Thompson refused to contact the Colombian.
The Rangers was able to make only two knocks on the door in the first team, but the former Aybrox Porter Liam Kelly hit Lassani Kulibali and the peaceful strike of Ovie Ejjaria were almost unstoppable.
And although the last watch of Livingstone for 34 minutes may have contradicted the course of the game, no one can deny that they had just earned it from their hard work.
The Rangers failed to cope with Jacobs' preparation.
Scott Arfield didn't respond when Declan Galler sent the sword to Scott Robinson, who quietly chose Menga for a simple end.
In the yard, Gerard moved the Kolibala to Ryan Kent, and this change was almost immediately worked when Higer hit Morelos, but the amazing Kelly took off his line to block him.
However, Livingstone continued to force guests to play the same game that they liked when Litgo and Halkett made one long walk after another.
Commander Holta could have improved the outcome at the last stages, but McGregor was well opposed to Jacobovs before Litgo hit the corner.
Glenn Middleton, a replacement to the Rangers, made another late application for punishment when he met Jacobs, but Tomson took a look again.
Almanah: The inventor of the Geiger account
And now a page from our Almanac Sunday morning: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago this day, and the time is coming... in Germany there was the future physics of Johannes Wilhelm Hans Geiger.
Heeger developed a method of detecting and measuring radioactive radiation, a substance that in time evolved into a device known as Geeger's calculator.
One of these sets of Geigers became one of the key elements of science, as well as one of the key elements of pop culture, such as in the 1950's "Call Coronado" film with Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, who are playing suspiciously on the appearance of cowboys.
The man said, "What's all this about?"
Rogers: “It’s a Geiger computer that is used to search for radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you lift these triggers, you can really hear how they affect atomic radioactivity in minerals."
Evans says, "Well, well, it's really going to grow."
Hans Geeger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the vindictive who bears his name continues to live.
A new anti-cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to see evil cells
A new anti-cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to see and kill evil cells
The vaccine teaches the immune system to identify harmful cells that are part of the treatment
The method predicts the removal of immune cells in the patient and their changes in the laboratory
Then these cells are able to see white cells that are common to many types of cancer. These cells are then re-initiated to the patient.
The test vaccine shows many promising results in patients with various types of cancer.
In one woman who received a vaccine that teaches her immune system to identify harmful cells, her liver cancer disappeared for more than 18 months.
The method includes the removal of immune cells in the patient, changing them into the laboratory so that these cells can "see" together for many types of white blood cells (HER2), and further re-introducing these cells into the patient.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Institute of Cancer, Merylland, noted: "Our results show that we have received a very promising vaccine."
" HER2 "stimulates the growth of several types of cancer," including breast cancer, ovarians, legends and colorectal cancer," he explained.
A similar approach in removed immune cells in patients and “scientific ” aimed at cancer cells has been developed in the treatment of one type of leukemia.
After attending the SNL show at the MAGA Canyea Bisball, West won a series of talks in support of President Trampa,
What caused the negative response of the viewers
Watchers at the SNL (Saturday’s Eve in the Direct Efream) show revealed that Kenya had been exposed after his bombing, during which he praised US President Donald Trappa and said he would vote in presidential position in 2020.
After the third song was performed called Ghost Town in baseball with the title "We're going to return America to its former glory," he blew up a poem where he criticised democracy, and once again declared his support for Trapa.
"Many times during the conversation, white people ask me, "How can you like Trump? He's a racist."
Well, if I were worried about racism, I'd have left America a long time ago," he said.
The show began with the sketch of Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star witnessed Bretta Cavano, who presented a report to the Senate Legal Committee on the subject of calling Christine Blaise Ford on sexual violence.
Although Westa’s speech was not transmitted directly into the Efferate, a video with its heavy voice was posted on the social network of Cres rock.
It is left unclear whether Rock wanted to smile at the West by placing this post.
West also complained to the spectators that behind his back there was an unpleasant situation because of the main meeting.
As Washington Examiner reports, West said: "When I was behind bars, I was treated badly.
I was told, "Don't go out to the spectators in this baseball game."
They've been bothering me!
And then they tell me I'm in a place where the oppressed keep quiet."
The West went on to say, "You want to see a place where the oppressed are silent?
Then try to treat each other with love."
According to the Variety Week, its comments have at least twice called for a negative response by the audience in the room, and the SNL show actors appear to be lost. One of the audience said, "The studio has a dead silence."
In the last minute, guests were asked to replace the singer, Arian Grande, whose former boyfriend, Reper Mac Miller, died a few days before his flight.
The West called for many surprises by performing song I Love it (I love it) in Perrier's dress.
Vesta supported the head of TPUSA Kendes Turner, who wrote on Twitter: "One of the most courageous: Thanks to you for setting up the NATIONAL PROTECTION."
Instead of the director of the show, Karen Hunter wrote on Twitter that West "is who he is, and that's just great."
"The way I won't reward it (by buying his music or clothing or by supporting his "art"), who, in my opinion, answers and exposes the ideology that harms my people.
He is a free man.
Like us," she added.
Before the show, reper announced on Twitter what changed his name: now he's "the one who used to know how Canyon West."
West is not the first performer who changed his name. He follows the example of Daddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and Pie Daddy.
Fellow Repper Snup Dogg had previously been called Snape Leon, and, of course, the music legend of the last decade, Prince changed its name to the symbol, and then became "Artist, formerly known as Prince."

Kit Herington's Star of the "Greed Game" series condemns the idea of brutality
Kitt Herrington became famous for the role of the war with the sword of John Snow in the brutal medium-term fantasy series "Greeds" by HBO.
However, a 31-year-old actor who was convicted of hero-macho stereotypes, claiming that because of such heroes on screens, young boys often seem to have to be cruel in order to respect others.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture Kit said that, in his opinion, "something went wrong", and asked how to solve the problem of the problem of the prevalence of violence in the era of #Meto's population.
Kitt, who recently married his colleague on "Greeds", a 31-year-old actor named Rose Lesley, noted that he was "very determined" to fight this problem.
"I've been well-adjusted enough at the moment, when did we become on the path to the idea of brutality?" he asked.
"Why do we teach future men if we look at their growth through the tension of the problem we see now?"
Kitt believes that television is partly responsible for the popularity of brutality by portraying the most powerful heroes.
He continued: "What is natural, and what are we planted?
Why does television and the street teach youths to feel pressured to be the same men?
In my view, the really important question today is, How can we change it?
'Cause it's obvious that young boys have fallen off the right path.'
In the interview, he also noted that it will not be removed in any puzzles and puzzles after the show of the next summer's series is over because it's already finished with battles and horses.
As of November, Kit will play "The True West" Sam Shepard's story about the film producer and his brother-in-law.
As an actor recently admitted, he considered meeting with his wife Rose to be the best she had since she attended the "Greeds" series.
"During the summer in this series I met my wife, so he gave me a future family and determined my future," said Keith.
In a fantasy series that won the Emmy Prize, Rose played the Beatty, the hero Herington John Snow.
The couple arrived in June 2018. The ceremony took place on the territory of the Lesley family's estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: In China, 14% of new cases of disease are reported to increase
In China, a 14 - percent increase in HIV and AIDS is reported.
According to health authorities, there are more than 820,000 patients in the country.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, some 40,000 new cases of disease have been reported.
In most cases, illness has been passed on by an article indicating a change in the past trend.
In some regions, HIV was rapidly spreading through infected blood during transfusions.
However, as the official representatives of health authorities said during the conference held in the province of Greece, the number of people who are infected with HIV this way has dropped almost to zero.
However, compared with the previous year, the number of HIV - AIDS patients in China increased by 100,000.
The transfer of VIL by sex in time is a serious problem for the Chinese LGBT community.
The decriminization of homosexuality in China took place in 1997, but LGBT society often suffered from discrimination.
According to the study, between 70 and 90 percent of men who have sexual relations with other men are further married to women because of their country of conservation.
In most cases the transmission of the disease is due to improper use of protective equipment during sexual contact.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised to ensure free access to HIV drugs, seeing this way to address the problem in part.
Maxine Walters is protesting the lack of data from the journalists' senators on her network by her state worker and is critical of "hazardous lies" and "the theories of speech"
On Saturday a member of the U.S. Chamber of Representatives, Maxine Walters condemned the vote on the fact that one of her state employees had posted personal data from three U.S. senators on their websites in Wikipedia.
A Democrat from Los Angeles claims that these statements spread ultrasounds to political observers and websites.
"A lie, a lie, and then a more disgusting lie," said Walters on Twitter.
According to the report, the information provided contained addresses and phone numbers of U.S. senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrina Hetch from Yuti.
The data appeared online at 4:00. They were placed by an unknown person from Capitol during a hearing in the Senate commission for sexual charges against Bretta Cavano, a candidate for the U.S. Supreme Court.
The flight of data took place some time after the three senators inquired about Cavano.
The issue of The Hill reported that on conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, information was found that the IP address was directly linked to the Waters office and that it was able to obtain data from its state-owned employee.
"These irrefutable claims are absolutely false, they don't answer the facts," said Walters.
"The staff member of my office whose personal data and security have been put at risk as a result of these distorted and misleading statements has no relation to the flow of this information.
These unsubstantiated claims are absolutely false, they don't answer the facts."
Voter's statement was quickly criticised on the network, including the former press secretary of the White House, Ari Fleycher.
"This objection is filled with anger," Fleisher wrote.
"It suggests that she cannot be a member of Congress with such a nature.
When someone is accused of something he has not done, there is no need to be angry.
The accused should not act out of revenge.
He should not ask questions about the reasons for the accused.
He must remain calm and unmovable."
It seems that Fleicher was conducting a parallel between Walters’ reaction and the criticism of the Democrats at the address of Judge Cavano, who was accused of being too upset during the hearing at 4:00.
Omar Navarro, a candidate from the Republican Party, who is bled to take the place of Walters for the results of the inter-elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
"This is so news if it's true," he wrote.
In his statement, Walters noted that her office had already reported "the relevant public authorities and legal bodies on these false statements."
"We will do everything possible to find the guilty," she continued, "and they responded to the law for their actions which are harmful and dangerous to all my employees."
Look at the film "Agent Johnny English: New Mission" - A passing parade on spy fighters with Raven Atkinson
It's already a good tradition to look into every new British film of the meaning of Brexit. They're also in the new series of comedy parades in the battle of Johnny English. The first film called "Johnny English" appeared on screen in 2003 and later replayed in 2011, re-reading "Johnny English: Restart".
Will it become a ridiculous ironic self-sustainment for what we are recently, the new export potential of the nation?
In any case, Johnny Inglesch with his moving face and his twin eyes had been given the opportunity to make a mistake, and his name indicates more than anything else that this commercial character was created for viewers in non-English countries.
As we know, Johnny is an extremely happy secret agent who, despite his extraordinary effort to be famous and charming, is a little bit from Inspector Clousea, a little from Mr. Bina and a lot of things - from the guy who played a note of the movie "Founded Horses" at the opening of the Olympic Games in London in 2012.
The staff is also a mandrakesman and an international order that has always been left behind after he has been robbed of what Atkinson once had played in a long - forgotten television commercial by Barclaycard.
The last film about Johnny England has several beautiful moments.
I liked the scene when Johnny Inglesch was approached by a helicopter in the coastal areas, and the gloves of the gins hung around his neck.
Atkinson's talent is well-discovered to adjust the buffonade, but humour is going on, and at some point it's very much, especially if it compares to "serious" pins such as "Agent 007" and "Mission impossible", one of the "ingredients" which is also comedy.
It's amazing that the fires are calculated more like children than adults, and I don't think the stupid attacks that take place with Johnny English don't look as dramatic and as the Atkinson approach in the movies about Bina.
As always, the film begins with a serious threat to Britain.
In Britain’s supersecret spy network, hacker opens up and reveals the names of all field agents who have become completely desperate for an active agent. (Unfortunately, Kevin Eldon played only an episode.)
This proved to be the last step for the Prime Minister – a strong person who has already faced a devastating criticism and is in deep depression because of the loss of popularity (Emma Thompson tried to best transmit the image of Teresa May, but the scenario did not fully reveal it).
The board of directors informed her that all active agents had been compromised, and she had to contact one of the delegates.
The election is based on unreducated Johnny English, who is now working as a teacher at some supermarket and is officially teaching children to work undercover (in this part of the Spanish school year there were several distant jokes).
The English are quick to get to Whitegoll at a terminal briefing where he again meets his most painful friend, Buffalo, who is playing Ben Miller.
Buff is now married to the captain of the underwater boat (the role of an isolated anxious person is not entirely in line with the talent of old Pepperdin).
So when everything in her Majesty's Secret Service is going to get rid of her, Betman and Robin are going back to the street and suddenly they meet a fatal woman at the Pistolet office, who plays Olga Curylenko.
And at the same time, the Prime Minister is under the auspices of a charismatic billionaire who has made his article in technology and technology and says it can solve the problem with the British network, the unfortunate Jason Walt, who was playing Jake Leessey.
The English and Baf are on their way back to their smiles: they are dressed by officers making fires in a French skirmish restaurant; they continue to dry chaos, illegally walking around the corner on the widest street of the Volta; England is making real trouble when trying to use virtual reality to get to know about the planning of the Volta house.
All the stops lead us to the last episode, but it reminds us of his kindness and generosity.
It's a moving movie.
As I watched other filmmakers about Johnny English, I asked myself the same question: Can't the British film industry ever offer Raven Atkinson a role that really matches his talent?
The librarians deny the preparation of a plan that the British will work four days a week, but they will get pay in five days.
The Leeborist Party, Jeremy Corbin, has to discuss a radical plan for which the British will work four days a week, but they will be paid in five days.
It is recognized that the party wants to commit its managers to transfer the costs saved by the revolution of artificial intelligence to employees, giving them an additional output.
In this way, workers will have a third income and will bring home the same pay.
According to the source, this idea will be consistent with the party's economic program and will direct the country's resources to support the working class.
The transition to the four-day work week was approved at the United Kingdom Congress of Trade Unions. It appears that workers can thus benefit from a change in the overall economic situation.
Source of the Leiborist Party reported on The Sunday Times: "The policy review will be announced at the end of the year.
All will not change in one night, but the idea of a four-day work week is the party's approach to changing economic balance in the interests of workers, as well as the general industrial strategy of the party."
The liborists didn't get this idea first because the Green Party promised to start a four-day work week still during the pre-commenced campaign in 2017.
However, not all members of the Leiborist Party at the time accept this desire.
Spiker of the Leiborist Party said, "The party's political program has no four-day work week, so we don't look at this idea right now."
The "Tinoon" Chancellor John McDonnell presented his view of the socialist revolution in the economy on the pre-shipment trip of the Leiborist Party last week.
Mr. McDonald said it was designed to take power back from "unless directors" of municipal companies and "visitors".
The "Tinary" Chancellor's plan also means that water supply shareholders may not get all their share of the capital if the Leeborist government initiates "recalation" on the basis of the alleged infringements.
It also confirmed its intention to include employees in corporate governance and to create an inclusive equity fund to transfer 10% of the usual shares to the private sector companies that expect annual dividends of 500 pounds of sterling.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell the show 60 Minutes (60 minutes) whether the Cavano, the FBI's leading FBI, can change their mind
In connection with the investigation by Judge Bretta Cavano, who is led by the FBI, the final vote on his appointment as Judge of the Supreme Court is postponed at least once a week. The question arises as to whether the senators continue to support Cavano after the Bureau's investigation.
On Sunday's show, 60 Minutes correspondent Scott Pelley asked Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Greema if the FBI could find something that would change their mind.
Kennedy seemed more open than his South Carolina colleague.
"Yes, of course," said Kennedy.
During the hearing, I told him I had a conversation with Judge Cavano.
I phoned him after everything happened and the charges were dropped, and I asked him, "Did you really do this?"
He was decisive, uncompromising, uncompromising."
It seems that Graham's mind is not going to change.
"I think the removal of Cavano is a provocation," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett firmly opposed everything," added Graham, turning to Christine Blaise Ford.
And everyone she calls can't confirm it under the oath.
It happened 36 years ago.
I don't understand what can change."
What is the Global Citizen Festival, and how can it influence poverty reduction?
New York will host the Global Citizen Festival (World Festival of Citizens) – an annual event in the music world with an overwhelming number of star performers and at least an exciting mission – to combat poverty around the world.
During the 7th Global Citizen Festival, tens of thousands of people will compete in the capital of the Central Park, not only to enjoy the performances of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Sean Mendes, but also to pay attention to the real goal of the festival – organizers will want to fight the extreme form of poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is the continuation of the Global Poverty Project, an international civil organization, which is expected to eradicate poverty by increasing the number of people who are actively fighting it.
In order to get free allowance for an event (if you do not want to pay a VIP fee), visitors must perform low tasks or "acts", such as learning in a voluntary project, writing an e-mail to a world leader, making a phone call or anything else to help pay attention to the purpose of the organization – poverty eradication.
So are there any results already, since the goal of Global Citizen organizers has been lost for 12 years?
Is it really the idea to reward for acting as a free concert — a great way to convince people to demand action, or is it just another case called "clicitism," when people feel that something really changes by signing an electronic petition or by making a publication on Twitter?
According to Global Citizen, since 2011, they have set 19 million "actions" for their guests, which are aimed at achieving different goals.
The organization claims that these actions have prompted world leaders to declare plans for financial recovery and programmes of more than $37 billion, which will help to change lives by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group cited as an example of its 390 financial commitments and public applications, which had already been collected and spent at least 10 billion.
Some 649 million people around the world have already been directly affected by the cost estimates.
Among the main financial commitments are the Fund The Power of Nutrition, which is territorially related to Britain. Under the project, investors and realists have undertaken to "help children grow up" and promised Rwanda $35 million to meet the challenge of unemployment after receiving more than 4700 messages from Global Citizens.
"For the support of the British government, the mayors, the governments of other countries and citizens of the world, such as you, we can make a social problem of non-exhaustive history," said the representative of The Power of Nutrition Tracy Ulman, speaking in public during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The organization also stated that after 5,000 "acts" called for improvements in the diet of mothers and children, the United Kingdom government announced spending on The Power of Nutrition project aimed at improving the diet of 5 million mothers and children.
In answer to one of the popular questions on your website, "Why do you think you can fight extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen's representatives wrote: "It's a long and hard way, so sometimes we'll fall down and fail.
But like the participants in the civil rights movement and against apartheid to us, we will succeed because together we are stronger."
Janet Jackson, close The Weekend, Sean Mendes, Cardi B, Jeanelle Mona is just part of the star performers that will be held this year at the New York festival, and will report his Debora Lee Ferness and Guy Jackman.
The Interior Minister said that the United States could use military and maritime forces to block the export of Russian energy
According to U.S. Interior Minister Ryan Zinke, mentioned in the Washington Examiner, Washington "for the need" can be addressed with the help of military-sea forces to prevent Russian energy from emerging into the market, including the Middle East market.
Zinke stated that Russia’s participation in the conflict in Syria, especially where it acts at the request of the state of law, is the reason for the new energy generation.
"I think they're living in the Middle East because they want to be the middle of the energy trade, as they already do in Eastern and Southern Europe," he said.
According to the owner, there are ways and means of solving the problem.
"The U.S. military and maritime forces can provide free passage by sea and, as necessary, block them so that Russian energies do not reach the market," he said.
The Association of Consumer Energy Alliance (EEE) was a non-commercial organization that held itself as the "voice of each consumer" in the United States.
He then compared trade approaches to Russia and Iran, noting that they are actually similar.
"The economic strategy for Iran and Russia is generally because we use energy effectively and replace it with alternatives," he said, calling Russia "one-wayly developed", since its economy depends on mineral sources.
At the time of the month of these statements, the trauma administration set out to increase the export of natural gas to Europe by boosting the energy market of Russian origin, a very low-cost option for Europeans.
To this end, the owners of the trampa administration and President Donald Tramp himself are trying to convince the German government to reject the "independence" road construction project "Northern Stream 2", which, according to Trampa, makes Berlin a Moscow-led contractor.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that "Northern Flow 2" gas is worth 11 billion dollars and doubles the current gas capacity to 110 billion cubic metres, except an economic project.
Kremlin is convinced that Washington is at odds with the project only for economic reasons, which is an example of unfair competition.
"In my view, we share the idea that energy resources cannot be an instrument of pressure and consumers should have the option of selecting suppliers," said Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak after a meeting with U.S. Energy Minister Rick Perry, who took place in Moscow in September.
The U.S. position called for a negative response from Germany, which confirmed its support for the project.
The German leading organization of the German Federation of German Industry (BDI) urged the United States not to interfere with EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I don't like it when the third country interferes with our supply of energy," said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federal Federation of German Industry after the last meeting of German Chancellor Angel Merkel with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Senator from Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren "he thinks seriously" about voting for the president's post in 2020
Senator from Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that "he thinks seriously" about voting for the president's post after the mid-election.
At a meeting with the public in Goliok, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he was considering the possibility of extending his application.
According to The Hill Warren's publication, "It's time for women to go to Washington to adjust to the government's work, and for that, it's supposed to be a woman."
"After 6 November, I seriously think about my candidate being removed from the president's post."
During a meeting with the public, Warren expressed his appreciation to the President Donald Trappa, saying that he "did not lead his country in that direction.
"I'm extremely concerned about what Donald Trump is doing with our democracy," she said.
Warren was open, critical of Trappa and proposed a candidate for the position of Supreme Court judge, Brett Cavano.
In a Friday tweet, Warren wrote: "...there is no doubt that the FBI has to conduct an investigation before the vote."
However, according to the study on Friday, most of Warren’s voters do not think it should be voted in 2020.
According to the results of the study conducted jointly by the Safford University of Political Studies and The Boston Globe, fifty-eight percent of the state's potential voters in Massachusetts were against the withdrawal of their candidate senator.
Thirty-two percent supported the removal.
The results showed that former Governor Deval Patrick used more support.
During the discussion of the candidates for other well-known democracies who could vote in 2020, former President Joe Byden and Senator of Vermont Bernie Sanders are also called.
According to the Associated Press, Byden said he would make a decision by January.
Sarah Pailin is referring to PTSR Traka Pailin during the interview with Donald Trappa
26-year-old Trek Pailin spent the year in Iraq after entering military service in September.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence, and the incident took place on Monday night.
"What happens now to my son, because he's going back, can only be understood by other families who experience the effects of PTSD and other health problems with which our soldiers return home," she said to the participants in support of Donald Trappa in Tals, Oklahoma.
Pauline called the arrest of Treka "a problem no one cares about" and said that her son and other veterans of war "are returning home with no ones who were more cruel than they were before, and want to know if they respect what their brothers, pilots and other military officers have done for this country."
According to the spokesman of the City Police Department of Vasilla, Den Bennett, Treka was arrested on Monday in the city of Vasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence and assault on women, as well as that he banned reports of violence and carried a gun as an alcoholic.
18 states and the Colombia District Supports the Controversy Policy
Eighty states and the Colombia area support the charge of a new U.S. policy, according to which victims of gang persecution and domestic violence refuse to give up refugee status.
According to a report by NBC News, the representatives of 18 states and districts made an analytical note by a court consultant in Washington to support a petitioner who needs an appeal and has filed a case in court.
The full name of the petitioner in the case "Greeces v. Sesnsa" after the US Civil Rights Union which is accused of federal policy and which has been filed in August is not disclosed.
The caller said that her partner "and his cruel son-in-law" was her, but the owners of the United States rejected her when she asked for a hit on July 20th.
She was illegally detained in Texas.
Public prosecutors who support Grace's call have said that the inhabitants of El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala (the refugees who often call for asylum in the United States) are often faced with serious problems such as banditism and domestic violence.
The new refugee status policy reflects the 2014 Appeals Council’s decision on immigration, which suggests that immigrants without documents from domestic violence could apply for asylum.
The District Attorney General of Colombia, General Carl Reisin, said during his speech on Friday that the new policy " ignores dozens of laws of state, federal and international law".
"The federal law requires that decisions on the application for refugee status be based on the facts and circumstances set out in such a statement and that the prohibition violates this principle," says the Court's analytical advice note.
The prosecutors further state in the analytical note that the policy that prohibits immigrants from entering the United States is detrimental to the economies of the country, as they can potentially become entrepreneurs and "full of the necessary work resources".
In June, General Jeff Sesness issued a decree for immigration judges that they could no longer provide refugee status to those who are fleeing from domestic violence and vandalism.
"The title is given to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear of persecution in connection with raciality, belief, nationality, membership in certain civil groups or political views," Sesns said during the presentation of the policy on 11 June.
The purpose of this approach was never to solve all the problems that people around the world face every day.
Survivors desperately try to find those who are left alive while the number of people who have died in Paul’s city has doubled
For those who have survived, the situation continues to deteriorate.
"The situation is very tense," says a 35-year-old mother, calming down her boy with a leak in the evacuation center of the devastated city of Paul.
"Every minute of help speeds up the body.
It's not enough clean water."
Some residents return to their ruined homes and collect their underground profits in an effort to save what they have found.
Hundreds of people were injured, and the doctors, who were injured by an earthquake, were overwhelmed by a force of 7.5 ballasts on the Richter scale.
Some of the wounded, including Two Geris with a fractured back and shoulders, rest at Paul’s military hospital, where patients are given help under the open sky by means of repeated mail.
His eyes were filled with tears when he remembered how strong mailing the hotel room on the fifth floor where he was living with his wife and daughter.
"It wasn't time for lunch.
I think I was impressed by the walls," said Heris Correspondent Associated Press, adding that he and his family had come to the city at Christmas.
"I heard my wife crying for help, and then she kept quiet.
I don't know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they're safe."
The U.S. Ambassador accuses China of "increasing psychological pressure" by means of "advertising propaganda"
A week after the Chinese state newspaper placed on four pages of the American daily advertising material on mutual benefit from trade between the United States and China, a US envoy in China accused Beijing of using American press to distribute propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trap of the past Wednesday sent a payment supplement to China Daily in Des Moines Register, the most popular newspaper of the state of Iowa after China was accused of trying to influence the election to Congress on 6 November. China rejects these charges.
According to the U.S. official Reuters agency, the trauma, in which he accuses Beijing of attempting to interfere with the American elections, is a new phase of ejaculation by Washington, China.
While foreign governments may issue commercials to intensify trade, there is a time-out of trade war, which has already raised import fraud.
Experts from China and the United States believe that at the beginning of this war, the launch of a repressive target in China was intended to launch an attack on exporters from countries such as Iiova, who supported the Republican Party of Trapa.
Terry Brunsted, a US ambassador to China and former governor of the state of Iowa, the largest exporter of agricultural products to China, stated that China has caused damage to American workers, farmers and companies.
China, as Brensted wrote in the week's Des Moines Register column, "strengthens the pressure by publishing advertising that contains propaganda in our independent press."
"The Chinese government uses the way for the American people to develop the tradition of freedom of speech and the independence of the press by placing a paid advertising in the Des Moines Register," says Brunsted.
"On the contrary, in the streets here in Beijing, you're just looking for different voices. You can't see the real picture here that the Chinese people are really thinking about the development of China's economy, which is causing concern, so you can conclude that China's media are under the control of China's Communist Party," he wrote.
He also added that "one of the most important Chinese editions proposed publishing" his article, but he didn't name it.
Analysts warn that by the fall of the Cavano, the Republicans are setting up against themselves women-biotics before the inter-elections
Since many well - known Republicans support and protect the candidate for the post of Supreme Court judge Brett Cavano after he was convicted of several sexual harassment, analysts warn that this may lead to an unwanted reaction to future inter-elections, especially in women.
All around this situation, the majority of the Republicans state that they would like to vote.
Such things can't just be played back then," he said during an interview with The Hill published on Saturday, Grant Roger, professor of politics at the Maxwell University of Syracuse School.
Riger expressed doubts that the FBI's investigation, which had recently begun to pressure Senator Jeff Fleek (Arision’s Republican republic), would be sufficient to calm down the frustrated voters.
According to Washington, D.C., chief adviser and spokesman for the progressive group MoveOn (Remaining) Katrin Jean-Perry said on Friday: "Women will not forget what happened yesterday – they will not forget it either tomorrow or November".
According to Mic, on Friday morning, protesters sang "Listapad is approaching!" during a demonstration at the Legal Committee when the Republicans decided to proceed to the candidature of Cavano, despite the testimony of Dr. Kristin Blaise Ford.
In an interview with a news site, Steve Rothenberg, a deputy political observer, said, "People will be extremely interested and motivated."
"They say it's now, and it's true.
However, motivation can be attributed, especially to women aged 18-29 who have not yet been appointed and who have not often voted if they do not like the president."
Before the Forum gave evidence of the applicant's allegations of the position of the Supreme Court judge in sexual crime, analysts predicted the negative reaction of voters if the Republicans insisted on confirmation.
According to NBC News, earlier this week the head of the National Committee of the Republican Party Michael Steel said, "This is an unpleasant story for the Republican Party."
As President of the U.S. President of the United States (priorities) (a group that helps in the pre-democratic campaign), Hay Secil, "it is not right to vote on the committee, the final vote, or the fact that Cavano was on the jury's side, and in how they responded to the situation and how they went on doing it."
However, American ideas about what to believe were divided into Ford or Cavano, and there is little more support for Ford.
As a result of a new study by YouGov 41% of respondents believe or believe in Ford’s testimony, Cavano believes or believes 35% of the respondents.
In addition, 38 percent of the respondents noted that, in their view, Cawano had given or almost gave false testimony, while 30% of the respondents said the same about Ford.
According to The Guardian, after the pressure from the FBI, the charges against the Ford and another caller, Debor Ramirez, are checked.
Last week, Ford gave a witness under oath to the Senate's Legal Committee about how Cavano attacked her while she was in the state of alcohol use when she was 17 years old.
Ramires said that a candidate at the position of the Supreme Court judge showed her his genitals at the festival while they were teaching at the University of Hell in the 1980s.
The Internet comes from the world network and plans to launch "new Internet," to create Google and Facebook competition
Team Berners-Lie, a member of the global Internet network, is launching a new launch to create a competition for Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest world technology legend project, Inrupt company, is being developed by a platform with an open source source of Solid, which is the idea of Bernersu Lee.
With the Solid platform, users can choose where to store data and who to provide access to this or other information.
In an exclusive interview, Fast Company Berners-Lie was pleased that the Inrupt objective is "world domination".
"We should do this now," he said about the start.
It's a historic moment."
The application uses Solid technology that allows users to create "personal online data storage" or POD.
It can store contact lists, current business lists, calendars, audiobooks, and other tools for personal use and work.
It's like using Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify in one browser.
The unique feature of this personal online data storage is that it fully meets the user's needs, which can access any information.
The company calls it "increasing personal capacity through data".
According to Director General Inrupt John Bruce, the company aims to provide resources, processes and appropriate skills so that the Solid platform can be accessible to everyone.
At the present time, the company is composed of Berners-Lei, Brussels, security platforms for IBM, several state developers hired to work on the project, and a community of programmers.
From this week onwards, technology developers around the world can create their own autonomous applications using tools available on Inrupt website.
Berners-Lie said that he and his team would not negotiate with Facebook and Google about whether to make a full replacement when all their business models are making domicile changes over a short period of time.
"We don't ask for their permission."
In a Saturday publication on Medium Berners-Lie, the Inrupt mission "to ensure business energy and ecosystem and help protect the integrity and quality of a new network created on a solid platform".
In 1994, Berners Lee transformed the Internet, establishing the World Cup Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In the last month, Berners-Lie is an influential figure in the debate on network neutrality.
Even at the time of the launch of Inrupt Berners-Liy, the founder and director of the Consortium of the World Heritage site, The Web Foundation and the Institute of Open Data.
"I look very optimistic about the next generation of network development," added Berners-Lie.
Bernard Vann: Celebration of a church representative of the Cross Victoria in the Year of World War I
The only representative of the Church of England who received the Order of the Cross of Victoria to take part in war during World War I is respected in his home city within 100 years.
Colonel Bernard Vann received a reward for his participation in the attack under the Belgian and Leukor on September 29, 1918.
However, he died of a four - day sniper bullet and never learned that he had won the highest military reward in Britain.
On Saturday, two of his grandsons discovered a monumental stone during a parade in the town of Rashden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, called it "very symbolic" because the discovery of a monumental stone took place about 100 years after his grandfather made a promise that he was rewarded.
According to London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Colonel Vann transferred his battalion through the St. Caten channel "through very thick clouds and under the blazing fire of field weapons and kolumes."
Later he rushed to the fireplace and with "exploited kindness" he pulled his sword forward, one went to the field and destroyed three enemy weapons.
Colonel Vanna shot the German sniper on October 4, 1918 — a little over a month before the end of the war.
72-year-old Michael Vann said his grandfather did what he could never repeat and deserved respect.
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, took the lead in the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that "it feels very proud of taking part in this council" and he added that "because of the real hero, he shows him the respect that so many people show him."
The MMA fans didn't sleep all night to see the Bellator 206 tournament, but instead they showed them "Peppu"
Imagine that you don't sleep all night just to see what happened to the Bellator 206 tournament, and they refuse to look at the main event.
There were 13 battles in the San Jose tournament, including six main programs that were broadcast overnight in Britain on 5 channels.
On the 6th of the morning, just before Gegard Musassi and Rory McDonald were ready to meet in a unit, the British television monitors died from sight when the battle wasn't on the screen.
Some observers were not caught by this because they did not sleep until the very morning, waiting for the battle.
One of his fans wrote on Twitter that his child's interfering with a child movie seemed "some sort of crazy joke."
"According to the government's decree that the content that was transferred by 6:00 a.m. was inappropriate, so they were forced to leave the child transmission," said Dave Schwartz, the senior marketing and public relations president of Bellator, when he was asked about the telemedicine,
"Peppa pig," yeah.
The president of Bellator Scott Cooker promised to work on a cross-platform chart for future coverage and viewers in Britain.
"I think if we talk about retranslation, we'll be able to fix it," said Cooker.
"The road is now there on Sunday, 6 a.m., and we can't do anything until it's Sunday, and they're on Monday.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the transmission was turned off, we found a lot of messages we responded to, and the text was not very friendly.
We thought it was a technical injustice, and we tried to eliminate it.
However, this proved to be an incompatibility with government regulations.
I can promise you it'll never happen again.
We're going to speed up the tournament to five battles instead of six as usual.
It's a really unpleasant situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Dale felt "bad" for others because of his sexual orientation
The Olympics in the water, Tom Daily, says that he grew up feeling worse than others because of his sexual orientation, but this gave him reason to succeed.
A 24-year-old sportsman said he didn't understand that "not all like him" until he went to high school.
Taking part in the transfer of desert Island Discs to Radio 4, led by Lauren Lavern, he noted that he openly spoke of the rights of gays to give others "a hope."
He also stated that because of parental influence, the Olympics were less likely to win.
A doctor who has been conducting this program for a long time, Kirsty Young, went to a hospital for several months.
When I came as a couple to the first Lavern program, Dale said that he felt "bad" for others when he was a kid, because "the society didn't accept when people liked boys and girls."
He said, "So far, the feeling of inferiority and differentity has been what gave me strength and strength to achieve success."
In his words, he wanted to prove that something was worth not to disappoint all those who finally learned about his orientation.
A two-time bronze Olympic show became a well-known fight for the rights of LBGT society and was used to appear at the these-year Games of Association in Australia to call on more countries to decriminate homosexuality.
He said he spoke openly about his views because he felt happy that he could live openly without any consequences, and wanted to give this "hope" to others.
A three - year - old world champion admitted that his feelings for a man, American filmmaker Dustin Lans Bleke, whom he met in 2013, had become a real disappointment to him.
Délie went along with Oscar’s prize laureate, who was 20 years older than he was last year, but, as he put it, the difference of age was never a problem.
"When you're through so much at such a young age" (In the first Olympic games he was 14 years old, and in the third year his father died from cancer), it's hard to find someone who would also survive the same age and fall.
In June in marriage, there was a son named Robert Blackdale, and since then, according to Dale, his "councility" has changed.
"If you asked me last year, I'd just think about what I should get gold," he said.
"You know that there are things far more important than the Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold is Robbie."
His son was named after his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after he had major brain cancer.
Dale said that his father was unable to sleep well and that before he died, he asked whether they had bought flowers at the London Olympics in 2012 because he wanted to sit in the first row.
"I couldn't tell him "You won't sit in the first row because you won't be there anymore," said Dale.
"I held him in my hand when he stopped breathing, and only after he actually stopped breathing and dying, I finally realized that he was not infertile," he said.
The following year, Dalia participated in the 2012 Olympic Games and won a prize.
"I knew that this was what I had dreamed of all my life: to throw myself in front of my peers at the Olympic Games, and there was no feeling better than that," said Daily.
This feeling also inspired him to choose his first song, Proud (Goldier) in the performance of Giser Smolle, which was resonating with him while preparing for the Olympic Games and still calling for the walls.
The Desert Island Discs program is released on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11.15 p.m.
On Saturday with a match tournament for the Cuboc Reider, Michaelson was fired, which was not in shape.
American Phil Michaelson will set up a record on Sunday playing his 47th game in the "Cuboc Rayder" tournament, but he has to resume his form so that this event doesn't happen to him.
Michaelson, who participated in the tournament once every two years during the 12th record, released Captain Jim Furic from the game at the time of the fortifications and forsams.
Instead of staying at the center of events, as he often did, playing outside the United States, a five - year - old conqueror all day encouraged the team and practiced side by side, hoping to save the emotions.
Since Michaelson was not famous for his violent hits even while he was on his career track, a 48-year-old sportsman didn't go to the hard field for the Le Golf National golf course, where rap is usually punished for blocking hits.
And if that's not the way it's going to be, in the ninth game on the week of Michaelson, we'll have to meet with the champion of the Open Championship and the master of the exact hit of the French Molinary, who won all their matches this week in the fight with the new Tommy Flytwood.
If Americans who leave their three eyes after 12 single combatants do well to start, Michaelson’s match can be decisive.
Furic expressed confidence in his sportsman, and he certainly had nothing to add to it.
"He finally understood his role today, pushed me behind his back, pushed me around and said he'd be ready tomorrow," said Furic.
"He doesn't doubt his powers.
Michaelson is a member of the Hall of Fame who did so much for the team last week and this week.
I probably didn't expect him to play in two matches.
I predicted more matches, but that's what happened, so we decided to do it.
He wants to be there, in the field, like anybody else."
If Michaelson goes to the field on Saturday, he'll beat Nick Faldo's record, who played the biggest number of matches in the "Cuboc Rider" tournament.
He may finish his career in the "Cuboc Ryder" tournament, which has never responded to his individual achievement.
On account of Michaelson’s 18 winnings, 20 hits and 7 hits, but Furic said that his presence could play a decisive role in the team.
"He's funny, funny, nice, he likes to play with others, he's a guy who's good at teaming," explains Furik.
"I think young players had a good time walking on it, as well as this week, and it was interesting to watch.
He's more than just a player."
Captain of the European team, Thomas Bourne knows that the big waste doesn't solve anything.
Thomas Bion, the European commander of the team, knows from experience that a sensitive break in front of the last day of the tournament for Cubok Ryder is not yet guaranteeing victory.
In 1997, datchain argued in the field of the Walderram Club, where the team fought with his Ballesteros against the Americans on five fronts, but won the match with a small gap with the result of 1410.000:131⁄2.
"You remind yourself that we had a great game in the Walderram field; a great game in Brooklyn where we had won, and in the Walderram field where we had won violence," said Byron after a review of the winning games in Class 2018 with a result of 5:3 on Friday and a lesson at the Le Golf National stadium, after which the race became 10:6.
So history teaches me and every player of the team that nothing has been decided yet.
Tomorrow we have to play with maximum performance.
Get out of the field and do everything you need.
The game will be finished only after the result is shown on the table.
We have the goal of getting this trophies, and that's what we want.
As I said earlier, I focus on the 12 players of our team, but we know who is against us -- the best players in the world."
Satisfied with the speech of his players on the hard field, Bion added: "I will never run forward.
Tomorrow everything can be different.
The next day, we're expected to have an individual match, and that's something else.
It's nice to play field with a partner when everything's going well, but just when you're alone there, you can check what you're worth like a golfer.
Here's how players should be set up tomorrow: at the limit of options.
You're leaving your partner without support, and now he's gonna have to show you what he's up to."
Unlike Bourne, the opposite number Jim Furic expects his partners to play better on an individual level, except Jordan Spita and Justin Thomas, who had three eyes from four.
To the very end of the last day, Furika has returned to different sides: he was among the winners in Brooklyn, but he was defeated when a team from Europe created "The Miracle in Medina".
"I remember every damn word," he said in response to a question about how Ben Crenshaw, the captain of the 1999 team, organized players before the last day of the game.
"We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but we need to start successfully as it was in Brooklyn and Medina.
When the initiative moves on one side, players in the middle of the distance experience special pressure.
We've appropriately placed players in the team's compound, so we're going to do something incredible tomorrow."
Tomasus was given the opportunity to try to raise opposition to the ball-fighting against Rory Makilroy. The first half of the European team arrived at Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Ram, Tommy Flytwood and Ian Paulter.
"Only these partners and in this order I have chosen because I want to share equally throughout the game," Bion commented on his choice of players on individual matches.
The introduction of a new German warship was rejected again
The latest fleet of the German Navy was to enter into force in 2014 instead of the old wartime courts of the Cold War. However, according to local media, this will not happen until the following year because of the unfair system and the rising cost.
According to the newspaper Die Zeit, received from a military intelligence officer, the launch of the Reinland-Pfalz ship, the main ship of the latest class of the Baden-Württemberg fleet, was postponed until the first half of 2019.
This ship was supposed to join the rest of the fleet in 2014, but the problems resulting from the shipment were detrimental to the implementation of the ambitious project.
Four Baden-Wurtermberg ships, which the military-morrowership ordered in 2007, are to replace the old Braman class.
Understandably, they will be equipped with powerful weaponry, a collection of anti-aircraft and protocorobic rockets, as well as some technologies that reduce attention, especially radiolocation, infrared and acoustic.
Another important feature is the waiting period of technical security. It is expected that new franchises will not be able to return to base port for about two years.
Journalists Die Zeit, however, note that modern military ships that were to force German military power into the sea are also advanced at the time of entry into operation.
The F125 brutal frigate came under the title of the Turkish newspaper when the German military-naval forces officially refused to take the ship into action and returned it to the Blohm + Voss verb in Hamburg.
This is the first case of the return of the military ship to the shipbuilding company after delivery.
The reasons for the return were very little known, but the German media mentioned significant "software and equipment deficiencies", which made the battleship impossible for military operations.
The lack of software is particularly significant because the Baden-Wurtermberg ship is made up of about 120 seafarers, only half of the soldiers who served on the old Bremen fleets.
Moreover, it was found that the ship is too heavy to carry, which undermines its operational characteristics and limits its potential for further modernization.
It is believed that the Reynland-Pfaltz frigate is twice as heavy (7,000 tons) for ships as were used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to poor equipment, another problem has become a total cost of the project, which also includes the cost of preparing the crew.
The expected 2.2 billion euros have been converted into a total of 3.1 billion euros ($3.6 billion).
The problems of getting new frigates were particularly important in the light of recent warnings about the collapse of German military and maritime forces.
At the beginning of the year of the Bundestag mandate on the issue of armed forces, Hans-Peter Bartels said that the WMS had "left a small number of ships fit for military tasks".
The officer stated that the situation had worsened for some time, since the old ship had been released from operation and no new ones had arrived.
He was deeply sorry about the fact that none of the "Badden-Wurtermberg" franchise could fill the military-sea fleet.
The National Heritage Watches the Secret Life of Talkers
A new study carried out on the territory of land management in Scotland is intended to establish how people say they use landchaft in search of food.
Scientists hope that the data received will help to shed light on the conduct of these unique flight crews so that they can make their way out of storage in the future.
In the fields of Inver in West Russia, Scotland's National Heritage Sciences will be observed for species such as the Netopia carica and the Pygmie Netomy, as well as the usual and guided night.
Special registries will be placed in strategic locations in the field of land management to monitor the behavior of the speakers during the season.
Workers and volunteers of the National Heritage of Scotland will also conduct mobile research using hand detectors.
An expert analysis of all recorded sounds will help to establish the frequency and frequency of the voices.
Then it is planned to draw up a detailed map of animal life and prepare a report to link animal behavior with their environment.
Rob Dwar, a Nature Protection Adviser in Scotland, is expected to help determine which areas of life are the most important and how they are used in each species.
This information will help to assess the effectiveness of environmental monitoring (e.g. the formation of lakes) and identify optimal forest storage methods for species and other related species.
During the last century, there has been a significant decline in the population of sayingers in Scotland and Great Britain.
They are threatened by active construction and expansion of the territory, which removes their pollution.
Other negative factors include winding and lighting, mud paper, chemical processing of building materials, as well as domestic fires.
They're actually not blind.
However, during nighttime hunting, they are more effective in helping them to catch more than their eyes.
They use a complex method of elocation to detect comas and impediments to flight trajectory.
Over 270 historic buildings, 38 special gardens, and 76,000 acres [76,000 ha] of land throughout the country are being seriously affected by the problem of logging.
Ten specialized experts are regularly conducting research, testing sites, and sometimes even rescue operations.
The organization's forces have even created the first and the only one in Scotland to say it. It's located in the territory of Triv in the Dhamfris-and-Gallway area. It has eight of the ten species of saying that live in Scotland.
David Thompson, the director of the site, says it's an ideal place for them.
"In the territory of Triv's three wonderful conditions for saying," he says.
"This is an old building, a lot of giant trees and other pleasant living conditions.
But we still need to know a lot more about what we're doing here and elsewhere, and we'll be able to learn more about what they need to grow."
He insists that it is very important to check the area where there are speakers before any technical work is carried out, since the deliberate destruction of one place of pollution for the child can kill up to 400 singles with children, which is likely to cause the destruction of all the local population.
They are told and their nests are protected by law. Animals are forbidden to kill, torture, or worry.
Elizabeth Ferrell, an officer of the Scottish Conservative Centre, urged the public to join the organization’s efforts.
She said, "We still need a lot to know about what we're talking about, and we haven't yet discovered the characteristics of the population of many species."
Ronald rejects the charge of rape, and his lawyers prepare calls against the German edition
Cristian Ronald called the accusations "inclined" and said that people "try to draw attention to themselves", using his name.
His lawyer was willing to give calls against the German newspaper Der Spiegel, which published suspicious information.
American Catherine Mayorga has been accused of a forum for the assembly of Portugal and the Yuventus football club in the rape, which took place in 2009 in a hotel number in Las Vegas.
As Der Spiegel reported on Friday, Ronalda paid $375,000 for her silence.
Within a few hours of the release of the 33-year-old Ronalda prosecutor, 142 million of his followers were sent to the Instagram video transmission, calling the corresponding messages "inclined".
"No, no, no, no, no!
Today's charges are a bribe," said a five-year-old goldsmith on the camera.
"They want to draw attention to themselves using my name.
It's natural.
These people want to live with me, but similar situations are part of my work.
I’m a happy person and I’m all right, ” added a football player, smiling.
According to the Reuters Information Agency, Ronald's lawyers are preparing calls against Der Spiegel for published charges that they called "unacceptable news of suspicion in the field of private life".
Lawyer Christian Chertz said a footballer would require compensation for "the moral damage to the extent that is due to serious damage which is likely to be one of the most serious cases of personal rights violations in recent years."
It is claimed that the incident occurred in June 2009 at the Palms Casino Hotel in Las Vegas.
It is reported that after a meeting in the night club, Ronald and Mayorga returned to the player’s number where he seemed to have abused her, such testimony was handed to the local court of Clarke, Nevada.
Majorga says that after the described incident, Ronald fell on his knees and said he had a "99 percent good boy", which led to "one percent".
As noted in the documents, Ronalda confirmed that he had sex with the model but for general agreement.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and then to the hospital where her traumas were photographed, but later she agreed to a court settlement because she was "frightful of taxes" and warned of "public humiliation."
Now a 34-year-old woman wants to cancel a previous contract because she continues to suffer from an incident that she said had a place.
At the time of Ronald's incident, he was preparing to move to the Real Madrid FC from the Manchester United FC this year, and he became the winner of the Italian football team, the Yuventus team, for 100 million euros.
Brexit: Great Britain "will be permanently damaged" for the loss of car manufacturers
Great Britain "will be permanently damaged" if it loses the status of the world leader in the post-Brexit car industry.
He added that he welcomed the statement of representatives of Toyota UK who told BBC journalists that, in the event of Britain's accession to the EU without agreement, the company would have to stop its production and work in Bernaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," said Minister Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that the effects of cuts on the cord in Brexit case could cost jobs without agreement.
In Bernaston, where Toyota is manufactured by Auris and Avenis models, the truck released about 150,000 cars, 90 percent of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"In my view, if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, production at our plant will be stopped," said Marvin Kuk, Director General Toyota in Bernaston.
Other car manufacturers, such as Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, are also concerned about how the UK exit from the EU without an agreement on international trade.
For example, BMW stated that the factory of the Mini model in Oxford would be closed within a month after Brexit.
The main concerns of car manufacturers are that Brexit could risk supply chains without agreement.
The Toyota line manufacturer works in the operational mode of the supply of details and materials as needed - details are available every 37 minutes from suppliers in Britain and the EU for car manufacturers.
If the United Kingdom leaves the EU without agreement on March 29, there may be a breakdown in the supply of details that will lead to delays and lack of material.
As noted in the company, Toyota store contains no more than one day's details. So the production will have to stop.
Greg Clark noted that in the EU's plan to establish a relationship with Terse May (Checkers Plan), "the scheme for avoiding cross-border problems" was specifically designed.
"We need an agreement. We need an optimum agreement, which I think will enable us not only to achieve success at the moment but also to use the prospects that have occurred," he said during today's radio station BBC Radio 4.
"In view of the testimony of Toyota's company's representatives, as well as other car manufacturers, we finally need to keep up with the high-efficiency delivery chain."
Toyota could not tell how long the production would be stopped, but in the long term, it is expected that the increase in costs will result in a downturn of business competitiveness and that as a result, jobs will be cut short.
Peter Cuvallaris, head of the U.S. Professional Association of Business in Bernaston, who worked here for 24 years, said that other participants were extremely concerned: "From experience, I can say that the short-term jobs are not being restored."
The representative of the government noted: "We have issued a precise and reliable plan for the development of our future relations with the EU."
The Trampa and Rosenstein meetings can be reenacted at the White House
According to the representatives of the White House on Sunday, a meeting with Deputy Prosecutor General Rod Rod Rosenthein could be "reclassed once a week" until they held discussions on the issue of Brett Cavano's application for office in the Supreme Court.
Rosenstein controls the work of Special Prosecutor Robert Muller, who is investigating Russia's involvement in the election, the links between the assistants of Trapa and Russia and the potential interference with justice by the president.
Within a few months in Washington, D.C., they are discussing the possibility of the release of the deputy general of the prosecutor-general, who is at risk of Muller's independence.
Earlier this month in the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had expressed concern about using microphones to record talks with Trump and the possibility of giving up the president's office after the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein did not confirm this information.
But last Sunday he visited the White House on the back of the news that the officer was about to leave.
Instead of this meeting with Trump, who then lived in the United Nations headquarters in New York, was assigned to the fourth.
Tripp said that "I wouldn't want to" release Rosenstein, but then they refused to meet for a while with the Senate Legal Committee meeting to give a witness to Cavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment, Dr. Christine Blaise Ford.
On Friday, Trump was scheduled to conduct a week's trial of the FBI on charges against Cavanaugh, which further eliminated the vote in Senate.
Press Secretary Trampa, Sarah Sanders, spoke on the Fox News Sunday television show.
When she asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said, "This meeting is not scheduled, maybe it's going to happen this week, and I expect it to be postponed for a week, given all the events related to the Supreme Court.
But let's see, I'm always watching for the press to have the last information."
Some journalists disagree: Sanders didn’t have a radio briefing at the White House on September 10.
The leader Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders replied that the poor practice of briefings was not related to the denial of "play on the public" by television reporters, although she added, "I can't deny that they're playing on the public."
Then she admitted that she herself was going to talk to the press more.
"The president answers the question more frequently than any president to him," she said, adding, without referring to the source: "Statistics speak for themselves."
Sanders noted that the briefings would all be held, but "if there's a way to ask the President of the United States questions, it's better than talking to me."
We're often trying to talk to the press, which should be particularly noticeable over the last few weeks, and the opportunity to talk to the President of the United States is not worse than the press conference."
Trap regularly answers questions during the White House's marches, open meetings or press conferences for the participation of high-level guests.
Personal press conferences are rarely held.
In New York this week, the president may have demonstrated why this is so, in the face of the media that they are shocked and sometimes surprised.
The State Secretary on Health Protection of Scotland addressed EU workers in connection with Brexit's attacks
The Secretary of State for Health Protection has addressed to EU citizens who are working in Scotland's National Health Service to express their appreciation for their work and ask them to continue after Brexit.
Jean Freeman, a member of the Parliament of Scotland, sent a letter less than six months to the EU.
The Government of Scotland has already undertaken an obligation to cover the value of an application for the status of permanent residence for EU citizens working in autonomous state services.
In her letter, Mrs. Freeman said: "For the past few years, negotiations between Britain and the EU have been ongoing on the issue of exit.
But the British government is trying to prepare for possible exit without agreement.
I know that this period can be very distressing to you.
That is why I would like to stress again how I appreciate the contribution of each employee, regardless of nationality.
colleagues from all over the European Union and the country beyond it share valuable experience and skills, strengthening and improving health services for the benefit of patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is your home, we really want you to stay."
Christian Ebercrombie transferred a terminal operation after head trauma
The Tennissey State Tigers team commander Christion Ebercrombie transferred a terminal operation after having his head trauma in a week's fight against Wanderbilt Komodores, which his team lost with account 31:27.
The chief coach of the Tennisy State Tigers team told the reporters that the player was getting trauma soon to break.
"He came to the side line where he was wrong," said Red.
A sideline trainer and medical personnel gave Ebercrombie oxygen before taking it on their shoulders for further examination.
The official representative of the Tennessy State Tigers team told Chris Harris from the WSMV (Nashville, Tennessee) channel that Ebercrombies were operating at the University of Wenderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "until there's no evidence of type and severity of trauma." The Tennis State Tigers team is trying to find out when the player gets a trauma.
Ebercrombie, a friend of mine, spent his first season in Tennessee State Tigers after crossing the Illinois team.
He did five matches a week before he got out of the game.

This step can be considered as an attempt to neutralize the successful efforts of Jeremy Corbin to persuade young voters to make more available housing intended for high-paid workers.
The increase of the target will apply to natural and legal persons who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom. The additional government costs are aimed at helping those forced to sleep under the open sky.
An additional myth that leads to the rise of the double age to the second residence and the immortality of the order may be three percent.
In the Ministry of Finance, additional 120 million pounds are expected to be spent each year.
According to experts, 13% of the new homelessness that takes place in London happens to be owned by foreign citizens, which leads to price increases and makes it difficult for those who just dream about their own home.
Many productive areas of the country, especially in the capital, are desolated, since the vast number of foreign buyers spend most of their time abroad.
The new plan of action appeared just a few weeks after Boris Johnson called down government fraud to make living more accessible to young people.
He accused large construction companies of maintaining high prices for the safe way to collect land without further use of it. He called on Teresa Mei to refuse the quota to make it available to correct the "greedy position on the life market" in the United Kingdom.
Mr. Corbin announced a low level of reform in the area of homelessness, including the control of ordinary wages and the inability to move without a major reason.
He also proposes to extend local joy in building a new home.
Theresa May said: "I promised Turkey that I would dedicate my life to reinvigorating the British dream – for every new generation of life should be better.
This requires a change in our imperfect life market.
Britain will always remain open to those who want to live, work, and build their future here.
However, the fact that individuals who do not live in Britain, as well as foreign companies, buy housing under the same conditions as British citizens, cannot be considered just.
The problem of living under the open sky is still very painful for many people.
Jack Ross: "I'd like to be the main trainer in Scotland."
Chief coach of FC Sanderland, Jack Ross, says that "more than anything" ever wants to take over Scotland's assembly.
The 42-year-old Scotchman has taken over the club from the northeastern country, which now owns a third place in the First Football League, on three eyes away from the leader.
Ross moved to the St. of L.A. this summer, returning to the last season of St. Mary's FC to the Premier League of Scotland.
"I wanted to represent my country as a player.
I got to the second congregation in Scotland, but it all ended," said Ross during the Sports Sound program at the BBC Scotland radio station.
"When I was a child, my father and I often watched the game in Scotland at the "Hampden Park" stadium. It always fascinated me.
The only hope for me is to be successful at the head coach of the club."
The predecessors of Rossa in the Sanderland FC, in particular, were Dick Lawyer, David Moyes, Sam Ellaridas, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keen, Gustavo Poet and Paolo Di Canio.
The latest head coach of the FC, Alloa Atletek, says that he did not feel any concern about the transition to the big club for such authoritative names, which had previously been withdrawn from the FC Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"At the current stage I'll think he's been successful if the club comes back to Premier League.
Due to its structure and the material and technical security of this club, there is no doubt the Premier League level," he noted.
"It's going to be a difficult task, but the other result is either I'm going to think of myself as successful."
Ross has only been building a three-year training career, and he's been working with another trainer in Dhambarton's FC for 15 months.
Then he helped Alloa look after the FC reached the third division, and in the next season from St. Mirren, he traveled from the flight stage to the winning title of the first division.
According to Rossa, he now feels more comfortable than ever during his career in FC "Claid", "Gartpol", "Folkerk", "St. Mirren" and "Hamilton Academical".
"I'm on my way," he says, talking about going to the Alla FC.
"I sincerely believed that training was more appropriate to me than playing.
That sounds strange because I was successful, well done, and achieved some heights.
But playing isn't easy.
There are many challenges that need to be overcome each week.
I am still dealing with them through stress and stress, but I feel in my place as a primary coach.
I've always been interested in training, and I've never felt so comfortable about all my adult life since I chose this profession."

Study: 17:30 a.m. - ideal time for beer kitchen
The summer sky has helped to increase the use of British popes who do not have the best time, but it has sent pressure on the restaurant network.
According to estimates, sales of potatoes and bars in July increased by 2.7%, while restaurant income decreased by 4.8%.
The author of Peter Martin's accountant from CGA, who was consulted on business development, noted: "With the sun's rising and longer than expected, England's participation in the Championships world was pasted by the same scheme as in the previous month when the popping took place at 2.8%.
Red falling to 1.8% in July.
Babies and bars, which are focused on drinking, while having the best indicators, increase their income is the equivalent loss of restaurants.
Babies that feed on food have also suffered from spouts, but not as much as restaurants.
It seems that visitors are only interested in drinking.
In subcontrolries and bars, the monthly consumption of alcohol increased by 6.6%, while food was reduced by 3%."
Paul Neuman, an analyst at the RSM Department of Free and Business Affairs, said: "We have been watching such trends since the end of April.
Weather and large social or sports events remain the main factors affecting sales on the internal market.
Not surprisingly, restaurant groups continue to lose income. Annual sales drop by 4.8% raises special concerns about the need to cut costs.
A long summer of waiting didn't come at the best time for stores that offer food, and let's see if the temperature we've observed in the autumn can give them such necessary rest."
The overall increase in sales in bakery and restaurants, including new warehouses, was 2.7% in July, reflecting a slowdown on the market for new brands.
The global index of Coffer Peach Tracker sales in the pubs, bars and restaurants of the United Kingdom is a reflection of the combined and analysed performance indicators of 47 working groups, a total of which exceeds 9 billion pounds of sterling.
Every five children have a hidden account from their parents on the social network
As the results of the study show, every five children, sometimes not 11 years of age, have been hidden from parents and teachers on social networks.
A study of 20,000 high school students showed an increase in the number of effective sites in Instagram
This news has raised concerns about the possible location of sexual content
20% of the students reported having a "main account record" that they show to their parents.
Every five children, sometimes 11 years of age or older, create an account on social networks that is hidden from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students showed an increase in the number of effective sites in Instagram — a social network for the exchange of photos.
This news has raised concerns about the possible location of sexual content.
20 percent of the students reported having a clean "main" account that shows parents as well as one or more private ones.
The mother who accidentally met on her 13-year-old daughter's cover-up saw the call, "Take me down."
A study conducted by Digital Awariness UK and Headmasters' and Headness' Conference in private schools (HMC) showed that 40% of children between the ages of 11 and 18 had two social networks profiles. Half of these children admitted that an additional account is confidential.
The head of HMC Mike Bukenen's Association noted: "We are very concerned about the fact that many teenagers feel the desire to create an online space where parents and teachers cannot find them."
Alyde Doyle becomes "a representative of the interests of athletes" at the Scottish Athletics Council
Elide Doyle was elected to the Scottish Athletics Council as independent director during the annual general election of members of the government.
Doyle, Scotland’s most famous athlete, led by En - Bitty, called this step a great opportunity for those who take the lead in sports to take advantage of its wide experience gained at international level during the last decade.
"Eilede is used with great respect among Scotland's, Great Britain's and the world's athletes, and we are convinced that by joining her to the council, Scotland's athletic sport will be of great benefit," Bitty assured.
Doyle said, "I'll be inspired by the role of an athlete's representative, and I hope I can really benefit and contribute to the development of sport in Scotland."
The American, a four - year - old Olympic champion, who won a 200 - and - 400 - foot [200 m] race in 1996 in Atlanta, and now a sports observer for BBC, lost the chance to go through a transhistoric ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: "That's why I became an insulin.
I couldn't go.
The doctors said that it would only be time to show how much time I can recover.
I was able to regain my perfection by my extraordinary efforts, and I have learned to walk again and enjoy the dynamics that I have been doing today!
Thank you for your support!"
In advertising, women were compared to cows - Internet users ’ thoughts were divided
The malaise manufacturer was confronted with a variety of Internet users' reactions to advertising, in which young mothers are compared with actual cows.
In recognition of the release of a product called "the world's first silent nucleo-drug malt", Elvie, a technological manufacturer of consumer goods, released a commercial in the form of a humorous music video to demonstrate the freedom that the mother provides for the new viewer.
The four real mothers dance in a packed blue dome under the song, which contains the words, "Yes, I like myself, but I don't have the chest," and "As you can see on my own, it's not my chests, but my breasts."
Next, the choir sings, "Shut up, shake down to make the kids feel comfortable, shake off, stop the baby."
However, the advertising role published on the Facebook page led to a disturbing discussion online.
The video received 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, but the response of Internet users has been quite different. Many people have noted that in advertising, the "dangerous organization" of milk production in the industry is unappreciative.
"It's not very wise to use cows for advertising this product.
Like us, they need to be pregnant and born to give milk, but their children are taken to them by themselves within a few days of birth," wrote one of the users.
Elvie can easily be hidden in a brush for swallowing (Elvie/Mother)
Here's another comment: "It's understood that it's traumatic both for the mother and for the child.
But why don't you pick them up for the commercials of a milk-smoker for women who have to beat their babies?"
Someone else added, "This advertising is very far from reality."
Other users appeared to protect the advertising role. One of the women appeared to be "very happy."
"I think it's a great idea.
It would be unthinkable if she were still breast - feeding.
I felt like a cow.
The commercial's something crazy, but I didn't look for its hidden contents.
It's a great product," someone wrote.
Here's another comment: "Every commercial, focused on mothers who give birth to milk (often at work or in a toilet) and feel like cows.
This is not intended to highlight the advantages and disadvantages of the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, women are showing milk - feeding insects that are hidden in their buttghalts.
The idea of advertising is based on information that many women who use such products feel like cows.
However, Elvie's eyebrows are completely quiet, without any tires or tubes and is easily hidden in a bustle to catch. This allows women to move freely, keep the children and even go out of the street.
Anna Balarin, partner and executive director of Mother's advertising agency, commented on the situation: "Elvie's triggerer is so revolutionary a product that he demanded a clear and provocative presentation.
By means of a parallel between women who are breast - feeding and real cows, we wanted to draw attention to the characteristics of breast - feeding, an interesting and interesting way to demonstrate the incredible feeling of freedom that the new breeder brings.
Elvie’s impostor doesn’t get into the news first.
During the week of fashion in London, the mother of two children appeared on the floor with this product while showing a dress from the model of Marty Yakobowski.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly moved to a busy city on the Texas border
The number of migrant children detained has increased dramatically, although the number of monthly crossings of the border has remained relatively constant, often because the harsh rhetoric and policies of the Trump administration have been difficult to place children in the carers.
In most cases caregivers themselves have been exposed without documents. Now they are afraid to risk their own lives in the country, offering to take responsibility for the child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential caregivers and other adult members of their households would be obliged to give fingerprints and that these data would be transmitted to immigration services.
Last week, Mattie Albens, senior director of the Immigration and Emergency Control Office, testified before the Congress that the Bureau’s staff had arrested dozens of people who had applied for care for minors without supervision.
Later, the Bureau confirmed that 70 percent of the detainees did not have a criminal record.
"About 80% of the people who are caregivers or members of their home countries live in the country are illegal.
So we continue to follow these people," said Mr. Albens.
According to the crew staff, in order to speed up the case of children, officials have introduced new rules that will require some of the children to appear in court for a month after detention, not 60 days ago.
Many of them will be able to use videoconference rather than come to court personally to bring their legal status before immigration judges.
Those who do not have the right to access the appellant will be deported quickly.
According to the community staff and official data from responsible officials in the last month, the longer children remain under the care of, the more likely they will be to experience anxiety or depression.
The researchers say that these problems are being increased in stores, such as Tornillo, where it is more difficult to monitor the psychological condition of children.
They added that by moving children to their home city and not spending enough time preparing themselves emotionally or getting along with friends, we are risking the trauma that many of them have already experienced.
Syria ordered the U.S. "occupational force" of France and Turkey to immediately bring out the army
In addition, in front of the General Assembly of the United Nations, Minister Valid al-Mulalem urged Syrian refugees to return home, although the country had already been in war for eight years.
Muala, who is also serving as Deputy Prime Minister, said that foreign forces had resided in Syria illegally under the threat of terrorism, so "their attitude would be appropriate".
"They have to go right away and not put conditions," he said to the assembly.
Mualam insisted that "the war with terrorism was actually over" in Syria, where more than 36 million men have died since 2011, and millions of people have left their homes.
He said Damascus would continue "this sacred battle until we clear all Syrian territory" from terrorist groups and "any illegal foreign presence".
The United States has deployed approximately 2000 military officers in Syria, mostly teaching and consulting Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who are against President Barara al-Asada.
In the weakened state of France, more than 1,000 soldiers were sent out.
With regard to refugees, Mualem made sure that the country had the right conditions for their return, and he also accused "some Western countries" of the fact that these "express unfounded fears" are caused by which refugees are not forced to return.
"We have called on international cooperation and humanitarian organizations to help people come back," he said.
"We are watching the efforts to make the whole humanitarian problem political."
The United States and the European Union are warning that Syria will not be helped to recover until a political agreement between Asa and the cease - war opposition has been concluded.
UN diplomats report that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the establishment of a buffer zone around Idlib, the last large number of rebels, has created an opportunity to continue political negotiations.
Thanks to the Russian-Turkey agreement, there was a significant rise in the Syrian forces supported by Russia in the province where there are three million people.
However, Mualem stressed that the agreement has "clear terms" and expressed the hope that military action would be directed against the Jihadists, including fighters associated with Al-Qaida Front An-Nurra, who "will be destroyed".
UN Ambassador Stefan de Mistura is expected to call for the first meeting of the new committee, which will be composed by government representatives and opposition to develop a follow-up constitution for Syria and create conditions for elections.
Mualam cited conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the committee, stating that his work should be limited to "view of the articles of the actual constitution", and warned against interfering.
Why Trapa Will Be Reelected
According to this Trampa logic, it can be revised in 2020 if, as many liberal observers are likely to expect, it is not enough after the scandal and improvisation.
It would certainly be "the most dramatic end of the presidency all the time"!
At the moment, viewers do not give a flag.
Since 2014, the number of viewers in the prime-time has doubled (up to 1.05 million) to the CNN channel and actually decreased (up to 1.6 million) to the MSNBC channel.
According to Nilsen, the Fox News averages 2.4 million viewers in the prime time, compared to 1.7 million four years ago, and the program The Rachel Maddow Show on the MSNBC cable channel was at the top of a rating of 3.5 million viewers at night when the main news is being discussed.
"It's a fire that attracts people because it's beyond our understanding," said Neil Ber, who is performing the "Last candidate" drama on the ABC channel on the State Secretary, who becomes president after a devastating attack on capital.
Nell Scowell, an experienced humorist writer and author of the book "Write comedy moments: as well as a number of serious facts about discovering in Hollywood's club" suggests another theory.
She remembered her trip to Boston cab before the 2016 elections.
The water told her to vote for Trapa.
"Why?" she asked.
"Because he's kidding me," he said, "that's what Mrs. Scowell told me.
He's having fun.
Of course, unlike any other content on TV, history from Washington is capable of identifying the future case of Roy against Wade, the possibility of reunification of immigrant families and the state of the world economy.
Disfellowshipping is the only solution that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet you can't say that you're just trying to stay informed by citizens when you've been watching for six hours as a group of experts discuss using Bob Woodward's "well-known" source for his book "Strech", Paul Manafort's skin cover of $15,000" (the "Washington Post") and the shocking findings of Mr. Trampa's anatomism published by Stormy Daniels.
For me, for example, Super Mario will never be an ex.
"The sense of reality-show is partly related to what you agree with every night," said Brent Montgomery, chief executive director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and author of the television program "Stars of Lombard", about rotation in the actor's warehouse and daily daily news returns to the show "Tramp" (the conflict with NFL, support by Kim Chen Ina).
If you allow yourself to be plagued by an epidemic, you can suddenly quit.
When I was able to meet Mr. Fleis at his home on the northern coast of the island of Kawai this week, there was a hot sun (27 degrees Fahrenheit (27 ° C), but he sat at home looking at MSNBC and recording CNN.
He could not get out of the television, not when Brett Cavano stood before the Legal Committee of the Senate and the future Supreme Court appeared on the horse.
"I remember how we created all these crazy shows in our time, and people said it was the beginning of Western civilization," Mr. Fleis told me.
"I took it as a joke, but it seems they were right."

External effects on the most violent inter-elections at Congress
It is no wonder that in the 17th district of Pennsylvania there is an additional financial impact, as two real congressmen are seeking one cross through the look between the electoral districts.
In the struggle for this urban area of Pittsburgh, which had recently been transformed, is a democracy, a member of the House of Representatives of Conor Lemb, who won a victory in another area at the additional elections of the previous spring.
Lemb is against another real congressman, the Republic of Kitto Rotfs, who is now representing the 12th district of Pennsylvania, which is a major measure of the new 17th.
The card was reopened after the decision of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania that the old border areas should benefit the Republicans against the Constitution was taken into consideration.
Pre-election movements in the new 17th districts called for severe opposition between the financial divisions of the main parties, the Committee of the Democratic Party of the United States Congress (DCCC) and the National Committee of the Republican Party (NCRC).
The name Lemba became well known in Pennsylvania after a minimum victory in the 18th district during the additional elections at Congress in March, which were used by the general public.
This place has been belonged to the Republicans for over a decade, and President Donald Trump won a 20-hour victory in this area.
Political experts have given little advantage to democracy.
The United States considered the possibility of punishing El Salvador for China's support but thought
The diplomats recalled a weak opposition from Washington to the actions of the Dominican Republic and Panama, who had previously supported Beijing’s position.
In June 2017, Trump held a warm meeting with Prime Minister Panami Juan Carlos Varela.
State Department officials decided to reject US diplomatic mission leaders from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama through "the recent decision on Taiwan's ignorance," said the press secretary of the Department of Health Noyert at the beginning of this month.
But sanctions were directed only against El Salvador, which received about $140 million in US aid in 2017, particularly in the area of drug control, as well as in support of social and economic development.
The proposed fines, which were intended to reduce financial aid and the target limit of the visa, would be painful for this Central American country with its high level of unemployment and murder.
As a result of internal orders from the North and Central American countries, they held a high-level conference on security and economic growth.
But in the middle of September, senior representatives of the administration came to understand what they wanted the conference to take place. In fact, in this regard the issue of sanctions against El Salvador had ceased.
According to diplomats, Vice-President Mike Pens is now planning to attend a conference, which is scheduled to be held in mid-October, in a sign that the administration considers this West to be very important.
At that time, the three American envoys returned quietly to Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic, for there were no new reports or instructions from Washington.
The representative of Mr. Bolton, in the White House, refused to comment on the details of internal discussions reported by three U.S. officials, two of whom were diplomats, on conditions of anonymity.
This information was confirmed by a side analysis, which was close to the administration, which he also spoke of in terms of anonymity.
Learn From History
The following concern may be the report by Special Prosecutor Robert Muller on possible violations of justice by Trapa, which is a strong confirmation of why public information can now be found.
It is reported that within its investigation, Mueller checks the possible link between the Trapa campaign and the attack on our voting system from Russia.
If the effect of the convention will be changed into other hands, Trump will have to report to the conventioners as well as to the voters and finally to the participants.
In this case, there is a lot of "yes," and I don't want to say that the fall of Trapa continues, like his colleague in Europe.
All of us on both sides of the Atlantic have to make a choice that determines the duration of the struggle.
In 1938 the German officials were ready to set up a coup against Hitler if only the West began to oppose him and supported Chechosolachkin in Munich.
We have failed and lost the opportunity to avoid bloodshed.
History’s history has been marked by such turbulent moments, and the inexhaustible movement of democracy is accelerating or slowing down.
The Americans are now waiting for a few of these deadly intentions.
What will we do if Trapp is released by the Deputy Prosecutor General Rod Rosenstein, a man who is responsible for Mr. Muller's share?
Rosenstein was still in jail when the newspaper reported that he proposed secretly to write talks to the president and shared his thoughts on the issue of the non-compliance of the Tramp crew.
Rosenstein called information in The Times wrong.
"How do we react if the investigation against Bretta Cavano, which has recently begun the FBI, appears to be not fair enough or fair enough or if Cavano's application for office in the Supreme Court is confirmed despite convincing allegations of sexual harassment and the commission of false witnesses?
And first of all, will we, in the medium term, vote for those members of the Congress who can appeal to the responsibility of Trapa?
If we pass these tests, there will be bad times for democracy.
But I don't believe we're going to take it through the lesson I made in Prague.
My mother was a Czech - speaking Jew who had been deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that had ever taken over my family home.
She survived, immigrated to the United States, and 60 years later she sent me to burn Saturday candles on the table with a swastika.
Having such an inheritance, can I not see with optimism in the future?"

Game Dorrans with Rangers with Optimism is waiting for a meeting with the Adensian Rapid.
The FC Reingers will receive the "Rapid" on Thursday. After an amazing nothing in Spain in the game with "Willerreal" at the beginning of this month's victory over the Austrians will provide the Scottish club with a good chance to get out of the G League of Europe.
Because of the trauma of his knee, Lieutenant Graham Dorrance was able to play for the first time in the season only in the game with "Vilderreal", which ended with account 2:2. But he thinks that FC "Raingers" can use this result as a tramplin to achieve more.
"That was a good result for us because the "Willerreal" is a strong team," said a 31-year-old player.
"We went out to the game with the hope of getting a fight something and got one eye.
At the end of the race, we may be able to move forward, but at the same time, we can be sure that nothing is fair.
At first, the opponent was better, but after the break, we adjusted the situation for our benefit.
There will be another important opposition on the fourth day in the European Union.
I hope we can get three eyes, but it's not going to be easy, but our future opponents have shown good results in our last game, but we can count on the support of the sufferers.
The past year, of course, was difficult starting from my trauma and ending changes in the club itself, but now it was normal.
We have a great deal of work, and all the boys are happy.
I hope we can move on, stay behind the last season and succeed."
Women lose their dream through the islands for pension savings
Despite the fact that the test participants had a clear idea of how they wanted to organize themselves, few spoke to their family members about it.
Nearly half of those who participated in the nationwide survey said that they had talked to their husband or wife about the value of long - term care.
Only 10 percent of respondents spoke of it with children.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they don't want to talk about it quickly," said Golly Snaider, Vice-President of the Division of the Nationwide Life Insurance Company.
Here's what you need to do.
Talk to your husband or wife and children: Your family will not be able to provide you with the care you need if you do not tell your family your wishes.
Consult your consultant and your family to determine where and how to get supervision, since this choice may become an important factor in determining the value.
Contact a financial adviser: He can advise you on how to cover your expenses.
The sources of long - term care include traditional insurance policies, hybrid insurance policies, or self - insurance (as long as you have money).
Carefully prepare legal documents: this will allow you to avoid legal difficulties.
Prepare your representative’s confidence that you will control your medical care and monitor your needs if you are not able to do so personally.
In addition, we are encouraged to develop trust in money management.
Choose a trusted person who will make a financial decision for you and pay bills if you are incapacitated.
Do not forget the details. Imagine that one of your elderly parents needs immediate medical attention, so he is taken to the hospital.
Can you answer the questions about medicines and allergies?
Write down such information to make sure that you are ready.
"It's not just about money.
which medicines can be taken and
Who looks after the dog.

Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people lost their lives as a result of a massive earthquake and tsunami in the Indonesian city of Paul on Friday, reports representatives of government authorities, but the number of victims may increase.
With the exit of the means of contact of officials dealing with humanitarian aid, no information can be obtained from the Dongal Regiment, a region north of Paul, located near the earthquake site of 7.5 balsam.
After a natural disaster, 16,000 people were evacuated from Paul.
Let us consider a few key facts about the location of the island of Slavesi, the city of Palu and the Regiment of Dongal.
Palu is the capital of the province of Central Sulavesi, located at the end of the narrow riverbed on the western coast of the island of Sulavesi, with an average population of 379,800, according to the 2017 data.
When the earthquake struck, the city celebrated its 40th anniversary.
Dongala is a giant that stretches more than 300 km (180 miles) along the coastal line on the northwestern part of the island of Slavès.
According to the 2017 census, about 299,200 people live in the administrative area of the lower part of the province.
Fishing and agriculture are the main economic dividends of Central Sulaves Province, especially in the coastal region of Dongal.
Nickel is also important in the province, but mainly centered in Moroval, on the opposite coast of Sulaves.
According to the Indonesian agency's data on the effects of natural disasters over the past 100 years, Paul and Dongal have suffered from tsunamis several times.
In 1938 more than 200 men were killed as a result of tsunamis in Donegal and hundreds of homes were destroyed.
In 1996, tsunamis also covered the western part of Donegal, then killed nine men.
Indonesia is located in an active Pacific volcano and regularly suffers from earthquakes.
The following are some of the largest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years.
On December 26, 2004 a massive earthquake in the western coast of the Indonesian province of Acheg, located in northern Sumatra, struck 14 countries, resulting in the death of 226,000 people, more than half of whom in the province of Acheg.
2005: At the end of March, a series of major earthquakes erupted on the west coast of Sumatra.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias near the coast of Sumatra.
2006: The earthquake struck southern Java, the most densely populated island of Indonesia, and caused tsunamis on the southern coast, resulting in the death of some 700 people.
2009: Near the city of Padang, the capital of the province of Western Sumatra, was hit by 7.6 ballasts.
More than 1100 men have died.
2010: The earthquake struck one of the Mantawa islands near Sumatra, and caused tsunamis to rise to ten feet [10 m], resulting in the destruction of tens of thousands of villages and the death toll of about 300 men.
2016: A weak earthquake hit the landscape of Pedigeya in the province of Acheg, causing destruction and panic, linked to the fact that people have not yet been able to forget the destructive earthquake and tsunami in 2004.
This time there were no tsunamis, but more than 100 people died under the walls of the building.
2018: powerful earthquakes occurred on the tourist island of Limbok in Indonesia, resulting in the death of more than 500 people, mainly in the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed many homes, and thousands of tourists could not immediately leave the islands.

In Indonesia, earthquakes caused tsunamis: hundreds of deaths
At least 384 people were killed after an earthquake on the Indonesian island of Sulavesi on Friday.
The earth’s magnetic field is 7.5 degrees Fahrenheit [- 7.5 ° C] and has destroyed hundreds of homes.
Networks of connection and power supply have gone out of fear, and the number of victims can rise in the next few days.
The earthquake took place near the center of the island of Sulavesi, located in the northeastern part of the capital of Indonesia, Jakarta.
The video that is being spread on social networks shows the moment when you hit a character.
Hundreds of people gathered at a festival on the beach of Paul’s city when the tsunami broke out on the coast.
Federal prosecutors require a rare death penalty for suspects in New York
In New York, federal prosecutors demand the death penalty of Saifulo Saipov, who was suspected in New York, as a result of the death of eight persons — a rare punishment that has not been applied in the state for federal crimes since 1953.
It is said that in October 30-year-old Siepov followed the karmo rented at Home Depot Picapa went on a bicycle route along the coast of West Side, the Netherlands Mangetten, and began to beat up the passengers and passengers who had hit him on the way.
According to a report on the intention of helping to lose a death sentence in the South State of New York to justify the death penalty, the prosecutors must prove that the Siepov "has killed eight people "in fact" and "in fact" has caused serious physical damage.
According to judicial material, each of these charges foresees the possibility of a death penalty.
A few weeks after the attack, the Federal Court of Auditors filed a 22-point charge against Saipa, including eight charges of murder, which usually involve federal prosecutors in cases related to organized crime, as well as charges of violence and car destruction.
According to the prosecutors who described the Cyopa as a "dangerous, cruel and violent crime", this attack was the result of "rejective planning and slow thinking".
The victims, whom Saifula Habibullahević had suffered, injured or killed, became Diego Henrike Angelini, Nicolas Cleves, Ann Laura Dekadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlech, Ernan Ferruchi, Erna Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnukko, as described in the report on the purpose.
Five lost were tourists from Argentina.
Ten years have passed since those times, as in the South New York area last time the criminal case was brought to justice for the death penalty.
Judge Halida Barnes was convicted of killing two drug suppliers, and finally sentenced to eternal imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was brought to effect in New York in 1953, the couple Julius and Ethel Rosenberg lost after they were sentenced to a trial for spying for the benefit of the Soviet Union during the cold war two years before.
Both Rosenbergs were lost on a power plant on June 19, 1953.
According to the caselaws of Siipov, the birth of Uzbekistan, did not demonstrate the consequences of conscience during the following days and months after the attack.
According to the police, he told his followers that he was not harming himself.
According to the prosecutor’s office, Siepov reported that he had been inspired by the video IDIL that he had been watching on his phone.
The police report that he also requested IDIL to be promoted in his hospital room.
He refused to confess himself to the charges for 22 points.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Cyprus, said they were "very disappointed" by the decision of the prosecutor.
"We believe that the decision to get a death penalty instead of to accept the confession of forgiveness and to condemn eternal imprisonment without the possibility of release will only send the result of these events to the psychological trauma of all the victims," said Patton.
The side of the security of Cyprus earlier also asked the prosecutors not to seek a death penalty.
Parliamentary Member of the Conservative Party considers that the NIDJEL FARADJA should be appointed responsible for the Brexit negotiations
Today, during a protest campaign on the east of the Conservative Party, Nigel Farage promised "moving the national army."
The late leader of the United Kingdom Party of Independence said that politicians should "feel pressure" on themselves" by Eurosceptics because one of the MEPs proposed their candidate for negotiations with the EU.
A member of the Conservative Party, Peter Bown, said on his way to Birmingham that the United Kingdom "would already come" if Mr. Faraj was Secretary Brexit.
Taking into account the problems that May had faced by trying to calm his deeply rooted lines, it was even more likely that the Conservative Party's supporters, who were opposed to the exit, joined in a special protest campaign in the city against Brexit.
The prime minister is trying to influence the compromise plan of the Chequers, despite attacks by Brexit's supporters, those who oppose the exit, and the EU.
The allies insist that she won't let her try to talk to Brussels, despite the negative reaction, and force the Euroscopists and lesbians to choose between what she proposes and "haus".
Mr. Bown said he wanted to "talk with the Chechers" in the midst of the Leave Means Leave in Solihali.
He suggested that Mr. Farage go out of the darkness and take responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had answered for it, we would have gone out already," he said.
Parliamentary Member Wellingboro added, "I'll support Brexit, but we should reject Chechers."
Speaking against the EU, he said: "We fought in the world wars not to be organized.
We want to adopt our own laws in our own country."
Mr. Bown rejected the assumption that after the 2016 vote, the public opinion changed: "The idea that the British have changed their mind and they don't want to go out is absolutely not true."
A member of the Conservative Party and Vice-President Brexit Andrea Jenkins, who was also on the march, said to the reporters: "I'm just saying, "Minister, listen to people.
The Chequers plan is not popular among the general population, the opposition is not going to vote for it, it does not support our party and our activities that actually go along the streets and fight for the vote of the voters.
Please turn off the checks and start listening."
In her address to Teresa May, she added, "The Prime Minister keeps his job when he makes promises."
Mr. Faraj said that politicians should "feel pressure on themselves" if they are going to reject the decision taken at the 2016 referendum.
"That's why it's a question of trust between us, people and our political elite," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit, and we're here today to tell them it won't work."
In a report to the whole Enthusiast, he added: "I want our political elite, which is planning to betray Brexit's idea, feel pressure on itself.
We mobilize the national army of this country, which will lead us to victory in Brexit and will never rest until we become independent, sovereign, proud United Kingdom."
At that time, opposition to the exit went to Birmingham and then to the city center for a two - hour meeting.
A number of activists broke up with "Conservatives against Brexit" banners after the group started these exits.
Lebossian Lord Adonis laughed at the conservators because after the opening of the conference their party program caused security problems.
"These people who tell us they can use IT systems and technologies that are necessary for Canada-plus, well-organised border, free trade with Ireland," he commented.
"It's a full face.
There is nothing good in Brexit," he added.
Warren's planning to "seriously think" about the vote on the president's post
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said that after the November elections she "was seriously thinking about the presidential election".
The Boston Globe reports that on Saturday during the general meetings of the West Massachusetts, a representative of the Democratic Party from Massachusetts spoke about his future.
Warren, who is often criticised by President Donald Trampa, is on the second floor in November against a member of the Republican party, Jeff Dila, who was the leader of the trampa campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
It itself is considered the main candidate that can fight Trampo in 2020.
On Saturday, her 36th meeting was held with the voters in the form of general meetings from the time that Trump entered his office.
The audience asked her if she was planning to participate in the presidential election.
Warren replied that "It's time for women to go out to Washington and adjust to the government's work, and that's why she's got to be a woman."
They arrested a suspect in the murder of the LSU Tigers Baseballist Sams.
The Baton Rouge police, Louisiana State, reported on Saturday that they had been arrested on Friday for murder by LSU Tigers Wyd Sims.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dayton Simpson at a press conference at 11 o'clock in the morning.
On Friday they published videotapes with a request to help identify a person on it.
Twenty-year-old Sims was shot at the University of Southern campus on Friday morning.
"Weid Sims got a fire wound in his head and died on Saturday," said 247sports chief of police, Murphy J. Paul.
Wade joined his friend, and Simpson shot him.
As a result of the investigation, Simpson was found to be in the scene of a crime with his own gun and shot at Wade Sims.
The Simpsons were arrested without incidents and taken to the East Baton police station.
Sims, who grew up 6 feet and 6 inches and who was born in a junior league, grew up in Baton Rouge. He played in 32 games with 10 stars in the last season and played in the middle of the game for 17.4 minutes, collected 5.6 glasses and 2.9 collections.
Gran-pre-Russia: Luis Hemilton quickly withdrew from the battle for World Championship after the team decided to give him a victory over Sebastian Fatetel
From the time Walter Botts left behind Luis Hemilton on Saturday, it became clear that the Mersedez team's decisions would play a significant role in the race.
Bottas had been in the middle of the afternoon and nearly had gone to Hemilton, who tried to hold his position on the first two turns and gave Fettel an opportunity to attack his teammate.
Fettel went to the first five-foot and left Gemilton on his way to the edge of the race, which had to be resolved.
The captain of the command of Mersedez went around and left behind the Fatetel, but he was led by a certain manoeuvre, which resulted in Ferrari’s unwillingness to leave the inner space because of the risk that he was under pressure after his second manoeuvre was able to move forward on the third turn.
On his 21st day of birth, Max Ferstappen began from the back row of the network and remained in the seventh place until the end of the first circle.
Then he led most of the race because he didn’t change his tires so that he could get to the finish immediately and contain Kimi Reikkonen from the fourth place.
In summary, he stopped at five-foot on the 44th cycle, but he couldn't increase his speed on the last eight, so he took the fourth place.
"It's a hard day, because Walter was exposed to all the exits and showed pride when he gave me the opportunity to go.
The command has done an extraordinary job for the first and second places," said Hamilton.
The Body’s Tongue Was Not Immortal
On Wednesday, President Donald Tramp expressed his firm position in that he did not declare the content of the Christine Blaise Ford, which charges the candidate to Supreme Court of Bretta Cavano in sexual violence.
During a meeting in the West Virginia, the President did not direct his attention to the evidence presented by the Forum before the Legal Committee of the Senate, but rather expressed his opinion on the events in Senate, which, he said, demonstrated human "difficulty, incompetence and fraud".
"The only thing that could happen, and all the wonderful things that happen in the last few days in the Senate, are anger, you see the wicked people who are displaying hypocrisy, hypocrisy and falsehood," he said.
"You look at the publication and published information, and then they say, "Oh, I didn't.
It's not me."
Do You Recall?
Diane Fynstein, did you publish information?
Remember her answer... you announced the contents of the documents?
Oh, no.
I did not vote."
Wait a minute.
No, we didn't.," he added, copying the senator's behavior.
In July, Finstein received a letter with a report of the charges against Cavanaugh's Ford, and its contents were voted in early September, but Finstein denied that the effect of the information had been in her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's charge, I didn't disclose the information received from her," said the Finnish committee, reports The Hill.
"She asked me to keep it secret, and I didn't break my promises."
But her opposition seems to have not liked the president who commented during the Saturday meeting: "I tell you, her body was not impressed at all.
Maybe she didn't do it, but I haven't seen anyone else get worse."
Continuing to protect a candidate to the Supreme Court, where three women were accused of sexual violence, the president admitted that Democrats were using accusations for their own purposes.
"They are determined to return power in any necessary way.
You see humility, compassion, they all know who to represent, by whom to go through to gain power and control," says the President.
Elite League: "Dandy Stars" - "Belfast Giants", 5:3
The actor "Jeants" Patrick Duyer left two teams in the match against "Dandy"
"Dandy Stares" re-emerged for a Friday break in an annual bed by Belfast Janets, winning on Saturday's match with account 5:3.
Janets got an early victory in two shifts through Patrick Duyer's and Francis Bowley's escape.
Mike Sallivan and Jordan Counny compared the account to the domestic match, and then Duyer re-issued the "Jianants" ahead.
The "Dandy" player, France Busher, weighed two pounds of Lucas Lundvald Nilsen, gave them a victory.
This is the third in the season of the annual league of the defeat of the command of Adam Kif, who received the free victory over "Dandy" with account 2:1 at Friday night in Belfast.
This is the fourth session of the team in the season. Three previous matches were won by the command "Jeanants".

Aeronautics died so that hundreds of people on the plane could escape an earthquake
Aeronautics in Indonesia have been voted by a hero after he has helped hundreds of people to fly at their own cost.
More than 800 people died, and many lost their lives after a violent earthquake that caused tsunamis on the island of Slavonic on Friday.
Powerful underground mailmen continue to raid this area, and many people are trapped in the ruins of Paul’s city.
However, unlike his colleagues who had fled to save their lives, 21-year-old Antonius Gunavan Agung refused to leave his post in the diaspora prison, which was deeply enjoying at Muteara SIS Al-Jufrie Airport in Pala.
He stayed there to make sure that the 6321 Batik Air flight race, which was at the time on a flight trip, was safely lifted up into the air.
Then he pulled out of the dyspettic vein when he thought she was going to die.
Later he died in the hospital.
The representative of the Indonesian Air Navigation Service supplier Johanne Sirit said that this decision could save hundreds of lives, reports the Australian agency ABC News.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikapan in Calimantan to deliver it to a hospital in another town.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Paul.
"We are very sorry to hear about this," he added.
At the same time, the government is afraid that the number of victims may reach a thousand, as the agency has declared that access to the city of Dongal, Sigi and Butong are limited.
"The number of victims can grow, as many bodies are still under bars, and many of them cannot be reached," said the representative of the agency Sutopo Purvo Nugroho.
The heights of up to six feet [6 m] were reduced to the city of Paul, where mass burials would take place on Sunday.
Military and passenger planes provide assistance and food.
Rissa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute of help will bring the body.
Clean water is not enough.
Mini marquettes are everywhere buried."
The head of the International Committee of the Red Cross in Indonesia, Jan Helfand told CNN: "The Red Cross of Indonesia is quick to help people who have suffered this tragedy, but we don't know what they'll find there.
It's already tragedy, but it can get much worse."
The Indonesian President, Joe Vidodo, came to Paul on Sunday and turned to the country's military officers: "I ask all of you to work day and night to carry out all the evacuation-related tasks.
Are you ready?" CNN reports.
At the beginning of this year, Indonesia suffered earthquakes on the island of Lombok, resulting in more than 550 deaths.
A plane crash in Micronesia: as reported in Air Niugini, after a plane crash in a truck one man lost consciousness
The airline, which carried out a raid on the Pacific lagoon in Micronesia, now claims that one person has disappeared, although it was previously reported that all 47 passengers and crew had been successfully evacuated from the plane that had been stolen.
In Air Niugini, it was said that on a Saturday day, one passenger could not be found.
The airline reports that its representatives are trying to find a man and cooperate with local authorities, doctors, and investigators.
The airline did not respond immediately to a request for more information on passengers, such as their age and nationality.
The local ships helped save other passengers and crew after the plane landed on the water when trying to land on the island of Cuzuk.
On Friday, officials reported that seven men had been brought to the hospital.
The airline reported that six passengers stayed in the hospital on Saturday, and they all stayed in a stable state.
The cause of disaster and the exact sequence of events is unknown.
The airline and the U.S.A. said that the plane landed in the cabin shortly after the flight.
Some of the witnesses believe that the plane has flew into the mid-year term.
American passenger Bill Janes said that the plane was very low on the ground.
"That's very good," said Janes.
Janes told him and others that he and others had been able to travel to the emergency exits on a ton of cold air being on the water.
He told me that the steroids were panicking and screaming and that he had a slight headache.
The U.S.A. reported that mariners who worked near modernizing the story also helped in rescue operations by delivering people on the shore by means of an overcrowded boat before the plane sank 30 feet [30 m] deep (100 feet) of water.
According to the Aviation Safety Network data in the last two decades, 111 people have died in plane accidents related to PNG aviation, but Air Niugini is not included in this list.
Analyticals Relived the Chronology of the Night in which a woman was burned alive
On Saturday, the prosecutor’s office interrupted the case against a man who was charged with burning a woman from Mississippi who died in 2014.
Paul Roulett, an analyst at the U.S. Ministry of Justice, testified as an expert in the field of operational development for several hours.
He told the jury how he used cell phone records to play the 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night of the murder.
The Rollet, reports The Clarion Ledger, reported that he had received information about his location from several mobile phones that showed that Telis was from Chambers the night she died, which was contrary to his previous claim.
When it was shown that his cell phone was next to Chambers, even though he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to the last one.
On Saturday, Sanford gave a witness and claimed that he was not in town that day.
When the prosecutors asked if Telis was telling the truth, when he said that that night was in the Sanford Bay, Sanford said that he was "false because my Bishop was in Neshville."
Another misunderstanding was that Tellis claimed that Chambers knew about two weeks before her death.
The phone records indicated that they knew only one week.
The Rollet reported that some time after the death of Chambers Tellis, he delivered a text message, calls, and contact information to Chambers on his phone.
"He's got her out of his life," said Gael.
The protection should include its final arguments in the week.
The judge expects the trial to be handed over by the jury later that same day.
The High Breed: What is the famous hip-hop?
Three hip-hop performers want to challenge a negative view of the genre by filling their music with constructive messages.
The High Breed Group from Bristol says that hip-hop has changed its nature – political ideas and struggles to solve social problems.
They want to go back to the streams and make the famous hip-hop popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Commons have recently witnessed its birth directly in the United Kingdom through such groups as Akala and Lowkey.
Another dark one?
In New York, Ninja called a couple for release, receiving a "ristoic" message.
In New York, Ninja called for a couple of discriminatory liberations after she received an incorrect address from her mother with a complaint that she was "one darker".
The couple argue they're growing up, comparing their calls to "floating."
Linsi Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, expressed concern when she saw that the new nurse, Giselle Morris, who came to her first working day in 2016, was dark.
"No, there's another theme," Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a report.
Instead of sending him to her husband, however, she twice sent his mission to Morris.
As New York Post reports, aware of his mistake, Mrs. Plaxon-Flaxman felt "unhandled" and released Mrs. Morris, who said that their previous nephew, who was an African, had been doing his job badly and that he was expecting her from the Philippines.
Miss Morris paid one day a job and then sent her home to Uber.
Now Morris is in court, hoping to get a retirement pension in the amount of pay she would receive in six months of working with a couple whom she was first hired, even if she had no contract, and she was to pay $350 a day.
"I want to show them that they don't have to do this," she said on Friday and added, "I know it's discrimination."
In response to the charge that they were racist, the couple stated that the release of Morris was a wise decision because they feared that they would not be able to trust her after their training.
"My wife didn't mean what she sent her.
She's not a racist.
We don’t grow up, ” her husband, Joel Plasco, told Post.
"But would you leave your children with a man who was pregnant, even if it wasn't insane?
Your little boy?
It's not true."
Comparing the call to "floating," Plasco said that his wife had just born a child two months ago and "not yet."
"Would you kiss someone after that?
It's a bad thing," added the investment banker.
Although the court’s judgment is still valid, the court of public opinion has quickly condemned this couple on social networks by condemning their conduct and logic.
As told in a new letter, the publishers of Paddington feared that readers would not understand the idea of a doctor who could speak.
The daughter of Bonda Karen Jankel, who was born almost immediately after the book was agreed to be printed, said about the letter: "It's hard to put herself in the place of someone who reads the book first, before it was published.
Now it's funny because we know about the great success that the story of Paddington has achieved."
When she told her father, who was working as a BBC operator, before the little playmate inspired her to write a child book, she was optimistic about leaving her job, and she shared how on the 60th anniversary of the book's release she felt "good and sad" at the same time as her father died the year before.
About Padington, whom she describes as "a very important member of our family," Karen added that her father quietly wrote that the book became so popular.
"He was quite modest and didn't like to hang out," she said.
"But Paddington was so real to him, even though his own child! Because when the children reach something, we write it to them, although it's not theirs, but our victory.
I think he looked at Paddington's success the same way.
Although Padington is the creation of his image, he has always described his success."
My daughter died, and I had to make a phone call.
After her daughter was buried, she was transferred to a two - room hospital named Louis Pasteur in Nice, where doctors tried to save her life.
"I was on the phone regularly, saying that everything was really bad that she shouldn't have done this," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperuz.
"And then Nad phoned me and said she was gonna die for the next two minutes and I should apologize to her.
And I did.
I said, "Dad, love, I love you very much.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you."
Doctors who gave her heart to continue fighting gradually stopped acting and left the body.
She died some time before everything was turned off.
I just had to sit down and wait, knowing what's going on right now.
I couldn't complain, cry or cry because my family and people surrounded me.
I should really have kept myself in my hands."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperus, who was burning because of the loss of her daughter, flew on the plane with other passengers, not paying attention to the severe trials she had to endure.
"No one knew," she said.
"I lost my head and couldn't hold the rope.
It was hard to explain, but during my flight, I began to feel very sorry for Nadu.
He needed my love and support.
I knew how much he loved her."
Two women who were caught in a mountain are left with leaves to avoid suicide on the bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones through suicide are working to prevent others from laying their hands on themselves.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphres are left on the Wally Bridge with telephone numbers that people can call for support and messages that they would like to receive.
Miss Davis Tyler’s son was 13, when he suffered from depression, and at the age of 18, he laid his hands on him.
"I don't want other parents to feel the same way I do every day," she said.
45-year-old Mrs. Davis, who lives in the West, said her son was a prospective chef with a funny smile.
"Everyone knew him for a joke.
They always said that this smile made any room brighter."
But he quit his job before he died because he was still in darkness.
In 2014, Brother Tyler, who was then 11, found his brother’s body after laying his hands on him.
Miss Davis says, "I'm always afraid it'll work."
Miss Davis created letters, 'to make people know that there are those they can talk to and talk to, even if it's just a friend.
Don't lock yourself up, you need to talk."
Miss Gamfris, who has been married to Miss Davis for many years, lost her husband, Mark, who was 15 years old, shortly after his mother’s death.
"He didn't say he felt depressed that he had depression or something," she said.
"In a few days before Christmas we noticed that he had changed."
But on the day of Pentecost he was grieved with the spirit; and when the children were put out, he didn't see them at all.
She told me that his death had become a major trauma for them, but they should survive it: "It has been devastating.
A family line.
But we must continue to live and fight."

The future Bretta Cavano is on the horizon: The FBI is starting to investigate
"I thought that if we could get what we asked for, limited in time and the nature of the investigation, we might have reached some agreement, Mr. Flick said on Saturday, and he was afraid that the committee "extended" on the basis of the sudden loss of the loyalty of the political party.
Why did Mr. Cavano and his representatives not want the FBI to investigate?
They don't want time.
The inter-elections will take place in five weeks, November 6th. If the Republicans are expected to have problems, this will seriously complicate their efforts to make their own person through the elections in the Supreme Court of the country.
George V. Bush telephoned the senators with a request to support Mr. Cavano, who worked in the White House under Mr. Bush’s authority and met his wife, Ashley, who worked as a personal secretary for Mr. Bush.
What happens after the FBI prepares its report?
In Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are now sitting, there will be a vote.
It still did not understand whether Mr. Cavano could get at least 50 votes to the Senate to allow senior President Mike Pens to deal with the same number of votes and to vote in favour of his candidate as Judge of the Supreme Court.
During Kima's rule, the number of refugees from North Korea "has been cut off"
After Kim Chen Inn came to power seven years ago, the number of refugees from North Korea to South Korea was reduced by a South Korean legislator.
Again, Pion Seug, referring to the data of the Ministry of Association of the Republic of South Korea, stated that in the past year the number of refugees had grown 1127 compared to 2706 in 2011.
Mr. Pack said that key factors were the strengthening of coordinating control between North Korea and China, as well as the fact that smugglers now demand more money.
In the Philippines, public comments were received.
The vast majority of North Korean migrants finally propose South Korea's citizenship.
In Seoul, more than 30,000 North Koreans were declared illegal after the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most of them run through China, which has the longest border with North Korea, which is easier to overcome than a well-protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between two Koreas.
China views refugees as illegal migrants, not refugees, and often forced them to return.
The relations between North and South Korea, which are still in the state of war, have improved significantly over the past few months.
At the beginning of this month, the leaders of two countries met in Phoenicia and discussed the issues of denuclearization, which were discussed at the summit.
This happened after the United States historic meeting of President Donald Trampa and Kim Chen Ina in Singapore, where they in general agreed to cooperate on the nuclear disarmament of the Korean peninsula.
However, on Saturday, North Korea's North Korean Minister Yon-Ho on the basis of the sanctions received, he accused the United States of not making progress on these occasions.
"With no confidence in the United States, we cannot be sure of our country's security, so there can be no talk about unilateral disarmament under these circumstances," said Ray Yon-Ho in his speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosie calls Bretta Cavano "historic" and says he's not going to work in the Supreme Court.
The leader of the minority in the House of Representatives of Nancy Pelosi called a candidate under the position of Judge of Supreme Court Bret Cavano "historic" and said that he was not going to work in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi expressed his thoughts in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I've always been thinking that if a woman ever spoke this way, she would be called "asterical," Pelosi commented on her reaction to the Cavano witness before the Senate Legal Committee on Thursday.
Cavano was emotionally opposed to the charge of sexual violence against Dr. Christine Blaise Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening speech, Cavano was very emotional, sometimes screaming and screaming, talking to his family and school years.
He also publicly condemned democracies in the committee, calling it "a absurd and coordinated violation of the reputation", organized by liberals, who criticized Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential elections.
According to Pélosi, the Cavanos ’ testimony showed that he could not work in the Supreme Court because this showed his prejudice toward democracy.
"I think these statements, as well as his statement against Clinton and the Democrats, will lead to his candidacy," she said.
When she was asked if she was trying to announce the Roman Empire if her wine was to be confirmed and if most of the House of Representatives was to receive democracy.
"I'll say so: if he doesn't tell Congress or the FBI the truth, he won't only work in the Supreme Court, but also in the court where he's working right now," said Pelosy.
Cavano now serves as a court of appeal in the United States District of Colombia.
Pelosi added that as a democracy she was concerned with possible solutions to Cavano against the law "For access to medical care" or "Roo v. Weida" cases because they consider him a conservative judge.
In his hearings on the question of the Canary Islands, he asked whether he was making any decisions of the Supreme Court.
"It's not the time when the judge becomes an honest, preposterous person and we'll tell you how wonderful it is," said Pelosie.
Women are to take control of this weapon.
These are just words that have been contained in months and years of anguish, and she could not speak them without tears.
"We cry when we're in pain," said Mrs. Stein to me 45 years ago.
"I don't think it's something unusual, do you?"
She continued: "A woman who worked as an executive director and who was very helpful to me said that she was also crying when she was wrong, but she had her own method. When she went wrong and began to cry, she said to her co-rapporteur: "You can think that I am sad and because of that.
And I am evil."
And then she just continued.
I thought it was incredible."
The tears are considered to be a allowable release of anger partly because they receive them differently.
One of my clearest memories of my first job in the office where most men worked came from when I once wept out of unquenchable anger, and the older woman — the unkind manager I always feared — grabbed me from the room and pulled me to the back cell.
"Never let them see how you cry," she said to me.
"They don't know you're a heart.
They'll think you're sad, and they'll be glad they got to you."
Schreder’s patriarch, a former congressman from the Democratic Republic of Colorado, worked with Harry Garth at presidential elections.
In 1987, when Mr. Garta was married to a ship named Monkey Business, after he left the race, a deeply disappointed Miss Shreder decided that there were no reasons why she could not vote for the president.
"It was not a very thought - out decision," she said with a smile 30 years ago.
"Seven other candidates were already in the race, and another candidate was the last one they needed."
Someone called the situation "Blonds and Seven Gnoms".
Since it was at the end of the company, she left the company with money, so she promised not to take part in the race if she didn't get $2 million.
It was a hopeless struggle.
She found that some of her neighbors, who had not been harmed by the support of men of $1,000, gave her only $250.
"They think I'm going to get down?" she wondered.
When she spoke with her voice and announced that she would not hold an official campaign, she was overwhelmed by the emotions — the people who supported her, the disappointment of the system that had greatly complicated the collection of money and forced her to focus not on voters, such as members of parliamentarians, but also on sexism.
"You would think I had a nervous breakdown," said Ms. Schreder's reaction to the press.
You'd think Kleenex is my corporate sponsor.
So I was still thinking about what they're writing on my grave plate?
"She cried?"
How a trade war between the United States and China can lead to Beijing’s superiority
Experts believe that the first steps in the U.S. and China’s trade war were disappointing, and, although far to its completion, long - term prospects may lead to the benefits of Beijing.
U.S. President Donald Trump made the first warning shots at the beginning of this year, covering the main Chinese export goods, including solar batteries, steel and aluminium.
The biggest situation this week was increased by a new price on goods of $200 billion (150 billion), which actually accounts for half of all goods coming from China.
Beijing paid the same coin once and for all, not long ago, by placing a coin in the size of five to ten percent on American goods of $60 billion.
China has been committed to using similar measures in the United States, and the second largest in the world of economics will either lose the opportunity to live up to this promise at the earliest opportunity.
To force Washington to give up means to agree with the demands, but for President China, the public worship of the U.S.
However, as experts believe, if Beijing is using the situation properly, the pressure in the US trade war can lead China to a long-term advantage by reducing the link between the two economies.
"The rapid political decision in Washington or Beijing can create conditions that will lead to a severe economic downturn in any country, and this will actually pose a greater threat than observers have recognized before," said analyst Abigail Grace, who is involved in Asia-related issues at the analytical center Center for New American Security.
The Minister of Orders said Syria was "ready" to return refugees
In Syria they claim to be willing to return refugees and return to their homeland with the help of a war - torn country that lasted for more than seven years.
Speaking in front of the General Assembly of the United Nations, Minister of Coordinating Affairs Valid al-Mulalem stated that conditions in the country would improve.
"Today's real situation has become more stable and safer because of the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate the affected terrorists of the region so that people can return to normal life.
All conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country where they were forced to leave because of terrorism are now created as well as the unilateral economic measures that have affected their daily lives and restrict their livelihoods.
According to UN estimates, more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Mulalem stated that the Syrian government would be pleased to accept assistance in restoring the war-damaged country.
But he stressed that they would not receive any help or help from countries that support the generation.
Europe is strengthening the victory of the "Cubque Rider" in Paris
The European Command launched the "Cuboc Ryder" in 2018 when it won the US team with a summary account at Le Golf National in Paris, France.
The U.S. command had already won six victories in Europe and had not won the 1993 Cup of Rider tournament.
Europe returned to its crown when Captain Thomas Bourne’s command took 14.5 chances they needed to win over the United States.
The American star Phil Miquellson, who tried most of the tournament, hit his first long shot on the 16th moon par-3 in the water and reached the French Molinary.
The Italian golfer Molinari won all his rounds and became one of the four players who had ever taken account of 5–0–0 since the start of the tournament in modern format in 1979.
American Jordan Smith won a five-pound account from a player with the lowest rating in the European Turbier Olesen team from Denmark.
Dustin Johnson, who takes the first match in the world rating, made an account 2:1 Jan Paulter from England, who may have participated in the "Cuboc Rider" final tournament.
Spanish Sergio Garcia, a veteran "Cubca Rider" who has already participated in the tournament eight times, has become a European who has won the most in the tournaments all the time, taking over his 25.5-hour career.
"I usually don't cry, but I can't do anything today.
It was a difficult year.
Thanks to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so happy, so happy to return the cube.
It's a team's job, and I'm glad it's been able to help," Garcia said, without restraining her emotions, after winning in Europe.
He gives the estafetto to his colleague, John Reme, who won the U.S. golfer Tiger Woods a single game with account 2:1 a week.
"I feel incredible pride over Tiger Woods, I grew up watching this guy," said 23-year-old Ram.
In France Woods lost all four matches and now has a career record on the "Cuboc Rider" tournament 13-21-3.
A great statistics for one of the most famous players of all time who won 14 Major tournaments, only Jack Niklaus.
The U.S. Assembly of Jehovah’s Witnesses has been trying to reach the Fervai area, except for Patrick Ride, Justin Thomas, and Tony Finau, who showed a high-class golf course throughout the entire tournament.
The U.S. Captain Jim Furrick said about his team after a rough statement: "I swear to these guys, they're fighting.
This morning we were soon on our way over Europe.
We fought.
I'll take the hats from Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We're regrouping, I'm going to work with the U.S. Professional Players Association and the Kubok Ryder Committee, and we're moving forward.
I love these 12 guys and I swear I'm their captain.
You can't thank them.
We lost."
