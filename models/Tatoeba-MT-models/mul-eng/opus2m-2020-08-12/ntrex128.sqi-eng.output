Wells Assembly members worried that "they look like fools"
Among the members of the Assembly there is a general concern about the proposal for a change in their title in the MWP (Vell Parliamentary Members).
This has come as a source of plans to change the name of the assembly in "Well's Parliament".
Members of the Assembly from all political spheres are concerned that this could lead to jokes.
A member of the Laburist Party's assembly said his group was worried "that this smells with Twp and Pwp."
For readers outside Wells: Anyway, twp means "bottle" and pwp means "cock".
A member of the Walls Party said the whole group was "unsatisfied" and proposed an alternative.
A Welsh conservator said his group was "meditated" about the change of name, but it was said there was no distinction between the words "MWP" and "Budalla".
In this context, the deviation of the word "w" in the wild is similar to that of the word "w" in the English of Yorkshire.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently drafting legislation on the publication of the change in the name, said: "The final decision on the appointment of members of the Assembly will certainly depend on the members themselves."
The Law of the Wells Government of 2017 gave the Welsh Assembly the flag to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a consultation with the public, and its latest proposal for the appointment of the assembly as "Well's Parliament" received broad support.
In connection with the issue of the title of Assembly Members, the Commission favoured the designation "Well Parliament Members" or "WMP", but the alternative "MWP" found more support in a consultation with the public.
It seems that the Assembly members are proposing alternative elections, but the struggle for reaching consensus can be turned into a shock for Creator Eli Jones, from which legislation on changes is expected within a few weeks.
The legislation on reform will include other changes related to the way the Assembly works, including rules for the exclusion of Assembly members and the structure of the committee system.
During the debate on legislation, the final vote on the issue of their appointment will remain for Assembly Members.
Macedonians vote in the referendum on the change in the country's name.
On Sunday, voters will vote for the change in their country's name to the "Republic of Northern Macedonia".
The vote by the people was put in an effort to resolve a multiannual dispute with neighboring Greece, which also has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long been standing for the name of its northern neighbours for a claim on its territory and has consistently opposed its demands for membership in the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, a referendum opponent for the change of name, has said he will not recognise the votes.
However, referendum supporters, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the change of name is simply the price to be paid for EU and NATO membership.
Saint Martin's bells are silent while the churches in Harlem face difficulties
"Historically, the older people I've talked to say he's had a bar from a church at every turn," Mr. Adams said.
"They're both missing."
He said that the disappearance of the colors is understandable.
"Today, people are socialized in other ways," he says.
"The bars are no longer the point of meeting the camp, where people go regularly."
As far as the churches are concerned, he is concerned that the money from the sale of property will not extend as long as the leaders claim "and sooner or later they will return to the starting point."
He added that the churches could be replaced by palaces full of people who would not support the holy lands that remained in the camps.
"Many of the people who buy environmental housing in these palaces are white," he said, "so very soon the day will come when these churches are closed in a good time, since it is the payment that most people who live in these houses will become members of these churches."
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem was converted into a color - colored metropolis in 1870, St. Martin.
The original white - minded congregation was transferred to the 1930 ’ s.
The building was purchased from a colorful congregation of people who had their place of worship there.
St. Martin passed a color congregation under Rev. John Howard Johnson, who led a small business boy on the "125th" road, a main market road in Harlem, which refused to hire or promote color merchants.
In 1939, the building was badly damaged by a fire, but after his famous Johnson reconstruction plans were made, they took care of it.
Rev. David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and heir of St. Martin, called him "the association of the poor."
An expert who played in the Korean career called it something else: "A cultural treasure" and "a historic non-replaceable instrument."
The expert Tiffany Ng from Michigan University also stated that this was the first career in the world played by a color musician, Dionysio A. Lind, who was transferred to a major career in the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said San Martin hadn't replaced him.
The events of the last months in St. Martin have been a complex retreat of contractor architects, some sent by church leaders and others from the Episcopal Diocese.
The council - the leading body of Famulism, composed of old leaders - wrote the diocese in July, concerned that it "will try to transfer costs" to the Famulism council, although the latter was not involved in the work of architects and contractors sent by diocese.
Some famulants were accused of lack of transparency by the diocese.
Fishing wounded 13-year-olds during a forced arrest in California
A fish has attacked and wounded a 13-year-old boy on Saturday while he's trying to catch gas in California, on the day of the opening of the golf season, officials say.
Sulmi was just before 7:00 a.m., near the beach of Beacon's in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel was told about KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been busting with some friends about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy crying for help, and then he drove to him together with a group to get him out of the water.
Hammel said that at first he had thought that the boy was just exaggerated by the head of some garage, but then I realized that he was screaming "I was dead!
He killed me!"
Hammel says when he got to his son, without his whole key was broken.
"It was all called out of the water: 'There's a fish in the water!' Hammel added.
The boy was transported by helicopter to the child's "Rady's" hospital in San Diego, where he was critically reported.
The species of fish responsible for the attack was unknown.
Captain of the coast guard Larry Giles spoke at a media conference that a fish was seen in the area a few weeks ago, but it was designated as a rare species of fish.
Giles added that the victim had suffered traumatic injuries in the upper part of the body.
Officials stopped access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablad until Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours, for research and security purposes.
Giles was said to have more than 135 species of fish in the area, but most of them are considered undesirable.
Saninsbury's plans to enter the MB Cosmetic Market
Saninsbury's is competing with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with cosmetics of the style of big markets, with a specialized sales post.
In the framework of a considerable effort to enter the US cosmetic market of 2.8 billion pounds, which continues to grow while sales of fashion and household clothing pay down, the largest cosmetics will be tested in 11 markets around the country and will expand into more markets next year if they succeed.
Cosmetic investment comes at a time when supermarkets are looking for ways to fill the gap between television, microwaves, and home - looking.
Saninsbury's is said to double his offer of cosmetic products to 3,000 products, including for the first time also such brands as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The existing lines from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will be given more space, with areas dedicated to adjacent brands, similar to those in the Boots market.
Also, the supermarket will re-market its cosmetic Boutique line in such a way that most of the products are made up of vegan ingredients - something that is increasingly required by older buyers.
In addition, the retail trader "Fragrance Shop" will test the concession in two Saninsbury markets, the first of which has been opened last week in Croydon, south of London, while a second is expected to open later this year in Sally Oak, Birmingham.
Online purchases and a trend towards daily food purchases in small quantities in the lake markets mean that supermarkets must now do more to attract people.
Mike Coupe, director of Saninsbury's executive, has said that outlets will start to be more and more like big markets, while the supermarket network is trying to fight Aldi and Lidl's price chains with more services and cheap products.
Saninsbury's set outlet "Argos" in hundreds of shops and presented a series of "Habits" that after the purchase of the two networks two years ago, which he believes has promoted food products sales and has made them more profitable.
The previous attempt by the supermarket to restructure its cosmetic and pharmaceutical departments resulted in failure.
Saninsbury's tested a partnership with Boots in the early 2000s, but the merger ended after a debate on how to divide income from pharmaceuticals into its supermarkets.
The new strategy comes three years after Saninsbury sold its pharmaceutical business from 281 Celesio markets, the pharmaceutical network owner "Loyds" for 125 million pounds.
He said "Loyds" would play a role in the plan, adding a wide range of luxury brands of leather care, including La Roche-Possay and Vichy in four shops.
Paul Mills-Hicks, director of Saninsbury's commercial director, said: "We have transformed the vision of our cosmetics into a better environment for our customers.
We have also invested in a specialized training staff, which will be ready to give advice.
The range of our brands is designed in such a way that they fit every need, and the environment of attraction and volunteer location shows that we are now a cosmetic destination to the left, which distinguishes from the old way of making purchases."
Peter Jones "gyndozed" after Holly Willoughby withdraws from the 11 million-dollar deal
The Dragons Den star, Peter Jones, has gone "jinded" after the television presenter Holly Willoughby has been attracted by an 11-million-dollar deal with his business dedicated to a certain lifestyle, focusing on her new contracts with "Marks and Spencer" and "ITV"
Willoughby doesn't have time for their brand of home halls and "Truly" accessories.
The business of these two was compared to the Goop brand of Gwyneth Paltrow.
The 37-year-old "This Morning" presentation directed Instagram to tell her departure.
Holly Willoughby has introduced the star of "Dragons Den", Peter Jones, after the recent withdrawal from their business of winning a dedicated life-style - to focus on her new promising contracts with "Marks & Spencer" and "ITV".
Sources say Jones was "ganged up" when the gold girl and television agreed during a Tuesday's tension meeting in his business sovereignty cell in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new agreements -- worth up to 1.5 million pounds -- meant that she had no more time to dedicate her brand of home and "Truly" accessories to them.
The business was compared to the Goop brand of Gwyneth Paltrow and was expected to double its estimated wealth at 11 million pounds.
While Willoughby, 37 years old, was directed by Instagram to release her flight from Truly, Jones flew out of Britain to one of his restrooms.
A source is stated: "Truly was inconceivable in the heads of Holly's priorities.
It would have been her future long to be associated for the next decade.
Its decision to withdraw all persons including absolutely disabled persons.
No one could believe what was happening on Thursday, she was so close to the opening.
In Marlow's offices there is a store full of bags that are ready to be sold."
Experts believe that the departure of the presenting "This Morning", which is among the most successful British stars, can cost millions of signatures, due to considerable investment in products starting from pockets and wheels up to doors and doors, and causing further delays in its opening.
And this can be the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, the mother of three children, and her partner Dan Baldwin, were close to Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby founded Truly with Capp in 2016, and Jones, 52 years old, joined as her director in March.
Couples spend vacations together, and Jones has 40 per cent of the shares in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby is expected to be Ambassador of the brand for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as the representative of the "I'm A Celebrity" of the TV.
Last night, a source near Jones was expressed "We don't want to comment on his business issues."
The harsh talk "We're still in love"
He made a joke about the criticisms he would receive from the media because of his comment, which some would call as "not worth a president", and because of the position associated with North Korea's leader.
Why is President Trump so much delivered?
Trump said, imitating the voice of the news reporters with a smile.
"I didn't give up anything."
He said Kim was interested in a second meeting, after their first meeting in Singapore in June he was greeted by Trump as a major step towards North Korea's nuclearization.
But the negotiations for censorship have been interrupted.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, Korea's major North Korea diplomat, New Yong Ho, was addressed to world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday, saying that the North does not see any "responsive reaction" by the US to the first steps taken by North Korea to nuclear power.
On the contrary, he says, the US is continuing sanctions aimed at keeping under pressure.
Trump kept a much more optimistic view of his mythic speech.
"The things are going better with North Korea," he said.
"We were going into war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have been killed.
Now we have a wonderful relationship."
He said his efforts to improve Kim's relationship have resulted in positive results - preventing missile testing, helping release obstacles, and returning home to the rest of the U.S. soldiers.
In his speech about Kim’s relationships, he defended his inconsistency.
"It's very easy to act as President, but instead of having 10,000 people out there who are trying to get into this crowded area, we'd have about 200 people standing there," Trump said, pointing towards the crowd in front of him.
Shoplifting and terror in Indonesia destroys an island, killing hundreds
After the earthquake in Lombok, for example, foreign disadvantaged organisations were told that their presence was not necessary.
Despite more than 10 per cent of the Lombok population's displacement, no national disaster has been reported, which is a prerequisite for the catalyticization of international aid.
"Unfortunately, they have made it very clear in many cases that they do not seek international support, so the issue is a little challenging," said Mrs. Sumbong.
While "Save the Child" is building a team to travel to Paul, it is still not sure if a foreign staff can work on the ground.
Mr. Sutopo, the publisher of the national disaster agency, said Indonesian officials were evaluating the situation in Palu to see if international agencies would be allowed to contribute to assistance efforts.
Taking into account the frequent landscapes of Indonesia, the country remains unprepared for the anger of nature.
While buildings have been built in Aceh, they are hard to find in other coastal areas.
The apparent lack of a siren for warning of the tsunami in Paul, despite having been released, may have contributed to the loss of life.
Even in the best of circumstances, travel between many Indonesian islands is difficult.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complex.
A hospital ship that was stationed in Lombok for the treatment of the victims of the earthquake is traveling to Paul, but it will take at least three days to reach the new disaster zone.
President Joko Widodo has used the improvement of Indonesia's short infrastructure as the central point of his electoral campaign, and has invested many sources of money for roads and roads.
But lack of funding has worried Mr. Joko's administration, while he is facing new elections that will develop next year.
Mr. Joko is also facing pressure from continuing sectoral tensions in Indonesia, where Muslim community members have embraced a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people have been killed, and tens of thousands have been displaced from their homes after the slaughter of Christian and Muslim groups on the streets, where they have been used as ammunition, rifles, and other cold weapons.
See: Daniel Sturridge of Liverpool points out in the last few minutes a parallel bullet against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge has saved Liverpool from a loss in Premier League against Chelsea, with a bullet at the 89th minute of the seventh day in Stamford Bridge, London.
Sturridge took a walk from Jordan Shaqiri at about 30 yards away from Chelsea's port, while his team was missing with the result 1-0.
He put the ball on his left before he hit the other side of the door.
Topi flew over the area until he jumped right and above the network.
Topi saved the dance in Cape Arrizabalaga air and ended up on the network.
"The sign was to be placed in the right position as well as to get the top and players like Shaq always play with the top front, so I tried to create myself as long as possible," Sturridge said for LiverpoolFC.com.
"Seeing Kante coming, I checked the ball with a touch and didn't think for a long time but just hit."
Chelsea was headed by the 1-0 result in the first part, after a hole in the 25th minute from Belgian Star Eden Hazard.
The blue ruler made a revision to Matthew Kovac during that game, before he circled around the field and headed with a sprint toward the middle of Liverpool.
Kovacic made a quick combination in the middle.
Then he gave me a beautiful vertical stick that Hazard pulled out of the area.
Hazard passed the speed shield and, with a hit on the left, pointed to the second stick, passing the top behind Liverpool's Porter's arms, Alison Becker.
Liverpool will meet with Naples at the season of the Campion Law groups on Wednesday at 3 p.m. at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will meet with Videoton at the UEFA European Law Thursday at 3 p.m. in London.
The number of deaths from the tsunami in Indonesia goes to 832
The number of deaths from earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has increased in 832, the national disaster agency has been declared on Sunday’s first hour.
According to reports, many people have been blocked under the roofs of buildings such as the 7.5 walls struck on Friday and caused a wave up to 20 feet high, says the publisher of Sutopo Purwo at a press conference.
The city of Paul, with a population of more than 380,000 inhabitants, is believed under the ruins of exemplary buildings.
The police arrest a 32-year-old man suspected of murder after a woman gets her death from the wounds
A murder investigation was sent after his wife's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside, this morning.
The 44-year-old was found at 7:55 A.M. in Grayson Mews in John Street, while a 32-year-old man was arrested as suspect of murder.
The police have called on the residents of the area who have seen or heard anything presented for witness.
Detective Brian O'Hagan said: "The search is in the early stages, but I would like to call anyone who has been near John Street in Birkenhead, who may have seen or heard something suspicious, to contact us.
I would also like to call on everyone, especially taxi drivers who may have caught film views, to contact us after they can have essential information for our investigation."
A police spokesman has confirmed that the victim is a resident of Birkenhead and her body has been found inside a tenant.
That afternoon, friends who thought they knew the woman came up to the stage to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
The investigations continue, while the police have said it is informing the victims' families.
A local taxi driver in Grayson Mews has tried to enter his apartment, but he is informed by the police that no one is allowed to enter or leave the building.
He remained silent when he discovered the incident.
Now, residents are being informed that they will be allowed to enter their homes only after a few hours.
A police officer has been heard telling a man that the whole area is being treated as a crime scene.
A woman has crossed the crime scene.
She doesn't rest again the words "it's terrible."
At 2 p.m., two police vans were inside the perimeter and another van was outside.
A number of officers were positioned within the perimeter, monitoring the housing block.
Everyone who has information is asked to send a message directly to @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact "Crimestopers" anonymously at 0800 555 111 by choosing code 247 of 30 September.
Cromwell's statue in Parliament, last monument touched by the debate for "recording history"
Its removal would have been a deserved punishment for the destruction of many Taliban from the cultural and religious artifacts of England by its fanatic Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick's proposal as "recorded" and "an attempt to re-examine history".
John Goldsmith, head of Cromwell Society, said: "In the middle of the current debate on the removal of the Statutes, it was inevitable that Oliver Cromwell's image be seen outside the Western Palace.
The iconoccalism of English civil wars was neither ordered nor conducted by Cromwell.
Maybe this would have been a wrong Cromwell sacrifice for his ancestors Thomas' actions in the past century.
The excellent portrait of Cromwell by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is evidence of the opinion of the 19th century and part of the history of a figure for which many think it deserves to be praised.
Mr. Goldsmith said about "The Sunday Telegraph": "Many people, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, viewed Cromwell as a parliamentary defender from external pressure, which, of course, was monarchy.
The fact that this is a complete portrait is the subject of further historical debates.
What's certain is that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century gave the form of further development of our nation, and Cromwell is a well-known individual figure that represents a part of that medal.
His achievements as Lord Protector also deserve to be celebrated and remembered."
The death penalty for the Chinese farmer
A farmer has been attacked and killed by a door in a market in Southeast China, according to local media reports.
The man, identified only with his nickname "Yuan", has been found drunk with a broken artery and covered in blood by a hole in the Liupanshiu market in the province of Guizhou, reports "South China Morning Post" on Sunday.
A doorman is ready to inject door-to-door vaccines at a chair on May 30, 2005, in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
It is said that he had traveled with his cousin from nearby Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 doors on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him unconscious and discovered a door of a hole in the door by the open door.
He said there was a big man door in the chair with his mouth full of blood.
A medical examination has confirmed that more than 550 people have been injured by the death penalty, according to the report.
"My cousin's bones were broken and damaged," said his cousin identified with the nickname "Wu," as quoted in the evening news in Guiyang.
In videos filmed by security cameras, Yuan is seen entering the market at 4:40 a.m. on Sunday morning to feed his doors.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man didn't belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager has responded to the news last night that the thief was kept in isolation to prevent another attack, while the police collected evidence at the site.
According to reports, Yuan’s family and market authorities are negotiating a compensation for his death.
Although rare, cases of people hit by doors have been reported earlier.
In 2016 a mine attacked a woman and her husband at their farm in Massachusetts, causing serious injury to the man.
Ten years earlier, a 650 - pound [650 kg] farm was packed after his tractor, until his wife left the animal.
After a farmer from Oregon was kidnapped from his doors in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba expressed to CBC News that usually, the doors are not aggressive, but the blood smell can act as "influence".
"They just want to play.
They're like your little cousins... their intention is not to hurt you.
You just have to show them proper respect," he said.
The effects of the Rosa hurricane are expected to bring large waves of widespread spread into the South-West of the United States
As predicted, the strength of the Rosa hurricane is moving toward the coldest waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, over the next few days, Rosa will cause wakes following floods in northern Mexico and in the South-West United States.
On Sunday, on the 5th day of the morning with the sun, Rosa was accompanied by a speed of 85 miles per hour, classified as Category 1, hurricane and was located 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, the Pacific Ocean is beginning to form a low-pressure zone, which is moving towards the East, towards the West Coast of the United States. As Rosa is expected to approach the Baya California village on Monday at the top of a tropical bridge, she will continue to push the large tropical flag towards her north, towards the southwestern United States.
Monday, Rosa will cause birth to 10 inches in some parts of Mexico.
Then, the reaction of tropical weakness to the low - pressure zone will result in the next days of heavy rains and widespread flooding in the South-West.
At local level, rising rain clouds of 1 to 4 inches will cause sudden floods, droughts, and possible land degradation in the desert.
The high tropical decline will make the number of species in the designated area reach approximately 2 to 3 inches per hour, especially in some parts of Nevada and South Arizona.
2 to 4 young people are expected to live in some areas of the South-West, mainly on a large part of Arizona.
There is also the possibility of immediate flooding with rapid deterioration of conditions, due to the widespread nature of tropical rain forests.
Because of the dangers of tropical raindrops, it is not recommended to walk in the wilderness by foot.
Large waves can turn cannons into powerful rivers, and rocks will bring strong snow and rain into the area.
Afforestation of the low-pressure area will bring heavy rains in some parts of the southern coast of California.
The total number of young people can reach half an inch [2 cm], which can cause small droplets of remains and fragile roads.
For the region, these will be the first rounds of the summer season.
Some of the widespread tropical fires will begin to approach Arizona on Sunday evenings and on Monday mornings, before the rain clouds are extended on Monday and Tuesday evenings.
The mighty ones will be dispersed into four quarters on the Tuesday, and they will continue until Wednesday.
October in the United States can be characterised by high temperatures, with temperatures falling in the Arctic, while tropicals remain warm.
At times, this leads to drastic changes in temperature in short distances.
A good example is the dramatic difference in temperature across the central United States on Sunday.
Between the city of Kansas in Missouri and Omahas in Nebraska, as well as between St. Louis and Des Moines in Iowa, the temperature difference is about 20 degrees.
During the next few days, the remaining heat of the winter will try to gather and expand again.
A good part of the central and eastern United States is expected to start October at a warm temperature, between mid-80s, from the South Poles to the designated part of the Northern Hemisphere.
New York City can reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which will be about 10 degrees above the average.
Our long-term climate forecast shows high chances of temperature on the average in the eastern United States during the first half of October.
Over 20 million people have followed the Brett Kavanaugh trial session
More than 20 million people have followed through six television networks the interesting witness of High Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused her of a sexual attack suspected of taking place in the 1980 ’ s, Christine Blasey Ford.
Meanwhile, political blockades continued, and transmitters interrupted regular programs to transmit the back into the last minute of Friday's events: an agreement reached by Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona to conduct a single FBI investigation on charges.
Ford said before the Senate's Judicial Committee that it is 100 per cent sure that Kavanaugh had touched him while he was drunk and was trying to move him to a gym party.
Kavanaugh, in a flash witness, was said to have been 100 per cent sure that this had not happened.
There may have been more than 20.4 million people reported by Nielsen on Friday.
The company was measuring the average visibility in CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News and MSNBC.
The figures for other transmission networks, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business, were not immediately available.
And Nielsen usually has problems with the number of audiences from the offices.
To set this number in perspective, the size of this audience is similar to that of a football elimination or that of the Academy Awards.
The Fox News channel, whose opinioners have strongly supported Kavanaugh's name, headed other networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the 24-hour session, Nielsen said.
ABC came second with 3.26 million spectators.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
The interest continued to grow even after the court session ended.
Flake was the main character in Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican office issued a statement that he would vote in favour of Kavanaugh, he was filmed by CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning in the face of protests while trying to jump into the elevator to attend the judicial session of the Judicial Committee.
In transmission of CNN’s life, he stood down for a few minutes while being counseled.
"I'm staying here, before you," said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?
He said to them, "You are strong, while there are so many women who are weak."
Flake said his office had issued a statement, and before the elevator door closed, he said there would be more to say during the committee session.
A few hours later, all cable and satellite networks were covering the moment directly when the Judicial Committee would vote for the transition of the Kavanaugh candidate to vote in front of all Senate members.
But Flake said he would only do this with the confidence that the FBI would investigate charges against the candidate for the next week, as some democracy had demanded.
Flake was partially convinced by talks with his friend, democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and some other senators after him, Flake made the decision.
Flake's election was discreet, since it was clear that the Republicans would not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without the conduct of the investigation.
President Trump has requested the opening of an FBI investigation on the charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accused critics of "playing political games" with Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May has accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union that "they are playing political games" with Britain's future and compromise national interest, in an interview for the Sunday Times newspaper.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrived at the Conference of the Conservative Party in Birmingham, Britain, on 29 September 2018.
In another interview with her on the main page of the newspaper, her former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson continued the attack on her plan for Brexit, so-called "Checkers", by saying that the proposal that Britain and the EU pay taxes on the counts of each other is "finally absurd."
Wyde Sims gun murder: Police arrest suspect Dyteon Simpson for the death of LSU player
The police have arrested a suspect for the murder of Wade Sims, a 20-year-old basketballist of the LSU team.
20-year-old Dytheon Simpson has been arrested and has been questioned in prison environments under the unmanaged murder charge, said Baton Rouge Police Director.
Official sources have taken out the video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and the police say Sims had lost his eyes during the interview.
The police have found sites and says they have found traces of Simpson's DNA in them, CBS WAFB's branch reports.
After taking Simpson's question, the police said he admitted that he had put his gun on Wade by causing death.
The amount for his release was set at $350,000, the lawyer reported.
The Law Office of the Eastern Community of Baton Rouge has issued a preliminary report on Friday, where it is said that the cause of death has been a wound caused by fire from head to head.
The Department appreciates the task of recruits near the state police in Louisiana, the state police criminal laboratory, the Southern University police and the citizens of the area, for assistance with investigations carried out by the authorities.
LSU's athletic director Joe Alleva has thanked the legislative authorities of the area for "their well-being and for the establishment of justice in the country."
Sims was 20 years old.
The boy with 6 feet and 6 inches grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, had played basketball for LSU.
In the last season, he had an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 hits for each game.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball team coach Will Wade said that the team was "choked" and "joined" by Wade's death.
"That's why we're worried all the time," said Wade.
Want to throw a spell on Mexico City
The entrance from the Popcatepetl volcano has reached the southern slopes of Mexico's capital.
On Saturday, the National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans to stay away from the volcano after the crater was lifted and 183 gas releases were registered within 24 hours.
The center had monitored a number of thefts and injuries.
Social media images showed widespread noise coverage of car jams in some parts of Mexico City, such as Jochimilco.
Geophysicists have seen an increase in the activity of the volcano, which takes place 45 miles (72 km) south of the capital, since when a 7.1-scale earthquake hit central Mexico in September 2017.
The Volcano known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Police compete with Catalan separatists before the year of independence vote
Six persons were arrested in Barcelona on the seventh day after the pro-independence protestors were arrested with peaceful police forces, while thousands of people joined rival demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of the Catalan polarisation vote for strike.
A group of masked pro-separatists, surrounded by peaceful policing forces, struck with glass and canals by creating dark rainlights along the roads that normally flow from tourists.
Later in the day, there was also crackdown, while the police had to use the goose sticks to end the payments.
For a few hours, repeating the phrase "We don't forget, we don't forgive," pro-innocent groups faced EU protesters calling "the Spanish Round."
Forty people were treated for minor injuries suffered during protests, according to local press reports.
In the region where feelings for independence are overcome, tensions continue to rise even one year after the October 1st referendum, which is considered illegal by Madrid, but is celebrated by the separatist Catholics.
The majority of voters chose independence, although participation was low, since citizens voted against the vote.
According to the Catholic authorities, about 1,000 were injured last year after the police tried to stop the votes at the voting centres in the region through violent charges.
On Friday evening, pro-independence groups set up camps outside to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration continued, but it was forced to take another route.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electricist who participated in the separatist protest together with his wife, expressed no hope that Catalana would gain independence in the future.
"Last year we had one of our best times.
I saw my parents in tears because of the joy they would have had in voting, but now we're stuck."
Despite the fact that in last December's local elections, a vital victory has been achieved, although with close results, the Catholic pro-independence parties have found it difficult to keep the season this year, since many of their most well-known leaders have either voluntarily left the country or are in prison and awaiting trial for their role in the organisation of the referendum and the declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who was registering the protest on his phone with the police, said the conflict was fueled by both sides' politics.
"The situation is getting more and more tense," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catholic leaders who are in prison awaiting the trial last year, said he would vote for the European Parliament next year.
"The cast of the candidate for European elections is the best way to counter the regression of democratic values and the pressure that has come upon us from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Some people arrested after the car moved home
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 have been arrested after a car has been parked several times with a house in Londonderry.
The incident occurred at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday, about 19:30 BST.
Detective Bob Blemmings said damages were caused at the main gate and in the apartment itself.
It is thought that at a certain point a arrow was thrown toward the car.
Menga's victory over Livingston's 1-0 winner against Rangers
Dolly Menga's First Goll for Livingston ensured victory
Teams coming from a category below, Livingston surprised Rangers by causing Steven Gerard's second loss in 18 matches as team trainer from Ibrox.
The fall of Dolly Menga resulted in decisive while Gary Holt's team compared the second country's second country's Hibernian point.
Gerard's team has not yet won an outdoor meeting in Premiership, this season and next Sunday, will face Hearts, the difference with which eight points are.
But sooner or later, Rangers will wait at Rapid Vienna's home, in the precious fight for the European Law on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston has extended the series of successive winners at six meetings, and Coach Holt has not yet proved his loss since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston lost his case in front of the innocent opponents
Holt's team must have been in advance many minutes before they noticed, since their direct attacks caused Rangers many problems.
Scott Robinson managed to pass but hit the weak at the door, and then Alan Lithgow hit out in the top after the head hit by Craig Halkett.
The authorities were ready to let Rangers play before them, knowing that they could cause problems in standard attacks.
And so it was marked by the hand that decided the meeting.
Rangers caused a punishment attack and Livingston created the space. Declan Gallagher and Robinson combined creating Menga's potential, which hit and marked the center of the area.
By that time, Rangers had dominated the holding of the summit, but the local protection had been inexhaustible and Porter Liam Kelly had almost never been tested,
This way the game continued in the second part even though Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to wait for you.
Scott Pittman's strike stopped by Ranger's porter Allan McGregor while Lithgow hit out another standard hit by Livingston.
Investigations continued to come into Livingston's area and were constantly spared, while two allegations for the penalty--after Halkett's intervention to the player who came to replace Glenn Middleton, and another for hand touching -- were not taken into consideration.
Liverston-like Logic Game
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland in Tony Macaroni
A performance and phenomenal results for Livingston.
For a man, they played a great game and continued to cultivate expectations in this growing tractor.
The style of the game and their team has not changed much since their return to the head, but a great merit belongs to Holt for how he electred the team from his future.
He had a lot of heroes.
Captain Halquet was extraordinary, leading a perfectly organized defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall in trouble during the entire contest.
However, Rangers' lack of inspiration was lacking.
Although in some cases they played very well under Gerard’s direction, they lacked the quality.
Lack of final follow-up -- just once they got through the defense -- and this is something to serve as an alarm for Rangers, which they find in the middle of the table.
Erdogan is expected to feel doubt in the colony
On Saturday (September 29th) it was characterised by heavy skyscrapers while Turkey's leaders met for the morning in Berlin.
This was the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany - which aimed at settling relations between NATO allies.
They have challenged issues such as human rights, freedom of the media and Turkey's EU membership.
Later, Erdogan went to the colony to open a new giant box.
The city boasts the largest number of Turkish people outside Turkey.
For security reasons, the police stopped a crowd of 25,000 in front of the mosque, but many supporters went out the streets around to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan - many of whom were deaf - also raised their voices to punish both Erdogan's policies and the decision of the German government to welcome him in the country.
Opposition protests reflect the distinctive ability of a visitor who is worshiped as hero by some Turks of Germany and admired as autocrats by others.
Road accident in Deptford: Cyclists die after the car crash
A cyclist found his death after he was hit by a car in London.
The incident occurred near the crossing of Westword Street with Evelyn Street, a road road loaded at Deptford, in the south of the city about 10:15 B.C.E.
The driver stopped, and the ambulance assistants arrived right away, but the victim changed his life.
The move took place a few months after another cyclist lost his life in an accident where the author left the settlement, which took place in Childers Street about a mile away from the country of the Saturday accident.
The Metropolitan Police said the officers were working to identify the person and to inform his family.
Roads are closed and buses are announced to use other routes, while car drivers are advised to avoid the area.
Long Mountain Bourgeois: Six officers injured during a rebellion
Six prison officials have been injured during a tragedy in a high - security prison for men, the Bureau of the Bureau has been said.
The rebellion broke out at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire about 09:30 BST Sunday, and continues.
"Tornado" specialists have been called to keep track of the riots, which include eight prisoners and which are confined within a prison territory.
Officials have been treated in settlements for some minor injuries in the face.
A spokesman for the Burgundy Service said: "The trained prison staff has been mobilized to keep under control the incident currently taking place in the HMP Long Mountain.
Six staff members have been treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and we have made it clear that the responsible persons will be referred to the police and may be punished with imprisonment."
HMP Long Martin targets over 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was reported that the prison director had been subjected to treatment in the hospital after an attack by one of the prisoners.
And last October, the officers of the peaceful police forces were called into prison to keep a serious situation under control, where staff were attacked by bullies.
Uruguayan Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with immediate flooding (which can be of benefit to the outlying areas)
Although it is rare that a tropical depression hit Arizona, this is probably exactly what will happen on the first days of the next week, while the remaining strength of Ugandan Rosa passes through the Southwestern desert, spreading the risk of immediate flooding.
The National Meteorological Service has already issued warnings for immediate flooding on Monday and Tuesday from West Arizona to South and Eastern Nevada, South California and Utah, including Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to take the lead in Phoenix on Tuesday, approaching the spring of the month.
The National Meteorological Service in Phoenix expressed in a tweet that "only ten tropical cyclones have received the status of drought or tropical depression in a series of 200 miles from Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles from the Arizona border."
The latest models of the Ugandan National Centre predict 2 to 4 young Indians, with an isolated number of up to 6 Indians at the Mogollon border of Arizona.
In other desert areas in the South-West, including Central Rockies and the Great Basin, the stocks are expected to be at levels 1 to 2 inches, while in isolated areas their total can reach 4 inches.
For areas outside the risk of immediate flooding, Rosa's sisters can be a blessing, since the region has been hit by floods.
Although the floods are of serious concern, some of these factors may be beneficial, since the South is currently facing extreme conditions.
According to the U.S. Center for Tatysir Monitoring, more than 40 per cent of Arizona is dealing with the extremes of the second category," weather.com reported.
First, Urgani Rosa will hit the Gulf of California in Mexico.
Rosa, still powerful in the morning, with a maximum speed of 85 miles per hour, is 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and is moving north with a speed of 12 miles per hour.
Stupea is struggling with cold waters over the Pacific, and it's losing its power.
Suddenly, it is expected that hurricanes hit Mexico with tropical storms yesterday or the evening of the month.
Rain showers in some areas of Mexico can be strong, presenting considerable risk of flooding.
"The rain of an average of 3 to 6 inches is expected from Baja California to the northwestern Sun, and can reach up to 10 inches," weather.com reported.
Then Rosa will move north through Mexico, in the course of a tropical storm, before reaching the border with Arizona in the first hours of the morning of the wedding as a tropical depression, which will then move through Arizona, reaching Utah south on Tuesday night.
"The main risk expected by Rosa or its consequences are the strong droughts in Baja California, the North-West Sun and the southern US desert," Ugandan National Centre said.
These are expected to cause immediate flooding with life - threatening consequences, droughts in the wilderness, and land degradation in the highlands.
Sulimi in Midsomer Norton: Four arrests for the remaining killings in attempts
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old are arrested as suspects of the remaining murder in attempts, after a 16-year-old with a stroke in Somerset.
Adolescence was found wounded in the Middle East Excellence Terrace area about 04:00 BST on Saturday.
He was admitted to the hospital, where he is currently in a "sustainable" condition.
According to the Avon and Somerset police, a 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and a 20-year-old were arrested during the night in Radstock area.
Officials have called on anyone who might have caught up with a cell phone video from the event.
Trump says Kavanaugh "is faced with the folly and anger" of the Democratic Party
"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote against the cruel and cruel tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump said in a tube in the West Virginia Wheeling.
Trump said that Kavanaugh "is faced with the folly and anger" of the Democratic Party during its removal process.
Kavanaugh witnessed before the Congress on Thursday, renouncing Christine Blasey Ford’s conviction and emotion that he had attacked her sexually decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also gave a witness during the session regarding her case.
On Saturday, the President said that on that day "the American people witnessed the greatness, qualities of character and courage" of Kavanaugh.
"A vote for the appointment of Judge Kavanaugh is a vote for one of the most focused jurists of our time, a jurist with a clean public service record," he said before the crowd of supporters in West Virginia.
The president referred to the appointment of Kavanaugh during the speech on the importance of Republican participation in future elections.
"Five weeks separate us from one of the most important choices in our life.
I won't run, but I'm contributing," he said.
"I'm making so much effort and I'm fighting for great candidates."
Trump argued that Democrats have a mission to make "block resistance".
The first main procedural vote by the Senate on the appointment of Kavanaugh is expected to be held no later than Friday, CNN said a senior GOP director's assistant
Hundreds killed by earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, while figures are expected to grow
At least 384 people were killed, many of whom were killed by giant firemen who were thrown into the beach when the Indonesian island of Sulawesi was hit by a earthquake and we ate, the authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of them were gathered for a beach festival in the city of Paul on Friday, when the tall hills up to six feet (18 m) were thrown into a bridge, trying to cause the death of many and destroying everything ahead.
Food followed a 7.5 - foot - long [7.5 m] round.
"The next day, when the name threat was born, people were still carrying out their usual activities on the beach, and by the way, they didn't run immediately and hit his victims," said a press conference Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the publisher of the Indonesian disaster prevention agency.
"The conversation didn't come alone, he got himself a car, a truck, a house, hit everything on the ground," Nugroho said, adding that the dinner had crossed the open sea with a speed of 800 km/h (497 miles per hour), before hitting the coastal coming.
Some people jumped into the tree to save their name and survived, he said.
About 16,700 were evacuated to 24 centers in Peru.
Air photos published by the disaster agency showed a series of destroyed buildings and shops, broken and modeled wires and a water-circuit housing.
Post - earthquake outbreaks continued to shock the coastal city on Saturday.
The earthquake hit an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Agency for the Evaluation and Application of Technology (BPPT) expressed in a statement that the energy generated by the heavy Friday earthquake was around the threshold of nuclear bomb power dropped in Hiroshima during World War II.
The city's geographical position, which is in the back of a long and close circle, may have increased the power of the name, he said.
Nugroho described the damage as "great trouble" and said that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels were exemplary.
Some ceilings were found blocked under the roofs of exemplary buildings, he said, adding that 540 had been injured themselves and 29 had been destroyed.
Nugroho said that the number of victims and the damage rate could be much larger along the coastal river 300 km (190 miles) north of Paul, in a region called Dodraya, which is located next to the earthquake epicenter.
The communications networks "stop completely without any warning" from Doghera, Nugroho said.
The area has over 300,000 inhabitants," Red Crescent said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers were traveling to affected areas.
"It's already turned into a tragedy, but the situation may get worse," he said.
On the seventh day, the agency was severely criticized for not providing information about Paul’s attack from the tsunami, although officials said that the aliens had arrived at the time of the warning.
In amateur films distributed on social media, a man on the roof of a building can be heard warning passersby on the way down for the arrival of the nickname with stolen diamonds.
Within a few minutes, a hole moves into the back, taking its own buildings and cars.
Reuters could not immediately verify the reality of the film.
The earthquake and tsunami caused an energy mass intervention that blocked communications across Palu, making it difficult to coordinate rescue efforts by the authorities.
The army has begun to send cheap aircraft with the help of Jakarta and other cities, authorities say, but evacuated persons continue to have great need for food and other basic needs.
The city airport has only been opened for rescue efforts and will be closed until October.
President Joko Widodo expected to visit the evacuation centres in Palu on Sunday.
The number of victims from the mine in Indonesia goes up to 800.
The situation is quite serious.
While the World Vision post from Dodharea has come to the city of Palu, where workers are being raised in tarpaulin trees at their office, they witnessed the destruction of the road, said Mr. Doseba.
"They made me feel like they've seen a lot of destroyed houses," he said.
The situation is quite serious.
Although relief groups began serious efforts to move humanitarian aid mechanisms, some complained that foreign workers with extensive expertise were being prevented from traveling to Paul.
According to Indonesian regulations, funding, supplies and external staff can only begin to circle if the disaster zone has been declared a national disaster zone.
This hasn't happened yet.
"This is still a disaster at regional level," said Aulia Ariani, an Indonesian Red Creed speaker.
"After the government says "O.K., this is a national disaster," we can ask for national help, but this status has not yet been given."
On the second night after the earthquake and the tsunami in Palu, friends and families of missing persons were still hoping that the case of their loved ones would be of those few miracles that sometimes occur in natural disasters.
On the seventh day, a little boy was taken out of a bag.
On Saturday, rescue forces released a woman who had been living under the roof for two days, with her mother’s pillow next to her.
Gendon Subbandon, the trainer of the Indonesian national team of predictives, had trained two of the missing predictors for Asian Games, which were closed at the beginning of this month in Indonesia.
Some of the other people blocked at the Roa Roa Roa hotel, including Mr. Manding, were his students.
"As an old professional in the field of predictation, I am very emotionally burdened," he said.
Mr. Gendon reminiscessed that in the hours following the roundup of the hotel's "Roa Roa" show among the presuppose community, he had been trying to write to the WhatsApp competitors from Palu, who were participating in the beach festival.
However, his messages ended with only one sign of graying, instead of two blue marks.
"I think this means that the messages were not sent," he said.
Hayduts steal $26,750 during a bank trip to Newport in Levee
According to a press statement by Newport Police Director on Friday morning, some thieves have stolen $26,750 from a Brink's employee, who was returning a banknote to Newport Level.
The driver of the car had been putting a bank on a pleasure center and trying to spread it before others, Detective Dennis wrote in statements.
While he was employed, someone "has come running from behind the Brink's workers" and stole a cash-encumbered purse for delivery.
According to the declaration, the Witnesses had seen some suspects leaving the camp, but the police had not specified the number of persons involved in the incident.
Any person who has information about their identities should contact Newport's police in number 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: List changed name to Ye
Rector Kanye West will change his name to Ye.
Speaking about the change on Twitter on the seventh day, he wrote: "Officially known as Kanye West".
The 41st-year-old West has been called with the Y ring since then, and has used it as the title of his eight album, which came out on the market in June.
The change has come a little before his departure to Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to present his new "Yandhi" album.
He will replace the singer Ariana Grande in the show, which cannot come for "emotional reasons", the creator of the show said.
Apart from being abbreviation of his current name of art, West has been expressed in the past that the word has a religious meaning for it.
"I think "ye" is the most used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means "you," said West at the beginning of this year, talking about the title of his album with the Radiophone Big Boy.
"Before I am you, I am us, we are us.
I went from Kane, which means "the only one," just "Ye," which is the reflection of our good, our evil, our confusion, everything.
The album is more than a review of what we are."
He is one of many famous reporters who have changed their name.
Sean Combs is known differently as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he said he preferred the name Love and Brother Love.
A former West co-operater, JAY-Z, has done the same with or without a separate visa and capital writing.
Mexico's AMLO deserves not to use the army against civilians
Mexico's newly elected President, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, has been sentenced to never use military force against civilians, while the country is approaching the 50th anniversary of a similar confrontation against students.
On the seventh day at Tlatelolco Plaza, Lopez Obrador swore that "he will never use the army to force the Mexican people."
On October 2, 1968, military bodies opened fire on peaceful protesters in the marketplace, killing 300 people at a time when students' left movements were standing high throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has been promoted to support young Mexicans by giving monthly grant to students and opening up more public universities without pay.
It has been said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities push young people to criminal gangs.
The US should double funding for artificial intelligence
While China is becoming increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence, the US needs to double the amount spent on research in this field, a Kai-Fu Lee artificial intelligence investor and expert on artificial intelligence, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Comments have come after various parts of the US government have revealed discoveries of artificial intelligence, although the US lacks an official strategy for artificial intelligence.
In the meantime, China has announced its plan last year: within 2030, it aims to vote the first country for innovation in the field of artificial intelligence.
"The budgeting of research in the field of artificial intelligence would be a good start, since other countries are still very behind the US, and we are looking for a great deal of order in this area," Lee said.
The disseminating of funding may double the chances that the large-scale achievement in the field of artificial intelligence will take place in the US, Lee said in an interview for CNC this week.
Lee, author of the book entitled "Overpowers of artificial intelligence: China, Silicon Valley and New World Order", published this month by Hughton Mifflin Harcourt, is an executive director of the Ventures Synovation, who has invested in one of the most spectacular companies of artificial intelligence in China, Face+.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he created an artificial intelligence system that also passed the leading American players in Othello, and then worked as an executive director near Microsoft Research and as president of the Google branch in China.
Lee congratulated the US government's previous competitions for technology, such as the Agency's Robotics Challenge for Advanced Search Projects in the Defence Field, and asked when to develop a series competition in order to help identify young observers.
Lee said that Americans often need to work hard to get presents from the government.
"It's not China that's leaving academic leaders; they're corporations," said Lee.
Over the last few years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have been working hard at universities to work in the field of artificial intelligence.
Lee said changes in immigration policy could help the US to boost its efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
"I think green cards should automatically be given to people with the title doctor in the field of artificial intelligence," he said.
In July 2017, the Chinese State Council issued the Plan for the Development of the New Artificial Intelligence Generation.
The National Foundation for Natural Sciences in China provides funding for people in academic institutions, as well as the National Foundation for Science and other government organizations give money to American researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee said.
At the beginning of this year, the American Defence Department established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Centre, which is expected to include partners from industry and academy, and the White House announced the establishment of the Artificial Intelligence Selection Committee.
Meanwhile, this month DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in a initiative called "AI Next".
As far as NSF is concerned, it currently invests over $100 million per year for research in the field of artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, American legislation aimed at creating a National Safety Commission for Artificial Intelligence has not been implemented for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on the change in country name
On Sunday, the people of Macedonia voted in a referendum to determine whether its name will be changed to "the Republic of Northern Macedonia", a movement that could resolve a ten-year agreement with Greece, which had blocked its efforts to join the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, thinks its northern neighbor's name is a claim on its territory, and has set itself a blockade of its membership in NATO and the EU.
Two governments reached an agreement in June based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change may compromise the ethnic identity of most Macedonian slaves.
President Gjorge Ivanov has been said he will not vote in the referendum, and a polling campaign has cast doubt if the vote will reach 50 per cent necessary for the worth of the referendum.
The question in the referendum vote discussion reads: "Are you for NATO and EU membership through the accession of the agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the change of name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that for Macedonia, as one of the countries created by Yugoslavia's dispersion, this is a price worth paid to achieve membership in structures such as the EU and NATO.
"I have come to vote today for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia, so they can live free under the European Union's umbrella, since this means a safer life for all of us," said 79-year-old Olivera Georgievska in Skopje.
Although the referendum has no binding power, a sufficient number of Members of Parliament have expressed that they will be content with the results of the vote to make that decision.
The change in the name requires a majority of two-thirds in Parliament.
The state election commission stated that no irregularities had been reported until 1 p.m.
However, participation in the vote was only 16 per cent, compared with 34 per cent in the latest parliamentary elections in 2016, where 66 per cent of the voters registered cast their vote.
"I came to vote for my children, we have the country in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62 years old, a voter in Skopje's capital.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko cast their vote on the referendum on the change in the name of Macedonia, which would open the way for the country's membership in NATO and the European Union, Strumica, Macedonia, September 30, 2018.
In front of Parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov was preparing a small scene and was setting up a career in front of the chairs built by the referendum voter.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to join the top head, not getting out of the back door," Kavadarkov said.
"Our country is poor, but we have dignity.
If we don't like Macedonia, we can address other states such as China and Russia and become part of the Euro-Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will bring enough investments for Macedonia, which has a unemployment rate of over 20 per cent.
"I think the majority of the delegates will be proud, since more than 80 per cent of our citizens are for the EU and NATO," Zaev said after his vote.
He said a positive outcome would "confirm our future".
According to a survey published last month by the Macedonian Institute for Political Research, about 30 to 43 per cent of voters would take part in the referendum - a figure below the required level of participation.
Another survey conducted by Macedonian television Telma found that 57 per cent of participants were planning to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70 per cent said they would vote pro.
For a successful referendum, the level of participation should be 50 per cent plus one vote.
The referendum failure would give it the first strong attack on the pro-western government's policy since its arrival in power last May.
See: Sergio Aguero of Manchester City passes through all Brighton protection to be marked
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling took all the protection of Brighton at Manchester City's 2-0 win on the seventh day, at the Etihad stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made his arm at the 65th minute look extremely easy.
Argentina's gambling took a step in the middle of the action.
He got through the three Brighton guards before he got out of the open field.
Later, Aguero found himself surrounded by four green flowers.
He crossed a guard and passed by a few others at the entrance of the Brighton area.
Then he followed me to the left where Sterling was.
The English Sulmer used his way out of the area to follow the Agueros tortoise, which hit the right and crossed the porter Matthew Ryan by throwing the ball into the right corner of the network.
"Aguero is suffering from a foot problem," said the city's manager, Pep Guardiola.
"We discussed that he would play about 55 or 60 minutes.
Here's what happened.
We were lucky he marked a bullet at that time."
But it was Sterling who gave the victims the initial advantage in the Premier League match.
This ball was marked in the 29th minute.
During that action, Aguero took the ball in the middle of Brighton.
He's verticalized pretty for Laroy Sane on the left arm.
Sane took some steps before she followed Sterling on the second floor.
The horse’s rider brings the doll to the net and then throws it out of the limits.
The city will face Hoffenheim in the valuable challenge for the campaign team phase, Thursday at 12:55 p.m. in Rehein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to save the role of the "plowers" against Rockies
With the Nationals removed from the chance to reach the eliminaters, there was no reason to impose another start.
But Scherzer, who is always competitive, hopes to be given the opportunity to mark Colorado Rockies, but only if there is a playoff option for Rockies, who have an advantage in a fight against Los Angeles Dodgers in the National Law of the West.
Rockies got at least an opportunity to playoff thanks to winners 5-2 to the Nationals on Friday night, but they're still trying to get the division title.
"Even if we are playing without any motive, at least we can mark by knowing the atmosphere of fans here in Denver but also the fact that the opposition team will play at the highest level against which we can face all year round.
Why didn't I want to play in such a challenge?"
The Nationals have not yet announced who will be entitled to Sunday, but it is reported that they are inclined to leave Scherzer in such situations to start the meeting.
Scherzer, for whom the 34th presentation would be titled, presided at a training session on Thursday and could be presented in the field on Sunday, which could be a normal day of rest for him.
A player from Washington, who played with the ball is 18-7 with an ERA 2.53 ERA and 300 "strickeouts" in 220 2/3 games this season.
Trump gathers the West Virgin in the Mitigation
The President referred to the tragic situation in relation to his election to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, before he spoke about the importance of participating Republicans in future elections.
"Ninth is decisive for everything we've done so far.
Five weeks separate us from one of the most important choices in our life.
This is one of the biggest choices -- I'm not candidateing, but I'm contributing, and that's why I'm trying so much to fight for excellent candidates," he said.
Trump continued, "You see this terrible group of radical Democrats, you see what's going on right now.
And they have divided their minds into sects, in whatever way they may take it. You see their shamefulness and their hypocrisy.
They don't want to know who they are, who they are, who they are, who they are who they are who they are, and who they are who they are who they are, and who they are who they are, and who they are who they are.
Democrats, he said, have a mission to do "block resistance".
"And you've seen this in the last days," he said, calling Democrats "disgusting, cruel, foolish and faithless."
He was referred to as Crysenatór Democrate of the Senate's Judicial Committee, Diane Feinstein, which created a spirit of discontent from the audience.
"Do you remember her answer?
Did they open the document for you?
Oh, oh, what?
No, well, no, I... wait a minute...--her body language was pretty bad--was the worst language of the body I've ever seen."
The Work Party is no longer an open church.
She's not tolerant of those who say what they think.
When Momentum activists in my local party voted for the motion of disbelief against me, they didn't even live there.
In the end, I'm not the first of the Members of the Labour Party to be told they're not welcome - all because we say what we think.
My fellow MP Joan Ryan was treated similarly, simply because he firmly opposed anti-Semitism.
In my case, the motion of disbelief was a criticism of me for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
With regard to the importance of a responsible economic policy, with regard to national security and Europe, a similar ironic issue was raised by Jeremy against previous leaders.
In a report on the meeting of the Labour Party in Nottingham East, it was said that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive".
For the most part of my eight-year period as local members of the Labour Party, GC meetings have been so together.
Unfortunately, the meetings no longer have their previous tone, and the promise of a "best and most encouraging" policy has been forgotten from time to time if there has ever been.
It has become increasingly evident that opposing views are not tolerated in the Labour Party, and every opinion is judged on the basis of its acceptability by the party's leader.
This began shortly after Jeremy became leader, while colleagues with whom I thought the share of similar political views began to claim that I took a 180-degree turn and held views with which I would never agree - either on national security or on the only EU market.
As often as I speak in public - no matter what I say - the criticisms in social media, with people who seek my discharge, denouncing central policies, they tell me that I should not be part of the Work Party.
And I'm not alone in this thing.
I am aware that I am happier than some of my colleagues, since comments about me tend to be of a political nature.
I am amazed by the professionalism and the determination of colleagues who face general and racial discrimination every day, but they do not.
One of the most discouraging aspects of this political era is the normalization of levels of violence.
Last week, Jeremy Corbin said the Labour Party should eat a culture of tolerance.
In fact, we are no longer a "open church", and with every faith force and every change in the rules of choice, the party becomes more and more closed.
In the last two years, they have often advised me to lower my head, not to be so mean, and so everything "will be fine".
But that's not why I got into politics.
Since I joined the Work Party 32 years ago as a school student, urged by the failure of the Thatcher government that led my class to failure in a general school, I have tried to fight for the best public services for those who need more - whether as a member of a local council or as a government minister.
I've never hidden my policy, not even in the last elections.
Everyone in Nottingham East had clear views of my political positions and points of opposition to the current leader.
For all those who voted for the motion on Friday, I just want to say that the country is heading towards a Brexit that will touch our families, businesses and public services, and I can't understand the desire to spend time and energy with my loyalty to the leader of the Work Party.
But in fact, the only message I want to convey is not addressed to Nottingham Momentum, but to my voters, whether or not members of the Work Party: I am proud that I am in your service and I promise you that no threat to discharge or political favor will prevent me from acting in your best interests.

Chapters 38 - 17 Melrose: Insufficient Fathers in the List
Two recent attempts may have changed some final results, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to triumph in the extremely happy battle of Tennt's Primership today.
Now they're heads of lists as the only helpless team among ten teams.
In the end, it was their wonderful protection and courage to take risks from the winner of the local team, and coach Peter Murchie had the right to be fully satisfied.
"We've shown ourselves in every game, and we're still imperfect, so I'm usually happy," he said.
Melrose's Robyn Christie said, "We want to enjoy the Ayr team, which is more dangerous than we are."
Grant Anderson's attempt at the 14th minute, returned to the ground by Frazier Climo, passed Air in advance, but a green card for Scottish representative player Rory Hughes, who came for this challenge from Warriors, allowed Melrose to show the digital superiority and Jason Baggot received an ultimatum.
Climo increased Air's advantage with a penalty while shortly before the end of the first part, he noted and returned to the ground an individual action by bringing the result to 17-5 for Air before the break.
But Melrose started well the second part and Patrick Anderson's attempt, returned to the ball from Baggot, reduced the difference to five points.
Later, there was a long intervention as a result of the serious damage caused by Ruaryh Knott, who left with the bar, and after the game was reinvigorated, Air increased the result through a trial of Stafford McDowell, noted by Climo.
Captain Air, Blair Macpherson, was later punished with green cards, and Melrose re-used the fact that they had a more player, with an attempt to pull off Bruce Colvine, at the end of a part with heavy pressure.
However, the locals returned and when Struan Hutchinson was punished with yellow cards because he pushed Climo, without top, from the source of the sentence, MacPherson made "touch down" after the third floor of Air that was moving forward.
Climo noted and did the same almost after the rebooting of the game, after Kyle Rowe caught the ball hit by David Armstrong in the area and took Gregor Henry before the flanker player, for the fifth attempt of the local team.
Styl Game star looks like a new career in the restaurant industry
The "Still Game" star Ford Kieran seems to be determined to enter the hotel industry, after it was found to be the director of a licensed restaurant.
The 56-year-old played Jack Jarvis' role in the famous BBC show with co-scanarist and co-protagonist his long-term partner in the comedy world, Greg Hemphil.
The second has announced that the ninth season will be the last for this show, and it seems that Kiernan is planning his life after Craiglang.
According to official records data, he is the director of the Apionmore Limited.
The actor refused to comment on history, even though a source for Scottish Sun was not understood that Kiernan was trying to enter Glasgow's "floating restaurant industry".
"The Sea Is Ours": Bolivia without leaving the sea hopes that the court will open its way to the Peace
Marines monitor an improvisation of the sea fleet cell in La Paz.
Public buildings have built the blue ocean floor.
On the coastal bases of Lake Titicaca in Amazon, the engine is noted: "The sea is our property.
His recovery is a duty."
Through Bolivia without leaving the sea, the memory of the capture of the coast from Chile in a terrible conflict for sources during the 19th century is still quite alive - as well as the desire to sail once again across the Pacific.
Now, these hopes are likely to be much larger than they have ever been for decades, while Bolivia is awaiting the decision of the International Court of Justice after a five-year review.
"Bolivia is characterized by anger, the spirit of unity and peace, and of course, she is looking forward to the outcome with positive expectations," said Roberto Calzadella, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will follow the GJND session on large screens across the country, hoping that the Hague tribunal will decide in favour of Bolivia that -- after all decades of irregular discussions -- Kili is obliged to develop talks to give Bolivia a sovereign out-of-sea territory.
For Evo Morales, Bolivia’s charismatic Indian president - who is facing a controversial battle for taking the second mandate in the next year’s elections - the decision of the month is quite important.
"We are very close to the return to the Pacific," he swore at the end of August.
But some analysts are of the opinion that there is very little that the court has decided in favor of Bolivia - and that even if they had, they would have changed little.
The UN celebrity in the Netherlands does not have the courage to give another state part of Kili's territory, and it is stated that it will not determine the outcome of the possible talks.
The fact that GJND is going out with a decision only six months after the final arguments have been heard shows that the issue "was not complicated", Paz Zárate, an international legal expert, said.
And instead of helping Bolivia's cause, the events of the last four years may have penalized it.
"The issue of sea access is compromised by the current Bolivian administration," Zárate said.
Morales' aggressive rhetoric has disappeared every trace of charity left for the Kilians, she suggested.
At a certain point, Bolivia and Chile will continue their discussions, but it will be extremely difficult to develop discussions after that.
Two countries have not been embassies since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltze, representative of Bolivia in The Hague, opposed the idea that the decision of the court was surprisingly rapid.
The Monday will offer Bolivia "a unique opportunity to open a new era of communication with Kilin" and a chance "to end 139-year-old disputes with mutual benefits," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales - still one of the most popular presidents of Latin America - was using the sea issue for political interests.
"Bolivia will never withdraw from her right to have access to the Pacific Ocean," he added.
"The government is an opportunity to understand that we have to leave behind the last few years."
North Korea says nuclear war will not be carried out for how long it will not be able to trust the US
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho is saying his country will never take the first shot at nuclear weapons, as long as it can't vote for Washington.
New was holding a speech on the seventh day before the General Assembly of the United Nations.
He called on the United States to keep the promises made during a summit in Singapore between the leaders of rival states.
His comments come at a time when U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo seems to be in the forefront of the resurrection of nuclear diplomacy so far "to the contrary", three months after Singapore with Kim Jong Un-in-North Korea.
According to Ri, the hope that US continued sanctions and opposition to the declaration of the end of the Korean War will make North Korea more vulnerable is a solid hope.
As long as Pyongyang does not act first to make important movements, Washington hesitates to accept the statement.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
However, there is a broad scepticism about Pyongyang's intention to attract its rationale, which the state is likely to see as the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo is planning to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit between Kim and Trump.
The fashion exhibitions in Paris reveal the latest line of giant hats, which will soon come into your city's streets
If you want to own your collection of hats or to ensure full protection from the sun’s rays, do not ask for more.
Valentino and Thom Browne stylists presented an amazing series of giant capelets for their SS19 collection in the corridor, which opened up all the stylists in Paris's fashion week.
The wrong hats have taken this wine to Instagram, and these styles have brought their fascinating creations to the fore.
Valentino’s special creation was an extravagant hat, decorated with a wide array of details similar to the dolls, which surrounded the head of the model.
Other large accessories included stone-cooked chalks, a magic hat and even a pineapple -- but they're not made to keep your head warm.
Tom Browne also presented a strange mask - together at the time for Halloween.
Many of the colored masks had brown teeth and resembled more like Hannibal Lecter than do leather.
One creature was similar to the earth’s surface, filled with air and water pipes, while another looked like a glass of ice.
And if you like to follow this courageous course, you will be successful.
Modern analysts predict that giant hats can soon come into your city’s streets.
The giant hair trend has been followed by the La Bomba, the head of the rock with the two large legs we've seen all, starting from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
Marking bullets hidden behind the empty hats that were received through the social media, pulled out another great creature in the corridor -- a huge plague from which it was almost as big as the model of the bathroom that was holding it.
The orange-coloured orange-coloured, hard-coloured rose and a white leather hand on the left was the most special creation of the collection La Riviera SS19 of Jacquemus in the Blue Week in Paris.
The famous personality styler Luke Armitage said to the FCCC: "I predict the next year to see the head and the giant beach bag on the streets of the cities - since the style has had such an impact as it would have been difficult to ignore the demands for large accessories."
John Edward: Essential Language Skills for Global Citizens · Global Voices
Private schools in Scotland keep record of academic excellence and this has continued in 2018 with another series of excellent results in trials, further enhanced by individual and collective success in sports, art, music and other fields.
With over 30,000 students throughout Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish School of Private Schools (SCIS), are trying to offer the highest level of service for their students and parents.
Private schools aim to prepare their students for further education at higher levels, for their chosen career and their country as global citizens.
As an educational sector that can map and implement an appropriate educational curriculum, we are witnessing how the flow of modern languages continues to be an open, favorite choice at school.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you speak to someone in a language he understands, your words will be in their ears.
If you speak to him in your tongue, his words will be in your heart."
Those words are a powerful reminder that we cannot rely solely on English when we want to establish contact with people from other lands.
As a result of recent tests this year, we can see that languages are building the results list, with the highest level of passing notes between private schools.
A total of 68 percent of the students who have studied foreign languages have received a maximum A.
The data collected from 74 SCIS member schools showed that 72 per cent of students had received the maximum A in Mandarin, while 72 per cent of those who studied German, 69 per cent of those who studied French, and 63 per cent of those who studied Spanish had also received the A note.
This shows that private schools in Scotland are supporting foreign languages as one of the vital skills that children and young people will need in the future.
Currently, foreign language debt is considered to be as important as STEM (Scientific, Technology, Engineering and mathematics) in private schools and further schools.
A 2014 study by the United Kingdom Commission on Employment and Skills found that among the main challenges faced by employers in completing vacation countries, 17 per cent of them are related to lack of language skills.
In turn, language skills are becoming increasingly necessary for the preparation of young people for their future careers.
In terms of jobs that have the potential for mastering foreign languages, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Despite the career one chooses, if he has learned a second language, he will have real advantages in the future as a master of such a long - term ability.
The ability to communicate directly with strangers will automatically place a multilingual individual on competitors.
According to a YouGov survey, which included over 4,000 adults from the United Kingdom in 2013, 75 per cent of them were unable to speak a foreign language as well as to develop a conversation, and French was the only foreign language I spoke from a 2 per cent person, specifically 15 per cent.
That is why investment in learning the languages is important for children today.
Mastering many languages, especially mastering the languages of developing countries, will give children a better chance of working.
Within Scotland, each school will be different for the languages in which it is taught.
Some schools will focus on more classical modern languages, while others will offer languages that are considered more important to the United Kingdom in the 2020 perspective, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child’s interest, there will always be a number of languages that you can choose from in private schools, with a pedagogical staff from field specialists.
Scottish private schools are dedicated to offering a school environment that will prepare children and "arm" them with the skills necessary to get them out of custody, regardless of the future.
At this time, it cannot be denied that in a global business environment, languages continue to have a vital importance for the country’s future, so this should be reflected in education.
Modern languages should really be considered as "the ability to communicate international".
Private schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
You have to do it.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Private Schools Council
LeBron is expected to start off with Lakers on Sunday in San Diego
The wait is almost over for fans who were waiting to see LeBron James in his first game for Log Angeles Lakers.
Lakers' coach Luke Walton has said James will play in the pre-session open game on the day he goes against Denver Nuggets, in San Diego.
However, it is not yet known how many minutes he will play.
"They will be more than 1 and less than 48," said Walton on Lakers' official website.
The correspondent of Lakers wrote on Twitter that James would probably play for a limited number of minutes.
After training early this week, James was asked about his plans for Lakers' six pre-session games program.
"I don't need fights before the season at this stage of my career to prepare for it," he said.
The time of the drums in West Virginia, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump launched a series of electoral bombings this evening in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This will be the first of five such planned pipelines to keep them next week, including stops in the friendly areas including Tennis and Mississippi.
With the vote of approval left behind for his election to complete the vote in the High Court, Trump aims to create support for future elections because republicans risk losing control at Congress when voting in November.
What time is Trump's pipeline developing today in West Virginia and how do we track it online?
The Trump pipeline in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled to be held at 7 p.m. The Easttime tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can follow the Trump pipeline in West Virginia online below, via direct transmission to YouTube.
It is likely that Trump will address this week's hearing sessions to the Supreme Court of candidate Brett Kavanaugh, who was tense because of his sexual misconduct charges, with the expected vote of confirmation by the Senate to stay behind for a week while the FBI conducted the investigation.
But the main purpose of these numerous pipes is to help the Republicans take a step forward in the winter elections.
Thus, President Trump's campaign staff said that these five tubes in the next week aim to "give volunteers and supporters energy while republicans try to protect and expand the majority of those in Senate and the House of Representatives," according to Reuters.
"The control of Congress is so important for its agenda that the President will travel to as many states as possible while we are heading the busy season of the campaign," a spokesman for the Trump campaign, who did not want to be identified, said to Reuters.
Planned to develop in Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, today's tonight's tuition can bring support from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and covered by Pittsburgh media," according to the news agency "Metro News" of West Virginia.
The seventh will be the second time in the last month that Trump visits West Virginia, the country which won more than 40 percent in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican candidate of the Senate for West Virginia, Patrick Morrisey, who has remained behind according to surveys.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president should come and try to give him a jump in the poll," said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Cupa Ryder 2018: The US team showed willingness to fight while keeping their hopes alive by heading the garages to Sunday
After three uniform seasons, the remaining four for Sunday afternoon, it could be what this Ryder Cup needed.
This funeral procession is a totally created sport concept, but a concept where players really believe in and never more than in such a race.
And where can we say that this noise feels now?
"They had a six-point cut that has now gone into four, so we can say that it has been created up to some kind of red I believe," Jordan Spieth said while closing the day.
Of course, Europe has advantages with four points ahead when it remains in the game and twelve points.
As Spieth says, Americans hope that maybe they're in their favour and have a lot to encourage, especially from the shape of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day where three of the four possible points were taken.
Spiethe has been merciless from the beginning of the shootings to the grave and is leading his example.
The party brothels were added as they came around, entering the golf ball with an easy hit to bring the match to balance, when he and Thomas were first two points down after two rounds.
His easy shot that gave them the match win in group 15 was expected with a similar brothel, which shows that he believes an American team is still not out there.
"You must work hard and worry about your fight," said Spieth.
All the players are gone now.
18 rounds to leave a trail.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the past two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed story of the Ryder Cup.
The strange but devout European couple has realized four out of four and cannot grow up.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who didn't get a hit on the minimum on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided shooting on the minimum on Sunday morning and Friday evening, Friday evening and at nine second rounds on Friday morning.
This result and the way their energy seems to rise towards an enthusiastic crowd and anasialism reinforces the idea that they are players to be able to share the day and that there will be no other known player than Fleetwood and Molinari to win a possible European win, while the sun is on "Le Golf National".
Maybe two at the same time in different groups.
However, statements for a European triumph are still premature.
Bubba Watson and Web Simpson made it very easy to keep it with Sergio Garcia, the hero of the four-morning games when he was dating Alex Noren.
A point on the minimum and two points at the bottom were placed in front of the Spanish and Sweden in a cave from which they had no chance of leaving.
However, on Sunday no one will be there to help you get out of your group.
The four and two games are so amazing to follow from near because of the interaction between the two, the advice they give, the advice they don't give, and how a strategy can change there.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has taken a significant lead until the end, but these four sessions also showed that the US team will still fight even though some people, especially the states, have raised this issue in doubt.
Europe heads 10-6 while heading towards the final day of the Ryder Cup
Europe has a major advantage on the final day of the Ryder Cup after it has emerged from the four and two games with a 10-6 advantage over the United States.
Two inspiring Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari headed the two-winning race against a Tiger Woods found in difficulty to increase their advantage at four points in Le Golf National.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn, who was offered to take the trophie that he lost in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the weak American team in the morning's fight against hunger, bringing it into the 3-1 series of results.
The American team showed more resistance in the fourth game, winning two matches, but they couldn't minimize the difference.
Jim Furyk's team needs eight points from 12 individual Sunday matches to hold the trophie.
Fleetwood is the first first European first player who has won four points of radar, while he and Molinari, who are supervised by 'Mollwood', after a sensory end, are the second two in the history of the Ryder Cup that win four points in their four open matches.
After they sent Woods and Patrick Reed into the fourth game, they combined quite well together to enable a weak Woods and American beginner Bryson Dechambeau with an even more dramatic 57-4.
Woods, who had hardly two meetings on Saturdays, displayed a huge continuous explosion, but he has already lost 19 out of 29 his matches in the fourth and two and seven rounds.
Justin Rose, retired for the 4th morning fight, returned to partner Henrik Stanson in the double game and received a loss 2&1 from Dustin Justin and Brooks Koepka - ranked first and third in the world.
Europe had nothing to do with a beautiful and fresh day in the southeastern part of Paris.
Three times professional winners Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas decided the difference between Americans and two points on Saturday.
They won a strong victory 2&1 against Spanish Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in four matches and later returned to enable Poulter and Rory McIllroy 47-3 in two after they lost in the first two groups.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup a team has returned the result after a difference between four points in individual games, although Furyk's team only needs a balance to keep the trophie.
However, since he was the second best player for two days, an opponent seems to go beyond their possibilities.
North Korea says it won't be hit 'in no way' in the same way without winning the faith
North Korea's Foreign Minister told the United Nations that the continued sanctions on the seventh day were deeply rooted in the United States' lack of faith, and the country would not in any way be released from its nuclear weapons in a uniform manner in such circumstances.
New Yong Ho told the annual body from around the world of the General Assembly that North Korea has undertaken "an important measure demonstrating good will" last year, such as the halting of nuclear and radioactive tests, the assessment of areas where nuclear tests were developed and assuming that it will not increase the arsenal of nuclear weapons and technology.
"However, we see no response to this from the US," he said.
"Without faith in the US, our national security will not be self-sustained, and in these circumstances there is no way that we can only compare ourselves to the first."
While New highlighted North Korea's common complaints about Washington's resistance for a split "in" phase for the nuclear capture process where North Korea would be valued for its gradual steps, its declarations seemed important because it did not exclude the single nuclear carnation, as Penia did before.
The new one referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at a summit held for the first time between an US post president and the North Korean leaders in Singapore on 12 June, where Kim pledged to work towards "the nuclear carnage of the Korean peninsula" while Trump pledged to guarantee North Korea's security.
North Korea has requested an official end of the Korean War 1950-53, but the United States has stated that Pennsylvania should initially withdraw from nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted calls for international hard sanctions on North Korea.
"The United States insists that 'nuclear war' is initially carried out and increases the level of pressure through sanctions to achieve their objective in a way that is mandatory, even by opposing 'the declaration of the end of the war'," Ri said.
"The perception that sanctions can discourage us is the dreams of people who are unaware of us.
But the problem is that continuing sanctions is deepening our disbelief."
Newly did not mention plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, a statement that U.S. leader stressed earlier this week in the United Nations.
Instead, the Minister submitted three meetings between Kim and South Korea's leader Moon Jae in the last five months and added: "If South Korea and not the US, the process of nuclear carnation in the Korean peninsula would not have come into this situation without a road."
Despite this, tone used in the New speech was very different from last year when he told the UN General Assembly that the U.S. territory's location under flag with Korean-North rockets was offensive after "Mr. President Devil" Trump called Kim "the rocket man" with a suicide mission.
This year in the United Nations, Trump, which last year threatened to "completely destroy" North Korea, Kim thanked for the courage shown in taking the steps for cartoons, but said there was still much work to do and the sanctions must continue to be active until North Korea has carried out the nuclear cartoon.
Tuesday, Trump said he didn't have a time frame for this, saying, "If it's gonna take two years, three or five months -- that doesn't matter."
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Penia for business measures.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said to the United Nations Security Council on Thursday: "The implementation of the sanctions of the Security Council should continue strongly and without interruption until we complete the verification of the complete and final nuclear threat."
The Security Council has unanimously decided to increase the sanctions for North Korea since 2006, in an effort to end the funding of the Penia nuclear programmes and ballistic missiles.
Pompeo met New May in the UN General Assembly and then said he would visit Spain again next month to prepare a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit didn't go so well.
He left Pennsylvania in July saying he had made progress, and within just a few hours North Korea claimed that he had done "the request for a mafia style."
North Korea committed to a meeting with Moon this month to map a radioactive zone as well as a nuclear complex if the United States would take "the appropriate measures."
He said Kim had told him that the "adversary measures" he was seeking were security guarantees for which Trump was committed in Singapore and movement towards normalising relations with Washington.
Harvard students learn how to relax enough
A new course at Harvard University this year has included all students to sleep more, in an effort to combat the culture of increasing the study by using caffeine from these 'paid's.
One academic observed that university students number one in the world often do not know when it comes to things more basic than how to care for themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at the Brigham and Grave Hospital, prepared the course of lectures, which he believes is the first such in the United States.
He was inspired to begin this course after he gave a reference to the effect that sleep has on the student.
At his end a girl approached me and said to me, "Why is this being told me now in my last year?"
She said that no one had spoken to her before about the importance of sleep -- which impressed me,' he said for 'The Telegraph'.
The course, included in the program for the first time this year, explains to students the essential elements of how good sleep habits help academic and athletic performance, as well as how it improves their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and director general of university medical services, said the university decided to present this course after finding that students were seriously deprived of sleep during the week.
The course that takes an hour involves a series of intermittent responsibilities.
On the other hand, there is a vision of a conviction room where students click on coffee plants, forests, athletes and books so that they can explain the effects of coffee and tea and how athletic performance is affected by lack of sleep, as well as the importance of the time routine that should pass into bed.
In another part, participants were told that as a view of sleep over a period of time, the risk of heart attack, obesity, depression, and cancer increased.
A map of the camp, with an interactive icon, further encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
'We know that students' bring won't change immediately.
But we believe that they have the right to know--as you have the right to know--the healthy effect when you choose to drink should," said Professor Czeisler.
The culture of pride that you spend 'a night payout' continues to exist, he said, adding that modern technology and pressure on students are constantly increasing, meant that dreaming was a constant and growing problem.
Ensure that you have taken enough sleep dose, of a good quality, must be a 'secret weapon' of students to combat stress, fatigue and anxiety, he said -- even to avoid weight loss, because vision of sleep leads the brain into a urinary mode, making them feel hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California student of physical and chemical biology, helped Professor Czeisler prepare the course, after participating in one of his lessons last year in Harvard.
He said the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to return to a course for the entire camp.
He hopes that another step is to ask all post-university students to complete a similar programme of studies before competing institutions join them.
Prof. Czeisler recommended that students set an hour in time when they should go to bed, as well as when they should wake up, and be aware of the harmful effects of 'blue light' coming out of electronic screens and LED radiation, which can lead to the biological rate of sleep out of work, which leads to sleep problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga notes against Gerard's boys
Rangers took another hit as a visitor while Dolly Menga's hit gave Steven Gerard a 1-0 loss in Livingstone.
The team from Ibrox was trying to record his first win since the April 4-1 triumph in St. Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team caused the second loss in 18 Gerard matches as a coach, leaving his eight-point team behind the rescue leaders of the Ladbroke Premiership, the Hearts team.
Menga noted seven minutes before the first part was finished and with a decision of Ranger's team that seemed completely powerless to balance.
While Rangers now falls into sixth place, Livingston climbs into third and is right after Hibernian for golash difference.
Rangers can expect to have more trouble when their opponent Calum Spence was treated for a head attack after he was hit by an object that was shot by visitors' fans.
Gerard led eight changes to his team, which passed Air on the semifinals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, entered the same 11th field that hit a point Hearts last week and that he would be pleased to see how his well-organised team kills opponents everywhere.
Rangers may have been dominated by keeping the top, but Livingston created more when he had it in his possession.
They should have just marked two minutes from the start of the meeting, when the first time that Menga gave Scott Pittman to the door frame protected by Allan McGregor, he wasn't using it exactly by shooting the ball outside.
A long cross from the execution of the punishment by Keaghan Jacobs found Captain Craig Halkett, but his defense partner, Alan Lithgow, just shot him out on the back of the door.
Rangers took control of the game but apparently more than they expected to believe in their game in the opposite area.
Alfredo Morelos thought he deserved a sentence after four hours of playing while he and Steven Lawless were fired, but Judge Steven Thomson did not hear the Colombian complaints.
Rangers managed to make two hits at the door in the first part, but Ibrox's ex-porter Liam Kelly didn't worry about Lassana Coulibally's head and Ovie Ejaria's forceless attack.
While Levi's first hole at the 34th minute may have been contrary to what he saw in the field, no one can deny that they deserved it only for the pride they showed.
The Rangers had failed to serve long - distance passports for Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher hit the top towards Scott Robinson, who kept the peace to pass through Menga and to be marked in a simple way.
Gerard worked on the break between the parts while he replaced Coulibally with Ryan Kent and this change little as soon as it didn't give an immediate effect while the anesthesiologist followed up on Morelos, but Colonel Kelly ran from his position to block it.
But Livingston continued to make visitors play as they wanted, where Lithgow and Halkett followed each other's balls all the time.
Holt's team could stretch his head in the final phase, but McGregor stood firm and denied Jacobs before Lithgow jumped out of a ball from the punch.
Ranger's deputy, Glenn Middleton later claimed during the game for another criminal, while he argued with Jacobs, but Thomson again allowed the advantage.
Almanaku: Geiger’s Master’s Overwhelming
And now a page from our almanac "Sunday Morning: September 30, 1882, As today 136 years ago and IN VAZHDIM... the day the next physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, a spiral that eventually led to the production of what is known as Geiger's measurement.
A major science stamp since then, the Geiger scale has also become a major piece of popular culture, such as in the 1950 film "Coronado's Hills," with a non-professional scientific card such as Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
The man said, "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger scale used to track radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you set these limits, you can actually hear the effects of atoms released from radioactive activity in minerals."
Evans, "Don't tell me, I'm really listening now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63th birthday.
But the hope that keeps his name alive.
A new vaccine against cancer can teach the immune system to "distinguish" bad cells
A new vaccine against cancer can teach the immune system to "distinguish" bad cells and kill them.
Vaccines teach the immune system to recognize bad cells as part of treatment
Methods include the release of immune cells from a patient, changing them into the laboratory
They can "disappear" a protein found in many types of cancer and then re-inject
A vaccine that is under trial is showing promising results in patients with certain types of cancer.
A woman who was treated with the vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize bad cells noticed that cancer in the vein had disappeared for more than 18 months.
The method includes the release of immune cells from a patient, changing them into a laboratory so that they can 'disappear' a protein found in some types of cancer called HER2, and then re-injecting these cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, from the U.S. National Institute for Cancer in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results show us that we have a highly promising vaccine."
HER2 "incentives the growth of certain types of cancer," including breast cancer, vesicles, muscle and hereditary strength, Professor Berzofsky explained.
A similar phase of the release of immune cells from patients "to teach" them how to detect cancer cells has worked in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West appeared in a Pro-Trump tube, holding a capel with MAGA overwriting, after his show in SNL.
I don't think so.
Kanye West launched a protest in the studio during a broadcast on "Saturday Night Live" after a dismal interpretation where he praised US President Donald Trump and said he would run for this post in 2020.
After he interpreted his third song for that night called "Gosh Town", where he was holding up on his head a chapel that wrote "Make America Great", he came to talk to us strongly against democracies and renewed his support for Trump.
"How many times do I talk to a white person and they say to me, "How can you like Trump, he's racist?"
Well, if I were worried about racism, I would have left America a long time ago," he said.
The SNL began its presentation with a parody in the role of Matt Damon, where Hollywood star came to play the testimony of Brett Kavanaugh before the Senate’s Judicial Commission on sexual harassment charges raised by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although not transmitted, Western harsh speech records were loaded on social networks by comedian Chris Rock.
It's not clear whether Rock's trying to play West with that post or not.
Also, West complained to the spectators that he had spent a difficult time in the backyard because of what he had set in his head.
"They hurt me in the back.
They said to me, 'I'm going out to the stage with that hat in my head.'
They hurt me!
And then they tell me I'm buried," he said, according to Washington Examiner.
West came, "Do you want to see the bottom?", saying, "I put my head on my head, because this shows that no one can tell me what to do. Do you want the world to go forward?
Try love."
His comments were received at least twice by the spectators and SNL members appeared to be embarrassed, reports Variety, where one person told the newspaper: "All the studies went silent."
West was called a late substitute for Ariana Grande, whose former lover, Mac Miller, had changed his life a few days earlier.
The West surprised many people with the "I Love It" version of the song dressed as Perrier.
West is supported by the head of the TPUSA Conservative Group, Candace Turner, who posted on Twitter: "For one of the most brave souls: FAILED AS A BALL OF THE TURM'S BALLE."
But the Moderator of Karen Hunter's Emissions posted on Twitter that the West is just "it's the same and this is extraordinary."
"But I choose MOS to reward someone (by buying music or listening or by supporting his "art"), for whom I believe it is embarrassing and spreading the ideology that is harmful to my community.
While he's free.
So are we," she added.
Before the show, the singer said on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that he had already been "the one I've ever known as Kanye West."
He's not the first artist who changed his name and followed Didy's tracks, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His former boyfriend, Snoop Dogg has also had the name Snoop Lion and the late music legend Prince, changed his name into a symbol and then the artist who was known as Prince.
Accused of attempted assassinations in a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man is accused of attempted murder after a man hit a restaurant in Belfast on Friday.
The police said the incident happened in Ballyhackmore.
The defendant is expected to appear before the First Level Court of Belfast on Monday.
The charges will be examined by the Public Prosecutor's Service.
Game of Thrones, Kit Harington, Good Masculinity Toxic
Kit Harrington is known for his role as a soldier in character Jon Snow, in violent series of medieval fantasy "Game of Thrones".
But 31-year-old actor has hit male hero stereotypes, saying that showing such roles on the screen makes young boys realize that they need to be treated with respect.
Speaking about 'The Sunday Times Culture', Kit said he believed that 'something has gone wrong' and asked how the problem of toxic masculinity could be solved during #MeToo movement.
Kit, who recently married his actor's colleague at "Game of Thrones", Rose Leslie, also 31 years old, admitted that he felt 'too important' to solve this issue.
'I personally feel quite important about this issue for the moment -- where have we been wrong with displaying masculinity?' he said.
'What have we learned from men as they grow, in connection with the problems we are now facing?'
Kit believes that television can be partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity due to the excessive male characteristics shown there.
He continued, 'What is born, and what is learned?
What is taught on TV and what is taught on the street, making young boys believe they should be treated in a certain way to feel toward men?
I think this is one of the big questions of our time - how do we change this?
Because obviously something went wrong with the young boys."
During the interview he also admitted that he would no longer drive for "Game of Thrones" after the series ended at the end of the next winter, saying "the fields and horses have come to the top of the hill."
Since November, Kit will participate in a resale at the 'True West' scene by Sam Shepard, which is the story of a film producer and his brother hajdded.
The actor finally showed that meeting his wife Rose is the best thing she got from Game of Thrones.
'In this product I found the wife, so we can say that this show gave me my next family and determined my life from now on,' he said.
Rose played Ygritte's role, the sentimental interest of Kit's character Jon Snow, in the fantastic-scientific winning series of 'Emmy' prices.
The couple were married in June 2018 on the property of Leslie's family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has reported a 14% increase in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
There are more than 820,000 affected people throughout the country, health authorities say.
About 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
Most of the new cases have been transmitted through sexual relations, showing a change from past.
Traditionally, HIV infection spread rapidly in some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people who take the HIV virus in this way was almost zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in the province of Yunnan.
Year after year, however, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
The transmission of HIV through sex is an acute issue in the LGBT community in China.
Homosexualism was de-criminalized in China in 1997, but it is still said to overcome discrimination against LGBT people.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with other men will eventually marry women.
Most transmission of the disease is due to inadequate protective measures during these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal justice in medical barriers to HIV treatment as part of the effort to tackle this problem.
Maxine Waters denies that GOP senators' data are shared by members of the staff, saying these are 'hazardous lies' and 'conspirative theory'
U.S. representative Maxine Waters denounced Saturday's allegations that a member of her staff had posted personal information from three U.S. senators of the Republic on the pages of lawmakers in Wikipedia.
Democracy by Los Angeles claimed that these allegations were being raised by experts and the online "right-extrading" page.
"A lie, a lie and only a disgusting lie," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The information is reported to include home addresses and telephone numbers of American senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, from Utah.
The information was displayed online on Thursday, posted by an unknown person at Capitol Hill during a hearing session of the Senate panel on sexual behaviour against the candidate for the High Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
The flow of information came shortly after the three senators had received the question of Kavanaugh.
Some of the conservative pages such as 'Gateway Pundit' and 'RedState' reported that IP addresses identifying the source of publications were linked to the Waters office and removed data from a member of the Waters staff, reports Hill.
"This baseless claim is totally false and a big lie," Waters continued.
"The member of my staff - the identity, personal information and security that has been compromised as a result of these false and distorted claims - has not been in any way responsible for the leaking of this information.
This baseless claim is totally false and a big lie."
Waters' statements were immediately faced with online criticism, including the former Secretary for the White House Press, Ari Fleischer.
"This faith becomes frustrated," Fleisher wrote.
"This means that she does not have the right temper to be a Congressman.
When someone is accused of something they haven't done, he doesn't have to be nervous.
It doesn't have to be provocative.
The prosecutor's motives should not be settled in the first place.
He must be peaceful and peaceful."
Fleicher seemed to compare Water's response to the criticisms of Democrats for Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of being nervous during the hearing on Sunday.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who is trying to take Waters country to the mid-term elections, also posted his statements on Twitter.
"That's great, if it's true," he wrote on Twitter.
In her Waters statement she said her office had signaled "the relevant authorities and the law-enforcement institutions on these false charges.
"We will ensure that authors are discovered," she continued, "and that they take legal responsibility for all their actions, which have devastating and dangerous effects on everyone from my station."
Review of the film "Johnny English Gods Again" - comedy with rawn Atkinson material
It has been the case that every new film with British influence is seen for hidden messages on Brexit's topic and this finds implementation and in the revision of the "Johnny English" comedy-action scenario - which started in 2003 with "Johnny English" and with the return in 2011 with "Johnny English" .
Will this satirical comedian emerge from the clear lack of knowledge about our new national export opportunities?
In any case, the face-to-face character of the country, with the face as a dome and in view of Johnny English's experience, has been authorized to challenge things for a second time -- his name, which shows more than anything else that he is a broad, comical creature for territories that don't speak English, but that frequent Chinese.
Of course he's a secret agent of the missing, who despite the strangely claimed to be a magician, is a little from Inspector Clouseau, a little from Mr. Bean's character and a portion of that guy who only contributed to the release of a voice in the 'Chariots of Fire' song, at the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games - London 2012.
He is also based on a man of mystery, travelrs and international Atkinson, who once played on television advertisements that have now forgotten 'Barclaycard', leaving the country in chaos wherever he went.
There's one or two good moments in this movie's premier.
I liked him very much when Johnny English approached the helicopter dressed in a middle parsmour, and the speech of the helicopter gradually spread into his helmet.
Here is the gift of the physical comedy that Atkinson does, but humor seems to be empty and sometimes too, especially when the 'serious' films like 007 and the Impossible Mission have entered a few comedies as ingredients in their films.
Humor appears to be directed to children more than the number of adults and events of Johnny English crisis are not so creative and are focused on voiceless movements, just as Atkinson is doing in Bean's character.
The permanent theme as well as in this film is the fact that Britain is at serious risk.
A cybernetic hacker has been infiltrated into the British agents' super-secret network, discovering the identity of British field agents and has led the agent into duty -- unfortunately a small role for Kevin Eldon.
It's the last chance for a prime minister who shows up as a pomposal image and ready to fight, who is already suffering an extraordinary political non-popularity: Emma Thompson does the best to realize the character like Teresa May, but there is not much text on the scene that he can play.
Her intelligence advisers inform her that every active spy is compromised, so she will have to rely on someone who's retired.
And that means choosing yourself Johnny English, who was now a school director in a high school class, but who suddenly taught you how to become a secret agent: there are beautiful scenes here, because English is offering a spying academy in the form of rock school.
English calls again to Whitehall for an emergency meeting and is reunited with his former assistant, multi-stakeholder Bough, again playing by Ben Miller.
Now Bough is a married man, related to a captain of subordination, in the role of a girl of high school, where Vicki Pepperdine has been used to make a little mistake about this role.
So Batman and Robin, who did all the things back in Her Majesty's Secret Service, are back in action, confronting the beautiful dead woman Ophelia Bulletova played by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is magicating from billions of technological attraction who claims to be able to solve the problems of British computers: the Jason Volta League, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough start their ridiculous and disgusting jokes: masked as cameras, they set the flag a beautiful French restaurant; they cause chaos while entering the luxury luxury out of Volt; and English is totally disturbed as they try to use the material of Virtual Reality to identify themselves with the inner parts of Volta's house.
All sequences are usually for the final stage, but despite its joy and excitement, everything seems less like a movie for children.
A lot of moderate things.
As in other Johnny English movies, I couldn't think: isn't the British film industry a role for Rowan Atkinson to adapt to his talent?
The Laburist party denies that there is a plan for the British to work four days a week, but to pay for five days
The Labour Party led by Jeremy Corby is taking into account a radical plan that would make British workers work four days a week - but pay for five.
The party is reported to want corporate leaders to go ahead using the artificial intelligence revolution (AI) for workers, giving them an extra day of rest.
We will see that the workers would enjoy a weekend with three days of rest — but they would continue to bring home the same clothes.
The sources said the idea would "compulsory" with the party's economic agenda and plans to return the country to the favour of workers.
The passing of a week with four working days is an idea shared by the Syndicats Congress, as a way workers benefited from the changing economy.
A high-level source of the Laburist Party said 'The Sunday Times': 'Before the end of the year, a policy review is expected.
'It won't happen immediately, but a week with four working days is an aspiration corresponding to the party's collapse to balance the economy in favour of workers as well as the general industrial strategy of the party.'
The Laburist Party will not be the first to contradict this idea, where and the Green Party has been flew earlier for a week with four working days during the general election campaign in 2017.
However, this ambition is currently not supported by the entire Laburist Party.
A Laburist Party spokesman said: 'A week with four working days is not party policy and is not taking into account from the party.'
An office in Hije, John McDonnell, used last week's Laborist party conference to interrupt his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to pass power on by "anonymous directors" and "profiters" to public service firms.
The famine plans also mean that current shareholders in water companies may not take back all their shares, as the labor government can carry out a 'birth' with the reason for the actions considered to be cut.
He also confirmed plans to set up employees on company boards and to set up the Property's Comprehensive Fund to pass 10 per cent of private sector company capital, which means a dividend paid annually at value up to £500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy shows at "60 Minutes" if FBI research on Kavanaugh can change their mind
The FBI's investigation of charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed a final vote on his appointment to the High Court with at least one week, and raises questions if finding the search bureau could affect a Republican senator to withdraw his support.
In an interview to be broadcast on Sunday, the "60 Minutes", Scott Pelley, asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find out something that would make them change their mind.
Kennedy was more open than his college from South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," said Kennedy.
"I said that when I was in the hearing session, I said I had spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I got it on the phone after this happened, so when the charges were made and I said, 'Did you do this?'
He was determined and clear."
However, Graham’s vote appears to have been on the rock.
"I've divided my mind about Brett Kavanaugh and the change would only make a bomb charge," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett strongly denied it," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And whoever she mentioned could not verify it.
He's 36 years old.
I don't see anything going to change."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has done something to reduce poverty?
On Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual musical show that contains a large and exciting list of stars that interpret and also have a mission that is so exciting; to end poverty in the world.
Now, in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will expect the crowd of thousands of people at the 'Green Law' in Central Park not only to enjoy Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes's interpretations, but also to be held responsible for the real purpose of the exhibition, to end extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international legal group, which hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting against it.
In order to benefit from a credit card for displaying (except when you want to pay a VIP card), participants should meet a number of obligations, or "actions" such as voluntary work, sending an e-mail to a world leader, making a phone call or any other way meaningful to help raise awareness of their goal of ending poverty.
But how successful has Global Citizen Festival been when they've stayed and 12 years to achieve its goal?
Does the idea of rewarding people with a concert really work out a way to convince those looking for these interactions, or is it just another case of what is known as "click activation" - people who feel they're making a real change by signing an online petition or by sending a message to Twitter?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has been said to have registered more than 19 million "actions" by its supporters, giving them a boost of different objectives.
It is said that these actions have helped to motivate world leaders to declare political commitments worth $37 billion, which is said to affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group quoted 390 claims and statements as a source of the group's actions, where at least $10 billion are already distributed or secured as funds.
The group estimates that the funds provided so far have had a direct impact on around 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the main tasks include "The Power of Nutrition", a partnership of investors and executive agencies central to the United Kingdom, committed to "help children grow with their full potential," promising Rwanda to give $35 million to help put an end to the country's abuse, after receiving more than 4700 "circumvention" from Global Citizens activists.
"With the support of the British government, donors, national governments and citizens of the world like you, we can turn social injustice of abuse into a reminder of the past," the group's ambassador to "The Power of Nutrition" said at a concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after launching 5,000 actions to call on the United Kingdom to improve food for mothers and children, the government declared financing a project, "The Power of Nutrition", which will affect 5 million women and children who need food intervention.
In an answer to the most common questions on their web page where he asked, "What makes you believe we can end extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen replied: "It will be a long and difficult journey - sometimes we will come and fail.
But as every high city's right and as the movement against apartheid before us, we will go out, because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, the Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monae are some of the actors that will play this year in New York, which will be presented by Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The US can use the sea for "blockage" to prevent Russian energy exports - Secretary of the Interior
"If necessary" Washington can rely on his Marine to prevent Russian energy spread across the market, including the Middle East, has discovered the US Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke, according to Washington Examiner's quote.
Zinke claims that Russia’s involvement in Syria - especially where it operates at the invitation of the Syrian government of legislation - is a pretext to explore new energy markets.
"I think the reason why they're in the Middle East is that they want to provide it with energy as they do with Eastern Europe, the southern European boat," he reported.
And according to this official, there's a way to deal with this problem.
"The United States has the ability, with our Marine, to ensure that the maritime routes are open and, if necessary, to block them in order to ensure that energy does not reach the market," he said.
Zinke was directed to participants in an activity developed by the Energy Consumer Alliance, a non-profit organisation that has identified itself as "the voice of energy consumers" in the United States.
He continued to compare Washington's challenges in dealing with Iran's Russia, pointing out that these are practically the same.
"The economic option over Iran and Russia is almost a lot of use and replacement of burning wounds," he said, referring to Russia as "a fraudous mouth" with an economy that depends on fossil fuel damage.
Statements are coming after the Trump administration has undertaken a mission to increase exports of natural gas that have been exported to Europe, thus replacing Russia, a much more free option for European consumers.
To this end, officials of the Trump administration, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the North Stream 2 newspaper project, which, according to Trump, has turned Berlin into a Moscow 'slave'.
Moscow has been further expressed that the 11 billion-dollar North Stream 2 project, which is supposed to double the capacity of existing journalists to bring it to 110 billion cubic metres, is a clean economic project.
Kremlin argues that the fire opposition from Washington project is simply for economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe that sharing the same opinion that energy cannot be a means of pressure and that consumers should have the opportunity to choose the supplier," Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after a meeting with American Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. attitude has been replaced by opposition from Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitment to this project.
The main organisation for industry in Germany, the German Industry Federation (BDI), has asked the US to stay away from EU energy policy and from bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a lot of problems when a third state interferes with our energy supply," said Dieter Kempp, head of the German Industry Federation (BDI) after a short time ago meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will "think seriously" if he will apply for presidents in 2020, says the Senator of Massacuses
Senator of Massacuses, Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that he would "think seriously" taking part in the event for the president after the elections in the middle of the mandate.
During a pipeline in the city of Holyoke, Masaçusets, Warren confirmed that she would take the candidate into account.
"It is time for women to go to Washington and regulate our destroyed government and this includes a woman's decision on the left," she said "The Hill".
"After 6 November, I will seriously consider the candidate for presidents."
Warren hit President Donald Trump during the bombing in the city, saying he's taking the country into the wrong direction.
"I'm terribly concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," she said.
Warren is known for his criticism of Trump and his candidate for the High Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a Friday quote, Warren said "that we certainly need an investigation from the FBI before the vote."
However, a Thursday survey showed that a large part of Warren’s voters do not think it should be candidate in 2020.
Eighty-eight percent of the "possible" voters of Massacuses said the senator should not apply, according to a survey conducted by the Suffolk/Boston Globe University Political Research Centre.
Thirty-two percent supported this candidacy.
The poll showed that former Governor Deval Patrick enjoyed greater support for candidates, where 38 per cent supported his potential candidate and 48 per cent opposed this candidate.
Other high-profile democratic names that have been discussed to take place in 2020 include former President Joe Biden and Senator Vermont, Bernie Sanders.
Budden said he would be officially appointed in January, reports 'Associated Press'.
Sarah Palin cites the post-traumatic stress management of Trak Palin in Donald Trump's pipeline
Track Palin, 26 years old, spent a year in Iraq after he was called into the army in September.
On Monday night he was arrested and charged with a family violence incident
"What my son is going through, what he's experiencing after he's back, can be connected to other families that feel the spread of PTSD and some of the wounds that our soldiers are returning," she told participants in a tube for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Paul called his arrest "the elephant in the room" and said that her son and other veterans are fighting, "they come a little different, tired, thinking if they get due respect for what soldiers and other members of the army have given the country."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska and charged with family violence after an attack on a woman, after a family violence report and arrest while he was drunk, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman of the police department in Wasilla.
18 states, D.C. supports opposition to a new asylum policy
Twenty states and Carque of Colombia are supporting a legal opposition to an American new policy that denies asylum to victims who have been rescued by criminal groups or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and circles deposited an explanatory document as a friend of the court in Washington on Friday, in support of the change in asylum-seekers' policies, the NBC News reports.
The full name of the defendant on the Grace issue against Sessions that the US Civil Liberties Union has deposited in August against federal policy has not been discovered.
She said her partner "and her violent sons members of the band," abused her, but US officials denied her asylum request on July 20th.
She stopped in Texas.
State lawyers who are supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala as producing a high number of asylum applications in the United States because they are countries that have problems with gangs and family violence.
The new asylum-search policy in the US returned a decision, in 2014, from the Immigration Appeals Board that allowed immigrants without documents to save their family violence and apply for asylum.
Advocate General Karl Racine of Colombia's General Court said in a statement on Friday that the new policy "discovers all decades of state, federal and international laws."
"The federal laws require that all asylum requests should be judged according to the particular facts and circumstances of the case, and such a measure is contrary to this principle," said the joint court report.
Lawyers further argued in the report that the ban on the entry of immigrants was detrimental to the US economy, stating that their chances are to become businessmen and to "supply the job needed."
General Prosecutor Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges in June to refrain from any further damage to victims of family violence and gang violence.
"Asia is available for those who leave their country because of fear or persecution based on race, religious belief, nationality or belonging to a designated group of social or political convictions," the session said on 11 June, on the day of the political declaration.
Azili has never been meant to ease all the problems -- even all the serious problems -- that people face every day around the world.
Efforts to survive in Palu while the death balance is doubled in a race for survival
To the survivor, the situation was very honorable.
"The situation is quite tense," said 35-year-old mother, Risa Kusuma, while keeping her little sick son at an evacuation centre in the devastated city of Paula.
"The ambulance brings the bodies every minute.
There's no clean water anymore."
The inhabitants were seen returning to their destroyed houses, carrying their heavy loads into the water, in an effort to save everything they could find.
Hundreds of people have been injured, and hospitals damaged by 7.5 balloons are infected.
Some of the wounded, including Dwi Haris, who has broken down the corridor and shelter, are located in the Military Hospital outside of Palu, where patients are being treated in the outer environment because earthquakes continue.
His eyes were filled with tears as he recalled the violent earthquake in the hotel room at the fifth floor of the hotel that separated him from his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save myself.
I think I was hit under the walls," Haris said 'Associated Press', adding that his family had come to town for a wedding.
"I heard the woman was crying and asking for help, but then quietly.
I don't know what happened to him and my son.
I hope they're safe."
US Ambassador accused China of 'gagcmim' with 'propagandistic advertising'
A week after a Chinese official newspaper posted a four-page commercial on an American daily where US-China's joint trade profits were promoted, the US ambassador in China accused Beijing of using the US press to spread its propaganda.
US President Donald Trump, last Wednesday, referred to the supplement to China's Daily pay in 'Des Moines Register' - the most sold newspaper in the state of Iouas - after he accused China of attempts to intervene in the US Congress elections held on 6 November, a charge rejected by China.
Trump's allegations that Beijing was trying to interfere with US elections noted what American officials told Reuters that it was a new phase in Washington's scaled campaign to increase Chinese pressure.
While it is normal for foreign governments to lay down advertising to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently involved in a trade war in higher growth which has seen a comparison of rates on imports of each other.
Chinese and American experts have said China's Spanish tariffs in this trade war were destined to attack exporters in such states as Iowa, which has supported the Republican Party of Trump.
Terry Branstad, US ambassador to China and former governor for a long time in Iowa, a large exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing has hit US workers, farmers and businesses.
In an opinion published in 'Des Moines Register' on the day Branstad shared it wrote, "China is already twofolding this attack by putting propaganda advertising on our free press."
"By spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government is being helped by the American tradition of free speech and free press by setting up a pay ad in Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"On the contrary, in the streets of newspapers here in Beijing, you will find very few voices against it and you will not see any real reflection of the different opinions that the Chinese can have for China's worrying economic tractor, since the media is under the strong control of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of the most popular newspapers in China, he avoided the offer to publish his article," however he didn't tell him what the paper was.
Analysts warn that Republicans are adding women vote before elections in the middle of the mandate after the Kavanaugh scandal
The more major figures of Republicans are solidarity and protecting the candidate for the High Court, Brett Kavanaugh, before some allegations of sexual assaults, analysts have warned that they will face a harsh response, especially from women, in future elections between the mandate.
Emotions on this issue have been high, and many republics have publicly declared that they want to continue voting for the candidate.
These things can't be solved," Grant Reeher, professor of political sciences at the University of Sirakuza 'School Maksuell told 'The Hill' about an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said that he was questioning Senator Jeff Flake's last minute for an FBI investigation and that this would be enough to calm angry voters.
"The cities won't forget what happened yesterday--they won't forget it either tomorrow or November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior national adviser and spokesman for the progressive group 'MoveOn', according to Washington newspaper D.C.
On Friday morning, protesters sang 'Ninth is coming!' while they were demonstrating in the Senate corridors while the Republicans who are in charge of the Judicial Committee decided to move forward with Kavanaugh's candidacy despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's testimony, said 'Mic'.
"Ethnosis and democratic motivation will reach the top," said the news page Stu Rothenberg, an independent political analyst.
"People are saying that it's already been at high levels; that's true.
But it can be even higher, especially among unaccompanied female voters on the peripheral and among young voters aged 18 to 29, who, although they don't like the president, usually don't vote at all."
Even before Ford's public testimony detailing her allegations of sexual assault against the High Court candidate, analysts suggested that there would be a harsh response if the Republicans continued to support this candidate.
"This has turned into a collapsible disaster for GOP," said Michael Steele, former head of the National Committee of Republicans, early last week, according to 'NBC News'.
"It shall not only do with the committee's vote or the final vote or if Kavanaugh is to be set or not in the bank and the defendant's bank, it shall also do so in the way that the Republicans have dealt with this issue and in the way that they have treated that woman," said the NBC News, Guy Cecil, US President of Priorities, a group that helps in the election of the Democrats.
However, it seems that the Americans are somewhat divided by those who believe in the wake of Ford and Kavanaugh’s witnesses, with the latter having a little higher support.
A recent survey by 'YouGov' shows that 41 per cent of respondents believe in doubt or with much opportunity for Ford's testimony, while 35 per cent say they believe in doubt or with much opportunity Kavanaugh.
Also, 38 percent believe that Kavanaugh, with much opportunity or uncertainty, has lied during his witnessing, while only 30 percent say the same thing about Ford.
After Flake's insinuation, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations presented by Ford as well as by another prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, reports 'The Guardian'.
Last week, Ford testified before the Senate Judicial Committee, under oath that Kavanaugh attacked him at the age of 17, while he was in a state of shock.
Ramirez claims that the candidate for the High Court showed his genital organs before her while they were at a party during their study in Yale, the '80s'.
The World Wide Web creator plans to launch a new internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Bernards-Lee, the founder of the World Wide Web, is creating a company that aims to revitalize Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest technology legend project, ‘Inrupt,’ is a company built from the open-source platform of Berners-Lee, called ‘Solid’.
'Solid' allows users to choose where their data are stored and which persons are allowed to have access to a particular information.
In an exclusive interview for 'Fast Company', Berners-Lee said with a smile that the purpose after 'Inrupt' is "world domination'.
"We have to do it now," he said about this innovative company.
"It's a historic moment."
The application uses Solid technology to allow people to create "saving their personal data online" or a POD.
It can include contact lists, list items, music lists, and other personal and professional tools.
It's the same as having available on a browser and at the same time Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify.
What's unique about storing personal data on the network is the fact that the user is totally in the hands of what kind of information it will access.
The company calls it "personal strength through data."
The idea of Inrupt, according to company executive director John Bruce, is to bring together the resources, processes and skills needed to help Solid be available to everyone.
The company is currently composed of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some developers hired to work on this project, and a voluntary coding community.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their decentralised applications using the available tools on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are not talking to "Facebook and Google if they should present or not a total change where all their business models are completely overnight.
"We're not looking for their permission."
In a post published in 'Media' on Saturday, Bernards-Lee wrote that Inrupt's mission "is to offer trade energy and an ecosystem that helps to protect the integrity and quality of the new network built in Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Institute of Massacuses Technology.
Over the past few months, Berners-Lee has been a voice of influence in the debate on network instability.
Even while establishing Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Network Foundation and the Institute of Youth in the Netherlands.
"I am very optimistic about this new era of the network," added Bernards-Lee.
Bernard Vann: The Victorian Cricket's data is celebrated during World War I for the clergy · Global Voices
The only cleric who won a Victorian Cricket during World War I in the quality of the war is remembered in his country, 100 years later.
Colonel Bernard Vann won the medal on September 29, 1918, at the attacks in Bellenglish and Lehacourt.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and never heard that he had won the highest British military title.
A memorial stone was presented by two of his grandsons at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on the seventh day.
One of the neapists, Michael Vann, said it was "extremely symbolic" that the memory was exactly 100 years from the heroin act that gave his grandfather the medal.
According to "London Gazette," on September 29, 1918, Colonel Vann directed his battalion through the St. Quentin Canal "through a thick fog and under the edge of the bullets from the fields and the metropolis."
He then stepped forward to the fire line and with a "great cry" led the battalion forward and caught one of the weapons in the field and only killed three people from the opposing bodies.
Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 - less than a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's actions "are something he can never achieve but something that really shows modesty."
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, were set up by a post-paradise who was headed by the "Brentwood Imperial Youth" group.
Michael Vann said "I felt quite honored that it was part of this paradise" and added that "the value of a real hero is being shown by the support that many people are giving."
The MMA fans stayed all night awake to follow Bellator 206, but instead they saw "Derkuzen Pepa"
Imagine, you've been awake all night to see Bellator 206, and then you've got the opportunity to see this major event.
The exhibition by San Jose contained 13 diluffs, including six diluffs in the base package and will show in real time during the night channel 5 in the MB.
At 6 a.m., while Gegard Musasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to argue with each other, British observers were surprised when the transmission changed to show Derrkucen Pepa.
Some were disappointed that they had stayed awake all night until the first hour, especially for this attack.
A fan on Twitter described this transition from the fight in a visual film for children as "a bad joke."
"There are government rules that determine that at 6 a.m. that content was not suitable for the child and we should go through a programme for children," Dave Schwartz, the deputy market and communication president in Bellator, said when he was asked about the transmission.
"Dear Pepa," yes.
Belator's company president, Scott Cooker, said they will work on the programme to include viewers from Britain in the future.
"When I think about retransmission, I think we can solve it," said Coker.
"But there is six o'clock in the morning, day out, and we won't be able to solve this problem until Sunday with our time, so Monday with their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the program changed there, there were many messages that were circulated and none of them were friendly.
We were trying to fix it because we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't, it was a government problem.
I promise you it won't happen next time.
We're going to do the show with 5 matches in six places -- as we usually do -- we were able to give more about the fans and maybe we've got the can.
It's a bad situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt 'lower' about his sexuality
The Olympic poet Tom Daley says that he grew up feeling inferior to others because of his sexuality — but this gave him reason to succeed.
The 24-year-old said he didn't understand until he went to school nine years ago that "not all were like me."
Speaking about the first radio program on 'Desert Island Discs' presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he raised his voice for the rights of homosexuals to give them "hope" to others.
He also said that after being a parent, he thought less of winning Olympic medals.
The permanent presentation of the long-term program, Kirsty Young, has taken a few months of rest because it is sick.
Acting as a man-made person in Laverne's first program, Daley said that during his growing up he felt "inferior" to others because "he wasn't socially acceptable to like boys and girls."
He said, "To this day, those feelings of inferiority, and the fact that I felt different, have been the real elements that gave me strength and strength to get out of it."
He wanted to try to prove it worth "something," he said, not to disappoint everyone when they heard of his sexual orientation.
Twice winning the bronze Olympic medal, he is already a high-profile LGBT profile activist and used his participation in the Communist Games in Australia to appeal to more countries to legitimize homosexuality.
He said he went out open because he felt lucky that he was able to live openly and without consequences and that he wanted to give others "hope."
Three times the world's champion said the fall in love with a man - American film producer Dustin Lance Black, who met him in 2013 - "Get me ready."
Last year, Daley married the Oscar pricer, who is 20 years older than he, but said the difference in age has never been a problem.
"When you experience so many things at such a new age," he went to the first Olympic at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later -- he said it was difficult to find someone at the same age who had experienced the same smell.
The couple became parents in June, of a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley and Daley said his "all prospects" had changed.
"If you'd asked me last year, all I thought was 'I should get a gold medal'," he said.
"You know what, there are more important things than the Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic medal is Robbie."
His son holds the same name as his father, Robert, who died in 2011, at the age of 40 when he was diagnosed with cancer in his head.
Daley said that his father did not agree that he would die and that one of the last things he had asked was if we were ready for London 2012 - because he wanted to be on the first line.
"I can't tell 'you won't be on the first line of my father," he said.
"I was holding his hand while he had the right to take the breath and only after the right to take the breath and changed my life for the first time that and he wasn't unconscious," he said.
The next year Daley competed at the 2012 Olympic Games and won the bronze medal.
"I knew that this was what I had dreamed of all my life - to bow before the local public in the Olympic Games, it had no better feeling," he said.
It also inspired his first musical selection - Proud by Heather Small - who has associated him during preparations for the Olympic Games and continues to cause mornica.
Desert Island Discs are given at BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 p.m., with British time.
Mickelson, out of shape, left on the table on Saturday at Ryder Cup
US file Mikkelson will set a record on Sunday when playing his 47th fight in Ryder Cup, but it will have to change its shape so that this historic moment will not turn into disappointment.
Mickelson, for which it is the 12th time that participates in this event, this own record, which is organised every two years, was put in the chair by Captain Jim Furyk during the field games (fourballs and foursomes).
Instead of being at the center of the action, as it has usually been for the United States, five times won large titles, he spent the day supporting the team and working with hope that he would be released from anxiety.
Not among the most accurate hit players even when he was in his career height, 48-year-old is not a suitable player for the complex Le Golf National field, where long and difficult areas did not leave place for wrong shootings.
And if it wasn't enough just to fear the field, Mikkelson, Sunday, in the ninth battle, will face the "British Open" champion, Francesco Molinari, who has formed a team with beginner Tommy Fleetwood to win their four matches this week.
If the Americans, who have four points less, before the start of the 12 matches, are going to start wild, Mikkelson's game can turn out to be decisive.
Furyk expressed faith in his player, even though he could not say more than that.
"He fully understood the role he had today, gave me a sword strike, threw my hand into my neck and told me it would be ready tomorrow," Furyk said.
"He has great faith in himself.
He's at the Famous Hall, and he's made a lot of contributions for these teams last week, and for this week.
I probably didn't think he'd play two games.
I had thought more, but in the end it worked out that way and we thought it was the solution.
He wants to be in the field, like anyone else."
On Sunday, Mickelson will pass Nick Faldo's record for the player with more performances in Ryder Cup matches.
He can mark the end of his career at Ryder Cup, where he hasn't been at the height of his individual performances.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven balances, even though Furyk said his presence brings value to the team.
"He's a gesmer, sardistic, stubborn, he likes to bother people, and he's a fantastic boy to have in the team's room," he explained.
"I also think that the younger players were enjoying dealing with him during this week, and this was fun to see.
He gives more than just games."
Captain of Europe, Thomas Bjorn knows that big headway can disappear very soon
Thomas Bjorn, the head of Europe, knows from experience that the considerable headway ahead of the last day of the games in Ryder Cup can turn into a negative factor.
Denise made his debut in 1997 in Valderama, where a team with Captain Seve Ballesteros had a five-point head against Americans and closed the tournament by winning a very close difference, 1411⁄2-131/2.
"It reminds itself that we had a big head in Valderama; we had a big head in Brooklyn, where we lost, and in Valderama where we won but with many difficulties," said Bjorn, who was photographed after winning 5-3 in the 'Class 2018' Friday and tomorrow to head 10-6 in the 'Le Golf National'.
So the story tells me and everyone on that team that it's not over.
Tomorrow we'll go with the last March.
We'll go there and do the right thing.
Nothing's done until we get the points on the table.
We have a goal, we're trying to win this trophie, and here's our focus.
I've been saying it all the time, I'm focused on the 12 players we've got in the team, but we're aware of who we're facing -- the best players in the world."
Satisfied with the performance of his players in a difficult golf field, Bjorn added: "I don't want to rush in this phase.
Tomorrow we'll face another "response".
Tomorrow they see individual performances, and that's something else to do.
It's great when you're in the field with a partner, when things go well, but when you're alone, then you're testing your full capacity as a golf player.
This is a message you have to turn to players, and tomorrow you have to give the best out of yourself.
Now, forget the partner because he has to go and give the best of himself."
In contrast with Bjorn, opponent Jim Furyk will hope that his players will perform better individually than with partners, where only Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas will take three of the four possible points.
Furyk himself has experienced two major returns on the last day, being part of the winning team in Brooklyn before losing what is considered "Mreculia in Medina" by the European team.
"Remember every word," when asked how he had motivated his players during the last day, Captain Ben Crenshaw in 1999.
"We have 12 important battles tomorrow, but we must have a good start, as I saw in Brooklyn and Medina.
When he takes his seat on one side, he puts a lot of pressure on the middle.
We set the training based on this and we'll get the boys out of the order we believe is better, as soon as you understand, we're trying to make a miracle tomorrow."
Thomas has the duty to begin the results review and will face Rory McIllroy in the main contest, while Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter with European players in the first half of the order
"I chose this group and in this order that I believe it covers all the way to the contest," Bjorn said about his previous elections.
Reproducing the New German War
The new German Navy fleet should have been sent in 2014 to replace the cold wartime wars, but local media have reported not yet ready for the next year because of problem systems and high costs.
The launch of "Rheinland-Pfalz", the main ship of the new "Baden-Wertemberg-class", has been launched until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper "God Zeit" quoted by a military spokesman.
The Goddess must have joined Marine in 2014, but the post-transmission problems have damaged the ambition of the ambitious project.
Four vessels of type Baden-Wertemberg-class, which were commissioned by the sea in 2007, will serve as replacements of old Bramen-class cargoes.
The media will include a powerful top, a series of anti-aircraft and anti-aircraft rockets and steelt technology, such as radiation reduction, red and acoustic waves.
Some of the other important characteristics include longer periods of maintenance - should be possible so that new expenses can be transferred for more than two years from the country’s ports.
However, further delays mean that recent technological struggles - which are said to enable Germany to reflect foreign power - will be outdated at the time of their entry into service, wrote 'God Zeit'.
The F125's "dangerous" flag came out last year, when the German Navy officially rejected the order for this ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss coastal office in Hamburg.
This was the first time Marina returned a ship to her construction site after her release.
A little information was given about the reasons for the return, but the media in Germany cited them as a series of "big defects in software and hardware" that made the ship useless during a war mission.
The programme problems were particularly important in Baden-Wertemberg-class ships because they will be operated by a 120 marine team - half of the old "Bremen class" crew force.
It was also discovered that the ship was superior, which reduced its performance and limited marine capacity to further improvements in the future.
"Rheinland-Pfalz" of 7,000 tonnes is believed to be twice the weight of similar category ships used by Germans in World War II.
In addition to the physical parts of the problem, the cost of the whole project — including the training of peers — is also becoming a problem.
It is said that it's reached a figure to leave without a word of $3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) - of €2.2 billion that was initially predicted.
The problems that have gripped new barriers become particularly important after recent warnings that German maritime power is being reduced.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament Protection Committee, admitted that Marines are "extended enough ships to be moved to another country."
The officer said the problem was increased over time because old ships were removed from use but were not replaced by new ones.
He unfortunately said none of Baden-Wuertemberg's new frescoes would be able to join the Navy.
The National Trust Watches the Night’s Snare
A new research carried out by a company in Scotland’s tall areas is aimed at discovering how night cats use their land to hunt for food.
It is hoped that new discoveries will shed new light on the conduct of the single flying giants and will help protective measures in the future.
A study by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland will follow the usual night lacheries and so-called so-called soprano pitistreles as well as the sheep-catches and daubington lacres in Inverwe gardens, in Western Ross.
Special registration areas will be placed at key points throughout the area to monitor nightlife activities throughout the season.
The NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct field studies using hand detectors.
The analysis of the sounds that will be performed by experts for all records will determine the frequency of the sounds of the night lachers and what each species does.
Then a report and a map of their home will be drawn to give a detailed overview of their conduct.
Rob Dewar, Nature Protection Advisor for NTS, hopes that the conclusions will show which habitats are most important for nightlife hunters and how they are used by each species.
This information would help determine the benefits of local administration, such as the creation of cobalts and how forests are preserved for nightlife and other species associated with them.
The number of nightlifes in Scotland and the United Kingdom has decreased dramatically over the past century.
They are under threat of buildings and developmental jobs that have an impact on the environment and the loss of housing.
Wind turbines and wind turbines may also be at risk, as shown by rising letters or chemical components of construction materials, as well as attacks on domestic animals.
In fact, the nightlifes aren't dirty.
However, because of their nightly search habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to waiting.
They use sophisticated techniques to find location through sounds to accurately identify insects and obstacles during flight.
The NTS, which is responsible for caring for more than 270 historical buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 acres of land in the country, takes very seriously with nightlife.
There are ten trained experts who conduct regular studies, verbal inspections, and sometimes include rescue programs.
The organization has even established the first and only reserve in Scotland dedicated to nightlifes in Three, Dumfries and Galloway, which serve as home for eight out of ten species of nightlifes in Scotland.
The administrator of these reserves, David Thompson, says this country is an ideal territory for them.
"Here in Therave we have a great area for night-care lovers," he said.
"We have old buildings, many ancient trees and all the right housing.
But there's still a lot of things about nightlifes that remain unknown, so the work we do here and elsewhere will help us understand more than they need to "development."
He stresses the importance of carrying out night-care checks before carrying out property maintenance operations because there is the possibility that the sudden destruction of a leaf could kill up to 400 female and young bats by destroying the entire population of a area.
Nightlifes are protected, and their killings, assaults, and disturbances or their words are illegal.
Elizabeth Ferrell, while working at the night’s Laquirins Trust, encourages people to become part of the relief team.
She said, "We still have a lot to learn about our kids at night and many of our species, we just don't know how their people are moving."
Ronaldo rejects prosecutions while lawyers prepare to accuse the German magazine
Christian Ronaldo said the charges against him are "false knowledge," saying that people "want to promote themselves" using his name.
His lawyers are determined to accuse the German newspaper 'Der Spiegel', which published these charges.
Portuguese and Juventus Sulmire has been charged with the involvement of an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
On Friday, Der Spiegel reported that he was later alleged to have paid her $375 000 to avoid talking about the incident.
Speaking in a live video in Instagram, directed by 142 million of his followers, only a few hours after these allegations were published, Ronaldo, 33 years old, considered the reports "false news."
"No, no, no, no, no.
What was said today, false news," said the winner of the Art Top five times before the camera.
"They want to promote themselves using my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous by saying my name, but this is part of the job.
I'm a happy man and everything's going well," added the player, smiling.
According to Reuters, Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to accuse 'Der Spiegel' of these charges, which they have called "impossible reports of doubts about private life'.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player will seek compensation for "the moral values that correspond to the seriousness of corruption, which may be one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
The alleged incident is reported to have occurred in June 2009, in a suite of Palms Hotel and Kazino in Las Vegas.
According to documents presented at the Clark District Court, Nevada, after meeting at a club at night, Ronaldo and Mayorga are said to have gone to the player's room, where he is alleged to have spent it in the anus.
Majorga claims that Ronaldo went into a coma after the alleged incident and said "99 per cent" he is a "good boy" who is left behind by "one per cent."
The document says Ronaldo confirms that both had sexual relations but that it was with both sides.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and that she had photos of her injuries in a hospital, but later she agreed on a solution outside the court because she was "brought to trial" and was concerned that she would "publicly be tortured."
The 34-year-old says he's now trying to get the deal back because it's still traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was near the connection with Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged attack, and this wine passed to the Italian Yuventus giants in an agreement of 100m euros.
Brexit: The United Kingdom 'will Be Always Repentant' for losing the status of car manufacturers
The United Kingdom "will always be forgiven" if it loses the status of world leader in the production of cars after Brexit, Secretary for Business Greg Clark said.
He added that it was "anxious" that Toyota in the United Kingdom had told the BBC that if Britain would leave the EU without an agreement, the company would temporarily stop production at its factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that the impact of delays on the border, in case of an agreement-free exit, would cost the loss of jobs.
The factory in Burnaston, which produces models Toyota Auris and Avensis, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% were exported to other European Union countries.
"In my judgment, if Britain comes out of the EU at the end of March, we will stop production at our factory," said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's administrative director in Burnaston.
Other EU car manufacturers, such as Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have voiced fear of leaving the EU without agreement and how cross-border trade will work.
For example, BMW said that after Brexit would close her Mini series factory for a month.
Main concerns are related to what car manufacturers refer to as the risk of the delivery chain in the case of an unaccompanied Brexit.
Toyota's production line works on the basis of "now only passports," with a portion coming every 37 minutes from suppliers from the EU and the EU, for standard cars.
If, on March 29, the EU comes out without an agreement, there may be delays within which this industry can lead to delays and shortcomings.
It would have been impossible for Toyota to keep her factory in Derbyshire more than one day's inventory, the company said, and in turn production would stop.
Mr. Clark said that Theresa May's 'Checkers' plan for future EU relations "is specially designed to avoid these border controls."
"We need a deal. We want to have the best deal that will allow us not only to enjoy the success of the moment but also to take advantage of this opportunity," he said for today's program on BBC Radio 4.
"The data, not only from Toyota but also from other producers, show that we must be incapable of continuing what has been a very successful supply chain."
Toyota could not determine how long it would stop production, but in the long run, warned that increased costs would undermine the competitiveness of the factory and would lead to reduced jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working in Burnaston for 24 years and who is a senior U.S. union official at the factory, said members are becoming increasingly concerned: "My experience is that when these jobs are closed, they don't come back.
A government spokesman said, "We have set up a comprehensive and reliable plan for our relationship with the EU in the future."
The Trump meeting with Rosenstein can be resumed, says the White House
Donald Trump's high-level meeting with general deputy attorney Rod Rosenstein can "bet even for a week" after the war continues for High Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh said on Sunday the White House.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special adviser Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russia's electoral interventions, relations between Trump and Russia's auxiliary staff and the possibility that the president has prevented justice.
The discussion whether Trump will download or not the general deputy attorney from duty, thus risking Mueller's independence, is something that has created statements for months in Washington.
Earlier this month, New York Times reported that Rosenstein took into account the position of a spokesman to record talks with Trump and the President's possibility of downloading it through Amendment 25.
Rosenstein denied this news.
But last month, he went to the White House, among the reports that he was near the delivery.
By the way, a meeting with Trump was announced on Thursday, which was held at the United Nations headquarters in New York.
Trump said "it would be preferable" not to take Rosenstein away but after the meeting he added to avoid payment to the hearing session held by the Senate's judicial committee, where Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-day investigation by the FBI on charges against Kavanaugh, further putting the full vote in the Senate.
Trump's press secretary Sarah Sanders was present today at Fox News Sunday.
When she asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said, "It's not yet a date, it can be this week. I think it can be added another week, taking into account everything else that's going on with the Supreme Court.
But let's see, and I always like to keep the pressure up to date."
Some journalists may object to this statement: Sanders has not held a press conference in the White House since September 10.
Moderator Chris Wallace raised the question why.
Sanders said the lack of press conferences did not result from the dissatisfaction with TV journalists," even though she said, "I will not deny the fact that they draw attention."
Later, it will be understood that direct contact between Trump and the press will be increased.
"The president realizes more quality assurance sessions than any other president before him," she said, adding, without citing the data: "We have seen these figures."
There will continue to be a press conference, Sanders said, but "if the press has the opportunity to ask the President of the United States directly, then this is much better than how much you talk to me.
We're trying to do this often, and you've seen that we've often done it over the last few weeks, replacing press conferences in cases where you can talk to the president of the United States."
Trump regularly accepts questions when he leaves the White House or when he attends an open session or at a press conference with important personalities.
Individual press conferences are rare.
The president may have explained the reason for this fact, during this week, in New York, where he made a controversial statement and in some strange cases, in front of the journalists.
Health Secretary wrote workers from the EU in NHS Scotland about the fear of Brexit
The Health Secretary has written EU staff working in the NHS in Scotland to express his gratitude on behalf of the country and his desire to remain after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, has sent a letter, after they have been away from the EU for less than six months.
The Scottish government has already taken over covering the application costs for permanent residence status for EU citizens working in public services at local level.
In her letter, Mrs. Freeman wrote: "During the winter, negotiations have continued to move away from the EU, drawing closer to taking a decision in the year.
However, the MB government has also intensified its preparations in the event of an agreementless scenario.
I know it's a pretty stressful time for all of you.

Christion Abercrombie is subjected to an emergency surgical intervention after brain damage
Tennessee State Tigers Christion Abercrombie's founder signed an immediate surgical intervention after the damage to his head on Saturday, in the loss of 31-27 against Vanderbilt Commodores, reported The Tennessee journalist Mike Organ.
Tennessee State Rod Reed trainer told reporters that the damage occurred shortly before the first part.
"She came to the anesthetist and fell there," said Reed.
Trainers and medical personnel gave Abercrombie oxygen in the aneurysm before they placed it in the barrel and sent it for further examinations.
A Tennessee State official told WSMV Chris Harris in Nashville that Abercrombie had completed surgery at Vanderbilt Hospital Centre.
Harris added that "there is still no detail about the type/scale of damage" and Tennessee State is trying to figure out when the damage happened.
Abercrombie, the second year's student, is in his first season with Tennessee State after being transferred from Illinois.
He made five interviews on Saturday before leaving the game, bringing it to 18 total number of interviews during the season.
Foreign buyers will pay higher taxes when they buy a property in the MB
Foreign buyers will pay higher taxes for the purchase of a property in the EU, and state funds will be used to help cleanse people according to the new plans of the Conservative Party (Tory)
This move will neutralize the success of Corby's initiative to attract new voters
The unemployment rate will apply to those who don't pay taxes in MB
The treasure department plans to collect up to 120 million GBP per year to help the homeless
Theresa May will today announce that foreign buyers will pay higher taxes for the purchase of a property in the EU and state money will be used to help clean people.
This movement will be seen as an attempt to neutralize Jeremy Corby's success in attracting new voters with promises to offer more enduring strains and to "subscribe" high-performance people.
Employment tax will apply to individuals and firms who do not pay taxes in the MB, while state funds will support the government's initiative to combat the lack of housing.
This extra rate - which is added to the current employment rate, including the increase in the level of the salary presented two years ago for the second house and for the property purchased for rent - can go up to three per cent.
The Treasury Department predicts that this movement will group up to 120 million GBP per year.
About 13 per cent of the last-constructed property in London is purchased by people with away from the MB, resulting in price increases and making it more difficult to find shelter from first-time buyers.
Many of the country's rich areas - especially in the capitals - have been turned into "pretty cities" because of the high number of foreign exchanges that spend most of their time abroad.
This new policy comes only a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in employment tax to help young people buy their first home.
He accused large construction firms of maintaining high prices by buying land but not using it, and called on women. May he remove his hand from the quotas for affordable houses, with a view to settling "the British storm with property."
Mr. Corbyn has proposed some exciting reforms for the promotion, including the control of theft and the removal of "no reason".
He also wants to give more power to advice on building new houses.
Mr. May said: "Last year I declared that I would devote the Prime Minister's mandate to the restoration of British dreams - so, for a better life for every new generation.
And this means we can fix the problem of the house market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work, and build a life here.
However, it is not right for individuals who do not live in the United States and foreign societies to buy houses rather than British workers.
For many people, the dream of owning a house has made something too difficult to achieve, and injustice against the innocent is more real."
Jack Ross: 'My biggest ambition is to train Scotland'
Sunderland coach Jack Ross says "his biggest ambition" is to become a coach of Scotland in a given phase.
Scotland, 42 years old, is experiencing the challenge of raising the north-west club, currently located in the third country in League One (third category), three points away from the head.
He came to the Light Stadium this summer after he returned to St. Mirren in the Premier League of Scotland last season.
"I wanted to play for my country as a player.
It was once presented to representative B and only so," Ross said for BBC Scotland Sportsound.
"But as a child I grew up seeing Scotland many times in Hampden with my father, and it's something that has always attracted me.
However, this option will only come if I'm successful in leading the clubs."
Ross's parents in the direction of Sunderland include Dick lawyers, David Moyes, Sam Allardice, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Former Alloa Athletic coach says he is not worried that he is following the steps of these great names in such a large club, after he has previously rejected offers from Barnesley and Ipswich Town.
"For the moment, my success will depend on the fact that 'can I return this team to the Premier Law?'
Taking into account the structure and environment of this club, it is unlikely that it has its place in the Premier Law," he said.
"It's not a simple duty to go there, but I'd see myself as successful only if I could get back to the Premier Law Club."
Ross has only three years started his career as a coach after a period as an assistant coach in Dumbarton and a 15-month period in the Hearts leadership station.
Then he helped Alloa develop a higher category up to the third round of the cup, and transformed St. Mirren from a club near the fall from the category into the winners of the Championship title next season.
And now, Ross says he feels better than he ever felt during his career as a player at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"Perhaps it was really a turning point," he says, for taking Alla's direction.
"I really believed that training was the right thing for me, more than being a player.
It looks strange because I played well, I made a good life thanks to this profession, and I enjoyed some good achievements.
But being a player can be difficult.
You have to live a lot, every week.
Once again, I experience much stress and pressure from work, but training seems to be the right thing to do.
I've always wanted to train and now I've been doing something like this.
Full interview can be heard on Sunday, in Sportsound, on September 30, on Radio Scotland from 12:00 to 13:00 BST
According to one study, the perfect time "to drink a beer" is Saturday at 5:30 a.m.
The summer’s heat wave has increased local incomes in difficult situations in Britain, but it has increased pressure on restaurant stores.
The data show that sales in local and colour groups increased by 2.7 per cent in July - but restaurants bought by 4.8 per cent.
Peter Martin, a business consultant at CGA, who accumulated the data, said: "The continued season with the sun as well as England's participation in the world's Cup was more than expected to influence the adjustment to follow the same trend as June, where local sales increased by 2.8 per cent, while restaurants recorded even higher decline.
I drove to the restaurant with 1.8% in June, and it got even more upset in July.
Bars and locals with major activities for the supply of drinks recorded the best performance, with higher increases than the reduction of trade in restaurants.
The main areas of activity also recognized the decline as a result of the sun’s rising sun, although not as significant as the restaurants.
Looks like people just want to get out for a drink.
Sales of drinking in bars and locals increased by 6.6 per cent that month, while food fell by three per cent."
Paul Newman, a free time analyst and host at the RSM said: "These results confirm the trend we have seen since the end of April.
When it comes to sales on the domestic market, fashion and impact of important social or sports events remain the main factors.
It is no wonder that restaurant groups continue to experience difficulties, although a decline in sales of 4.8 per cent per cent per year will have a particularly serious burden in view of the continued cost pressure.
The long and hot summer could not come at a more difficult time for food operators and the time will show if the average temperatures of the August will give the most loving calm."
The total increase in local and restaurant sales, including those released, was 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting the slowdown in the launch of the markets.
The Coffer Peach Index of Industry Sales Tracking for the Color and Restaurants sector in the MB, collects and analyzes data from 47 companies, totalling more than 9 billion GBPs, and is the industry reference point.
One in five children have secret figures in the social media that hide their parents
According to one study, one out of five children — some of whom are not over 11 years of age — have secretly counted on the social media that conceals parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 nine-year-old students showed an increase in Insta's false profiles
This news has increased the fear of postage stamps with sexual content
Nine percent of the students said they had a "principal" figure that they told their parents
One out of five children - some of whom are no longer 11 - year - olds - are developing statistics on social media, which use adult media.
A survey of 20,000 nine-year-old students showed rapid growth in Insta's "false profiles" - linked to the page for the distribution of photos, Instagram.
This news has increased the fear of postage stamps with sexual content.
Nine percent of the students said they use a clean "principal" account that shows their parents, but they also have private accounts.
A mother, who accidentally discovered her 13-year-old daughter's secret account, discovered that a teenager urged others to "stop."
The U.S. Digital Avarences Study and the Headmasters and Headmasters Conference of Independent Schools (HMC) found that 40 per cent of the group 11 to 18 had two profiles, and half of them admitted that they had secret figures.
HMC Chief Mike Buchanan said: "It's disturbing that so many teenagers are tempted to create social spaces where parents and teachers can't find them."
Elid Doyle will be "the voice of athletes" on the Scotch Atlantic board
Elid Doyle is elected on the Atlantic board in Scotland, in the executive post of this governing body, during the annual meeting of the general assembly.
Doyle is the most famous Scoceze athlete of the races and fields and leader Ian Beattie described this decision as a great opportunity for all sports leaders to benefit from her extensive international experience over the past decade.
"Elyde enjoys massive respect in the athletic community in Scotland, the MB and in the world and we are sure that athletic in Scotland will benefit greatly by making it part of the board," Beattie said.
Doyle said, "I'm excited that I'm going to serve as an athlete's voice, and I hope I'll contribute and help in the direction of sport in Scotland."
The American, who won the 200 - foot [200 m] and 400 - foot [400 m] race in 1996 Games in Atlanta, with four Olympic art medals in total, who is a regular expert in BBC, lost the ability to follow a temporary ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: "A month ago I had an attack.
I can't go.
The doctors said it would only be time to tell him if I'm going to get better and to what extent.
You had to do some rehabilitative work, but here I was fully recovered, and I learned to walk again, and today I am making military service!
Thank you for encouraging messages!"
The advertising of the railway bomb that compares mothers to wolves brings public opinion
A company for the production of railway pumps has shared public opinion with a commercial that compares mothers who play with cattle ’ method.
To start promoting what is considered "the first generation pump in the world without noise and which can be worn," the company of consumer technology products Elvie showed a gasm music video to advertise the freedom that this new pump of mothers need to express freely.
Four real moms dance in a table filled with beer under the voice of a song with text like this: "Yes, I'm wearing myself, but I don't have it" and "If you hadn't noticed, these aren't my nose, it's my nose."
The refresher continues: "The pumps, the pumps, the food of the baby, the pumps, the pumps, the midwife."
However, advertising, published on the Facebook page of the firm, has caused online debate.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received friendly reactions from viewers, with many of them saying it underestimates the "seas" of the dairy industry.
"The use of cattle to advertise this product is a very weak decision.
Just like us they should be "born" and "born" to produce bones, only their "birth" takes from them a few days after birth," someone wrote.
Elvie's pipe pump is placed inside the recipes and doesn't look like Elvie/Mother.
Another commented: "It's almost traumatic for the mother and the child.
Why don't we use you to advertise a fire pump for mothers who can keep their babies?"
Someone else added, "What unsensitious advertisements."
Others supported the commercial, including a woman who admitted that the song looked "to be funny."
"I think this is a general idea.
I'd have bought one if you'd still feed the kid with giraffes.
The pump made me feel like a cow.
The commercial's a little crazy, but I saw what it meant.
This is a general product," someone wrote.
Another commented: "This is a gas commercial directed to mothers who use the pump (often at work or in toilets) and feel like "loop."
This is not a commercial that values or judges the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, the group of women shows that they've all danced with the "secret" pump placed in the recipes.
The concept behind this campaign is based on the fact that many women who use live pumps are said to feel weak.
However, Elvie’s pump is free of charge, there is no rope or tube, it is placed inside the recipes, and it does not fall into the eye, giving women the freedom to move, hold their babies, and even get out while they use them.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD (Creative Executive Director) at Mother commented: "Pompa Elvis is a so revolutionary product as it deserves a courageous and provocative promotion.
By making a parallelism between women who want to express themselves freely and petals, we wanted to take note of the use of the spring pump and the challenges they face, as well as in a fun and similar way of expressing the extraordinary sense of freedom that gives the new pump.
This isn't the first time the Elvie pump came out.
During the fashion week in London, a mother of two children appeared at the styleist Marta Jacubowski parade using the product.
Hundreds of immigrant children have been smuggled into a concentration camp at the border of Texas
The number of banned immigrant children has increased although the number of months of border crossings has remained relatively the same, partly as the consequence of the rhetoric and strict policies presented by the Trump administration that have made sending children to their support difficult.
Usually, most supporters have even been immigrants without documents, and they have been afraid to risk their position rather than trying to apply for a child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential supporters and other adults of the same family would have to give fingerprints, and these data would also be passed on to immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior officer of the Immigration and Dogan Agency, witnessed before Congress that the agency had arrested ten persons who had applied for unaccompanied bribes.
Later, the agency confirmed that 70 percent of the arrested persons had no previous criminal records.
"About 80 per cent of the individuals who are supporters or family members of the supporters reside in the country illegally and a large part of them are foreign to previous penals.
So, we're still following these individuals," Mr. Albence said.
According to law enforcement officials, trying to speed up the work of children’s data, officials presented new rules that some of them requested to appear in court within a month of the ban, not after 60 days, as was the previous standard.
Many of them will be presented before immigration judges through video conferences and not physically, to argue their request for legal status.
Those who do not qualify will be deported immediately.
According to stress workers and reports from the system in recent months, as long as children remain under ban, there is a greater risk of anxiety or depression, which can lead to violent explosions or attempts to rescue them.
Supporters say these concerns are more serious in view of a larger environment like Tornillo, where, because of size, there is more likely to be differentiation of signs showing that a child has difficulty.
They add that children's move to the city without enough time to prepare emotionally or to say good-bye to their friends can cause trauma that many of them already experience.
Syria calls for US, French and Turkish forces to withdraw immediately
During his speech at the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moulam also called on Syrian refugees to return home, even though the country's war has already taken place in the eighth year.
Moulalem, who also holds the post of Deputy Prime Minister, stated that foreign forces reside in the Syrian land illegally, with the assumption that they are fighting terrorism, and that "they will work with them in the right way."
"They should withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he said during the assembly.
Moulalem insisted that "the war against terrorism is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360 000 people have been killed since 2011, and millions of others have been displaced from their homes.
He said Damascus will continue "to fight in this holy war until we have cleansed all Syrian territories" both by terrorist groups and by "unlawful foreign forces."
The United States has about 2000 bodies in Syria, which mainly train and advise Kurdish and Syrian Arab forces against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops in the territory of this country separated from the war.
On the refugee issue, Moualem said that conditions are good for them to return, and he accused "some Western countries" of "absorption of irradiation" that forced refugees to stay away.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate their return," he said.
"They are politicizing a matter which must be entirely humanitarian."
The United States and the European Union have warned that they will not offer aid for Syria's reconstruction until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a neutral zone in the latest strength of the rebels in Idlib has created an opportunity to move forward with political discussions.
The Russian-Turkey agreement avoided a large-scale attack by Russian-based Syrian forces in this province, where three million people live.
However, Moulalem submitted that the agreement had "clear instructions" and expressed faith that military attacks would mark the JJJ, including fighters from Front Nusra related to Al-Qaeda, who "will be destroyed."
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to call soon the first meeting of a new committee made up of government members and opposition to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and expand the way for the elections.
Moulalem outlined conditions for the government's participation in this committee, saying that the panel's work should be limited to "reducing the current constitution's tires," and warned that there was no interference.
Why Trump's gonna get a second command
According to this logic, Mr. Trump will be resolved in 2020 beyond the cases when, as many people hope in liberal views, accusations and scandals end his presidency early.
In what would undoubtedly have been "the most dramatic creation of a president in history!"
So far, there's no sign of eyeliding.
Since 2014, the number of viewers during the peak hour has doubled to 1.05 million in CNN and has nearly tripled to 1.6 million in MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers during the peak hour, of 1.7 million who were four years ago, while the MSNBC program, "The Rachel Maddow Show", has reached the peak of the rating of cable channels with 3.5 million viewers during the evenings with major events.
"This is a fire to which people turn away because it's something we don't understand," said Neal Baer, director of the ABC drama series "Designed Survivor," which tells the story of a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack destroys Capitol.
Nell Scovell, an old comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys" Club, has another theory.
She recalls a taxi trip to Boston before the 2016 elections.
The driver said he'd vote for Mr. Trump.
Why? She asked.
He answered, "Because you make me laugh," said Mrs. Scowell.
There are fun values in chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on television, stories coming from Washington can determine the future of Roe v. Wade if immigrant families can join together and the health of the global economy.
Disfellowshipping is a struggle that only privileged observers can face.
However, if he finds himself after six hours looking at a panel of experts discussing the use of "peaceful information" by Bob Woodward in his book "Fair," Paul Manafort's leather bomber jacket, worth $15,000 ("a proud dress," said The Washington Post) as well as the implications of the vivid descriptions of Stormy Daniels, for Mr. Trump's anatomism, then this goes beyond being a informed citizen.
At least I'll never see Super Mario in the same way.
"A part of what he does and makes it look like a 'reality show' is that he eats you with something every night," said Brent Montgomery, executive director of Wellhouse Entertainment and creator of "Pown Stars," related to actors who circling and the daily developments of the Trump program (debates with N.F.L., compliments to Kim Jong-un).
You can't leave an unprecedented episode or stay back.
When I went to Mr. Fleiss this week, the time was with the sun and the temperature outside was 80 degrees, outside his house in the north coast of Kuwait, but he was hidden inside, seeing MSNBC, while he was registering CNN.
It was not possible to leave, not while Brett Kavanaugh would meet with the Senate's Judicial Committee and the future of the Supreme Court that belonged to the court.
"I remember when we carried out all those crazy programs in the past and people who said, "This is the last beginning of Western civilization," Mr. Fleiss said.
"I thought it was a joke but it turned out they were right."

Money from outside the private sector is placed in the closet for Congress elections
It is not surprising that Pennsylvania's 17th zone is facing a cash deficit, as a result of the reorganization of the electoral zones that forces two officials to work for the same post.
This recent reorganization of the Pittsburgh peripheral areas has established the democratic representative Conor Lamb - who won the post in another area, in the special elections, last spring.
Lamb is running against another candidate, Republican Keith Rothfus, who is currently representing the 12-year-old zone of Pennsylvania, which has been replaced by the 17th new zone.
This new division of maps came after the decision of the Pennsylvania High Court, which, in January, stated that the old areas had been designated in an irregular and unfair manner in favour of the Republicans.
This career, in the new 17th area, has also promoted strong efforts in the financing of campaigns by the party's main funding bodies, the Democratic Committee for the Congress (DCCC) and the National Committee of the Republic of the Fascati (NCRC).
Lamb became a famous name in Pennsylvania after a victory with close results in the follow-up special elections in March for the 18th election area of Pennsylvania.
For more than a decade, the post was held by the Republicans, and President Donald Trump won this area with 20 points of difference.
Political experts view democracy as a simple favor.
The US considers penalizing El Salvador for China's support, then withdraws
The diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already met Beijing, with little pressure from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a warm meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and owned a hotel in Panama until partners left the Trump's management team.
State Department officials decided to remove US diplomatic mission heads from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of "the latest sales to no longer known Taiwan," Department spokesman Heather Nauert said during a statement early this month.
But the penalties were examined only for El Salvador, which received some US$ 140 million aid in 2017, including for the control of drug abuse, development and economic support.
The proposed penalties involving reduced financial assistance and specific visa restrictions would be difficult for Central America's country and its high levels of unemployment and murder.
While internal meetings were making progress, North American and Central American officials urged a high-level conference focusing on security and economic well-being to follow a similar meeting last year, an action that was seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent immigrants from going to the United States.
But in mid-September, high officials of the administration made it clear that they wanted the conference to be held, giving them every opportunity to establish penalties for El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence has planned to hold a speech at the conference, which was scheduled in mid-October, a signal that shows the importance of the administration's cost for this meeting, diplomats said.
And three of the Americans returned peacefully from El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, without strong messages or punishment from Washington.
A White House official for Mr. Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate described by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats who agreed to talk about internal discussions, with a view to preserving their anonymity.
Their explanations were confirmed by an analysis by the administrator, who also spoke, seeking the right to anonymity.
Learn From God’s Word
The event of the order expected to happen could be the report of Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller on possible restrictions by Mr. Trump, for which there is considerable evidence in public data.
It is reported that Mr. Mueller is replacing his search to verify whether Mr. Trump has cooperated with Russia in the attack on our elections.
If Congress changes the country, Mr. Trump will have to report before this body, at a time when it is prepared to appear before the voters again, and perhaps it can be faced with an independent jury.
These are many if, and I don’t want to suggest that Mr. Trump’s fall or that of his counterparts in Europe is inevitable.
All of us, of course, need to make choices that will affect how long the conflict will last.
In 1938, German officials were ready to do the government against Hitler if the West would have resisted and supported Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We failed, and we lost the opportunity to avoid the years of the massacre that followed.
The course of history depends on these turning points, which speed up or slow down the relentless path of democracy.
At present, Americans are facing some of these turning points.
What will we do if Mr. Trump unloads Deputy General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the search warrants for Mr. Mueller?
Rosenstein has not been in a difficult situation since the newspaper reported last year that he had suggested to hide the president, as well as that he had been speculating that he was not fit to remain in office.
Mr. Rosenstein said The Times article wasn't accurate.
"How will we respond if the new investigation requested by the F.B.I. for Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or right- or if it is confirmed in the Supreme Court despite allegations of sexual assault and false testimony?
And above all, will we vote in the next elections for a Congress that will consider responsible Mr. Trump?
If we fail these tests, then democracy will face a long winter.
But I believe we will not fail because of the training I have received in Prague.
My mother was a Hebrew woman from Czechoslovakia, who was deported to Auschwitz from the same Nazi regime that hosted the embassy residence where I lived.
She survived, emigrated to the United States, and 60 years later she sent me to a table holding the swastika symbol (the broken cross).
Having this legacy, how can I not be optimistic about our future?"

Ranger player Graham Dorrans is optimistic before seeing Rapid Vienna
On Thursday, Rangers awaits Rapid Vienna knowing that a victory in front of the Austrians, after the Spanish winter comparison in front of Villarreal, earlier this month, would put them in a favourable position to qualify in Group G of the European Union.
An injury didn't allow Interfunctory Graham Dorrans to make the first presentation this season at the 2-2 fair to Villarreal, but he believes that Rangers can use that result as a push to achieve larger things.
"It was an important point for us because Villarreal is a good team," said the 31st-year-old.
"We went into the field believing we could get something and go out with a point.
We may have noted it eventually, but I generally believe that the comparison was a good result.
Maybe they were the best in the first part while we showed up in the second part and we were the best team.
On Thursday, it will be another big European evening.
I hope we can take three points but it will be a difficult fight because they have achieved a positive outcome in their previous fight, but with the fans who support us, I'm sure we can move forward and get a positive result.
Last year was very difficult, due to the injuries and changes in the club, but now there is a factor of optimism in this team.
The teams are good, and the boys are enjoying it very much; training goes well.
I hope we can move forward, throw the last season behind the arms, and succeed."
Women sleep less as a result of fear of pensions
Despite the clear idea that we wanted family members to be careful about it, few spoke to them about it.
About half of the individuals in the nationwide study said they were talking to their spouses about the long - term costs of care.
Only 10 percent replied that they were talking to their children about it.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they don't talk about it," said Holly Snyder, the deputy president of society for life insurance, Nationwide.
That's where we got to start.
Talk to your spouse and your children: You can’t prepare your family to take care of you if you don’t tell them your wishes.
Work with your counselor and your family and discuss where and how to benefit from care, since these choices may be an important factor in determining costs.
Take your financial adviser as well: The consultant can help you find a way to pay your expenses.
The options for financing long-term care include a traditional security policy for long-term care, hybrid life insurance policy to help cover these expenses or self-sustainment through your wealth - for how long you have money.
Prepare legal documents: Avoid legal battles through an authorization.
Take a health - care program and appoint a trusted person who will monitor your health care and ensure that experts are acting in harmony with your wishes if you are not able to communicate.
Consider, too, the acquisition of a prosecutor for your finances.
Choose a trusted person who will make financial decisions in your name and will guarantee the payment of bills if you cannot do so on your own.
Do not forget the details: Imagine that your elderly parent has a medical emergency and is on her way to the hospital.
Are you able to answer questions about allergies and medications you're taking?
Prepare a written plan with these details so that you will be ready.
"It's not only the financial aspect in the game, but also who are the doctors?" asked Martin.
"What medicines will be used?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
Prepare this plan."
A person is shot several times by air rifles in Ilfracombe
A man was shot several times with an air bag while he went home after he had spent the night out.
The victim, about 40 years old, was in Oxford Grove area, in Ilfracombe, Devon, when he shot himself in the knees, stomachs and hands.
Police officers declared this to be a "accident act", which took place about 02:30 BST.
The victim didn't see the aggressor.
The findings do not pose a risk to life, and the police are looking for witnesses.
Termination and Cuennament in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died as a result of a powerful earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Paul on Friday, while officials have declared that the number of dead is expected to increase.
With out-of-function communications networks, the staff of assistance have not been able to get information from Dodhra's regeneration, a region in the north of Palu, which was closer to the 7.5-ball earthquake epicenter.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people have been evacuated after this disaster.
Below are some facts about Paul and Dodhara, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the central Sulawesi province, which is located at the end of a narrow track on the western coast of the island of Sulawesi, with a population of approximately 379,800 inhabitants in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when it fell out of terror and hunger.
The bridge is a giant that extends more than 300 km (180 miles) along the coastal plain north of the island of Sulawesi.
Regenca, a smaller administrative region than the province, had a population of about 299,200 inhabitants in 2017.
Fishing and bloc are the main economic activities of the province, particularly in the coastal region of Doghera.
The release of the nickel is also important in the province, but it is mainly focused on Morowali, on the other side of the Sulawesi coast.
According to the Disaster Strike Agency in Indonesia, Palu and Dodhara have been hit several times by a tsunami over the past 100 years.
In 1938, a tsunami claimed the lives of over 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Doha.
In 1996, another tsunami hit the western part of Dodhra, causing nine victims.

Sarah Palin's eldest son was arrested on the charges of family violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of the former governor of Alaska and candidate for President Sarah Palin, has been arrested on the charge of aggression.
According to a report submitted on Saturday by Alaska's state police, Palin, 29 years old, by Vasilla, Alaska, was arrested as suspected of family violence, family violence control and arrest resistance.
According to the police report, when a woman, known as his, tried to call the police to report alleged crimes, he received the phone.
Paul is being held in Matt-Su's prison jail year and is being held a guarantee in the form of a $500-valued bond, KTUU reported.
According to reports on this network, he was presented to the courts on Saturday, and when asked about the admission of the offence, he said "it's absolutely innocent".
Paul is faced with three categories of A, which means he can be imprisoned up to a year and be fined with $250,000.
He is also charged with a decline in category B, which is punishable by one day in prison and 2000 dollars in prison.
It's not the first time they've been charged with criminal charges against Paul.
In December 2017, he was charged with attacking his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the attack.
This issue is currently being examined by the Veterans Court in Alaska.
In January 2016 he was accused of family violence, family violence report bans and armed robbery during the incident.
His beloved had claimed that he had hit him with a scratch in his face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin was criticised by veteran groups after linking her son's violent behavior with PTSD ( post-traumatic stress syndrome) as a result of service in Iraq.

The target hit the central part of Sulawesi, located in the north of the capital of Indonesia, Jakarta.
In social media they circle videos showing the moment of the attack.
Hundreds of people were gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when our dinner hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors are seeking a low death penalty for suspected terrorist attack in NYC
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect of the terrorist attack in New York City that killed eight people -- a rare punishment that has not been granted for a federal crime since 1953.
In October, Saipov, 30 years old, is supposed to have used a Home Depot wheel truck to carry out a terrorist attack on a road for bicycles along the western road, in lower Manhattan, crossing foothills and bicycles.
In order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors must confirm that Saipov has killed eight victims "in terms" and that he has caused serious body injuries "in terms of terms", according to a letter of intent to seek the death penalty set in the south corner of New York.
According to a court document, both charges can be sentenced to death.
A few weeks after the attack, a major federal jury filed Saipov 22 charges, including eight charges of murder in aid of organised crime, charges often used by prosecutors in organised crime cases, and a charge of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
This attack has come as a consequence of "a considerable and deliberate planning," the prosecutors said, describing the way the crime was executed by Saipov as "serious, cruel and moral."
"Sayfulello Habibullaevic Saipov caused pain, damage and loss to Diego Enrique Angelini's family and friends and friends Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnucci," wrote in the letter of intent.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since New York's southern circle was criminally following a death penalty case.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was sentenced to the murder of two drug suppliers but eventually was sentenced to eternal imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was used in a federal case in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were executed after being convicted of conspiracy and spying on the Soviet Union two years before the Cold War.
Both of them were executed in an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, with the Azerbaijani nation, did not show repentance during the days and months after the attack.
He has told the investigators that he feels good about what he has done, the police reported.
According to the record, Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack without ISIS videos on his cell phone.
The police said he had also asked to place the ISIS flame in his hospital room.
He said he's innocent for 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the public lawyers representing Saipov, said they are "very disappointed at the decision of the prosecution.
"We think that the decision to seek the death penalty and not the admission of eternal imprisonment without the possibility of appeal will increase the trauma caused by these events to all persons involved," Patton said.
Saipov's defence team had previously asked the prosecutors not to seek a death penalty.
The Conservative Party's MP says NIGEL FARGE should be placed in the head of Brexit's negotiations
Nigel Farage promised today, during a protest at a Conservative Conference, that it would "mobilize the people's army".
Former UKIP leader said politicians should "feel the pressure" of Eurosceptics - after one of those MPs Theresa May suggested he should be in the head of negotiations with the EU.
In March, Conservative President Peter Bone said in Birmingham that the MB would 'be out' if Brexit's secretary would be Mr. Farage.
But the challenge faced by Mrs May to join her group is taken into account by the Conservatives for EU position, who joined you in another protest in the city against Brexit.
The Prime Minister is making it difficult to implement the compromise plan reached in Switzerland, among attacks from those who want to stand or leave the European Union, as well as from the EU itself.
The allies insisted that she would try to reach an agreement with Brussels despite the harsh reactions - and would force Eurosceptics and labists to choose between her package and the trash".
During Largim's march, Largim means Mr. Bone said he wants to cancel the Chechers deal.
He suggested that Mr. Farage should come up with responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
'If he was in charge, now we'd be out,' he said.
Wellingborough added: 'I will support Brexit but we must cancel the Chequers agreement.'
Expressing his position against the EU, he said, "We didn't fight in the world wars to be subjugated.
We want to map our laws in our country."
Mr. Bone put down the suggestions that public opinion has changed since the 2016 vote: 'The idea that the British have changed their mind and want to stay in the EU is completely false.'
Conservative Andrea, who supports Brexit, was also on the march and said to journalists: 'I just want to say: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
'The Chequers agreement is not supported by the general public, the opposition won't vote, it won't even be supported within our party and by activists who fill the streets and vote for us.
Please leave Chechers and start listening.'
In a message directed to Mrs. May, she added, 'The ministers keep the job in cases when they keep their promises.'
Mr. Farage said during the march that politicians should "feel the pressure" if they are thinking of giving up the decision taken at the 2016 referendum.
'Now, this is a matter of faith between us -- the people -- and our political class,' he said.
They're trying to cheat Brexit, and we're here today to say, "We won't let you do anything like that."
During a message directed by the enthusiastic crowd, he added: 'I want you to force our political class, which is near Brexit's resignation, to feel the pressure.
"We are mobilizing the army of this country's people who gave us victory in Brexit and we will not stop until the United Kingdom is independent, proud and self-government."
In the meantime, they marched for the stand in Birmingham before holding a two - hour tube in the city center.
A small group of activists kept the banners written by Conservatives against Brexit after this group appeared at the end of the week.
The supporters of the Lord Adonis labists ironized with conservatives about the security problems they had with a "social application" at the beginning of the conference.
'These are people who tell us they can prepare IT systems and the technology necessary for "Canada plus" for open borders, for free trade with Ireland,' he added.
'It's totally a farce.
There's no such thing as good Brexit," he said.
Warren plans to ' carefully consider the possibility of candidate for presidents'
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren has said it will "discernately consider the possibility of candidates for presidents" after the November elections.
The Boston Globe reports that the Moscow's democratic senator spoke about her future during a meeting together, held on Saturday in western Massachusetts.
Warren, a continuing critic of President Donald Trump, is a candidate to be re-elected in November against Republican Geoff Diehl, who was co-director of the Trump campaign in 2016 in Massachusetts.
It was at the center of speculation that it could run in front of Trump in 2020.
The scheduled meeting on Saturday was her 36th meeting with the voters according to the joint format since Trump arrived at headquarters.
One of the participants asked her if she had planned to apply for the President.
Warren replied that the time has come for "women to go to Washington and regulate the corrupt government, and this also includes the decision of a woman in charge."
A person is arrested for killing LSU team player Wade Sims
The police at Baton Rouge, La., reported on Saturday that he arrested a suspect for the murder of basketballist Wade Sims on Friday.
Ditheon Simpson, 20, was arrested about 11 hours ago, reported police department in Baton Rouge, during a media conference.
The police had published a video on Saturday, Friday, asking for help to identify the person who appeared there.
Sims, 20 years old, was shot with a gun and killed at the South University campus during the morning of Friday morning.
"Wayde Sims changed his life as a result of the wounds caused by fire in his head," said for 247sports, chief of police officer Murphy J. Paul.
Wade intervened to protect his friend and shot Simpson.
Simpson took the question and admitted that he was in the situation, held his gun, and that he had shot Wade Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incidents and sent to the police department in the eastern area of Baton Rouge.
Sims, 6'6', played 32 games, 10 of which were titled, last season, with an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points, and 2.9 balls on the match table.
Russia's High Price: Lewis Hamilton approaches world title after team's instructions give him victory to Sebastian Vettel
Since Valtteri Bottas was qualified before Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that the guidance of the Mercedes team" would play a significant role in this process.
Bottas started from the first country and almost "guyed" Hamilton after protecting his position in the first two yards and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel was the first to make a stop and left Hamilton to guarantee "traffick" at the end of the car group, something that should have been decisive.
Mercedes stopped it later and positioned after Vettel, but Hamilton came out after some manoeuvres that forced Ferrari's pilot to leave behind behind behind a double movement to protect himself in the third floor.
Max Verstappen started the race from the last line and at the end of January on Saturday, on his 21st birthday.
Then he was in charge of a large part of the race after he didn't change his tires to get a quick finish and passed by Kimi Reikkonen on his fourth date.
Probably, he stopped in the 44th row but didn't get out to improve the rate in the eight left by leaving Raikkonen's fourth country.
It's a hard day because Valtteri did a great job all weekend and showed me a real gentleman I left last night.
The team has done an extraordinary job with these positions," Hamilton said.
Use Very Low Body Language
President Donald Trump ironized Senator Diane Feinstein during a poll on Saturday, related to her stand, that it was not the person who "brought into the store" Christine Blasey Ford's letter accusing the candidate for the High Court, Brett Kavanaugh, of sexual assault.
During a speech in a tube in West Virginia, the president did not directly refer to the testimony given by Ford before the Senate's Judicial Committee, but said what was happening in Senate showed that people are "lawless, evil and dishonest."
"The only thing that can happen and the beauty of what's happening in the Senate during the last days is when you look at the inathene, when you see people who are indifferent, wicked, evil and dishonest," he said.
"When you look at secret publications and then people say "Oh, I didn't.
I didn't do it."
Do You Remember?
Diane Feinstein, were you the one who took the letter out?
You remember her answer... have you taken the document-- "Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't get it out."
Wait a minute.
We didn't... no, we didn't," he said, imitating the senator.
In July, Feinstein was sent with details of the charges against Kavanaugh from Ford, and the document appeared earlier in September -- but Feinstein denied that the information had come out of her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's charges, I didn't take her story to the store," Feinstein told the commission, reported The Hill.
"She asked me to keep it secret, and I kept it like she asked me."
But it seems that her denial was unacceptable to the president, who commented during the debate on Saturday evening: "For my opinion, the finds were really ready to do so.
Maybe he didn't, but I've never seen the weakest finding before."
Taking into account the candidate for the High Court, which is accused by three women of sexual misconduct, the president said that Democrats are using alleged charges to achieve their goals.
"They are determined to regain power at all times.
They don't care who suffers, who should go to get power and control," Mediaite reported as the president said.

Air traffic controller loses his life by ensuring that hundreds of people on a plane survive the earthquake
A air traffic controller in Indonesia is being respected as a hero after he lost his life, ensuring that a plane with hundreds of people is safe.
Over 800 people lost their lives and many others were declared missing after a great earthquake hit the island of Sulawesi on Friday, thus causing a tsunami.
Strong waves continue to worry the area, and many people have reached out in the morning in the city of Paula.
However, although his colleagues kept him safe, 21-year-old Antonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post at the control tower that drove violently at Palu's airport "Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport".
He stayed to make sure that Batik Air's 6321 flight aircraft, which was on the bridge at the time, could begin safely.
Then he dropped out of the traffic control tower when he thought she was looking.
He lost his life later in the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia’s editor, Johannes Sirai, said the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, Australia’s ABC News reported.
We were preparing a helicopter from Balikpain to Kalimantan to take him to a bigger hospital in another town.
Unfortunately, he lost his life this morning before the helicopter arrived in Palu.
"This news touches our soul," he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that the number of deaths can reach thousands of people, while the local disaster relief agency says entry into the cities of Dodhara, Sig and Boothong is limited.
"It is believed that this number will continue to grow, since there are still many bodies under the roof, while others are not possible," said the Agency's spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
The Dallas that arrived to six meters have destroyed Palun, where on Friday a mass mass ceremony will be held.
Military and commercial aircraft are bringing supplies and aid.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, spoke for Sky News: "Ambulance brings body every minute.
There's no clean water.
The mini-markets are all over the place."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Creed in Indonesia, said to CNN: "The Red Creed of Indonesia is urging to help survivors, but we don't know what they'll find there.
It's already a tragedy, but it can be even more confusing."
Indonesian President Joko Vidodo arrived on Sunday in Palu and directed the country's army: "I'm asking you to work day and night to carry out all your evacuation duties.
And are you ready?" CNN reported.
Indonesia was hit by earthquakes last year in Lombok, where more than 550 people lost their lives.
A plane crash in Micronesia: "Air Niugini" now says a person has lost after a plane exploded into the lake
The airline that led a plane that flew into the Gulf of Micronesia has now revealed a missing person, since it had previously declared that all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the waterborne plane.
In a press statement, Air Niugini said on Saturday afternoon they are not finding a passenger.
The airline stated that it was cooperating with local authorities, hospitals, and investigators in an effort to find the person.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for further information on the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
The local boat helped save passengers and crew after the plane flew into the water by trying to sit down at Chuuk Island Airport.
On Friday, officials said that seven people were associated with the hospital.
The airline said that six passengers remained in the hospital on Saturday and that they were all stable.
The consequences of overcrowding and the resulting events remain unclear.
The U.S. Airline and Marine said the plane landed in the bay after the bridge had not been reached.
Some Witnesses thought that the plane had crossed the bridge.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane dropped very low.
"This is an extremely good thing," said Jaynes.
Janes said that through the water that had reached the peak level, he and the others managed to get out of the plane's emergency exits.
He said that the soldiers were panicking and shouting, while he was wearing a light towel on his head.
The American Navy said that mariners who were working on a scale near there helped save them by using an airship to transport people to shore before the plane sank some 30 metres (100 feet) below water.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network show that 111 people have lost their lives on the basis of the air lines registered in PNG over the past two decades, but "Air Niugini" was not included in any of them.
An analyst builds night time when a woman dies
On Saturday the prosecutor presented her arguments in the retrial of a person who was charged with burning a woman from Mississippi in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for several hours on the quality of an expert in the field of data analysis.
He explained to the jury how he had used phone data to rebuild the movement of the homeless, 29-year-old Quinton Tellis, and the victim, 19-year-old Jessica Chambers, the night that this last changed his life.
According to reports of The Clarion Ledger, Rowlett stated that he received location data from some cell phones that show Tellis was with Chambers on the day of her death, the fact that he threw down his previous claims.
When the data found that his cell phone was in the same place as Chambers's during the time he said it was happening to his friend Michael Sanford, then the police went to talk to him about it.
Sanford was brought before the courts on Saturday and testified that he was not in the city that day.
When you asked the prosecutor if Tellis was telling the truth when he said that night was in Sanford's truck, the last one said "he's lying because my truck was in Nashville."
Another misunderstanding is Tellis' statement, which said he had met Chambers about two weeks before she died.
Phone tables showed that they had only one week they knew each other.
Rowlett said that shortly after Chambers' death, Tellis had deleted messages, calls and contact data from his phone.
"He wiped it out of his life," said Hale.
For the sake of protection it is expected that He will show you His signs in the watches of the night.
The judge declared that the jury would take the decision on that day.

Another color man?!
I ran from New York to the couple to get out of work, after I get the "racist" message.
A woman from New York accused a couple of discrimination on leaving work, after she received a message that had been misdirected by a mother, who complained she was "another colourless man."
The couple have denied that they are racists, considering the case as "restraint."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, expressed her concern when she discovered that the new date Giselle Maurice was a colored woman, at the time she was presented on her first day of work in 2016.
"JOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO,otherotherOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOWOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
However, instead of sending her husband, she sent her Mrs. Maurice twice.
According to New York Post, after realizing her fault, Plasco-Flaxman, "feeling like a bike," said Mrs. Maurice, on the ground that their current date, which was African-American, had done a poor job and that instead, she wanted a Filipino.
Mrs. Maurice paid for her only day of work and then sent her home with a "cocket in jeep".
Now, Maurice is charging the two for retirement compensation, and she's looking for compensation at $350 a day for a six-month period for which she was hired, even if no contracts.
"I want to tell them they shouldn't do such things," she said on Friday for The Post, adding, "I know it's discrimination."
The couple have rejected claims that they are racist, saying that Maurice's departure was the right move, because they were afraid they couldn't believe it after they had offended him.
"My wife sent her something she didn't want to say.
She's not racist.
We're not racist," said co-director Joel Plasco for The Post.
"But will you leave the children in the hands of a person to whom you have been held captive, even though it is wrong?
Your son-in-law?
Tell me."
In view of the fact that he and his wife had brought up a child two months earlier and were in a "very difficult situation."
"Can you complain to someone in this situation?
It's not a positive thing to do," added Plasco, investment banker.
While the matter has gone to court, public opinion has quickly denounced the couple on social media, criticizing their behavior and logic.
A new letter shows that Paddington's publishers were afraid that readers would not be connected to a gold talk
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was received, said about this letter: "It's hard to put yourself in the place of someone who reads it for the first time before it was published.
We feel a great pleasure now that we have seen the extraordinary success of Paddington."
She said that her father, who had worked as a cameraman for BBC, before being inspired by a little bear bear to write the book for the child, would be surprised if his work would be rejected, adding that the 60-year-old publication of the book, the last year after his death, contained "Sorrow and Happiness".
As far as Paddington is concerned, which she identified as a "very important member of our family," she added that her father was very proud of success.
"She was a quiet person and I didn't cry," she said.
"Paddington was so real that it was the same as having a successful child: you feel proud to even though it's not exactly your success.
I think that's how he looked at Paddington's success.
Even though it was his creation and imagination, he always gave him credit to Paddington's character."
My daughter was changing her life, and I was forced to say goodbye by phone.
After her arrival, her daughter was rushed to the Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in New York, where doctors were trying to save her life but without results.
"Nad called me regularly to tell me that it was very serious, that she didn't think she would go out," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then I got a call from Nad who told me she would die within two minutes and I should say goodbye.
And that's what I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you very much.
We'll be together soon.
We'll be together.
The medications that had given her doctors to keep her heart at work were losing her effect and slowly getting out of her system.
She had died a while ago and now everything's "fucking."
I had to sit down and wait, knowing that this was happening.
I couldn't cry or cry because I was surrounded by family and people.
I should have been strong."
With the passing of time, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, oiling for the loss of her daughter, boarded a plane alongside other passengers who were unaware of what she was experiencing.
"No one knew," she said.
"I kept my head down and all the time I was suffering.
It's hard to explain, but during that flight I felt a great disappointment for Nad.
I felt that he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Women who keep their eyes on the snow post letters to prevent suicides in the rain
Two women who have lost loved ones as a result of suicide are working to prevent others from committing suicide.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have sent letters with inspiring messages in a wave at Wells as well as phone numbers that can call them for support.
Mrs. Davis was 13 when he began to suffer from depression and killed himself at the age of 18.
"I don't want no parent to feel the way I feel every day," she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45 years old, living in Lydney, said her son was a promising cook with a "english" smile.
"Everyone knew about his smile.
People always say that his smile tears down every room."
However, he quit his job before he changed his life, after it happened "at a really dark moment."
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, who was then 11 years old, was the one who found his brother after he committed suicide.
Mrs. Davis said, "I'm constantly worried that there'll be a dominant effect."
Mr. Davis created the letters, "that people know that there is someone who can help them and who can talk to them, even with a friend.
Don't sit alone - you need to talk."
Mrs. Humphreys, who has been friends with Mrs. Davies for many years, lost Mark, her 15-year-old partner, not long after his mother's death.
"She didn't say she felt upset, in depression or something else," she said.
"A few days before Christmas we noticed the change in behavior.
He was exceedingly upset on Christmas day - when the children opened their gifts, he didn't see them and did nothing."
She said his death was a major trauma for them, but they had to be relieved: "It's something that destroys the whole family.
We've been destroyed.
But we all have to go ahead and fight."

The future of Brett Kavanaugh depends on the fate of the spring after the start of the FBI's investigation
"I thought if we could give him something similar to what he was asking -- a limited investigation in time and in object -- maybe we could bring some harmony," said Mr. Flake on Saturday, adding that he was afraid that the committee "was working" among the many obstacles of the opponents.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want to search the FBI?
Their silence comes as a result of time.
The elections for Congress are only 5 weeks away, November 6 - if the Republicans do something wrong, as is expected, they will be very weak in their efforts to select the person they want in the highest court of the country.
George W. Bush called the senators, promising that they would support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Mr. Bush and through him met his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI issues her report?
It will be voted in Senate, where 51 republics and 49 Democrats are currently present.
It is still unclear if Mr. Kavanaugh could gather at least 50 votes in Senate, which would allow Vice-President Mike Pence to end this situation and confirm it to the Supreme Court.
Number of deserts in North Korea under Kim's direction
The number of deserts in North Korea has declined since Kim Jong came into power seven years ago, a South Korean legislator has declared.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the Ministry of the Union in South Korea, has stated that there have been about 1127 earthquakes last year - compared with 2706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said the main factors were stricter controls within the borders between North Korea and China as well as higher rates required by human being traffickers.
Penny hasn't made public comments.
Most North Koreans are underprivileged by South Korea.
Seoul has declared that over 30,000 people from North Korea have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean war in 1953.
Most of them go to China, which has the largest border length with North Korea and can easily pass through the DMZ between the two Koreas, which is protected from many forces.
China considers foreign deserters to be illegal and not as refugees and is often forced by force.
The relations between North and South Korea — which are technically still in war — have been significantly improved in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pennsylvania and their talks focused on late negotiations for denuclearization.
This meeting came after the historic June meeting, between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un, in Singapore, where they agreed, in general terms, to work for a Korean gun-free youth.
But on Saturday, North Korea's Foreign Minister, New Yong-ho, blamed US sanctions for lack of progress up to that time.
"Without faith in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and in these circumstances, there will be no chance that we, in a uniform way, will get the first cartoon," said Mr. New at a speech at the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelois calls Brett Kavanaugh "historic," and says he doesn't deserve to serve in the Supreme Court
The leader of the minority in the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, called the name of High Court Brett Kavanaugh "historic" and said that because of his temper, he was unable to serve in the High Court.
Pelosi made these comments on Saturday, during an interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I can't think that if a woman had ever brought such a thing, people would say 'historic'," said Pelos about her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate's Judicial Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh categorically denied the charges that he had sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his presentation, Kavanaugh was very worried and in some moments he almost screamed or "crushed his mouth" when he spoke about his family and the years of Gymnasium.
He accused democracies in a way that was expressed before the committee, calling charges against him "agrotic and coordinated attack on his figure", organised by liberals unaccompanied by Hillary Clinton's loss in 2016 presidential elections.
Pelois expressed his opinion that Kavanaugh’s testimony contained evidence that he could not serve in the Supreme Court, after she showed his condemnation of the Democrats.
"I think he punished himself with those statements and the way he attacked Clinton and Democrats," she said.
Pelosi hesitated to answer the question whether he would try to give Kavanaugh a movement of disbelief in the case of his appointment, and if Democrats win most of the countries in the House of Representatives.
"Let me tell you -- if he's not telling the truth before Congress or the FBI, then he's unqualified not only for the High Court but also for the court where he is now," Pelos said.
Kavanaugh is currently a court in the Court of Appeal in Washington.
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, he was concerned about Kavanaugh's decisions against the Transitional Care Act or about the Roe case against Wade, since he was considered a conservative judge.
At the sessions of his appointment, Kavanaugh avoided questions about whether he would enforce certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"It's not the time for a hysterical and united person to become a member of the court and expect us to say "Oh how good!" Pelois said.
And women should use it.
This is a fair verbal attack, the whole month of the year that they blow up, and it can't bring it to an end without crying.
"We're crying when we're upset," said Mrs. Steinem 45 years later.
"I don't think this is unusual.
She continued, "It helped me a lot, a woman who worked in a leading position, who said that she was also crying when she was upset, but she had set up a style that was how many times she started to cry, to tell the co-rapporteurs, "You can think I'm upset and so I'm crying.
But I'm actually upset."
Then she kept talking.
And I thought it was a brilliant idea."
Lots are a way to express anger, partly because they are completely misunderstood.
One of my most vivid memories from an old job, in an office where men were above me and where at one point I found myself crying from an uncontaminated ink, was the moment when a larger woman caught me for her mouth--a cold manager I always had some fear--and pushed me toward the stairs.
"Never let others see you crying," she said.
"They don't know you're mad.
They think you're upset, and they'll be glad they came out to bother you."
Patricia Schroeder, a Democratic member of the Congress from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart in his presidential candidates.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart found himself in the middle of an extramarital relationship on the board of a ship named "Monkey Business" and pulled out of the garage, Mrs. Schroeder, himself unannounced, realized that there was no reason why he didn't even think of running for presidents.
"This wasn't a well-weighted decision," she said, laughing, 30 years later.
"In the streets there were already seven other candidates, and the last thing they needed was a more candidate.
Someone called it "Seven Jacks" and "Seven Jacks."
Since the campaign was in its final stages, she had remained behind the fund collection, so she was convinced that she would not guarantee it had not been able to raise $2 million.
But it was a tough war.
She discovered that some of her supporters, who gave her 1,000 dollars to men, only $250.
"Don't they think I'm being put down?" she asked herself.
During his speech that he would not develop an official campaign, she was so satisfied with emotion — thanks to the people who supported her, angry with the system that it made it so difficult for her to raise money and voter segregation instead of delegates, and inasmuch as she was killed by sexism.
"See if I've had a nervous crisis," recalled Mrs. Schroeder, related to how the press responded to her.
"See how Kleinex was my sponsoring company.
Do I remember thinking what people would write on my gravestone?
"That cry"?
The advantages of the US-China Trade War for Beijing
The first barriers to trade between the US and China were disturbing, while the war is far from over, a gap between the two countries may benefit Beijing in the long term, experts say.
US President Donald Trump issued the first warning at the beginning of this year, setting taxes on the main Chinese export goods, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most sensitive deviation was what happened this week when the new rate reached the currency worth 200 billion dollars (150 billion pounds), effectively taxing half of the landfills coming into the United States from China.
Pekini is caught every time "in nature", finally setting a tariff from five to ten per cent more than $60 billion worth of US dollars.
China has been forced to return to the US with the same currency, and the second largest economic power in the world is not likely to be delivered quickly.
Removing the measures from Washington will mean surrendering to their demands, but for China's President Xi Jinping, it would be very embarrassing to publicly submit to the US.
However, experts said that if China plays its letters as it should, the pressures from the US trade war can positively support China in the long term, in order to settle the sustainability of these two economies.
"The fact that political decisions taken as quickly as possible in Washington and Beijing can cause economic downturns in each of these countries is much more dangerous than what has been seen abroad," said Abigail Grace, a research associate at the U.S. New Security Research Centre, which focuses on the Asian continent.
Syria is 'gasy' for the return of refugees, says Foreign Minister
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is calling for help to rebuild the land devastated by a war that has lasted for more than seven years.
Speaking at the General Assembly of the United Nations, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said conditions on the ground were improving.
"Sot, the situation in the country is much more stable and certainly thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate the areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normality.
Already, there are all conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to their country, from which you have to be evacuated because of terrorism and the same economic measures that affected their daily life and well-being.
The UN estimates that about 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
About six million others who still live in the country need humanitarian help.
Al-Moulem said the Syrian regime would welcome assistance in rebuilding the ruined state.
However, he stressed that the country would not accept assistance or conditional aid from countries that sponsored accession.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup trophies in Paris
The European team has won the 2018 Ryder Cup trofee after defeating the US team with final results 16.5 to 10.5 in Le Golf National, outside Paris, France.
The United States has already lost 6 radically in European territory and has since 1993 won this war in Europe.
Europe rescinded the core after Captain Thomas Bjorn's team arrived to get 14.5 points they needed to hit the United States.
American star, Phil Mickelson, who was the most difficult player during the tournament, led the first hit into the water and closed the 16th group with 3 hits more than the level set, losing the fight against Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golf player, Molinari, jumped across all his rounds, making 1 out of 4 players who have achieved 5-0-0, since it started applying the current format in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was awarded 57-4 by the lowest-ranking player in the European team, Danish Thorbjorn Olesen.
Player number one in the world order, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 and 1 of the English Ian Poulter, who could have played in his latest Ryder Cup final.
Spanish veteran Sergio Garcia, who has played eight Ryder Cup, has become the most successful European ever player in this tournament, with 25.5 points in career.
" Normally, I don't cry but today I can't keep myself.
It was a difficult year.
I am very grateful for Thomas who chose me and trusted me.
I'm very, very happy that we got the cup.
Success is the team, and I am glad I had the opportunity to help them," Garcia expressed quite excitedly after the European team's winners.
He spoke to his fellow international, John Ram, who defeated 2&1 U.S. golf legend, Tiger Woods, in direct challenges on Sunday.
"I feel an extraordinary pride that Tiger Woods wore. I've grown up seeing that player," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all his matches in France and now has 13-21-3 statistics, during his career in Ryder Cup.
A remarkable statistics from one of the biggest players of all time, who has won 14 important titles, ranked the second after Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team has been struggling all weekend to get the ball in the right place, except Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high caliber golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. captain Jim Furyk, spoke after his team's humiliating presentation, "I'm proud of these guys, they fought hard.
There were some moments during this paradise when we were under pressure from the European team.
Let's get out of here.
Congratulations to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
His 12 players played pretty well.
We're going back, I'm going to work with PGA in America as well as our Ryder Cup committee and we're going ahead.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud I'm the captain.
We're gonna have to get their hat off.
They played better than us."
