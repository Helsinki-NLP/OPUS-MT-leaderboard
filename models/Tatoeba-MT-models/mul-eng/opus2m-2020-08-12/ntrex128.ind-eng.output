Members of Majelis (AM) Welsh are worried when they're 'blowing like muppets'.
There are concerns among some AMs about a suggestion that their term should be changed to MWPs (Member of Welsh Parliament/ Member of Parliament Welsh).
This was because there was a plan to change the name of Majelis into Parliament Wellsh.
The Americans throughout the political spectrum are worried that this could lead to confusion.
An U.S. member said that his group was concerned, "The moment was happy with Twp and Pwp."
For readers out of Wales: In Welsh, Twp means crazy and Pwp means dirty.
A member of the press (AM) said that his group as one, felt "not comfortable" and had suggested some alternatives.
A Conservative Welsh says his group "open thought" about a change of name, but it's estimated that this is a fake from MWP's shortness of breath to Muppet.
In this context, the letter “w ” in the Welsh language is similar to the letter“ u ” in the English New Yorkshire language.
The Majelis Commission has now adopted legislation to identify the change in the name, saying: "The last decision on any explanation of an amnesty is of course a problem for those members themselves."
The 2017 Walls Council decision gave the Walls Council the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of public consultation on a well-known proposal to receive extensive support to refer to the Journalist as Parliament Wellsh.
With regard to the issue of amnesty, the Commission is more interested in the WMPs (Welsh Parliament Members/ Members of Parliament Welsh), but the MWP options receive much support in public consultation.
The U.S.s seem to offer alternative options, but the struggle to reach consensus can remove the boss, Elin Jones, who is expected to issue a change of laws in the century for a few weeks.
These reform guidelines will include other changes in how to work, including the rules of dissuasiveness for the U.S. and the Committee's system.
The U.S. will get a final vote on the question of how they should be called when they discuss the benefits.
The Macedonians went to vote in the referendum on the change in the name of the country
The voters will determine whether their country's name will be changed to the "Northern Republic of Macedonia".
The so - called hearing was in an effort to settle the issue for a decade with a Greek neighbor, who also had a province called Macedonia.
Athena has long argued that the name of the neighbouring country on the north side shows a recognition of its own territory and has repeatedly rejected the offer of European Union and NATO membership.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ibanov, a voter for a change of name, has said he will reject the vote.
However, referendum supporters, including Minister Zoran Zaev, believe that the change in the name is the price to be paid to join the European Union and NATO.
Lonceng-Lonceng St. Martin didn't stand when the churches in Harlem had a problem
"Historically, the old people I'm going to talk to say there's a bar and church in every corner," said Mr. Adam.
"Today, there's none."
He said that losing him all those bars could be claimed.
"People socialize in other ways" now, he says.
"Let's not be a social guest room where people visit it regularly."
Likewise with the church, he was worried that the money was not going to last as long as the leaders expected, "and sooner or later they will be back from the beginning."
The churches, he adds, can only be replaced by building an apartment with condomium filled with people who will not help to keep the remaining sacred places around.
"Most people who will buy condominium in these buildings are white people," he said, "and that's why it's going to speed up the day where these churches are closed together because it's not possible that people who move to condominium will be members of these churches."
The two churches were built by the white congregation before Harlem became the black - and - white metropolis of the metropolitan area in 1870, and a decade later, St. Martin was born in St.
The original white method congregation moved in the 1930 ’ s.
The black congregations in the area around the globe were being affected by these developments.
St. Martin was replaced by a black congregation under the leadership of Pope John Howard, who led an equestrian businessman on 125th Street, the main road to Harlem, who refused to work or promote black people.
The building was severely damaged by fire in 1939, but when the people of the parishioners planned to rebuild it, they built a tower.
Professor David Johnson, son of Prince Johnson's son and his successor at St. Martin's proud to call the throne "Lonnce of the Poor"
One expert who opened a gold ring in July gave him another poem: "A cultural property" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument."
One scholar, Tiffany Ng of Michigan University, also wrote that this is the first stage in the world played by black music, Dionysio A. Lind, who replaced it with the largest stage in the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said St. Martin didn't replace him.
What has happened in Santo Martin in the last few months is an extensive account of architects and contractors, some of whom were brought by public church leaders, and others by Episcopalism.
The vestry - the governing body of the vestry, formed by the public leaders - wrote to the vestry in July with concern that the vestry "will try to pay" on the vestry, although the vestry is not involved in the artistic and contractor sent by the vestry.
Some parishioners need less transparency on the side of the dream.
Hiu injured a 13 - year - old youth in a labor camp in California
A dog attacked and hurt a 13-year-old boy on the Sabbath when he jumped down to catch a lobby in California at a lobby opening ceremony, followed by an officer.
The attack took place about seven o’clock in the morning near the Beacon Palace in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had spent half an hour with his friends on Saturday morning when he heard a boy asking for help and then waited in groups to help pull him out of the water.
Hammel said that at first she thought it was just a happy story after she caught the lobby, but then she "dang" that the boy cried, 'I'm hurt!
I'm hit!'
The whole bone is broken," Hammel said that he knew him when he got the kid.
And I cried unto them all, saying, There is a lion in the water.
The boy was rushed to the Rady Hospital in San Diego, where he was treated in a critical condition.
The hieroglyphic species responsible for the attack are unknown.
Captain Rescuer Larry Giles said in the media conference that a dog had been seen in the area a week earlier, but it was categorized as safe dog species.
Giles adds that the victim suffered a serious injury on part of his body.
The authorities have closed access to the sea from the Ponto Bridge in Casablad to the Swami in Ecinita for 48 hours for the purpose of research and security.
Giles realizes that there are more than 135 species of snow in this area, but most of them are considered safe.
Sciencebury's plan to break up England's beauty market
Sainsbury took over Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with a kios-kios beauty of conservation that was passed on by specialist assistants.
As part of a substantial increase in the British beauty market of £2.8 billion, which continues to grow during the sale of fashion products and household appliances down, the larger kios-kios beauty will be tested in 11 shops throughout the country and will be developed into more shops in the next few years if this proves successful.
Investing in the beauty field is a quest for the supermarket to use the previously used rockets as a TV, microwave, and household appliances.
Sciencebury said that it would greatly reduce the supply of beauty to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The current mercenaries are starting from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also get more space with dryer areas like those found in stores like Boots.
The supermarket also demolished the factory’s makeup so that most of its products would be suitable for something that young shoppers could increasingly demand.
In addition, the perfumer Fragrance Shop will test the consensus in two Sciencesbury, the first one opened in Croydon. London south last week, while the second one will be opened in Selly Oak, Birmingham, this year.
Online payments and changing the purchase of daily food needs in small numbers of local toco shops mean that the supermarket must do something more to attract people to attend.
Mike Cope, executive chief of Sciencesbury, has said that healings will become more like Mall when the supermarket chain tries to fight back thieves like Aldi and Lidl by providing more and more services without food.
Sainsbury has put Argos in hundreds of shops and has also identified some Habita diseases since they bought the second rounds two years ago, which she said has supported the sale of food daily and made a more useful claim.
The pre-suppressive supermarket campaign to modernize the beauty department and the pharmaceutical industry ended up in failure.
Sciencesbury tried to use Boots in the early 2000 ’ s, but the same work ended after a dispute over how to share the benefits of the chemical industry in the supermarket.
A new strategy appeared after Sainsbury sold 281 pharmaceutical shops to Celesio, owner of the Loyds Farmer, worth £125 million, three years ago.
It is said that Lloyds will play a role in this article, adding a variety of low-cost skin care brands including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in the four shops.
Paul Mills-Hicks, business director of Sciencesbury, says: "We've changed appearances and excitement on kios-kios beauty to improve their appearance for our conclusions.
We also invested in trainees who would be willing to offer advice.
Our target range is designed to meet all the needs, the environment and a good place to do that we are now becoming the target of a long-term anti-smoker."
Peter Jones 'grem' after Holly Willoughby drew himself out of the £11 million loan.
The Dragons Den Star, Peter Jones went "with grace" after a TV show Holly Willoughby drew itself from a business deal worth £11 million to focus more on the new contract with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time to take over the sale of their marriage equipment and accessories, Truly.
This couple's business is similar to the Goop brand of Gwyneth Paltrow.
This morning's director, 37 years old, used his Instagram account to announce that he was out.
Holly Willoughby has made the Dragons star" Den, Petes Jones is angry with being drawn to the last few hours, from the life-changing business of those who benefit--to focus on his bigger contract with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
The source says that Jones was so "gram" when the TV gold girl admitted during a meeting held on Saturday at her business center office in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new contract - worth up to £1.5 million - means she no longer has enough time to serve on the market for their home equipment and accessories, Truly.
Their business has been compared to the Goop market owned by Gwyneth Paltrow and is thought to cost Willoughby a fortune of £11 million.
When Willoughby, 37 years old, used Instagram to announce that he left Truly, Jones flew away from Britain to one of his restrooms,
One source says: "Truly this far is Holly's most important priority.
At that time it will be the future of its longevity, which will make it last for decades to come.
His decision to return to the dust of the ground caused quite a stir among all the people involved.
No one can believe what's going on that Saturday, really close to the time of escape.
There's a store full of stuff at Marlow's main office ready for sale."
Researchers believe that this morning's event, one of the most precious stars in England, can destroy companies up to millions of dollars because of large investment in product form, ranging from cotton and lead to clothing and household equipment, as well as the potential for further escape.
And this could mean ending a long-standing relationship.
The mother of three children, Willoughby and her husband and Baldwin have been very close to Jones and his wife Tara Capp for 10 years.
Willoughby set up his team with Capp in 2016, and 52 - year - old Jones joined Maret as head of the Bethel family.
This couple had fun together and Jones had 40 percent share in Baldwin’s TV production.
Willoughby will be the leader of the M&S brand and will replace Ant McPartlin as the carrier of the I'm A Celebrate.
A close associate with Jones said last night, "We won't comment on this business relationship."
Speak seriously 'and then we fall in love'
He joked about the criticism he would receive from the media because he made comments that some people considered "not presidential" and had been very positive about North Korean leaders.
Why did President Trump give so much?
Trump says with a voice of "reading news" his own.
"I don't give anything."
He knew that Kim was interested in meeting the second time after a previous meeting in Singapore in June, praised by Trump as a step forward in denouncing North Korea.
But the negotiations for nuclear disarmament have stopped.
More than three months after the June meeting in Singapore, North Korea's highest diplomat spoke to world leaders there.
On the contrary, he wrote that the United States continues to maintain sanctions aimed at curbing oppression.
The trumpet is more optimistic in its description.
"We're doing the best with North Korea," he said.
"If we fight North Korea.
Millions of people will be killed.
Now we have this wonderful relationship."
He says that his success in improving Kim’s relationship has led to positive results in stopping rocket tests, helping to free the army and restore the remaining American soldiers to their homes.
And he's protecting his unethical approach in talking about Kim's relationship.
"It's easy to be president, but compared to having 10,000 people out there trying to get into this messy arena, we'd better have about 200 people standing there," Trump said, pointing forward to the right direction.
Indonesia's Tsunami and Gump Destroyed an Island, Killing Hundreds of People
As a result of the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign non-governmental organizations were informed that they were not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of the population of Lombok have lost their place of residence, there is no statement of national disaster, as a condition for international assistance.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they have explained that they do not ask for international help, so this is a little against," said Mrs. Sumbung.
While Save The Children are calling a team to go to Palu, it's still not sure if foreign staff can work in the field.
Sutopo, the head of the national disaster relief team, says that the Indonesian office is taking stock of the situation in Palu to see if foreign aid can contribute.
Looking back on the country’s long history of Indonesia, the country is still in a state of stillbirth.
While the tsunami shelter was being built in Acah, it was not a public display on the other side of the sea.
There is no tsunami warning in Palu, although the threat has already been warned, perhaps great has contributed to the existence of a life - sacrifice.
At the best of times, travel among many Indonesian islands is very challenging.
Natural disaster makes logistics even more complex.
The hospital that has been located in Lombok to care for earthquakes is heading to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach a new disaster site.
President Joko Widodo has made an improvement in Indonesia's damaged infrastructure as a result of the election campaign, and he has spent money on building roads and railways.
But his lack of funds hindered his ability to run the race for life again the next year.
Joko’s father was also under pressure from a growing sector in Indonesia, where Muslim members of the majority took a more conservative form of protection.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands were displaced when Muslim and Christian factions fought on the streets, using weapons, buses and weapons, and other weapons of mass destruction.
Witnessing: Liverpool’s player Daniel Sturridge inserted an amplifier against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from the defeat of Chelsea at the Premier League with one score at 89 on Saturday in Stamford Bridge London.
Sturridge received a receipt from Jherdan Shaqri about 30 meters from the Chelsea border when the team was left 1-0.
He put the ball on his left before he turned it over to the other side of the boat.
The ball hits high on the ball when the ball hits the right foot on the net.
The ball finally fell through the Fallopian River and fell into the river.
"It's just trying to get into this position, to control the ball, and players like Shaq always play it in the future as much as possible, so I'm just trying to give myself as much time as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante come and take one opportunity and don't think too much about it, and just make an appointment."
Chelsea led with score 1-0 at the first half after the Belgian original player Eden Hazard printed a ball at the 25th minute.
The Blue attacker gave Matthew Kovacic a chance to return to the game, before he approached the middle line and ran fast to the middle of Liverpool.
Kovacic quickly gave up and ran in the middle line.
Then he made a perfect visit, which led to Hazard’s death.
Hazard managed to cross the battle line and point the ball to the edge with a left-hand look, through the Liverpool Alison Becker.

Chelsea faced Videoton at the UEFA League of Europe on Wednesday night in London.
The death toll from Indonesia's tsunami increased to 832
The death toll on the ground and Indonesia’s tsunamis increased by 832 people, resulting in a landslide on Sunday morning.
Many were told that they were trapped in a series of buildings that destroyed 7,5 Richter’s massive earthquake on Friday and destroyed more than 20 feet [2 m] of mud, says Sutopo Purwo, a spokesman for a press conference.
The city of Palu, which lives more than 380,000 lives, is filled with fallen buildings.
The police arrested a man, 32 years old, on the murder scene after a woman was tortured to death.
A murder investigation was carried out after the body of a woman was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside last morning.
A 44-year-old woman was found in Grayson Mews, on John's way, at 7:55 a.m. with some injuries, while a 32-year-old man was detained on a murder warrant.
The police have asked those who are around you to see or hear something for themselves.
Detective Brian O'Hagan says: "The investigation is still at the beginning but I'm asking everyone around John's street in Birkenhead to see or hear something suspicious about contacting us.
I'm also talking to everyone, especially taxi drivers, who might put something on the dosborough camera to contact us because they may have important information for our research.
The police have confirmed that the woman whose body was found was local Birkenhead and she was found in a building.
Tonight, friends who feel confident that they know the woman came to the scene to ask where she was found this morning.
The investigation continues, as the police have said, in the process they are telling the closest victims.
A young taxi driver who lived in Grayson Mews just came back to his apartment, but the police told him that no one was allowed to come in or out of the building.
The man can't say anything when he knows what's going on.
Now the citizens are being told that they will need a few hours until they are allowed to go back.
A police officer was listening to telling someone that all areas are now being treated as events.
A woman appeared in a crying situation.
He always repeats 'this is really scary'.
On the 2nd day of the van police car is in line and the others are outside.
A number of officials stood in line to block the apartment.

Parliament Cromwell's god has become the last known monument under the "recording of history"
Its execution will be a punitive justice on the Taliban's destruction of many traditional artefacts and British buildings by fanatical Puritan followers.
But Cromwell's society describes Mr. Crick's advice as "foolish" and "to try to re-write history."
John Goldsmith, head of Cromwell Society, says: "This cannot be avoided in the debate at this time about visual pollution, that Oliver Cromwell's figure outside the Westminster station will become a threat.
The Anglo - American World Power is not commanded or controlled by Cromwell.
Perhaps Cromwell’s wrong offspring were to be sacrificed to his grandfather Thomas centuries earlier.
The outstanding representation of Cromwell by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is a 19th-century opinion and part of a historical figure that many still believe is worthy of consideration.
Mr. Goldsmith told Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is considered by many people, perhaps more in the late 19th century than today, as a parliamentary defender against external pressure, in particular the government.
Whether it's a fully accurate representation, it's still subject to further historical debate.
Which must have been that conflict in the middle of the 17th century has formed the next nation's development, and Cromwell is an individual figure that represents one side of the difference.
The Lord of the Throne is worthy of all praise."
The Killer Kills Chinese Farmers Until Death
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a southern Chinese market, according to a local media report.
The man, who was identified only by the name "Yuan", was found dead by the buried arterial, reporting blood near a pigeon in the Liupanshui district of Guizhou, South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A cow farmer is ready to place a vaccine on a pig farm on May 30, 2005 in Xining Province of Qinghai, China.
He was reported to have gone with his cousin from neighboring Greece on Thursday to sell 15 chickens in the market.
The next day, her cousin found her dead, and she saw the door of the bathroom near her door opened.
He said that there was a large animal baby in his mouth.
Forensic research confirms that the body’s weight of 550 pounds has been abused by the farmer until his death, based on a report.
"My nose is bleeding and ruined," said the bear known as "Wu," as suggested by Guiyang Evening News.
The security camera records show Yuan entering the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his grandparents.
The body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed that man was not owned by Yuan or his nephew.
A market manager told Evening News that the bear had been forced to stop attacking others, while the police collected evidence at the scene.
Yuan’s family and market authorities were reportedly negotiating compensation for his death.
Although rare, cases of racial violence against humans have also occurred before.
In 2016, a father attacked a woman and her husband in their farm in Massachusetts and threatened to hurt the injured man.
Ten years ago, a baby with a weight of 650 pounds caught a Welsh farmer in his tractor until the woman was scared and pulled out the animal.
After an Oregon farmer was eaten by his grandmother in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that the baby was usually not aggressive but blood can act as a "pemico".
"They're just playing games.
They're jealous, very curious to know... that they won't come out to hurt you.
You just need to give him enough respect," he said
The rest of Rosa's camp brought a deep rain to the west of the United States.
As you can imagine, the Rosary was exhausted as she moved on a colder beach in the north coast of Mexico.
In any case, Rosa will be able to draw water from all over Mexico, the northern and western regions of the United States, for a few days.
Rosa has a wind speed of 85 mph, Badai Category 1, starting at 5 o'clock in the morning. Sunday's time in the East Region is 385 miles west of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa may have moved north on Sunday.
In the meantime, Palanga began to form over the Pacific Ocean and moved east, towards the South-West of the United States. When Rosa approached the end of the California Bay on the Year as a tropical storm and began to cause tropical flooding to the north to the west of the United States.
Rosa will bring rain to 10 inches [10 cm] in part of Mexico on Sunday.
Then, the tropical storm that struck the area with the help of an approaching hurricane would blow a flood in the Middle East for a few days.
Locally, 1 to 4 of the rain forests will cause dangerous freshwater waters, canals and possible long-distance soils in the desert.
A low tropical earthquake would cause a heavy downpour of rain close to 2 to 3 inches per hour, especially in the southern part of Nevada and Arizona.
Many of the 2 to 4 rain forests are thought to fall in some parts of the Western world, especially in most of Arizona.
The water of the lake is likely to occur under adverse conditions as a result of rapid tropical rains.
It's really not recommended to explore the desert by walking on foot because of the tropical rain threat.
The torrential rains caused torrential rains to overflow, and torrential rains washed the vital organs of the local wind and blew them down.
The nearest aid will cause the local rain to cross the southern coast of California.
The total amount of rain that exceeds half the inch is sufficient to allow, which can cause small points to flow and the road becomes narrow.
This will be the first rain in that area during their rainy season.
Some tropical rains will begin to approach Arizona at the end of Monday and Sunday morning, before the rains become more widespread on Monday and Sunday.
And the rain poured down and the floods came and the winds blew and lashed against that place.
In October there will be some dramatic changes throughout the United States when the Arctic is colder, but the tropical region remains warm enough.
Sometimes this causes dramatic changes in temperature in the short term.
There is an accurate example of the dramatic difference in temperature across the central United States on Sundays.
There are about 20 degrees Fahrenheit [- 20 ° C] between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
During the next few days, the remaining summer will be well formed and will be reenacted.
Most of the U.S. central and eastern regions are expected to start hot beginning in October with the speed of spreading large 80s of South Data to parts of the East Sea.
New York City can reach 80 degrees on Saturday, which is thought to be about 10 degrees above the average.
Our long-term climate view shows a high chance of warming on the United States' eastern coast until mid-October.
More than 20 million people have witnessed the arrival of Brett Kavanaugh.
More than 20 million people testify to the interesting statement on Thursday by the Chief Justice Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of committing sexual violence that was expected to happen in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, on six television networks.
During that time, political importance continued, with publishers attending a regular event to report the unexpected events at the last minute of Wednesday: A deal planned by Senator Arizona Jeff Flake for the FBI to do research for one week on the charges.
Ford told the Court of Justice Committee that the woman was 100 percent sure that Kavanaugh would get her bodies drunk and try to get off her clothes at the High School party.
Kavanaugh, in his fiery testimony, said he was 100 percent sure that didn't happen.
Perhaps more than 20.4 million people reported by Nielsen on Friday were watching him.
The company calculates the operating rates in CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The use of other networks that publish this is not readily available, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen is often in trouble with the number of people who witness it at the office.
To put this in perspective, it's a number of powers that are almost equal to the playoff football game or Academy Awards.
Fox News Channel, who thinks the event's leader is very supportive of the Kavanaugh tour, won from all networks with 5.69 million graduates throughout the congregation, Nielsen says.
ABC is second position by 3.26 million.
CBS has 3.1 million, NBC has 2.94 million, MSNBC with 2.89 million assets and CNN with 2.52 million, Nielsen says.
The interest remains high after arrival.
Flake was the key player in that Sunday drama.
After the Office of the Democratic Republic of the Congo issued a statement that he would choose to support Kavanaugh, he was arrested by CNN and CBS on Friday morning by the prosecutor that he was trying to lift to the Court Committee.
He was standing down for a few minutes when he pulled up, reported directly to CNN.
"I stand right in front of you," said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the country the truth?
He was told, "There's no power when there's a lot of women who can't do it."
Flake says that his office has issued a statement and says, before the elevator is closed, that there are many other things he needs to say in the committee.
The cable TV and the transmission network all flowed in a few hours later, when the Court Committee would choose to raise Kavanaugh's call to the whole Senate for a hearing.
But Flake says he's just gonna do it with understanding that the FBI will investigate the charges against the nation for the next week, as the Democrats have demanded.
Flake has been assured by some of the talks with his friend, Senator Chris Coons.
During the conversation with Coons and some senators, Flake made his decision.
Flake's choice has power, because it's clear that the Republican party won't have a voice to support Kavanaugh without research.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation on the charges against Kavanaugh.
The British Prime Minister accused the "political game" of Brexit
The Minister Theresa May accused the "political game" critic of the future of Britain and undermined national interests, on his plan to leave the European Union, in a discussion with Sunday Times newspaper.
The British Minister Theresa May arrived at the Burmingham Conservative Party Conference, England, September 29, 2018.
In another interview, after one of the talks that appeared on the front page of the press, the Foreign Minister Boris Johnson stressed an attack on what he said as a Chequers plan for Brexit, saying that the proposal about England and the EU that should bring together the same tariffs is "not quite reasonable."
Wyde Sims shooting: The police captured the suspect of Dyteon Simpson in the death of LSU players.
A 20 - year - old LSU basketball player was caught by the police.
Dyteon Simpson, 20 years old, has been arrested and in prison with a two-level homicide charge, says the Baton Rouge Police Department.
The office wrote a video interview between Sims and Simpson, and the police said Sims lost his eye during the war.
The police found these glasses at the scene and said they found DNA Simpson on that stuff, WAFB CBS's affiliate reported.
After Simpson questioned, the police said he admitted he had committed a fatal shooting at Wade.
The contract has been set at $350,000, the lawyer reported.
Koroner Paroki Baton Rouge East wrote a preliminary report on Friday, saying that the cause of death was a headache to the head.
The Department is grateful for the hard work done by the National Police Department of Louisiana, the police lab of the state, the Southern University police and the surrounding towns in helping research leading to arrest.
LSU athletic director Joe Alleva thanked the district law enforcement for "supporting and seeking justice."
Sims was 20 years old at the time.
With a height of 6.6 feet in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
The score-rate point is 5.6 and falls to 2.6 in the game last year.
On Wednesday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said his team felt "damaged" and "distorted" with Wayde's death.
"This is what you've been worried all the time," said Wade.
A fire mountain climbs up a well in Mexico City
The flood that came out of Popocatepetl’s volcano has reached the southern region of Mexico City.
The National Plan Prevention Centre warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the fire mountain after increased activity in the field and listed 183 gas emissions and dust in the century for more than 24 hours.
The center of the building was divided several times.
The social media images show a typical dust leak on the front of a car in the neighborhood of Mexico City.
Geophysicists have recorded an increase of 45 miles (72 km) north of the city’s capital since the 7.1 earthquake struck central Mexico in September 2017.
This Rapi mountain is known as "Don Goyo" which has been active since 1994.
Catalonian police have been separatistly involved in the election campaign.
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after a pro-liberal demonstration campaign involving anti-hoghar police, and when thousands of people joined in a syllable demonstration to commemorate the first celebration of the Catalan polarization polling for self-sustainment.
A group of pro-separatists who were held by the anti-hoghar police broke them down with mud and threw dust caps, creating dark clouds in the streets that would usually be filled by the guards.
The investigation also took place after that day with police officers who used their battalion to monitor the investigation.
For a few hours pro-liberal groups have ruled "Don't forget, no forgiveness" facing a single worker who says, "Life Spanyol."
Forty people were treated for the small injuries suffered in the protest, and the local press reported.
A year after the October 1st referendum, Madrid was deemed illegal but celebrated by the Catalan separatist.
The voters prefer to be modest, even though the number of voters with whom they are opposed and the majority with whom they vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured a year after the police tried to stop hearings in the TPS throughout the area in a hostile environment.
Pro-liberal groups have spent the night in order to prevent demonstrations in the national police station.
The demonstration continued, but it was forced to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who attended a separatist protest with his wife said that he no longer hoped for the prospect of freedom.
"A year ago we spent one of our best moments.
I witnessed to my parents crying because they could choose, but now we are trapped," she says.
Although successful in winning vital victory even though in the last December regional election, the Catalan pro-liberal parties have fought to defend this year's moment, even though many of their well-known leaders, who are in prison or in prison, are waiting for a trial, on their role in organizing referendums and on the declaration of freedom.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who protests with his phone to support the police, says that the conflict has been hit by politicians on both sides.
"Now more arrest," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who were imprisoned in the late years, announced that he would join the European Parliament's elections next year.
"To stand as a candidate for Europe's election is the best way to threaten the survival of the values of democracy and the persecution we have seen from the Spanish government," he said.

A bus may also have been blown off course in some respects.
The goal printed by Menga has given Livingston victory over Rangers with score 1-0
First round of Dolly Menga for Livingston ensures success
Livingston's victory affected the Rangers' side by destroying Steven Gerard from his office as director of the Ibrox Club, over his second success in 18 matches.
The attack by Dolly Menga has proved to be different when Gary Holt's side moves along with the second line of the Hibernia.
The Gerard side remained unconquered in this period of Premiership and faced the eight-point Hearts leader in front of them, the next Sunday.
Previously, Rangers had seen the Rapid Vienna in the European Union, on Thursday.
Livingston, during that time, widening the record they didn't win in the division into six matches, while Holt's coach still had a success since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston lost his chance to fight a vicious guest team.
The Holt team should have won a long time before they printed the ball, with the exception of those who gave Rangers a lot of trouble.
Scott Robinson succeeded in boxing but his effort to break through the wall, and then Alan Lithgow could only expand his work after he jumped in and faced Craig Halkett's attack from the other side of the wall.
The householder felt satisfied to let Rangers play the game out at first, knowing that they were able to draw the team on the event of his death.
And that's how to make a very important goal.
The rangers of free access and Livingston got the opportunity, Declan Gallagher and Robinson joined in helping Menga, who got the ring and printed the ball from the middle of the field.
At that level, Rangers has dominated the building but realized that the housekeeper's defense cannot be fired and Liam Kelly's cabinet is completely unstoppable,
It continued until the second generation, although Alfredo Morelos managed to escape from Kelly.
Scott Pittman was attacked by Ranger's Rangers Allan McGregor and Lithgow whose tactical effects of other Livingston games were far from over.
The attack continued to come to Livingston's front and continued to retreat, while two cheerleaders -- after the opposition of the People on Glenn Middleton's replacement player, and one for handball -- were rejected.
"Fenomenal" from Livingston - analysis
BBC Scotland Alasdair Lamont in Tony Macaroni Arena
The performance and the phenomenal results for Livingston.
For a man, they're amazing, they're always hoping for this going on.
The way they play and their staff have not changed since they returned to the boss, but great credit has to be given to Holt on how he has been strengthening the team since his arrival.
He's got so many kung fusses.
Captain Halkett is very big, leading well-organized defenses, while Menga keeps Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall awake during the game.
However, Rangers lacked inspiration.
Whatever they were at the time under Gerard, they failed to meet that standard.
Their final ball is less than good-only once they can destroy the formation of the owner’s side of the house - and it becomes a reminder to Rangers, who recognize their identity in the middle of the field.
Erdogan's got a big reception in Cologne.
On Saturday (September 29th) the Turkish and German leaders met for breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany - aimed at improving relations between NATO troops.
They argue about problems including human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's entry into the EU.
Erdogan then went to Cologne to open a new big mask.
This city is home to the Turkish people who are outside of Turkey.
The police cited security reasons to prevent 25,000 people from meeting in front of the mosque, but many supporters moved around to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan Protestants - many of them Kurdish - also argue, threaten both, the integrity of Erdogan and the German government's decision to accept it in that country.
The protest protest describes an argument about the identity of an importer who was accepted as a champion by some Turkic peoples and was described as a dictator by others.
Deptford railway station: The train's dead in a car crash
A bus driver died in a traffic accident involving a car in London.
The explosion took place near Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, many streets in Deptford, on the north side of the city, about 10:15 B.C.E.
The car driver stopped and the paramedics came, but the man died at the scene.
It happened months after another bicycle racer died in a children's street truck, about 1 mile away from the Saturday break.
The Metropolitan police said the officers were trying to identify the man and tell his family.
The roads were closed, and buses were transported, as well as motorcycling to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six injured officers in the prison
Six men were injured in a rape in a man's prison with a firm guard, the law firm said.
The accident occurred at the HMP Long Lartin prison in Worcestershire about 09:30 BST (GMT+0100) on Sunday and continues to progress.
The Specialist "Tornado" has been forced to deal with this robbery, involving eight prisoners and occurred on one side of the building.
Officers are being treated at the scene because of minor injuries in the face.
A prison spokesman said: "The law enforcement officer who has been specially trained has been forced to deal with the incident that is taking place in the HMP Long Lartin prison.
Six officers have been treated for injuries.
We do not deny the violence in this prison, and clearly that the responsible person will be handed over to the police and may have to spend a longer time behind the iron fence."
HMP Long Lartin prison has supported more than 500 prisoners, including some of their most dangerous rivals.
In June it was reported that the prison chief was treated at the hospital after an attack by a paramedic.
And in October last year, anti-hospital officers were called into prison to deal with a serious robbery where a rapist was attacked by a billion ball.
Rosa’s Bay Threatened Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with the Floodwaters
The tropical depression that afflicts Arizona rarely occurs, but that is what is likely to happen at the beginning of next week because the remaining energy pressure of Badai Rosa across the western windshields, creates a risk of flooding.
The National Cuaca Service has issued a warning of floods on Sundays and Sundays for the West Arizona area to Nevada south, southern California and Utah, including Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Rosa was supposed to direct her way through Phoenix on Saturday night, and she was going to wake up on Saturday night with a shower.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix mentioned on Twitter that there are only ten tropical tops that can lead to tropical storms or depressive status in the 200 thousand Phoenix areas since 1950!
Katrina (1967) is a train in 40 miles of the AZ border. "
The latest World War I tool has been able to predict 2 to 4 heavy rains with the number of earthquakes reaching 6 in Mogollon Rome Arizona.
Other Western powers areas include Central Rockies and Great Basin are likely to be larger than 1 to 2 inches, with probably the number of isolates reaching 4 inches.
For those in the free zone, Rosa’s rain may have been a blessing because the area was devastated.
Although water is a serious problem, some of these rains are likely to be of great benefit because the western spirit realm is now being dominated by drought.
According to the U.S. Health Report, only about 40 percent of Arizona’s areas have a low incidence of extreme malnutrition, the second highest category," weather.com reported.
First, the road through the Rosary leads to the country along the California border of Mexico
Rosa, still at the power of the storm on Sunday morning with a wind speed of 85 miles per hour, 385 miles north of Punta Eugenia, Mexico and moving north with a speed of 12 miles per hour.
The island was surrounded by a much warmer climate in the Pacific Ocean, so it had to be sparsely populated.
That's why it's supposed to be going to blow up in Mexico with the power of a tropical storm on Saturday evening or night.
Rainfall may be high in parts of Mexico, causing high water risks
"The total rain level 3 to 6 inches is thought to go from the California Bay to the western zone of Sonora, possibly up to 10 inches," weather.com reports.
Then Rosa will cross the northern part of Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border on Wednesday as a tropical depression, which will enter through Arizona and the South Pole on Wednesday night.
"The main risk that could be posed by the Rosa Bay or the rest of it is a very high rainfall in the California Bay, the western zone of Sonora, and the A.S. western region of the A.S." The National Badai Centre (NHC) says.
It is thought that the rain will threaten the mountains and the hills that flow into the desert, and it turns out to be a barren land in the mountains.
Midsumer Northon Attack: Four suspected arrests attempted to kill
Three young men and a 20-year-old man were arrested for attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found with a brain injury in Somerset.
The young man was found wounded in the area of Excelsior Terrace Midsomer Norton, about 4:00 BST on Saturday.
He was taken to a hospital where he was in a stable condition.
A 17 - year - old boy, two 18 - year - olds, and a 20 - year - old man were arrested during the night in Radstock, Avon, and Somerset, police.
The officer has already made an appeal to anyone who might have a video of the event on his phone to come up with a report.
Trump says that Kavanaugh 'takes hate and anger' from the Democratic Party
"A voice for Judge Kavanaugh is a voice to reject the violent and humiliating side of the Democratic Party," said Trump on a campaign in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump says that Kavanaugh "accepts hatred and anger" from the Democratic Party during the pencalonian process.
Kavanaugh witnessed before the Congress on Thursday, forced and emotionally denied a charge by Christine Blasey Ford that she had committed sexual abuse to her several decades ago when they were still young.
Ford also witnessed in court about his statement.
The president said on Saturday that "Americans saw the wisdom and quality and courage of Kavanaugh on that day.
"A voice of support for Judge Kavanaugh is a voice to impress someone who has the most perfect legal thought in our time, a jury with a true public record," he said to West Virginia Support Group.
The president implied that Kavanaugh was speaking about the importance of the participation of the people of the Republic in the middle of the election.
"Five weeks before it happened was one of the most important choices in our lives.
I'm not running, but I'm really kidding," she said.
"That's why I went there to go on, fight for a great horse.
The trumpet argues that Democrats are in the mission to "fight and block."
The first hearing procedure at the Senate level in the Kavanaugh can be expected to be carried out as soon as Friday, a GOP senior assistant told CNN.
Hundreds of people died because of Indonesia’s tsunami, tsunamis, with an increasing number of victims.
Fewer than 384 people died, many were injured when a storm hit the sea, when an earthquake and tsunami hit the island of Sulawesi Indonesia, according to the authorities on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered for a sea festival in Palu on Friday, when a flood of six feet (18 m) destroyed the sea at noon, causing many deaths and destructions.
Tsunami is followed by earthquakes with 7.5 force.
"As the threat of a tsunami increased yesterday, people still do their work at sea and do not run so quickly that they become victims," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the BNPB (BNPB), said at the time of arrest in Jakarta.
"The tsunami didn't come alone, he pulled the car, wood, house, hit everything in the country," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had crossed the sea at 800 kph (497 mph) before crossing the coast.
Some people climb trees to save themselves from the tsunami and save themselves, he says.
About 16,700 people were recruited to 24 duty stations in Palu.
The photos produced by BNPB show many buildings and shops that were damaged, including coal and coal doors, as well as an avalanche of water.
A swarm of locusts swarmed around the city all over the sea on Saturday.
The earth’s magnetic field surely accounts for 2.4 million inhabitants.
The Institute of Technology Research and Technology (BPPT) says in a statement that energy released on the massive Wednesday is about 200 times more powerful than nuclear bombs dropped in Hiroshima during World War II.
The city’s geography, which is located at the very end of a long drought, can be said to increase tsunamis.
Nugroho describes the damage that has occurred as "extensive" and says that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels have been destroyed.
The body of some victims was found trapped under the collapsed walls, he said, adding that there were 540 victims and 29 missing.
Nugroho says that victims and injuries can only be larger across the coast 300 km (190 km) north of Palu, a region called Dodhraa, which is closer to the center of the earthquake.
Communication "is really slow with no information from Doghera, Nugroho says.
There are more than 300,000 people who live there," said the Red Cross in a statement, adding that their members and their volunteers are heading for the most vulnerable area.
"This is a tragedy, but this can be worse," he said.
The relevant authorities received a lot of criticism on the Sabbath because they did not inform that there was a tsunami that hit Palu, although the authorities said that the balloon had already crashed at the time the warning was issued.
A amateur record shared in social media shows a man on the floor on a building hearing warning with panic that there will be a nearby tsunami, towards those on the street below.
In a few minutes, the water cycle crossed the sea, blowing up buildings and cars.
Reuters can't quickly prove the accuracy of the record.
Fires and tsunamis are the greatest cause of power generation that has decided to communicate around the Palu to undermine the authority to coordinate rescue efforts.
The military has already begun sending cargo aircraft with aid from Jakarta and other cities, say the authorities, but refugees still need food and other trees.
The city of Odara has been restored to its original state of affairs. It will be closed until October.
President Joko Widodo has been scheduled to visit the evacuation center in Palu on Sunday.
Tsunami Indonesia's victim has risen to over 800.
It's very scary.
When the World Vision officers from Dothraa arrived safely in the city of Palu, where these officers were protected in the wooden canals built on their desks, on their journey they had passed through many parts of the country, says Father Doseba.
"They tell me they've seen many houses destroyed," he said.
It's very scary.
Even when the relief group began to move long enough to start disaster control activities, some of these groups felt that there was pressure on foreign volunteers who had skills, who wanted to go to the Palu.
According to Indonesia's regulations, training, aid for goods and energy from abroad can only begin if the disaster area has been officially declared as a national disaster zone.
That thing hasn't happened yet.
"It's still a provincial disaster," said Aulia Ariani, talking about the Red Indonesia River.
"When the government says, OK, this is a national disaster," we can receive international assistance, but there is no such status."
On the second night of the sacrament and the tsunami in Palu, friends and family of the missing victims still hope that their loved ones will be a part of the miracle that will improve the life story of the world.
On the Sabbath day, a boy was to be led outside the camp.
On Sunday, the rescuer released a woman who had been arrested under the cover of darkness for two days along with her mother’s body.
Gendon Subandono, an Indonesian national team coach, has become a coach for two missing athletes who are quick to follow the Asian Games that ended this month in Indonesia.
Those still trapped in the Roa-Roa Hotel, along with Father Mandi, are his disciples.
"As an adult in the field of airplanes, I have my own emotional burden," he said.
Gendon told me again how after the news about the Roa-Roa Hotel that collapsed around the airline community, he finally sent a message of WhatsApp to the Palu competitors, who attended and attended the events at the sea.
However, all its messages, they only get one sign of the beads, not the two blue beads.
"I think it means not sent," he said.
The team took $26,750 during the ATM filling at Newport in Levee
On Friday morning, he stole $26,750 from a Brink official who was filling up the ATM machine storage box in Newport, based on a report from the Newport Police Department.
The driver's car has set up an ATM machine in the entertainment complex and is ready to send more money, Det. Dennis McCarthy wrote in a report.
While he was working, another guy ran away from Brink's back and stole a bag of money that would be sent.
The Witnesses saw some suspects flee from the scene, based on reports, but the police did not mention the number of people involved.
Anyone who has information about their identity can contact Newport police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper changed his name to Yes
Rapper Kanye West changed his name to Yes.
Collecting this change of name via Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "The first officially known as Kanye West."
West, 41 years old, has had the name Ye for a while and uses it as the eighth album title, written in June.
This change was made before it appeared on Saturday Night Live, when he was supposed to write the new album, Yandhi.
He replaced the singer Ariana Grande to appear on this show, which was canceled because of the "emotional reason," said the performer.
As a brief description of his professional name right now, West has previously said that for him this word has religious meaning.
"I believe 'ye' is the word commonly used in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'You'," said West at the beginning of this year, discussing the title of the album with Radio Big Boy.
"So I'm you, I'm us, it's us.
That name was taken from Kanye, which means only one, to be Yes--as a mirror of our good, our bad, our fault, everything.
This album is more than our real self-esteem."
He's one of the number rappers that changed their name.
Sean Combs has been known in various ways as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced his preference for the name Love and Brother Love.
The West co-laborator, JAY-Z, also made it with or without a link sign and a big letter.
President of Mexico, AMLO, has sworn not to use the military in the face of civil society
Election President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has sworn that he will never use military power against civil society to block the 50th anniversary of the blood-result action against students.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza to "never use military power to force Mexicans."
The army bombed a peaceful demonstration on the beach on October 2, 1968, killing 300 people at the time, when the leftist movement left his farm throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has guaranteed support for young people in Mexico by providing monthly subsidies to those who are studying and opening up more free universities.
He says that abortions and at least educational opportunities motivate young people to form criminal gangs.
A.S. should slow down A.I.
Since China is more active in the field of engineering, the U.S. should reduce the amount of money that will be used for research in the field, says the investor and A2 Kai-Fu Lee, who has been working for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comment came after various parts of the U.S. government made announcements about AI, even when A.S. overall lack of formal AI strategy.
In the meantime, China introduced its plan last year: to become number 1 in the 2030 AI innovation.
"AI research is a good start, remembering all other countries that are far away from the U.S., and we're looking for the next one in the AI field," says Lee.
Determining debt could slow down the opportunity so that the next major AI will be held in the U.S., Lee told the CNBC in a conversation this week.
Lea, owner of the book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and New World Order" has been published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, CEO of Sinovation Ventures, who has invested in one of the largest AI companies in China, Face+.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University he planned an AI system that won the best Othello American player, and then he served as an executive at Microsoft Research and the president of the Google branch of China.
Lee admitted the previous U.S. government technology competition like the Robotics Challenge for the Mutakhir Research Project and asked when the next activity would be carried out, to help identify the next viewer.
Researchers in the U.S. often have to work hard to win a gift from the government, says Lee.
"It's not China that takes academic leadership; it's a company," said Lee.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have been working on the university for AI research in recent years.
Lee says that the changes in immigration realities can also help the U.S. to support AI's efforts.
"I think the black card can be offered automatically to PHD holder in the AI field," he said.
In July 2017, the National Assembly of China issued a series of plans for the development of the next generation of skills.
The Chinese Academy of Sciences provides loans for people in academic institutions such as the Academy of Sciences and other government organizations that share money with researchers in the U.S., but the quality of academic tasks is lower in China, says Lee.
At the beginning of this year in the U.S. Department of Defence developed a Joint Action Skills Centre, which was designed to involve industry and academia, and the White Buildings announced the formation of the Committee's Committee on Skills.
And this month DARPA (Mutakhir Research Agency) announced an investment of $2 billion in an initiative called AI Next.
For NSF, DARPA recently invested more than $100 million a year for AI research.
Meanwhile, the U.S. legislation requested by the National Commission for Skills does not see any further action for months.
Macedonians make a vote in a series of amendments to the country's name
Macedonia's people voted on Sunday to decide to change the country's name as "Northern Republic of Macedonia," an action that will resolve a conflict for a decade with Greece that has challenged its offer of asylum to become part of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province named Macedonia, has protected the view that the country's name is a country in the north that represents ownership of its territory and has banned its association with NATO and the European Union.
The two sides of the government reached agreement in June on the basis of the new name given, but the nationalist opposition argued that the change would destroy the identity of most of the ethnic population Slavia Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov says he will not give his voice to the general election and a boycott campaign has raised doubts as to whether the results of the election can reach a minimum of 50 per cent of the votes required for the election to be announced.
The question on the vote is, "Do you agree with NATO and the EU by accepting an agreement with Greece?"
Supporters for the change in name, including Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is worth paying to get access to bodies such as the European Union and NATO for Macedonia, one of the countries born from the breakup of Yugoslavia.
"I am here today to give my voice for the future of the country, for the young generations of Macedonia so that they can live free under the auspices of the European Union because it means a safer life for all of us," says Olivera Georgievska, 79 years old, in Skopje.
Although they are not legally recognized, many members of parliament have said that they will obey the laws of the land when they make their own decisions.
The change in the name requires a two-thirds majority vote in Parliament.
The National Electoral Commission said there were no reports of violations until 1 day.
However, the results of the vote were only 16 per cent, compared with 34 per cent of the last parliamentary elections in 2016 when 66 per cent of the voters were enrolled.
"I came to give my voice for my children, where we are in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62 years old, an elector in the capital, Skopje.
The Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife, Zorica and his son Dushko, gave their voice to the general election in Macedonia in a series of country names that will open the way for the country to join NATO and the European Union in Strumica, Macedonia, September 30, 2018.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54 years old, has prepared a small hall and drew courses in front of the stadiums made by those who will vote for the vote.
"We agreed to join NATO and the European Union, but we wanted to participate respectfully, not through the server door," Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have a relationship.
If they don't want to accept us as Macedonia, we can switch to China and Russia and become part of Euro-Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO membership would bring more investment needed for Macedonia, which has a starting rate of more than 20 per cent.
"I believe most of the population will support it because more than 80 percent of our societies support the European Union and NATO," Zaev said after he gave his voice.
He says the result "yes" will be "confirming our future."
A result of an opinion poll published by the Macedonian Research Institute last year stated that between 30 and 43 percent of the voters would participate in the polling of these less than the required number.
Another opinion expert, quoted by the television station Telma Macedonia, found 57 percent of the responses that were planned to join in giving their voices on Sunday.
Of them, 70 percent said they would choose.
In order for this to be successful, 50 percent of the volume will be added to the volume.
A failure in the vote will represent the first event against the pro-Barat government since May last year.
Witnessing: Sergio Aguero from Manchester City studied the whole wall of Brighton to print the Bible.
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling were raped as Brighton's defense at Manchester City 2-0 on Saturday at Stadium Etihad, Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look very easy on his score in minutes to 65.
Argentina's attacker received an operation in the middle of the field at the beginning of the game.
He ran among the three Brighton defenses, before he stepped into the open field.
Aguero later found himself surrounded by four black men.
He moved across one of the defenses before running to meet up with some other combatants at the end of Brighton.
Then he pushed to the left, to Sterling.
The front view of England was using its first approach from the edge to the ball back to Aguero, who used its right foot to beat the bridge Brighton, Matthew Ryan with a right side of the bridge.
"Aguero fought with some problems on his feet," said Pep Guardiola to the reporter.
"We talked about himself playing for 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We succeeded him in printing a piece of paper at that time."
But Sterling-is who gave Sky Blues the first advantage in the war of Prime Minister League.
It happened at the 29th minute.
Aguero got a ball, far away from the Brighton area in that game.
He picked up a ball with a long crosswalk through Leroy Sane’s left leg.
You did a little exercise before leading Sterling to post-mortem.
A look in front of Sky Blue leads a ball to the back of the ball right before that ball jumps out of the border.
City against Hopeneheim in the League Championships team on Saturday at 12.55 p.m. in Rhein-Neckar, Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to accuse the sponsors of Rockies.
With the delimitation of the Nationals from the playoff game, there's no reason to force other competitions.
But Scherzer who's too competitive is hoping to win Colorado Rockies on Sunday's game, but only if there's still playoff implications for Rockies, who won one game over Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
Rockies didn't at least get a place after winning the wild-card game against the Nationals with score 5-2 on Friday night, but still trying to get their first division class.
"Although we play without winning, most of us can't know how to play this Denver with audiences and other teams that will compete at the highest level at any point I may meet this year.
How could I not compete in such a contest?"
The Nationals have not yet announced the opening game for Sunday, but it is reported that in such a situation, they tend to let Scherzer join the match.
Scherzer, who's going to start the show for the 34 times, takes training sessions on Thursday and starts the game on Sundays that are usually used to relax.
Pitcher's right-hand Washington's score 18-7 with round-rate (ERA) 2.53 and 300 strike-outs in 220 2/3 this season.
The trumpet was campaigning in West Virginia.
The president voluntarily referred to the situation following the election of the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, when he spoke about the importance of the results of the Republican society in the middle of the election.
"All the effort we've made has been wasted in November.
Five weeks before he made the most important choice in our life.
This is one of the great, great -- I'm not really running that is why I fight everywhere for a great candidate," he said.
The trumpet continues, "You don't see there's a radical radical group that's very scary, you can see it happening right now.
And they decided to take back power in any way, you saw their wickedness, their miracle.
That is what they desire. We do not give them any increase.
Democrats, he says, are in the mission to "reject and block."
"And you saw it during the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats "disgusting and evil and cruel and untrustworthy."
He referred to the Senate of Diane Feinstein, which served on the Senate Committee of the Senate by name, which had been warmly welcomed by his audiences.
"Do you remember the answer?
Are you sure you want to delete this document?
Uh, uh, what.
No, uh no, I'm waiting for it-- it's a very bad body language I've seen."
The Work House is no longer a public service place.
Now be tolerant of anyone who raises his mind
When a Momentum activist in my local party called to threaten me, it didn't surprise me.
After all, I was in the last order of the Parliamentary Members, who were told that our presence was not expected because we had given up.
My colleague in parliament, Joan Ryan, was treated the same way because he strongly defended antisemitism.
In my case, the motions were critical of me because I didn't agree with Jeremy Corbyn.
With regard to the importance of responsible economic performance, national security, in Europe, is an ironic issue that Jeremy Corbyn and former leader faced.
The report for the meeting of East Nottingham workers on Friday says "we want the meeting to be inclusive and productive."
During my nearly eight years of being a member of the local Parliament, the meeting of the General Committee on Friday night was exactly like that.
Unfortunately today, the quality of many meetings and promises about a "better, more kind" policy has not been forgotten for a long time, if indeed it has already begun.
The differences in opinion in the working parties are becoming more and more tolerant and each opinion is being evaluated by the party’s rights.
It started soon after Jeremy became the leader, as a colleague I once thought would be able to share the same political viewpoint, start expecting me to reject and accept the position I had before I would never accept - well in national security and the single market of the European Union.
Whenever I speak openly and care about anything I say - then there will be a social media discussion that asks for a referendum, a central political debate, telling me I shouldn’t be in the party.
And it's not just me who's been through it.
Of course, I knew that I was happier than some of my colleagues because of the comments I received from the politicians.
I admire professionalism and the limitations of my peers who are exposed to sexual harassment or racism every day but who never gave up.
One of the most disturbing aspects of the current political era is how much abuse has been considered normal.
Jeremy Corbyn complained a week ago that the Burhu party should help develop tolerance culture.
The fact is we are no longer in a larger church and with every "untrustable" moss or changing the selection of party rules into a more limited one.
I got a lot of advice for the last two years that motivated me to keep my head down, not too loud, and then I'll say "okay."
But I got involved in politics not to do it.
Since I joined the 32nd class of the Society when I was still a school student, probated by the government’s approval of that understanding school that somehow affected my class, I have tried to find a better public service for those who desperately need it as a local councillor and a government minister.
I have never been in a situation where I have not felt Jehovah’s strength and his guidance.
There's no one in East Nottingham who's gonna question my position of right now and things I don't agree with.
For those who promote museums on Friday, which I can say is when the country moves fast towards the government (Brexit), which will endanger our country's business and public service, I do not want to waste time and energy for loyalty to the leader of the Party.
But really, one of my messages is not for Nottingham Momentum, it's for my constitution, as a member of the Group or not. I'm proud to serve you and I promise that there's no threat of official engagement or any political reality that will prevent me from doing what I believe is the best thing for you all.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Unconquered Ayr to the position above
The last two trials may have been a little overdue, but no doubt Ayr deserves to win the Tennent's Premiership race that is very comforting today.
Now they're in line order, only one side won't win from ten.
In the end, their superior defenses, and their ability to get the best out of it, gave Peter Murchie a team of housekeepers and trainers the right to enjoy themselves.
"We've been trying our game for a long time, and we haven't managed yet, so we're happy," she said.
Robyn Christie from Melrose says, "Thanks to Ayr, they're better off taking chances than we're doing."
Grant Anderson's test at the 14th minute, converted by Frazier Climo, put Ayr in front, but the king's card for Captain Scottland Rory Hughes, was given on that game by Warriors, gave Melrose an opportunity to print numbers and Jason Baggot went through an unconversioned attempt.
Climo extended Ayr's leadership with a talent, before, right in the middle of the time, he printed a bullet and then made a single attempt to make Ayr score 17-5 at rest.
But Melrose started the second half with the good and the Patrick Anderson test that Baggot gave him, reducing the chance to five points.
And there's a long hole because Ruaridh Knott suffered serious injury, was thrown out, and since it started back in the game, Ayr has been going faster than trying Stafford McDowall, changed by Climo.
Captain Ayr Blair Macpherson later received the king's card and again, Melrose made an award player pay with an unchanged Bruce Colvine's test, at the end of the hard-pressure.
The owner has returned to play, but, at the time of St. Hutchinson's receipt of the royal card because of looking for Climo without a ball, from the finish line, MacPherson came behind the most damaged Ayr.
The climate changed, as was the case again, almost since the beginning of the game, after Kyle Rowe made a round-up visit and disturbed the five efforts of Gregor Henry.
The Still Game star looks ready to go through his new career in the restaurant industry.
The Still Game Kieran star appeared ready to move to the service industry after it was previously known that he was charged as a director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56 - year - old Jack Jarvis died at a popular BBC event, which he attended and was also stared at by his ex-computer, Greg Hemphil.
The couple had announced that the serial to nine that would come was the last episode, and Kiernan's mind was planning to drive the race right after Craiglang.
According to the official record list, he is Director of Apionmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the story, although a Scottish Sun source claimed that Kiernan was trying to get involved in a growing restaurant business in Glasgow.
‘The sea is our own: Bolivia, surrounded by countries, hopes that justice will reopen its path to the Pacific.
The seamen made patrols at the large riverbank located in La Paz.
Public buildings attract a blue sea flag.
The link between Lake Titicaca and the Amazon is broken by the motor: "The sea is our own right in a way.
To be resurrected is a duty.
Through Bolivia’s countryside, memories of the success of a sea route to Chile in a 19th - century bloody conflict are still vivid as if it were a dream to once again cross the Pacific Ocean.
That hope may have reached its peak in a few decades, as Bolivia was waiting for the trial to be held on October 1 after five years of consideration.
"Bolivia has a moment, a spirit of unity and peace, and of course a positive hope for the outcome," says Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivian people who will watch ICJ’s presence on a broad list throughout the country, hope that the court in Den Haag will support Bolivia’s request that - after a few decades of thought that prevented it - Chile is obliged to negotiate Bolivia’s sovereignty over the sea.
Evo Morales, the Bolivian private president who has faced a controversial war for the next year's reelection -- also has a lot of support for the New Year's event.
"We are very close to the return of the Pacific Sea," he swore at the end of August.
But some analysts are convinced that the court can't decide Bolivia's will, and that's just gonna change if it's possible.
The UN-based bodies do not have the power to grant the Chilean region, and it has been established that it will not result from the possibility of thinking.
That ICJ's arrest came only six months after the last argument that had been heard, which indicated the case "not complex," said Paz Zárate, an international lawyer in Chile.
And it's still far from continuing Bolivia's demands, in the last four years it may just happen.
"The issue of access to the sea has now been raised by the government of Bolivia," he said.
The aggressive rhetoric of Morales has weakened the reputation of the rest of Chile’s citizens, he says.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to think at some point, but it will be very difficult to keep the discussion going.
The two countries did not become superpowers since 1962.
President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltze, a representative of the Bolivian government in Den Haag, quickly rejected the idea of making a decision.
The Day of the Year will give Bolivia "a wonderful opportunity to open an era of contact with Chile" and an opportunity to "end 139 years of debate with benefit," she says.
Calzadilla also denies that Morales is one of the most famous Latin American presidents who uses maritime issues as a political supporter.
Bolivia will never release its right to have access to the Pacific Ocean," he added.
"It's an opportunity to see what we need to finish the past."
North Korea says nuclear weapons explosions will not happen unless they can trust the U.S.
North Korean Prime Minister Ri Yong Ho said the first country would never commit nuclear weapons if Korea could not trust Washington.
Ri made a statement on the Sabbath at the time of the General Assembly.
He mentioned that the United States entered into an agreement at a meeting in Singapore between the two opposing leaders.
His comment appeared when U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appeared almost beginning a nuclear diplomacy that had lasted more than three months after a meeting with Kim Jong Un from North Korea.
The Ri says only a "all dream" that by continuing to purify and seal up the U.S. against the declaration of the Korean War settlement will make North Korea surrender.
Washington is careful to agree with that statement without Pyongyang which has made an effort to eliminate the armed forces earlier.
Okay, Kim and President A.S. Donald Trump want a second meeting.
But there is a growing doubt that Pyongyang is really about the approval of the country's armed fleet that is the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare a second meeting between Kim and Trump
Show Paris mode shows multiple times the latest collection of heads up to the main road near you
If you want to multiply the topi collections or really want to be protected from sunlight don't look for another one.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne published a series of large-scale finals for their SS19 collection at their fashion exhibitions in Paris Fashion Week.
The really unprofessional top has been spreading Instagram in this summer and these designers have been watching the creation that attracted the eyes of the performers.
What comes out of Valentino is a cream top that is covered with a wide striped fabric covering the model’s head.
Large accessories include such items as leather, leather, and even leather, but not such items as leather or cloth.
Thom Browne also showed a group of strangely and precisely rounding Halloween.
Many colored balls that are on the move are the same color as Hannibal Lecter, which is similar to that of the Haute Couture.
A creature that resembles a ship’s shell is equipped with a snorkel and eyeglasses, while others are seen as flickering ice cream.
And if you keep going through the bigger mode collection -- then you're winning.
Mode monitors think that this big top collection will be based on the main road near you.
The big tops became a very loose train in 'La Bomba', the tops with two legs wide open were used by everyone including Rihanna until Emily Ratajkowski.
The glory of the label on the back of a very unencumbered top of social media makes a great creation in coastal catwalks of almost the same size as light clothing - used with a single model.
The burning wall ceiling, surrounded by the ceiling with a white cap, is a collection of Jacquemus' La Riviera SS19 in Paris Fashion Week.
Luke Armitage's famous hairdresser said to the FCC: "I hope to see a big towel and a beach bag arrive on the main road for the summer -- since designers have made great appearances, it will be difficult to ignore the demands for this great accessories."
John Edward: Language skills are very important to global citizens
Scotland's swastika school maintained academia, and it was continued in 2018 with outstanding results, which were enhanced by each student and collective success in sports, art, music, and hard work.
With more than 30,000 students throughout Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scotland Swavata School Hall (SCIS), are working hard to provide the best service for students and adults.
The school is designed to equip its students for higher education, careers, and careers as citizens of the world.
As an educational sector capable of developing and implementing school curriculums as expected, we saw the modern language continue to be the focus of popular and desired education in many schools.
Nelson Mandela says: "If you speak to someone in the language he understands, your words will go into his head.
If you speak to him in his speech then your words will enter into his heart."
It's a strong reminder that we can't just rely on English if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From the latest test this year, we can see that language is the top position of the table with the highest performance in single school.
Total 68 percent of foreign - language students get a value of A Plus.
On this date, 74 SCIS schools have been collected showing that 72 percent of students have A Plus in Mandarin, while 72 percent of those who have learned German, 69 percent of those who have learned French and 63 percent who have learned Spanish also have A.
This shows that a high school in Scotland supports foreign language as an important skills that children and adolescents will certainly need in the future.
Currently languages, as the choice of eye lessons, are set in the same standard as those of STEM (Scientific, technology, records and mathematics) in modern school curriculums and elsewhere.
A survey carried out by the British Labour and Skills Service in 2014 found that for some reason employers had to keep fighting against people, 17 percent of them were less language skills.
As a result, language skills are strengthened to prepare young people for their future careers.
As more and more people have access to the language they need, such skills are essential in a global environment.
Whatever a person's choice of career, if they've learned a second language, in the future they'll feel real benefits because they've had this whole life.
You can communicate directly with people from foreign countries who will automatically make a successful multilinguisher in competition.
According to a poll of over 4,000 English adults in 2013, 75 percent of them did not speak a foreign language well enough to speak French and became the only language spoken in two percent, 15 percent.
That's why investing in language learning for children now is important for now.
Having multilingual ability, especially in countries with a growing economy, will provide children with a better opportunity to find meaningful work.
In Scotland, each school will teach different languages.
Some schools will focus on more classical modern languages, while others will teach what is considered to be the most important language in England for the next few years, namely 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child’s interests, there will always be a number of languages that can be selected at a single school, with a qualified teacher in this field.
The school in Scotland is directed to provide a learning environment that will prepare children and equip them with the skills needed to succeed, whatever happens in the future.
It cannot be concluded that now, in the global business environment, language will always be an important aspect of determining the future of the country, so this must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern language must really be considered as "the training of international communication."
The school itself will continue to offer these choices to young people in Scotland.
You have to do it.
John Edward is head of the School for Scotland
LeBron's going to take a dance for Lakers on Sunday at San Diego.
The desire of the fans to see LeBron James starts his debut for Los Angeles Lakers is almost over.
Teacher Lakers Luke Walton has announced that James will play in the opening of the Sunday season against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
However, it is not yet determined how many minutes he will play.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," said Walton on the official Lakers website.
Reporter Lakers Mike Trudell wrote tweets that James might be playing just a few minutes.
After this week’s training, James was asked about his plans for the sixth Lakers season.
"In my career right now, I don't need to do a summer game to be prepared," he said.
General Transport Programme in West Virginia, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump started a general meeting tonight at Wheeling, Virginia West.
It's the first general meeting of the five general meetings scheduled for next week, including a stop in some fun places around Tennessee and Mississippi.
After being instructed that a voter is required to elect a High Court officer, Trump intends to build support for him for his general election due to the fact that the Republic Party is at risk of losing control of Congress if a vote is taken in November.
How much time do you spend in West Virginia's public meeting tonight and how can you watch closely?
The general trumpet in Wheeling, Virginia West was scheduled for 7 p.m. ET tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch a public summit in West Virginia by means of direct YouTube channels.
Perhaps Trump will discuss this week with the Supreme Court of Great Britain Kavanaugh, who has become increasingly insistent after charges of sexual misconduct and the opinion that the Senate's hearing will be postponed until one week while the FBI is investigating it.
But the main purpose of this public meeting is to help the Republicans to get some time off from the November elections.
As a result, President Trump's campaign said that five general meetings this week are aimed at "encouraging volunteers and supporters because the Republican parties are trying to protect and expand the majority they hold in Senate and DPR," says Reuters.
"The control of Congress is so important for its agenda that the president will probably travel to the countries of the party while we are in the busy campaign," said a spokesman for the Trump campaign who refused to mention his name to Reuters.
Planned for Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, tonight's general meeting is expected to provide support from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and attracting broadcasts from Pittsburgh media," according to West Virginia Metro News.
On Saturday will be a second trip to West Virginia in the last month, the country that he visited with more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump tried to help Patrick Morrisey, a candidate for the West Virginia Senate of the left-wing Republic Party.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president should come as an effort to improve his ability in the field of opinion," said Simon Haeder, a politician at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. Army team defends its hope in the day-to-day fight
After three sessions one-sided, foursome Saturday evening sessions are probably needed in this Ryder Cup.
The idea of a moment’s flag is a sports concept that is fully believed by players, and nothing is more than a competition.
Where do they think is the moment now?
"In the past, they won six points and now four, so I think we think it's a little bit of a moment," Jordan Spieth complained last day.
Europe certainly has benefits because it won four points with another twelve games.
But the American team, like Spieth said, feels they have a little bit of moments and they have many things that can be exciting, except the Spieth and Justin Thomas formations that play together all day and each raise three of the four points.
Spieth has been playing by killing from the tea area to the green area and leading with excitement.
The wave of celebrity is getting stronger when it's round, making an important call to make a series of games when he and Thomas lose two against two.
The call from her who won them at number 15 that was invited with similar applause, the announcement that lets you know that she's sure America isn't lost.
"It's not really supposed to work harder and worry about your own game," said Spieth.
All these players are gone now.
18 to be determined.
The only player with more points than Spieth and Thomas for two days yesterday is Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, an unforgettable story from Ryder Cup.
A unique but attractive couple from Europe are four to four and can do it without making mistakes.
"Moliwood" is the only couple who didn't do bogey talk on Saturday evening, but they also stopped from bogey on Saturday morning, Saturday afternoon and back inne on Friday morning.
That run, and how their energy seems to go well to both of this vast crowd that convinces them that they are the players to be defeated on Sunday, and no more famous than Fleetwood and Molinari will unlock Europe's potential for winning at the most sunny day on Le Golf National.
It's better if the two of them are placed in a different hall at the same time.
But it is still too late to talk about Europe’s success.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson worked on Sergio Garcia, a field fighter, when she was shot by Alex Noren.
One bogey and two doubles on the Nine front like looking for a hole that will never be reached by these Spanish and Swedish golf players.
However, on Sunday no one can help you get out of the hall.
Fourballs and foursomes are a good show to be seen closer because of the interaction between couples, the advice they give, the advice they don't give, and how strategies can change for a while.
Long ago, Europe played better as a team and led quite a long way to the final day, but the forum also showed that the US team had a chance to compete even though some parties doubted, especially in the United States.
Europe won 10-6 on the last day of Ryder Cup
Europe will benefit from the final day of Ryder Cup after the rise of the fourball and foursome Saturdays by leading 10-6 on the United States.
Two inspired Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led by two victories over Tiger Woods who had to fight to record their points this far in Le Golf National with four points.
The European team Thomas Bjorn, who wanted to protect the recently found trophies in Hazeltine two years ago, dominates the American team that was wrong in the morning's fourball, making this series 3-1.
The United States has fought more and more in its forums, winning two games, but it has not been able to reduce its deficit.
Jim Furyk's team needs eight points of 12 matches every Sunday to protect the trophi.
Fleetwood is the first European runner who won four consecutive points, while he and Molinari, who were called "Mollwood" after the end of the season, became only the second couple who won four points of their four openings in the Ryder Cup.
After winning Woods and Patrick Reed in their Fourballs, they became very strong to win the Wounds, which blew up the American bryson Dechambeau with more than 5&4.
Woods, who forced himself through two games on the Sabbath, once appeared to be drunk but he had lost 19 of the 29 matches in fourballs and foursomes and a series of sevens.
Justin Rose, retired at the morning’s fourball, then returned to marry Henrik Stanson in his foursome and lost 2&1 from Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - a 1 and 3 worlds.
Europe did not reach its own level, despite the fact that it was enjoying its day and race in the west of Paris.
The three main winners Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set off for the United States two points on the Sabbath.
They won 2&1 that attracted Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter from Spain in fourball and then back to defeat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 in foursome after the first two holes were lost.
It's just two times in the history of Ryder Cup where a team returns from the defense four points into the single game, although as a team fighting Furyk only needs a series of points to protect the trophies.
However, after two days of being best - off, the attack seemed to be overdue.
North Korea says 'not possible' will shoot a gun on the other side without trust.
On Saturday, North Korea's Foreign Minister informed the U.S. government of their continuing sanctions that would further deepen their distrust of the United States and that it would not be possible for the country to tear its own nuclear weapons apart in such a situation.
Ri Yong Ho told the world's General Assembly this year that North Korea has taken "fashioned meanings that show good intentions" last year, such as ending nuclear and missile testing, exposing nuclear testing sites, and promising not to develop nuclear weapons and nuclear technologies.
"But we didn't see any proper attitude from the United States," he said.
"Without belief in the United States there will be no confidence in our national security and in such a situation we will not be able to tear our own weapons apart first."
While Ri brings back the same complaint from North Korea about Washington's resistance to the "fashioned" approach to demilitarization where North Korea will be punished for taking the step forward, a significant statement was announced that they did not completely refuse as Pyongyang did in the past.
Ri refers to the statement made by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the summit between the US President and North Korean leaders this time in Singapore on June 12, at which time Kim promised to "incorporate Korea" while Trump promised North Korea security.
North Korea had officially wanted the end of the Korean War 1950-53, but the United States said Pyongyang had to stop its nuclear weapons earlier.
Washington also refused to appeal for international sanctions in North Korea.
"The United States is struggling with "the first revolution" and increases pressure with the sacred gift to achieve their goal firmly, and even refuses "the end of the war," says Ri.
"The assumption that sanctions can make us sink is the illusion of people who don't know about us.
But the problem is that it's going to keep going. It's going to make us lose our faith."
Ri didn't mention an article for the second summit between Kim and Trump, which was held by the U.S. leaders in the United States this week.
The mayor even missed three meetings between Kim and South Korea's leader Moon Jae-in in the last five months and added: "If the most difficult part of this denouncing is South Korea and not the United States, the total demarcation of Korea will not reach this kind of point."
However, no dramatically different from last year's, when he spoke to the General Assembly that stressing North Korea's rocket in the United States is something that cannot be denied after "Mr. President Devil" Trump called Kim "man of rocket" on a suicide mission.
This year at a meeting of the PBB, a year-old Trump threatened to "destruct" North Korea in total, commending Kim for her courage to take action to get rid of it, but that big job still has to be done and sanctions must still be done until North Korea has committed a demolition.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no time limit for this, "If it takes two years, three or five months, it's okay," he said.
Tingkok and Russia believe that the UN Security Council must punish Pyongyang on the steps taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, told the U.S. National Security Council on Wednesday that "the Sanctions of the Security Council should be continued strictly and should not fail until we know that complete, final and verification reductions are complete."
The House of Security with the voice of lightning has been increasing its sanctions for North Korea since 2006 as an attempt to halt the development of nuclear programmes and anti-political missiles by Pyongyang.
Pompeo met Ri at the General Assembly Hall and said after that he was going to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his final journey was not successful.
He left Pyongyang in July and said that there was actually progress, only North Korea in an hour's delay that he was making "the demand like a gangster."
North Korea promised at a meeting with Moon this month to expose the missile position and also the nuclear complex if the United States took "the right action."
He said that Kim told him to do "the right thing" with his will was security security that Trump promised in Singapore and moved towards normalization of the relationship with Washington.
Harvard professors take a course on enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year makes all S1 students sleep there more, in an effort to combat the culture of macho in the study that is developing through 'humans of ghost birds' playing coffee.
One academic found that students at the university of the number one world often don't know anything if they discuss very basic things about how to protect themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep specialization at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, planning a course, which he was sure was the first of his kind in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after giving training about a lack of sleep at school.
'At last a girl came to me and said, 'Why did I just get to know now, in my last year?'
The girl said no one ever told me the importance of sleeping--which surprised me," she told The Telegraph.
The course that was first launched this year explained to students how good sleep habits contribute to academic and athletic performances, as well as to improving their general health.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and the executive director of university health services, said that the university decided to introduce this course after finding a very low number of students to sleep during the week.
The course for this one hour involves clarifying an interactive task.
In one session there was a picture of an assarami room, where students would click on a cup of coffee, tea, gymnasium, and books to get an explanation about the effects of caffeine and light, as well as how athletic results are affected by sleep deprivation, and how important it is to have a regular time to sleep.
On the other hand, researchers have found an explanation of how long sleep deprivation can increase risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression, and cancer.
A map of a campus, with interactive icons, then moves the poets to think about their daily routine.
'We know this won't change student behavior immediately.
But we are convinced that they have the right to know--like you have the right to know the effect of choosing to smoke on health,' said Prof. Czeisler.
The culture of pride with 'begand' is still there, it's also added that modern technology and pressure that continues to increase on students that mean a lack of sleep is a growing problem.
To make sure you sleep well enough, with good quality, must be 'secret weapon' to combat stress, fatigue, and fatigue, its thirst - even to avoid weight gain, because lack of sleep causes the brain to activate hunger mode, leading to continued hunger.
Raymond So, 19 - year - old California student of chemistry and physics who helped Professor Czeisler to design the course, took one of his classes last year in Harvard.
He said this course had opened his eyes and inspired him to organize the course for the entire campus.
Next, she hoped that all her teachers would be instructed to complete the same study program before joining a competitive institution.
Prof. Czeisler recommends that students consider setting up a bedtime alarm, also a wake-up alarm, and recognize the effects of the 'blue light' that are spread by electronic lights and LED light, which can control your current rhythm when you get out of its schedule to cause sleep problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Gol Menga lowers the military mind of Gerard
By the way, Rangers felt the sadness of the day when Dolly Menga's attack took away his divorced Steven Gerard team at 1-0 in Livingston.
The Ibrox team has been trying to record their first victory on their journey, since the 4-1 victory in February in St Johnstone, but the Gary Holt team has just won a second victory for Gerard in 18 games as manager, causing its team to lose eight points from the Leader of the Ladbrokes Premiership Hearts.
To attack seven minutes before the first game is over and the Rangers who lose their minds don't seem to be moving.
While Rangers now down to the sixth position, Livingston went to the third position, only left the hibernian gol leaves.
And maybe there'll be more problems in the Rangers cell after the Calum Spence line guard has to be treated because of the headache after an object thrown away from the distance.
Gerard made eight changes to the Ayr team to the Betfred Cup semifinal.
On the contrary, Holt went with the same Livi 11 who took one point from Hearts last week and he'll be happy with the costumes that challenge them at every opportunity.
Rangers may dominate the possession of balls, but Livingston uses the balls they have better.
They should've written the score in just two minutes when the first one was released by Scott Pittman through Allan McGregor's pocket, but that's a great opportunity too wide.
A free Keaghan Jacobs in there met Captain Craig Halkett but his guardian Alan Lithgow could only be included in the background.
Rangers took control, but it seemed that there was more hope for them than for their third game.
Alfredo Morelos must have felt that he was supposed to get a lawyer when he and Steven Lawless stepped on the mark for four hours but Steven Thomson's agent refused to join this Colombian citizen.
Rangers were able to make only two explosions on the first floor, but the former Ibrox guard, Liam Kelly, never had any problems with the head of Lassana Couliby and Ovie Ejaria, who were easily shot.
Although the opening goal of Livi at the 34th may be contrary to his way of fighting, no one can deny that they deserve it because of their hard work themselves.
Once again, Rangers failed to cope with the tactics of deep Jacobs' death.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher put a ball into Scott Robinson, who remained calm and chose Menga for a simple end.
Gerard acted when he rested by replacing Coulibaly with Ryan Kent and the change was very powerful when the jumper put the ball on Morelos but Kelly was playing fast out of the line to stop.
But Livingston continued to force the team to play the exact game they enjoyed, with Lithgow and Calcutta playing all the games.
The Holt team should have spread their tension at the final stage but McGregor stood up to welcome Jacobs before Lithgow pulled out his ass.
Rangers' replacement player, Glenn Middleton, complained about the talent while he was in contact with Jacobs, but then Thomson turned on his face.
Almanac: Geiger’s Readers
And now from our Almanac "Sunday Morning" page: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, and CENTURY TERUS BERTMBAH... day when future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed methods of detecting and condemning radioactivity, which was one of the findings that finally made the device known as Geiger's Reader.
Since then, Geiger's readers have also become popular with pop culture, such as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado," stared by Cuban scientists who seem to be less convinced, namely Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: What's that?
Rogers: "This is Geiger's reader, used to find radioactive mineral locations, such as uranium.
When you use this earphone, you can actually hear the effects of atoms released by radioactivity in the mineral."
Evans said, "Tell me, it must be working now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
Yet, that discovery preserved his name.
The new cancer vaccine teaches the immune system to 'know' evil cells
The new cancer vaccine teaches immune systems to 'know' evil cells and kill them
The vaccine teaches immune systems to recognize bad cells as part of treatment
The method involves extracting immune cells from patients, turning them into laboratories.
Then they can't get to know the general protein on a lot of cancers and then they're cut back again.
A test vaccine shows the effect of promise on patients with various types of cancer.
A woman treated with this vaccine, which teaches her immune system to identify the bad cell, her ovarian cancer has disappeared for more than 18 months.
This method involves the process of extraction of the patient's immune cells, transforming them into the laboratory so that they can "know" the protein that is common to many cancers called HER2, and then withdraw that cell back.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, from the United States Cancer League in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "The result is that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "increasing the growth of certain types of cancer," including breast cancer, ovary, paru-paru, and colorectal cancer, Professor Berzofsky explained.
The same approach as the nine immune cells of patients and "teaching" them how to stimulate cancer cells has been successful in treating one type of leukemia.
Kanye West Started Diatribe Pro-Trump, wear MAGA Top, after its SNL appearance.
Not walking well
Kanye West was interviewed at a studio during Saturday Night Live after he found himself in a crash where he praised US President Donald Trump and said he was going to commit himself in 2020.
After taking the third night's song, Ghost Town circled where he wore the Mac American Great Cup, he fought against the Democratic Party and turned his back on Trump.
"And I used to talk to white people and they said, "How can you like Trump, he's racist?"
Yes, if I'm worried about racism, I've been out of America for a long time," she says.
The SNL began a demonstration by Matt Damon's star, where Hollywood star, Brett Kavanaugh, in front of the Senate's Judicial Committee on sexual violence complaints made by Christine Blasey Ford, began.
Although not announced, the West-West record was taken to social media by Comrade Chris Rock.
I don't know if Rock's trying to cross the West with that spell.
In addition, West complained to the audience that he was having trouble in the back of the tower because of the stolen roof.
"They put me in the back of the stairs.
They said, 'Don't go out with that hat.'
They bit me!
And then they said I'm in the middle," she said, according to Washington Examiner.
West goes on: "Do you want to see a dark spot?" says he'll wear Superman's shoes, because this means you can't figure out what I'm supposed to do.
Try to love."
Its comments resulted in at least two of the spectators and SNL performances appear to be embarrassed, Variety reported, with one person telling: "All the studios are tertiary."
West was brought in the last few hours as a substitute for the singer Ariana Grande, the former rap singer Mac Miller who just died a few days ago.
West confuses many people with the appearance of the song I love it, dressed like Botol Perrier.
West received support from the head of the TPUSA Conservative Group, Candace Turner, who wrote twitter: "For one of the bravest souls: THE TIME OF LOVE TPUSA."
But Karen Hunter's director wrote a tweet that West was just "it's self-contained and it's really great."
"But I choose for TIDAK to find someone (by buying music or clothing or by supporting his "synonyms") whom I believe to wear and combat dangerous ideology for my community.
He's free.
So do we," he added.
Before the show, the rap singer announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that he is now "the officially known as Kanye West."
He was not the first artist to change his name and follow the kind of artist Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy, and P Diddy.
Like rap singer, Snoop Dogg got the name Snoop Lion and certainly won Prince's music legend, turning it into a symbol and then an artist who was previously known as Prince.
Request for an attempted murder on a rapist at the Belfast restaurant.
A 45-year-old man was charged with attempted murder after a man was admitted to a restaurant in East Belfast on Friday.
The incident occurred in Ballyhackmore, a police statement.
The guards were expected to appear before the Belfast State Court on Sunday.
This charge will be dropped by the General Court.
The Star Game of Thrones Kit Harington criticises toxic masculinity
Kit Harrington is known for his role as Jon Snow in a series of medieval fantasies filled with violence by HBO Game of Thrones.
But this actor, 31, attending the macho hero stereotype, says that the role on that kind of list makes teenagers often feel they need to be strong to be respected.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit says he's convinced 'there's something wrong' and asks how to deal with the worst masculinity problem in the era #MeToo.
Kit, who recently married his game at Game of Thrones Rose Leslie, also 31, admits he's "hard enough" to discuss that issue.
'I feel personally, quite strong, now--where are we at fault in this masculinity thing?' he said.
'What do we teach men when they grow up, the problem we see now?'
Kit believes television may be responsible for the appearance of bad masculinity with its very masculinity characters.
He continued: ‘What is the character from birth, and what does it teach?
What does it teach on TV, and on the street, that makes boys feel they have to have this side to be men?
I think it's really one big question right now -- how do we change it?
'Cause obviously there's something wrong with the young people.'
In that interview he also admits that he won't play in the prequal or secondary Game of Thrones when this series will end the summer coming, saying that he's already 'completed with war and horses'.
Since November, Kit's going back to the True West from Sam Shepard, that's the story of the film producer and his brother, who's a bunch.
The recent actor revealed that he thought meeting with his wife Rose was the best reason to get out of Game of Thrones.
'I met my wife in this show, so I gave my family the future, and from here my life began' she said.
Rose played Ygristte, the love flower of Kit's character Jon Snow, in this Emmy's winning fantasy series.
This couple was married in June 2018 in the area where Leslie’s family lived in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: Tingkok reports 14% of the duration of the new case
Tingkok has announced 14 percent of its population living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people were displaced in this country, says health officials.
About 40,000 new cases were reported on the second quarter of 2018.
The majority of the new case was released through sex, making changes in the past.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly through some parts of Tingkok as a result of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people who live with HIV in this way has declined to nearly zero, says Tingkok’s health authority at a conference in the Greek province of Greece.
Yet, from year to year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in Tingkok has increased to 100,000.
Sexual transmission of HIV is a serious problem in the Tingkok LGBT community.
Homosexuality was criminalized in Tingkok in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is said to be increasing.
According to this country's conservative value, the study suggests that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women.
Many sexually transmitted diseases are caused by a lack of adequate sexual protection.
Since 2003, the Tingkok government has pledged universal access to HIV treatment as part of its efforts to address the problem.
Maxine Waters argues that the staff has corrupted GOP senator data, spreading 'dangerous lies' and 'conspiracy theory'
The representative of Maxine Waters on Saturday complained that one member of his staff had sent personal information to the three senators of the United States Party of America to the Wikipedia page of parliamentarians.
The Democratic Party of Los Angeles asserts that this claim is motivated by experts and the "ultra-right swing" website.
"A lie, a lie, and many other lies are disgusting," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
It is reported that written information includes home address and U.S. Senator's phone number. Lindsey Graham from South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, all from Utah.
This information appeared on Thursday, which was sent by people unknown to Capitol Hill during the Senate panel meeting on sexual charges of sexual misconduct against the Chief Justice Brett Kavanaugh.
This box appeared shortly after the three senators asked Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the shipment was linked to the Waters office and disclosed information from one of the Waters staff, Hill reported.
"The charge is not based on this is really wrong and is a outright lie," Waters continues.
"My staff members -- who are identified, personal information, and their safety are threatened by the consequences of the accusations that lie and wrong -- are at least not responsible for the indiscriminateness of this information.
That is indeed a monstrous lie.’
Waters ’ statements quickly attract critical attention, including from the Secretary of the White Building, Ari Fleischer.
"It means anger," Fleisher wrote.
"So this shows he's not fit to be a Congressman.
If a person is held responsible for something he has not done, he or she may not be able to do so.
They could not afford to travel.
They cannot question the motives of the oppressed.
They will be at peace and at peace."
Fleisher appeared to compare the Waters reaction to the democratic criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, which critics have been accused of being too angry during the Kamish day.
Omar Navarro, a member of the Republican party who is trying to get water at the time, also tweeted his thoughts on Twitter.
"Great if it's true," he wrote on Twitter.
In his statement, Water said his office had warned "the proper authority and the law enforcement entity about this wrong charge.
"We'll make sure that the defendant gets caught," he continued, "and they'll be legally responsible for all their destructive and dangerous actions for one and all my staff."
Johnny English Strikes Again - Rowan Atkinson's missing eye
Now looking for the meaning of Brexit in each new film with the common view of England has become a tradition and it seems to be the return of Johnny English comedy parodes - which began in 2003 with Johnny English and returned to life in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Would you like to know more about how bad it is for us to become the new country?
In any case, the elderly Johnny Englishman, the cartoonist, and the lack of skills has changed his license to ruin everything for the second time - giving more than anything that he is a wide-ranging comical creation designed for language cinemas other than English.
Of course he was a crazy secret agent who, from his strange guess, had some Clouseau character, Mr. Bean's character, and a little bit of the windmill that contributed some notes to the Chariots of Fire topic at the London Olympic opening event 2012.
In fact, it's based on the international actor and mystery man who played Atkinson on the now forgotten Barclaycard TV commercial, leaving the mess behind him.
There's one or two sweet moments on this new JE trip.
I like it when Johnny English approaches the helicopter by wearing the middle century green clothes and the rotor balls with a quick approach to his helmet.
Atkinson's present for physical comedy was shown, but his humor felt a lack of sleep and too weird, especially when the "serius" movie branding like 007 and Mission Impossible has convinced itself to insert comedy as a material.
The humor seems to be directed to children from adults, and to me are a variety of unscientific Johnny English characters and the focus of Atkinson's films in Bean's personality.
The premise that's been burning for these years is that England is in serious trouble.
A cyberlogist has entered a super-secret English web site, covering the identity of all British agents in the field, to disappoint the responsible agent -- it's just a small part for Kevin Eldon.
This is the last opportunity for the proud and opposed metro race, which has destroyed its entire population politically: Emma Thompson fought very well with almost-Teresa-May character but not much could have been done from his point of view.
His wise advice gave him information that since every active eye had been weakened, he had to bring someone out of retirement time.
And that means Johnny English's uncle himself, now employed as head of school in some hard buildings, but he gave us a secret lesson about how to perform the surgery: there are some good jokes here, when English offers a visual academia like School of Rock.
English was returned to Whitehall for the funeral and reunited with old friends who had been suffering for years, namely Bough, by Ben Miller again.
Bough is now married, stranding a sailor, the role of a woman in the upper class where Vicki Pepperdine was recently eliminated.
So Batman and Robin, who made a mistake on your Secret Agent back in action, met a beautiful mystery woman named Olga Kurylenko.
In the meantime, the metropolis has been worrying about falling into the influence of millions of charismatic technology that admit to solving English computer problems: evil Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough began their consonance: as servants, they burned French fast restaurants; they made a mess by climbing onto the Volta's own boat; and English moved anarchy when he tried to use the headset Virtual Reality to fill himself with the inner Volta house.
All the interruptions are of course interesting for the last sequence, but with such noise and noise, there are a few children's TV shows that have everything about them.
It's quite moderate.
And like any other Johnny English film, I can't think: couldn't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a really good role for his team?
The mob was planning plans for the British to work four days a week but paid five days.
Jeremy Corbyn of the United States considered a radical project that required four days of work but five days of pay.
It was reported that the owners of the company wanted to continue to appreciate the results of the industrial revolution (AI) for workers by giving them more leisure time.
He will let his workers enjoy the end of the present three days, but he will still have the same reward.
Some sources say that this idea will be "pass" with the party's economic agenda and articles urging the country to support workers.
The four - day program was approved by the British Congress as a way for workers to feel the benefits of economic change.
One source, the senior of the U.S. Army, told The Sunday Times: "The report on this event is expected to be published before the end of this year.
'This won't happen in the evening, but four days of work in a week is an aspiration that is consistent with party approach to develop a return to the economy that supports workers and industry strategies as a whole.'
The Group is not the first to support this idea, since the White Party has promised four working days a week on the 2017 general election campaign.
However, this is not the time for all members of the Governing Body to take sides in any social issues.
And when he had spoken unto them, he said, It is not lawful for a man to eat of the fruit of the tree, nor yet drink of the fruit of the tree:
The President John McDonnell used the conference last week to complete his vision of the social revolution in the economic field.
McDonnell says he's determined to take back power from 'anonymous director' and 'catants' in the utility company.
The article cancels out this view also means that the current holder of the drinking water company may not be able to get back to the whole world because the government of the Party can do 'lost' for what it feels like.
He also made sure that his plan was to place workers at the company’s premises and create an Inclusive Property Gift that would pay 10 percent of the company’s share in the insurance sector to employees, which would end the annual divide up to £500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy told "60 Minutes" if FBI research about Kavanaugh could change their view
The FBI's investigation of the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has put an end to the vote on his own attorney at the Supreme Court for at least one week, and raises questions as to whether this meeting of the Bureau could affect senators from the Republican Party to withdraw their support.
In a talk given on Sunday, the "60 Minutes" correspondent Scott Pelley asked Senator of the Republican Party. John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham, if the FBI could find something that could change their mind.
Kennedy seems to be more open than his partner from South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," said Kennedy.
"I said I'd attend a meeting, I said, I've spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this incident, and the charge appeared, and I said, "Why don't you do it?"
He's a strong, determined man."
However, it seems that Graham’s voice will not be changed.
"I think I've decided about Brett Kavanaugh, and I need a bigger charge to change it," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what's going on, but what I know is: Brett hit it hard," Graham added, pointing to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And all the people he named cannot verify his name.
It's 36 years old.
I don't see any new changes."
What does it mean to be a Global Citizen Festival, and what does it mean to do something about poverty?
On this Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual event that features the star’s range that is most striking, as well as an effective mission; the end of poverty in the world.
Now, in the seventh year, Global Citizen Festival will be a witness to tens of thousands of people coming to the Great Lawn in Central Park not only to enjoy the actions of Janet Jackson, Cardi B, and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of this event's real goal of ending extreme poverty in 2030.
Global Citizen Festival, launched in 2012, is a follow-up to the Global Poverty Project, a group of international lawyers hoping to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting poverty.
In order to get free tickets for this event (except that you want to pay the VIP ticket), the concert finisher must complete a task or "action" such as being willing to send e-mail to world leaders, calling, or other means of doing something that will help improve their commitment to end poverty.
But how has the Global Citizen achieved its goal over the past 12 years?
Is the idea of giving a gift to free concerts is the right way to invite people to do something, or is it just another case called "clickivism" - people feel like they make real difference by signing an online dating or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has written more than 19 million "actions" from its supporters, encouraging them to set other goals.
It has been said that this action has helped to make world leaders announce a commission and a deal of more than $37 billion that will affect more than 2.25 billion people in 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, this group has collected 390 commissions and announcements from their actions, at least $10 billion of which have been filed or filed.
It is estimated that nearly 649 million people around the world have been exposed to this long - standing threat.
Some of the main commissions are The Power of Nutrition, a campaign based in England by investors and executives to "help children grow up to their maximum potential," the promise will give Rwanda $35 million to help end gender shortages in that country after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizen.
"With the support of the British government, the contribution, the national government, and the Global Citizen like you, we can make social injustice about this gender deficiency a record in history," said The Power of Nutrition, Tracey Ullman told London's audience on April 2018.
This group also says that after more than 5,000 actions are taken to improve nutrition for mothers and children in England, the government has announced a bill for a project, Power of Nutrition, which will extend to five million women and children through nutrition.
To answer one of the questions on their website that ask "What makes you think we can end this extreme poverty?"
Global citizens respond: "This will be a long and hard way -- sometimes we'll fall and fail.
But just like the movement of civil rights and the great anti-parity that existed before us, we'll succeed, because if we're united we'll be stronger.
Janet Jackson, Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monée are some of the stars that appear at this year's event in New York, which will be guided by Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The U.S. can use the Red Sea as a "blockade" to slow Russian energy exports - Secretary of State
"If necessary" Washington could ask for help from the Red Sea to prevent Russia's energy from reaching the market, including in the Middle East, US Secretary Ryan Zingke revealed, as Washington Examiner put it.
Zinke strongly believes that Russia’s involvement in Syria - in particular, in its place of operations on a fair government invitation - is a country to explore a new energy market.
"I'm sure the reason they're in the Middle East is they want to be energy designers, as they do in Eastern Europe, the southern part of Europe," he reports.
And, according to that office, there are ways and means to prevent it.
"The United States has that ability, with our Marine Corps, to ensure open sea routes, and, if necessary, to blockade, to ensure that their energy is not available to the market," he said.
Zinke spoke in front of the participants of the event organized by the Alliance for Energy, a group of nirlabs that called himself "a power dealer" in the U.S.
He compared Washington's approach to a deal with Russia and Iran, seeing that in terms of efficiency, they are the same.
"The economic choices in Iran and Russia are less than, benefiting and replacing fuel," he said, pointing to Russia as one of "the experts in the field" with an economy that depends on fossil fuels.
This statement appears when Trump's government representatives are carrying out missions in order to increase their emissions of natural gas into Europe, replace Russia, a much easier choice for Europeans.
To that end, Trump's government officials, including US President Donald Trump's own, are trying to get Germany to withdraw from the North Stream 2 "unsuitable" pipeline project, according to Trump, making Berlin "slave" Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the North Stream oil pipeline project is worth $11 billion, which is designed to reduce the oil pipeline capacity of up to 110 billion cubic metres, is a clean economic project.
Kremlin argues that Washington's violent opposition to this project is simply motivated by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I am sure we have the same view that energy cannot be made up of tools to make pressure and that consumers must be able to choose their own way," said Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak after meeting with the Energy Minister AS Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
This US attitude has attracted reactions from Germany, which has reaffirmed their commitment to this project.
The German Federation of German Industries (BDI) noted that the United States has asked the United States not to participate in the European Union's energy operations and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I will face a major problem if the third country throws out our energy forces," says Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) after the most recent meeting between Chancellor of Germany Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will "record the situation" When He Takes Over as President in 2020, Senator Massachusetts's Word
On Saturday, Senator Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren said he would "record the situation" when he resigned as president after a half-time election.
When she campaigned at the city hall in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren insisted that she consider herself a failure.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and improve our bourgeois rule, including put women in a position of tart," she told The Hill.
"After 6 November, I'll take a picture of the situation when I step down as president."
Warren compared himself to President Donald Trump when he campaigned at the city hall, saying he "takes this area to the wrong direction.
"I'm very concerned about what Donald Trump did to our democracy," he said.
Warren's blackmailing his criticism of Trump and the Chief Justice Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Wednesday, Warren says "we definitely need the FBI investigation before we make a vote."
However, an opinionist who wrote on Thursday showed that most of Warren’s own constitution did not want him to take his place in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of the "probability" voters in Massachusetts say that the senator does not go beyond himself, according to the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
32 percent of the people who support the campaign.
The survey showed more support for Governor Deval Patrick’s mission to self - defense, with 38 percent supporting the possibility of suicide and 48 percent resisting it.
Other important names in the Democratic Party that were discussed about the possibility of self-determination in 2020 include the mandate of President Joe Biden and Senator Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Biden says he'll decide it officially in January, Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin took PTSD Track Palin on Donald Trump's campaign
Track Palin, 26 years old, spent one year in Iraq after entering the army in September.
He was arrested and imprisoned in the violence in his marriage on Sunday night.
"What happened to my son, what will happen when he comes back, I can contact other families who also experience the consequences of PTSD and some of our military injuries," he said in front of the participants attending the campaign for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin refers to his arrest as "in the room" and tells about his son and other veterans: "When they return with a little different, they return with greater force, they return with respect to what they have given, including soldiers and fugitives and every other member of the army to the country."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, plus reports of domestic violence and possession of weapons in drinking situations, according to Dan Bennett, head of the Police Department of Vasilla.
18 partner countries, D.C., support the challenge of new tax implementation
Eighty - eight countries and the District of Columbia support the legal challenge of the new U.S. practice that has refused to sacrifice for victims who have fled from gangs or domestic violence.
The representative of the 18-member countries and districts drew friends-of-the-court brief on Sunday in Washington to support the polls against this reality, NBC News reported.
The full name of Grace v. of the U.S. Civil Liberties Union session in August on federal events has not yet been revealed.
He said his partner "and his son who is a violent gang member," he was disappointed, but the U.S. officials rejected his appeal on July 20th.
He was kept in Texas.
The authorities of the parting country that supported Grace described El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, which produced a large number of volunteers for the United States, as a country with major problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. election turned out to be a 2014 Immigrants House decision that allowed dark immigrants to flee their homes from violence.
The Grand District of Colombia, Karl Racine, says in a statement on Friday that this new reality "rejects the laws of the State party, federal, and international that have been in existence for several decades."
"The federal law maintains that all music clima must be issued on the basis of certain facts and circumstances related to that clima, and that such prohibition violates the principle," said friend-of-the court brief.
Further, the court has given a short view that the reality that refuses to enter the U.S. economy destroys the economy, says that they will probably be hard workers and "injecting the necessary labour."
In June, the Supreme Court ordered the immigration judge not to pay taxes to victims of domestic violence and gang violence.
"Maybe it is available for those who leave their home country because of persecution or fear caused by racial, religious, national, or political problems," the session said in a statement on 11 June.
It's not meant to solve all the problems -- even though all the problems are serious -- that people face every day around the world.
The tragedy of survival in the Palu is very sad because the victims are trapped while fighting with time to find the victims.
For those who survived, the situation was becoming worse.
"It's very disturbing," said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, to her son's baby who's staying at the refugee center in the town of Palu.
"Every minute the ambulance comes bringing the dead.
The clean water is very fast."
The people looked back at their destroyed homes, took some of the stuff they were fond of, trying to save whatever they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and were treated at hospitals, with a 7.5 - magnitude earthquake, and so on.
Some of them were injured, including Dwi Haris, who suffered from back and neck fractures, sleeping outside the Palu Hospital, where patients were treated outside the room because of severe diarrhea.
The tears welled up when she told him back how she felt when the storm broke down her five - room hotel bed with her wife and daughter.
"It's not enough to save yourself.
I think I'm trapped in a blockade," Haris told the Associated Press, adding his family to the town to attend the wedding.
"I heard my wife cry for help and then cry.
I didn’t know what was happening to my son or daughter.
Peace be upon them.
The U.S. High Commissioner accused Tiankok of 'immigrating' with 'propagandizing'
A week after Tingkok's official post posted a four-page announcement on an US day that called for a return to US-Tiongkok trade, U.S. chief leader for Tingkok accused Beijing of using US press to spread propaganda.
President A. Donald Trump of the European Union later referred to the Chinese daily payout in the Des Moines Register - a paper published in the state of Iowa - after Tingkok accused the U.S. Congress elections on November 6, a charge filed by Tingkok.
The trumpet claim that Beijing is trying to join a camp in the US elections, which shows what the U.S. officials say to Reuters, is a new phase in the increase in the Washington campaign to force Tingkok.
While it is common for foreign governments to introduce advertising to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently involved in growing trade wars, which have caused them to raise the level of taxation.
Tiankok's award rate at the beginning of this trade is designed to attract exporters from such countries as Iowa, which supports the Republic of the Trump Party, says Tiankok and the United States.
Terry Branstad, U.S. chief leader for Tingkok and former governor general leader Iowa, exporting mainly agricultural goods to Tingkok, says Beijing has destroyed workers, farmers, and businessmen in the United States.
Tingkok, Branstad writes an opinion in the Des Moines Register on Sunday, "now devastates this intimacy by making advertising on our own free media."
"In spreading its propaganda, the Tingkok government has taken advantage of the tradition of freedom of speech and freedom of the press which is highly valued in the United States by advertising money in the Des Moines Register," Branstad writes.
"On the other hand, in the street news store here, in Beijing, you will find an excuse for different voices and will not see any real assurance on the different opinions that the Tingkok people may have about the troubled Tingkok economy, remembering the media under the leadership of the Tingkok Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "it's one of the most popular media in Tingkok that refuses to offer to publish" his article, although he doesn't mention which post.
An Analysis Reminds Republicans of Women’s Elections
As prominent members of the Republican Party stand up and defend the head of the Supreme Court of Great Britain Kavanaugh in the face of some sexual violence, the analyst has warned that they will see an attack back, especially from women, in the general election of a quarter of the time to come.
The emotions about this problem are very high, and most members of the Republican Party have already shown that they want to make progress in the voting process.
This cannot be stopped," Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Maxwell School, Syracuse University told The Hill about an article published on the Sabbath.
Reeher says he suspects Senator's defense Jeff Flake at the end of the minute to do FBI research will be enough to slow down anger on the voter.
"We will not forget what happened yesterday--they will not forget it tomorrow, nor will they forget it in November," Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior and national speaker for the progressive movementOn said it on Wednesday, according to Washington, D.C.
On Friday morning, the demonstrators shouted "November is near!" when they performed demonstrations around the Senate when the Republican Party controlled the Committee of Justice to continue to progress in the Kavanaugh massacre following the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
"Antusia and democratic motivation will come out of the list," political analyst not Stu Rothenberg's party, told the news site.
They say, ‘It is too high, and it is the truth.’
But it can be even higher, especially among women's voices in the refugee area and younger voters, 18 to 29, who because they don't like the president, often don't give a voice."
Even prior to Ford’s public testimony that he had been sexually abused by the Supreme Court’s officials, a warning analysis would follow if the State party continued to encourage him to progress with confirmation.
"It's a mess for GOP," said Michael Steele, head of the National Committee of the Republic Party, earlier last week, to NBC News.
"This is not only about the election of a committee or the election of a final vote or whether Kavanaugh will be placed on the advisory board, it is also about how the Republican Party deals with this problem and how they do it," Guy Cecil, US Director of Priorities, a group that helps to select a Democratic Party, points to the whole of the news.
But it seems that Americans will be different about who should be trusted after Ford and Kavanaugh's testimony, with a little more suitable choice for the last.
A new opinion taken by YouGov shows that 41 percent of the respondents really believe or may believe in Ford's testimony, while 35 percent say they really believe or may believe in Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they felt that Kavanaugh might or really lied during his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same thing about Ford.
After Flake's release, the FBI is currently investigating the charges filed by Ford and another prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian.
Ford witnessed under oath in front of the Court of Justice Committee that Kavanaugh, in a state of drunkenness, had attacked him when he was 17 years old.
Ramirez said that the Chief Justice's officer showed him his kindness when they attended a party while they were studying in Yale in the 1980s.
World Wide Web Browser Planned to Start New Internet for Google and Facebook
The Berners-Lee team, a World Wide Web scientist, destroyed a startup trying to track down Facebook, Amazon, and Google.
The latest project of this technology legend, Inrupt, is a company built from the open source platform Berners-Lee, Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data are stored and anyone who is allowed to have access to any information.
In an exclusive conversation with Fast Company, the Berners-Lee joke says that the term behind Inrupt is "dominating the world."
"We have to start it now," he said from the start.
"This is a historic moment."
This application uses Solid technology that allows people to create their own "private online data storage" or POD.
This storage can contain contact lists, task lists, calendars, music posters, and other personal and professional tools.
Like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify all available at one browser and all at the same time.
What's unique about this private online data storage is that it's really available to the user who can access what kind of information.
In a company known as "private data transfer."
The idea of building Inrupt, according to CEO John Bruce, is to provide the company with the right resources, processes, and skills to help make Solid available to all.

Bernard Vann: Memorial season WW1 Victoria Cross
The only church council in England who won Victoria Cross during World War I as a warrior was celebrated in his birthplace 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel The Reverend, Bernard Vann won the appreciation on September 29, 1918 for the attack on Bellenglish and Lehacourt.
Four days later, however, he was killed by a terrorist and never knew that he had won the highest honor of the British military.
A warning stone was erected by two of his grandsons on a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his cousins, Michael Vann, said this was a "symbolic symbol" that would reveal exactly 100 years of grandfather's performance to win appreciation.
According to London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Colonel Vann led his battalion across the Sant-Quentin Canal "subsisting a very loose storm under the threat of fire from field weapons and machines."
Then he stepped forward to the time line and with "the greatest courage" led the line forward before speeding up the use of his own field weapon and defeating three seconds.
Colonel Vann was killed by a German gunman on October 4, 1918 - only over a month before the war.
Michael Vann, 72, says his grandfather's action is "something I know I can't live but it's a very humble act."
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also suffered from postparade poisoning, led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann says he's "very lucky to compete in this paradise" and adds "the courage of a real warrior is being shown with the support that many people will receive."
The MMA waits for the night to watch Bellator 206, but they even get Peppa Pig.
Imagine, you've been waiting all night to watch Bellator 206 that's all you've got to do is ignore the main event.
San Jose’s prize was 13 battles, including six in the main cards and was being played all night in England on Channel 5.
On the 6th of the morning, just as Gegard Musasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for each other's presence, the audience in England was impressed when his appearance changed to Peppa Pig.
Some people feel unworthy after waiting for the day of battle.
A Twitter fan describes a change to a child's card movie as a "fucking joke."
"This is the rule of government, that on the 6th of the morning this content is not suitable for adoption, so replaced by the children's programme," said Dave Schwartz, representative of the Senior Press and Communications President Bellator, when asked about the transmission.
"Beppa is a baby," yes.
The president of Bellator Scott Cooker said they would improve their management by counting the audience in England in the future.
"I think, if we think about recycling, I think we might be able to solve it," said Coker.
"But this time there is at 6:00 a.m. on Sunday and we won't be able to fix it until our Sunday, their Sunday.
However, we are not without help.
Trust me, at the time of change, many texts turn back and everything doesn't teach.
We're trying to fix it, we think it's just a technical mistake.
No, it's a government problem.
Trust me, it'll never happen again.
We will reduce up to five of the six wars we have fought — as usual — and we will try to avoid too much competition for fans, and we will succeed.
This is a situation that is of no use."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley feels 'lower' related to sexuality
Olympicsman Tom Daley says he grew up humble because of his sexual problems -- but it gave him motivation to succeed.
This 24-year-old man said he didn't realize it until he entered high school, that "not everyone like me."
Speaking for the first time on Radio 4 Desert Island Discs brought by Lauren Laverne, he said, he talked about the right of homos to give "hope" to others.
He also said that being an adult made him less important than winning the Olympics.
A regular program that has been held for a long time, Kirsty Young, is taking a few months off due to illness.
As shown by the people who were expelled from Laverne's first program, Daley said he felt "not compared" to everyone else who grew up with him because "it's not something that can be socially accepted to like men and women."
He said, “This is how I feel today, less than any other, and a different feeling, which has come to me from a real source of strength and strength, so that I may be successful.”
He wanted to prove that he was "something," he said, so he wouldn't disappoint everyone when they knew about his sexual problem.
These two Olympic medals have become the famous LGBT campaign and have been used in the Commonwealth Games this year in Australia to attract more countries to avoid discrimination against homosexuals.
He says he speaks because he feels lucky to live openly without consequences and wants to give others "a hope."
The world's war three times says it's falling in love with a guy -- a filmmaker from the US Dustin Lance Black, which he met in 2013 -- "I'm surprised."
Daley was married to Oscar, a 20 - year - old brother from the United States, and she said that her age is not a problem.
"If you're having so many problems at a very young age" -- she followed her first Olympic at the age of 14 and her father died of cancer three years later -- she said it was very difficult to find someone with the same age that had suffered the same cancer.
This couple's grown up in June, with a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley says "the whole perspective" has changed.
"If you ask me a year ago, all around 'I have to win a gold medal'," he said.
"You know, there's something bigger than some winning the Olympic gold medal.
Control my Olympic gold is Robbie."
His son had the same name as his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 when he was diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father couldn't accept that he was going to die, and one of the last things he asked was whether they had got tickets for the 2012 Olympic London -- because he wanted to sit on the front line.
"I can't tell her 'You won't sit on my front row'," she said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing and still didn't really stop breathing until he died, finally I admitted that he wasn't defeated," she said.
The following year, Daley won the 2012 Olympics.
"What I know is just, this is what I've dreamed of all my life-- to bow in front of the audience at the Olympic Games, there's no better feeling than that," he said.
It also inspired his first choice - Proud by Heather Small - who had agreed with him in his preparation to go to the Olympics and still made him searing.
Desert Island Discs is a BBC Radio 4 broadcast on Sunday, 11.15 BST.
Mickelson changed his role when he was introduced to Ryder Cup on Saturday
The American footballer Phil Mikkelson will record the record on Sunday when he plays the 47th ryder Cup game, but he has to change his role to avoid unpleasant achievements.
Mickelson, who played in the two-year program to record the 12th record, was quoted by Captain Jim Furyk for the game of four balls and four groups on Saturday.
Aliph is in the middle of the action, as he usually did for the United States, the main five times winner shares his time between being the driver of the race and doing his game on the stage, hoping he could fix what's done to him.
Never became the fairest golf player in his career, this 48-year-old man is not fit to follow a very strong course in Le Golf National, which routinely gives long and violent punishment for every wrong shot.
And for his own field, it's not scary enough for Mickelson, in the ninth game on Sunday, to face the Great Open War of Francesco Molinari, who has worked together with new Tommy Fleetwood to win all of their four matches this week.
If this American golfer, starting 12 single games with four points below, starting with a hot start, then the Mickelson game will prove very important.
Furyk says trust in this man, not because he can say a lot more.
"He really understands his role today, pulls back and strikes me, and says he'll be ready for the game tomorrow," said Furyk.
"He's so confident.
He's Hall of Famer and he gave so much to this team last week, and this week.
Maybe I can't imagine him playing two games.
I thought about something else, but that was the way he played it, and that was the way we thought we should go.
He wants to enjoy other things, just like most people."
Mickelson's gonna go through Nick Faldo's record for the most-played Ryder Cup game on Sunday.
This could represent the end of his career in Ryder Cup that will never raise the height of his individual record.
Mickelson won 18 winnings, 20 winnings and seven rowings, although Furyk said he had something to say to the team.
"He's funny, he's jealous, he's jealous, he's jealous, he likes to smile at people, and he's cool in the team room," he explains.
"I think the younger player is having fun with her, too, this week, which is fun enough to see.
He's got a lot of things, more than some games."
Captain Thomas Bjorn knows the big noise can disappear as soon as possible.
Mr. Thomas Bjorn, Captain of Europe, learned from experience that a man who led quite a great way to the final race at Ryder Cup could easily become an unpleasant journey.
Dane made his first debut at the 1997 Valderram competition, with the captain of the Sive Ballesteros team holding five points on the Americas, but just touched the finish line with their nose with the most typical edge, winning 1411⁄2-1311⁄2.
"We don't keep reminding you that we get a big deal in Valderram; we get a big deal in Brooklyn, where we lose, and in Valderram, where we win, but just," says Bjorn, taking a picture, after watching Class of 2018, winning 5-3 good on Friday and tomorrow with 10-6 in Le Golf National.
So history will show me and everyone on that team that this isn't over.
Tomorrow you're going into a really boring game.
Get out and do the right thing.
It's not over until you get a point on the writing board.
We have a plan, and that plan is to win this trophie, and that's the focus.
I've been saying, I've been focusing on the 12 players that are on our side, but we're also very aware of what's on the other side of the world's greatest players."
It's nice to see players playing in the hard golf field, Bjorn adds: "In this case I'll never make it myself.
Tomorrow is a different star.
Tomorrow, individual players will make progress, and this is something different will be done.
It's very nice to be out there with a partner when everything goes well, but when you're out there playing individually, then your ability as a golf player will be tested.
That's the message you have to deliver to all the players, putting out your best for tomorrow's game.
Now, you leave your friend and he has to go get the best out of him."
Unlike Bjorn, Jim Furyk will ask his player to play better individually than they do for Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three of the four points.
Furyk himself has been at the second end of the final day of that great competition, has become part of a winning team in Brooklyn before Europe's success in "Midna's Miracles."
"I remember every word," he said, answering the question of how Ben Crenshaw, Captain in 1999, joined his players on the last day.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you want to start it as soon as you see in Brooklyn, as you see in Medina.
When the moment goes by, it'll give you a lot of pressure on the middle of the game.
We also arrange a list of players and put people in different ways that we think, you know, we're trying to do a miracle tomorrow."
Thomas has been commissioned to take the lead in the fight against Rory McIlroy in the contests, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood, and Ian Poulter, other European players on the board.
"I'm going with this group of people in order like this because I think I can cover all the way," Bjorn said about his own choice.
A new German warship is expected back
The new German Navy guardship should have begun its task in 2014 to replace the old Winter Warship, but the ship will not be there until next year because of the wrong system and its rising cost, the media reported.
The end of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", a major ship from the new Baden-Werttemberg class overseership, has now been expected until the first half of 2019, according to a newspaper Die Zeit that drew up military language.
This ship must have been part of the Atlantic Ocean in 2014, but the shipping crisis has hindered the arrival of this ambitious project.
The fourth class of Baden-Wuerttemberg, which was commissioned by the Navy in 2007, will be replaced by an old Bremen-class observer.
This ship will be equipped with strong brakes, an anti-aircraft gear, and an anti-ship gear, as well as some flexible technologies, such as radar removal, infrastructure, and acoustic keys.
Another important figure, including the longer period of care, was likely to be used for the most recent two years from its departure.
However, the continuation means this warship - which is said to allow Germany to increase its power abroad - will look at the time of its entry into its task, Die Zeit writes.
The F125 worst-off ship has become a news report last year, when the German Navy officially refused to deport the ship and returned it to the port of Bloom & Voss in Hamburg.
This is the first time the North Sea has returned to the ship’s Maker after shipping.
There are only a few known reasons behind the ship's return, but the German media cited a number of important "flying devices and heavy equipment" that made the ship useless when it was used for the war mission.
It's very important because the Baden-Wuerttemberg class ship will be operated by a crew of 120 passengers - only half of the working force on the older Bremen class ship.
It is also known that the boat will greatly reduce its power and limit its ability to increase its finality in the future.
"Rheinland-Pfalz" with this 7,000-ton bomb is twice as serious as the same class used by Germany in World War II.
In addition to damaged equipment, the cost of production of the entire project, including the training of shipowners, also became a problem.
It's said that it's going to surprise up to €3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) - it's going up from the start of €2.2 billion.
The problem of this new guardship has become very important to remember the latest warning because of an attack on the strength of the German maritime network.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament's Defence Committee, admitted that the Navy was "the destruction of ships with the ability to spread."
The office says often this problem is growing, as old ships are no longer used but there are no replacement ships available.
He regrets that not one of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class supervisors could join the Navy.
National Trust is listening to the secret life of a mysterious secret
A recent survey was conducted at a meeting in the High Court of Scotland aimed at discovering how bats could use them in their search for food.
It is hoped that this discovery will shed fresh light on the unique behavior of these flying creatures and help them to carry out their conservation activities in the future.
A study conducted by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland will follow the popular and sophisticated Pipistrelle as well as the long - term chocolate lake and Daubenton in Inverwe Gardens in Western Ross.
Special trains will be placed on the main site around the property to monitor vacation activities throughout the year.
The NHS staff and volunteers will also carry out regular inspections using gang detectors.
The audio player who analyzes all the recordings will ensure the frequency of calls and the types of activities that they perform.
Then maps and reports of habitats will be made to draw up a picture of the planet’s magnetic field surrounding their behavior.
Rob Dewar, environmental conservation counselor for NTS, hopes this will reveal which habitat is the most important for the island and how each species uses it.
This information will help you to determine what benefits are derived from the habitat prevention work, such as the construction of the forest and the best way to protect forests for the natives and other related species.
The population of the islanders in Scotland and throughout England has dropped dramatically in the last few centuries.
The island was threatened with construction and development that affected the region and its habitat.
Wind turbines and explosions also pose a risk, such as rockets, which are dependent on leaks and chemical treatment, as well as attacks from protective dogs.
In fact, tears well up in our eyes.
However, since his habit of hunting by night, his ears were more useful than his eyes in the matter of catching time.
They're using sophisticated entertainment technology to detect attacks and obstacles on their flight routes.
NTS, responsible for caring for more than 270 historical buildings, 38 important gardens, and 76,000 acres [76,000 ha] of land throughout the country, is very concerned about the island.
There are ten trained men, who regularly carry out investigations, search for omens, and at times try to save lives.
This organization has also established the first and only natural lakes in Scotland in the village of Thrave in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of the ten island species in Scotland.
The thousands of David Thompsons say the villages are suitable areas for the islanders.
"Here in Thrave, we have a good area for vacation," he said.
"We have old buildings, many old trees, and all good dwellings.
But there are still many things we don't know about loneliness, so the work we do here and in other property will help us to understand more about what they need to grow."
He stressed the importance of research into malaria before performing conservation in the property, because without a doubt there is a possibility that one parasite can kill up to 400 pregnant and still young babies, which could destroy the entire population at the same time.
The fugitive thus never had to fear reprisal.
Elizabeth Ferrell, the Scotland branch office for the Conservation of Trust, has encouraged the public to cooperate.
He said, "We still need to learn a lot about our habitat and about many species we don't know how to get their population."
Ronaldo who refused the invitation to attend was preparing a lawyer for the German magazine
Christian Ronaldo called himself a "false news" and said that people "want to promote themselves" using his name.
The speaker asked the German newspaper Der Spiegel, who published the above - quoted report.
The attackers in Portugal and Juventus were accused of rapeing an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He was then supposed to have paid him $375.000 to keep his mouth shut on this incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
Speaking in a video from Langsung Instagram to 142 million of his followers a few hours after it was reported, Ronaldo, 33 years old, threatened the report as "false news."
"No, no, no, no.
What they say today is false news," the winner of Ballon d'Or said to the camera five times.
"They want to promote themselves using my name.
That's normal.
They want to be known by calling my name, but it's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and everything's fine," the player added a smile.
Ronaldo's spokesman is ready to demand Der Spiegel on this charge, which they call "the suspect report in the private field that cannot be accepted," says Reuters.
Christian Schertz's spokesman said he would ask for compensation as "a moral change in the number corresponding to the weight of that abuse, which may be one of the most serious personal rights abuses in the last few years."
The incident was reported in June 2009 in a suite room at Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a club one night, Ronaldo and Mayorga were reported back to that player's room, where he was supposed to have stolen it, according to a report given at the Clark Capitol District Court in Nevada.
Majorga said Ronaldo collapsed after the incident and told him that "99 percent" he was a "good guy" who was just "one percent."
The document says that Ronaldo lets them both have sex, but it's based on desire together.
Mayorga also said she went to the police office and had performed a visa on her wounds in the hospital, but then she agreed to solve the problem outside the court because she felt "trembling to get revenge" and anxiety "to be humiliated in the public future."
This 34-year-old woman says she's now trying to cancel the peace settlement because she's continuing to experience trauma over the alleged incident.
Ronaldo almost joined Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the attack, and this summer he moved to the Italian-led Juve club with an agreement of €100 million.
Brexit: England 'will regret forever' on the loss of car manufacturers
England "will regret forever" if it loses its status as world leader as a car manufacturer after Brexit, said Business Secretary Greg Clark.
He added "on" Toyota, England has told BBC that if Britain leaves the European Union without an agreement, for a while it will stop production in its factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," said Mr. Clark.
The original Japanese car manufacturer said that if there was no agreement, Brexit would lose his job.
A factory in Burnaston - which produced Auris and Avenues Toyota production - produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90 percent were exported to the entire European Union.
"I think that if England comes out of the European Union at the end of March, we will see a stop of production in our factory," said Marvin Cooke, executive director of Toyota in Burnaston.
Another British car manufacturer has expressed concern about its exit from the European Union without agreeing on how border traffic would be on its way, including Honda, BMW, and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, said to close the Mini factory in Oxford a few months after Brexit.
The main issue involved in what the car manufacturers said was the risk of armed conflict if there was no agreement with Brexit.
The Toyota production line is run on the basis of "time" production principles, with a brand group that enters every 37 minutes of British and European Union freight for vehicles made according to the order.
If Britain came out of the European Union without an agreement on 29 March, there might be disturbances at the border, which, according to the industry, could lead to delays and at least one third of the population.
It'll be impossible for Toyota to keep up with more than one day in his factory in Derbyshire, company representative word, and thus production will be stopped.
Clark says an article Chequers Theresa May to connect with the future European Union is "decalibration precisely to avoid border checks."
"We have to have an agreement. We want to get the best deal that will also make it possible what I say not only enjoy success right now, but for us to get this opportunity," he told the BBC Radio 4.
"The evidence is not only from Toyota but also from other producers, that we really need to be able to continue what has become a very good team chain."
Toyota can't say how long its production will be stopped, but clearly in the long term, warning that the increase in the cost will reduce the capacity of another factory and eventually disappear in the matter of the cost of work.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working in Burnaston for 24 years and who is the head of the U.S. union in the factory, says his members have become more concerned: "My experience, as soon as this work is finished, will never come back.
The government said: "We have drawn up the right and reasonable agenda for our relationship with the European Union in the future."
The Trump meeting with Rosenstein might be back on track, looking for the White Building.
The high-risk meeting of Donald Trump with Chief Justice Rod Rosenstein could "be back for another week" because the president of the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, continues, the White Building said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Adviser Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russia's field of hands in general elections, relations between Trump and Russia's assistants, and the potential to prevent justice by the president.
Whether Trump will shoot a big judge or not, which will threaten Mueller's freedom, has been chasing the gosh in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, New York Times reported that Rosenstein was discussing using telegrams to record talks with Trump and perhaps slowing down the president through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein's reporting this.
But on the last day of the week, he went to the White House, in the middle of the report that he was about to resign.
On the contrary, the meeting with Trump, who was then in the U.S. office in New York, was announced on Thursday.
Trump said he would "choose not" to shoot Rosenstein, but that meeting was repeated to avoid contact with the Senate justice committee where Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual abuse, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, both will testify.
On Wednesday, Trump ordered a FBI investigation for a week on the Kavanaugh clima, which continued to record the entire Senate hearing.
Press Secretary Trump, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News Sunday.
When she asked about her meeting with Rosenstein, she said: "The date for that meeting has not yet been set, perhaps this week, I can see that returning her to another good week also recalls other things that happened in the big court.
But we'll see, and I always want to tell you the latest news to the press."
Several journalists will object to this statement: Sanders has not been holding a press meeting on the White House since September 10.
The director of Chris Wallace's show asked why.
Sanders says rarely because they don't like TV reporters "who try to draw attention," though, he says, "I don't agree with the fact that they're trying to attract attention."
Then he suggests that the contact be made between Trump and the press be established.
"The president asked more questions directly than the previous president," he added without saying "we've seen those numbers."
The meeting is still going to happen, Sanders says, but if the press has an opportunity to ask the President of the United States directly, it's far better than talking to me.
We're trying to do it more often and you've seen us do it a lot in the last few weeks and it'll replace a press conference when you can talk to the president of the United States."
The trumpet regularly raises questions when leaving the White Building or taking part in an open session or in a press conference with the high officials.
The press conference just rarely happened.
This week in New York City, the president may show why he does so, what he does, and at times he may be surprised to see in the press.
Health secretary wrote to European Union workers in NHS Scotland about concerns about Brexit
The Health Secretary wrote to the European Union headquarters in NHS Scotland to express his appreciation for the country and hope that they will continue to work here after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman MSP sent letters within less than six months to England attracted itself from the European Union.
The Government of Scotland has made a commitment to meet the constant cost of state aid for European citizens who work in the public service they are moving to.
In his letter, Mr. Freeman wrote: "During the summer, negotiations between Britain and the European Union on this self-reliance continue, approaching the decisions that are expected during this crisis.
But the Anglo - American World Power is also ready to launch an all - out attack on the world empire of false religion.
I know it must be very disturbing for you all.
That is why I now want to emphasize how much I appreciate the contribution I have made to each member of the staff, apart from their nationality.
Fellows from across the European Union, and others, brought with them valuable experiences and skills that strengthened and improved the work of health services, and benefited from the patient and society we served.
Scotland is really your home and we really want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie undergoing Postpartum Depression
Looking back on Tennessee State Tigers, Christion Abercrombie underwent post-mortem surgery after suffering head injuries on 31-27 from Vanderbilt Commodores on Saturday, Mike Organ from Tennessee reported.
The Head of State of Tennessee, Rod Reed told the victim's reporters soon before his father died.
"He came to the edge of the field and fell down there," said Reed.
The trainer and the medical team gave Abercrombie oxygen in the field before putting it into the field and carrying it to further evaluation.
An official from the Tennessee Department told Chris Harris of the WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie has come out of the operating room at the Vanderbilt Media Centre.
Harris adds that "there is no detail about the type of damage that has occurred" and the Tennessee Regional State is trying to find out when the damage has occurred.
Abercrombie, a high school student of these two red bears, was in the first time with the Tennessee District after being transferred from Illinois.
He got a total of five tickets on Saturday before he left the game, which made his total ticket during this period 18 tickets.
Foreign buyers will use higher prices when buying properties in England
Foreign buyers will be used to pay higher prices when they buy property in England, along with additional money that will be used to help immigrants in accordance with the new Tory article
This step will prevent the impact of Corbyn's movement in attracting young voters
This tax will be applied to those who do not pay taxes in England
The Department of Finance estimates will collect up to £120 million per year to help Tunisians.
Foreigners will be used for higher - quality goods when they buy property in England and the additional funds that will be used to help immigrants, Theresa May will now be announced.
Will this step be considered to be an attempt to prevent Jeremy Corbyn from making an effort to attract young voters by promising to provide a better and more stable environment?
The cost of paying taxes will be applied to individuals and companies that do not pay taxes in England, as well as to the government’s efforts to combat fraud.
The additional cost is now higher than the present cost of living, including a higher level that was announced two years ago on the purchase of the second house and on the purchase of the house in order to reach three percent.
The Department of Finance expects this move to reach £120 million a year.
It is thought that 13 percent of the property newly built in London is purchased by non-Ingress residents, which makes it more difficult for the first buyer to hang his feet in the farm.
Many rich areas in this country -- usually in the capital -- have become "the city of ghosts" because many foreign buyers spend most of their time abroad.
This new arrangement went out just a week after Boris Johnson reduced the cost of living that helped more young people to have their first home.
He accused the large construction company of maintaining the constant price of property by buying land but not using it, and forced Ny May to leave the money for the homes you owned using to improve the "harvest" in England.
Corbyn has announced an explanation of the reform process in an interesting field of agriculture, including gardening and ending the "no guilt".
He also wanted to give the building greater power to build new houses.
Ny May says: "A year ago I promised I'd deduce the mining office to restore the dream of England--that life should be better for every generation.
And that means improving our booming farm market.
Britain will always be open to those who want to live, work, and build life here.
However, it is not right for individuals who do not live in England, as well as for businesses that are based abroad, to buy modest housing for those who work hard.
To many people the dream of having a house is a far-off thing, and the conduct of the people is not easy for the real world."
Jack Ross: 'My main ambition is to lead a team in Scotland'
Bos Sunderland, Jack Ross says "the main ambition" is to be the manager of Scotland at some level.
This 42-year-old Scottish player, enjoys the challenge of living back to the North-East club, which is currently sitting on the third floor of League One, three points from the ground.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after leading St. Mirren back to the former Soviet Premier League.
"I want to pay my country as a player.
I got Top B and that's him," Ross said to Sportsound, BBC Scotland.
"But I grew up and often viewed the Scotland team in Hampden with my father as a child, and it always became something that attracted me to come back.
But that opportunity will come, if I succeed in team management."
Sunderland manager before Ross included Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardice, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyt, and Paul Di Canio.
This Alloa Athletic boss said he didn't feel embarrassed to follow the lead of the big name in that big club, after he had rejected the offer from Barnesley and Ipswich Town.
"For me, success at this time will be measured by 'can I return this club to the League of Premier?'
Because of the structure and facilities in this club, there is no longer any doubt about being in the Premier League," he said.
"It's not an easy task to be there, but I'll probably just see myself as a successful person here, if I can bring this club back there."
The career of Ross in team management was only three years later, after some time as a boss assistant in Dumbarton, and spent 15 months as a training staff in Hearts.
And he helped Alla recover from the degree to the third position, and turned St. Mirren from the rank of the degree into the winner of the Prize in the following season.
And Ross says he's happier now than he's ever done during his career in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren, and Hamilton Academic.
"It's probably the way I have to go," he cried when he took Allaa's receipt.
"I'm really sure management is the right thing for me, more than playing.
It sounds strange because I'm good at it, I'm looking for a good way to spend my life, and I'm enjoying some normal things.
But playing can be difficult.
There's a lot you need to spend every week.
I still experience it in terms of pressure at work, but in management it feels good.
I always wanted to lead something and now I do it, the most comfortable feeling I've ever had in my life."

Survey found, the right time to drink beer was at 7:30 p.m. on Saturday.
The heat wave has increased the perception of public-pubs in England who are fighting to survive, but more pressure on the restaurant network.
The number indicates that the pub group and bar saw a 2.7 - percent increase in sales in July - but a 4.8 - percent decrease in the restaurant.
Peter Martin, a CGA business consultant, who quoted these figures, says: "The bright days of England's attractiveness and participation in the world's far longer than expected meant, July will follow the same pool as June before, where public opinion increases by 2.8 percent, except for a restaurant that has a hard time.
It's down to a big restaurant store of 1.8 percent in June will get worse in July.
The sale of pubs and bars that sell these long drinks appears to be the most powerful thing that happens in the downside restaurant.
Pubs who sell food also suffer from sun heat, although not only restaurant operators.
Looks like people just go out for a drink.
The sale of all pubs and bar bars sold up to 6.6 per cent for this month, with the sale of food down to three per cent."
Paul Newman, an analysis of RSM's recreation and hotels, says: "This result continues the train we've seen since April.
Social events or major sports events continue to be a major factor in marketing outside the home.
It is not surprising that the restaurant group continues to fight to survive, although the generation of large sales of 4.8 per cent of the year will be very painful over the current cost pressure.
The long heat must not come when the operator sells food has a bad time, and the time will tell us if the hot enough heat we've enjoyed in August will give us some needed rest."
The total sales growth throughout the pub and restaurant, including the new opening, was 2.7 percent in July, showing a drop in mercenaries.

One of the five children has a secret social media account they hide from their parents.
Survey reveals, one of the five children - some of whom are still 11 years old - have a secret social media account they hide from their parents and teachers
Survey of 20,000 high school students revealed the development of the "false Insta" page
This news has raised concerns about the sex content
Twenty percent of students say they have a "main" account to be shown to the parents.
One of five children, some of whom are still 11 years of age, is making a permanent social media account that they hide from adults.
Surveys of 20,000 high school students revealed the development of the "false Insta" account - a reference to the photo-sharing site in Instagram.
The news has increased anxiety over sexually transmitted diseases.
Twenty percent of students say they operate "main" accounts that have been cleared to be shown to adults, while they also have private accounts.
A mother who found her 13-year-old daughter's secret site, found a teenager who asked others to call me "my boss."
A study conducted by the British Digital Foundation and the HMC Heads of Men's and Women's School (HMC) of independent schools found that 40 percent of students aged 11 to 18 had two profiles, with half of them claiming to keep their own accounts.
HMC head Mike Buchanan says: "This is so disturbing that so many teenagers are trying to create online rooms that their parents and teachers cannot find."
Elidh Doyle will be "for athletes" in the Scotland Athletics
Elidh Doyle has been elected to the Scotland Athletic House as non-executive director at the general meeting of the presidential House.
Doyle is the world's most prize-winning and field athletes in Scotland and head of Ian Beattie described this movement as a great opportunity for those who lead the sports field to benefit from its various experiences at international level over the last few decades.
"Eildah is highly respected throughout Scotland, England, and the world's athletic community and we are confident that athletics in Scotland will benefit greatly by bringing her into the house," Beattie said.
Doyle says, "I act as a voice for athletes and I hope I can really contribute and help lead the sport in Scotland."
American athletic athletes, who won 200 meters and 400 meters on the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta between the total four gold medals of the Olympics and now this BBC expert, are now unable to run after an hour's ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: "This is the last month I suffered a stroke.
I can't walk.
The doctor says it's only time I can determine if I can recover and to the extent to which it will recover.
What a relief it is to be able to return to the full - time ministry, to learn how to walk, and to work hard today!
Thank you for the message that gives you courage.
Illan pompas that compares mother to dog has broken the mind of the online world
Poultry pumps have broken down the world’s view of an advertising system that compares mothers who attack their mother with dogs who are fighting.
In order to mark the launch of a product called "the first silenced urban pump in the world," Elvie's technology company wrote a inspired announcement from a kind of music video to show the freedom this new pump has been given to express a mother.
Four moms dance in the corner holding a poem but follow a song that tells me something like this: "Well, I'm kidding myself, but you don't see an echo" and "If you don't notice this isn't aming, this is my town."
It goes on with the Refrain: "The pumps out, the pumps out, I'm giving them some nice food, the pumps out, the pumps out, I'm pulling my wife's milk."
However, advertisements published on the Facebook page of this company have created online controversy.
With 77,000 times seen and hundreds of comments, this video has received a dramatic response from the government, with many saying it causes "dangerous" in the dairy industry.
"A very bad decision using a knife to pull this product off.
Just like us, but also have to conceive and give birth to milk, except her baby was stolen from them in a few days after she was born," writes someone.
Elvie's town pump is very passive in the BH toysui (Elvie/Mama)
Another comment: "Trauma can be understood well for mother and baby.
But why don't you use it to call a poultice pump for the mother who needs to take care of her baby?"
The other one adds: "A missing announcement."
Others kept the announcement, with a woman who admitted that she found the song "fucking."
"I think this is a genius idea.
I'll buy it if I'm still fighting.
It makes me feel like a bear.
It's a little crazy, but I get what it is.
It's a genetic product," writes someone.
The other commented: "This is a good commercial for mothers who are too proud to be at their place of work or toilets and who feel like "sai."
This is not an announcement to praise or condemn the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, a group of women revealed that they all felt dancing with the hidden bombs in their bra.
The concept of this campaign is based on the age of many women who are suffering from ASI who say they feel like a snake.
But Elvie Pump is really hot, without cables or cables and passports in the bra, which gives women the freedom to move, suck their babies, and even go out and win.
Ana Bararin, a midwife and ECD at Mother, comments: "The Elvie pump is a product of propaganda that deserves to be destroyed with confidence and provocation.
By describing the image between women and men we want to meet with the ASI and all its challenges, as well as by showing them how to comfort and enjoy the freedom that the new pope has created.
This isn't the first time Elvie's pump became the main news.
At London Fashion Week, a mother and two children appeared at the catwalk for designer Marta Jacubowski using this product.
Hundreds of migraine children move quietly to the camp at the border of Texas
The number of migrant children detained continues to increase, although the month limit is still not changed, some of the harsh statements and acts that the Trump government has introduced to sponsors.
Basically, most sponsors themselves are immigrants without documents, and fear of endangering their own ability to live in that country by making progress to save children.
The risk increased in June, when the federal government announced that sponsors and other adult members of their marriage had to hand over their fingerprints, and their data would be shared with the immigration government.
Last week, Matthew Albence, an elder in the field of immigration and Bea Cukai, witnessed in front of Congress that the river had captured dozens of people who had filed a request to sponsor children under the age of.
The prosecutor then made sure that 70 percent of those arrested did not have criminal records.
"Nearly 80 percent of people who become sponsors or members of sponsor groups are in this country illegally, and most of them are bad foreigners.
That's why we keep hunting those people," said Mr. Albence.
In order to process children faster, officials introduced new rules that some of them were obliged to attend the court in the first month of the century, not after 60 days, which had become standard before, but instead.
Most of them appear through videoconferencing, not directly, to request legal status from the immigration judge.
Those who feel unworthy of help will quickly be disfellowshipped.
The longer the children are detained, the greater the likelihood of their being arrested or pressured, the more violent they are or attempting to escape themselves, the more dependent workers and the system reports received in the last few months.
Lawyers say that this concern is increasing in a larger facility like Tornillo, whose signs are on a child fighting side by side, because of its size.
They arrange that moving children to a rural town without giving them sufficient time to prepare themselves emotionally or say goodbye to their friends to avoid the traumas that have been discussed.
Syria asks the US, France and Turkey to return immediately.
On Friday in the General Assembly of the United Nations, Prime Minister Walid al-Moulem also asked Syrian refugees to return, although the country's war has now entered the eighth year.
Moualem, who also served as a military commander, said the foreign forces illegally resided in Syria, for reasons of combating terrorism, and "will surely be seized."
"They must return as soon as possible and not meet any conditions," he pointed out to the prosecutor.
Moulalem asserts that "wars against terror are almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, with more than a million refugees from their homes.
He insisted that Damascus would continue to "fight this holy war until we clear all the Syrian areas" from the terrorist group and "the presence of illegal foreign soldiers."
The United States has about 2,000 soldiers in Syria, particularly training and affecting Kurdish and Syrian troops against President Bashar al-Assad.
France had more than 1,000 soldiers in one war - torn country.
With regard to the refugee problem, Moualem insisted that they should return immediately, and he accused "some Western countries" of "proclaiming extraordinary fears" that moved refugees to move further away.
"We have asked international society and human society to facilitate this process," he added.
"They're politicizing what should be the problem of humanity."
The European Union and the United States warned that there would be no reconstruction aid for Syria until the political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war was reached.
The UN diplomats said the newest agreements between Russia and Turkey to establish a zone of refuge in the great Idlib concentration camp that has given the last opportunity to continue political talks.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey prevented a large number of attacks by the Syrian forces supported by Russia in the province, where there were three million people living.
But Moualem insisted that the treaty had "a clear time" and caused frustration that military action would strengthen the protesters, including the war of the Nusra Front related to Al-Qaeda, which "will be overrun."
The PBB Staffan de Mistura hopes that soon to announce the first meeting of the new committee established by the government and opposition members to make the Peace Order for Syria and open the way to the general election.
Moualem laid down the conditions of the Syrian government in the committee, stressing that the work of the panel must be restricted "in order to avoid the most extreme problems of the Law," and warning against handcuffs.
Why the Flood Will End Its Second Period
According to this logic, Trump will win the public election again in 2020, except for a number of hoped-for liberal spectators, contestants, and scandals that have ended his presidency here.
There's no doubt, "The most dramatic of the ever-presents!"
So far, there are no signs of failure for viewers.
Since 2014, CNN’s main time limit has risen from two to 1.05 million and MSNBC almost three times to 1.6 million.
Fox News has 2.4 million main clock monitors, rising from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC "The Rachel Maddow Show" has been sitting on the top of the cable TV with 3.5 million viewers on the main news night.
"It's a passion that makes people interested because it's something that's not understood," says Neal Baer, ABC drama director "Designed Survivor," about a cabinet secretary who became president after the attack that destroyed Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a senior comedian author and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And Some Truths Inside to Go to Hollywood Boys" Club," has another theory.

The driver said he'd give him his voice right for Trump.
Why? He asked.
"He said, 'because he made me laugh," Mrs. Scovell told me.
There is a value in recreation.
Of course, unlike other TV shows, stories from Washington can determine the future of Roe v. Wade, whether the immigrant family can reunite and restore the global economy.
On the contrary, the beauty can only be felt by the most special audience.
After that, it's not just a country citizen who knows when you find yourself witnessing a panel of experts discussing the use of "back" source Bob Woodward for his book called "Fear," wearing Paul Manafort's own skin bomber jacket worth $15,000" ("The Washington Post") and the implications of the terrible description of Stormy Daniels about Trump's anatomism.
This time, I'll never see Super Mario again.
"Part of the reality that he does it is like a real event that comforts you every night," followed Brent Montgomery, executive leader Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator "Pown Stars," about the player's hearing show and the day story of Trump (chosen against NFL, praising Kim Jong-un).

When I met Mr. Fleiss this week, it felt like 80 degrees outside his house on the north coast of Kauai, but he was hiding while watching MSNBC and CNN cameras.
He was unable to free himself, not with Brett Kavanaugh, who was prepared to appear before the Senate Committee and then the Supreme Court according to his estimates.
"I remember when we had all the crazy show that day and people said, "This is the beginning of the Western era," Mr. Fleiss told me.
"I think it's funny, but it turns out they're true."

A lot of money out there runs the most difficult time election in the White House.
Bensylvania 17 earns money, the blessing of returning to the convention district, which produces two stops in the same course.
The new Pittsburgh district was reorganized, drawing Conor Lamb from Rep. Democrats - who won courses in other districts over the special election last summer.
Lamb advanced against other prisoners, the Keith Rothfus Republic, which is now represented by the 12 former Pennsylvania District, which is located in the new Pennsylvania 17th.
These maps were returned after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania in January decided that the long-term districts were not constitutionally part of the Republican party.
The conflict in the new district of Pennsylvania 17 has largely affected the campaign between large parties' financial side, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NCRC).
The Lamb became increasingly known in Pennsylvania after a typical victory in the Maret special election for the 18th Congress district of Pennsylvania.
The course has been attended by the Republican authorities for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district with 20 points.
Politicians have raised a small portion of the population of Democrats.
A.S. Balancing El Salvador for Supporting Tingkok, Then Back
The diplomats made sure that the Dominican Republic and Panama had admitted Beijing, giving little pressure from Washington.
President Trump held a warm meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela from Panama in June 2017 and sent a hotel to Panama until the summit took out a team of management of Trump's organization.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs decided to draw back the heads of American diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama on "newest decisions that no longer recognize Taiwan," Heather Nauert, the department's spokesman, put in a statement this month.
However, only in the case of El Salvador, who received some $140 million from the United States in 2017, including drug control, construction and economic support.
The proposed law, which includes the promotion of financial assistance and the removal of visas, will damage the Central American country and will lead to the level of kidnapping and murder.
As the internal meeting progressed, North American and Central American officials marked a high-level conference focusing on security and economic security to follow up on the same meeting last year that was considered a step forward to prevent migration into the United States.
But in mid-September, high government officials insisted that they wanted the conference to continue, so that the review of El Salvador could be completed effectively.
President Mike Pence's representative is now scheduled to give a lecture at the conference, now scheduled for mid-October, as a tax signal made by the government at that meeting, with the diplomats.
And three U.S. emissaries were silenced back to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without bringing new corrections or severe punishments from Washington.
A White Building speaker for Mr. Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate presented by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss the internal assessment of this unclear situation.
Their statements were reinforced by an external analysis of the situation and by a discussion of the facts.
Study Edition
Another surprising case is the Special Adviser's report by Robert Mueller on the possibility of Mr. Trump's trial, which currently has significant evidence in the public record.
Mr. Mueller’s report also discusses whether the Trump campaign was co-existing with Russia in an attack on our public elections.
When the convention was over, Mr. Trump was asked to take responsibility for himself, as soon as he was ready to go in front of the voters, and perhaps he was finally a jury.
So there is still much to be done, and I do not mean to suggest that the fall of Mr. Trump’s regime cannot be avoided - or its unity in Europe.
There are choices we can make on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect how long we have been fighting.
In 1938 the German authorities were ready to do Hitler’s will if they opposed him and supported Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We've failed, and we've missed the opportunity to avoid the years that followed.
At first, history was focused on such sites, and soon after it was established, it was impossible for mankind to escape.
Now the Americans are facing some of these changes.
What should we do if the Trump shoots Agent Rod Rosenstein, who's behind Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been under pressure since then it reported that last year, he suggested that the president's signature be silenced and that he should not hold the president.
Mr. Rosenstein said The Times account wasn't right.
"How do we feel if the new F.B.I. investigation requested by Brett Kavanaugh is incomplete or fair - or if he is sent to the Supreme Court despite serious allegations of sexual assault and false testimony?
And in addition, will we give a voice in the amount of time for Congress that will ask for Trump's responsibilities?
If we fail to pass that test, democracy will suffer even more in the long run.
But I'm sure we'll succeed because of the lessons I've learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czech Jew who had been deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that had once persecuted me.

Rangers 'Graham Dorrans felt optimistic about the race in front of Rapid Vienna
Rangers held Rapid Vienna on Thursday, winning Austria, bringing good results in Spain against Villarreal this month, will strengthen their position to succeed from the G League of Europe.
Cedrells made the middle of Graham Dorrrans unable to appear in this first period until the 2-2 against Villarreal, but he was sure that Rangers could benefit from this result as a stone of greater weight.
"This point is very good for us because Villarreal is a great team," says the 31-year-old player.
"In this game we're sure we can get something and go with one point.
In the end, we may be able to do so, but, we think, the results may be fair.
At first, they may appear to be better, but in second place, we got up and became a better team.
It's Christmas Eve. It's a big day in Europe tonight.
We hope that we can finish three points though it will be difficult because they have good results in their final fight, but, with support from behind us, I'm sure we can continue to make progress and get positive results.
Last year, we had a hard time, because the consequences of my injury and the change in the club themselves, but now there is a very good hope in this club.
It's a good team and kids really enjoy it. It's a good training.
Let us now grow up, put the past behind us and achieve success."
The woman couldn't sleep because she was afraid of her pension ring.
Although it turns out that the survey team has an idea of how they want to be treated, few people discuss it with their family members.
About half of the people in the nationwide study discuss long-term care costs with their spouses.
Just 10 percent of them say it's talking to their kids.
"They want family members to provide care, but there's no way to start this operation," says Holly Snyder, the president of the nationwide life insurance business.
Here's the time to start.
Start talking to your spouse and children: You will not be able to prepare your own family for care if you don’t tell them your wishes before.
Talk with your family’s counselors, where and how you get care, because what you choose will mean very important in determining the cost.
Apply your financial advice: Your advice will likely help you in showing how to pay those bills.
The treatment you choose for long-term care involves traditional long-term insurance policies, hybrid insurance policies that guarantee these normal expenses or guarantee yourself with your wealth - while you have money.
Show your personal document: face-to-face legal dispute.
Show immediate power for your health care, that is, someone you trust to ensure your health care and ensure that your wishes are met by professionals when you cannot communicate.
At that point, the letter of power in the matter of money should also be considered.
Someone who is trusted to take care of all your financial decisions must choose, except to make sure your payment is made if you are not able.
Always remember with every detail: Just imagine when your elderly parents are in a bad condition and on their way to a hospital.
Are you prepared to answer various medical questions or allergic reactions?

A man shot an air weapon at Ilfracombe
A man was shot with wind guns on his way home from a party night.
Those 40-year-old victims were in Oxford Grove, Ilfracombe, Devon, when several attacks were made on their teeth, legs, and hands.
The shooting was described by the officer as "the next action" at about 02:30 BST.
The victim didn't see who attacked him.
The victim's scars didn't threaten his life, and a number of witnesses were sent by the police.
The earthquake and tsunami devastated Indonesia
The earthquake and tsunami that struck Palu, Indonesia, on the day of World War I left some 384 dead, the number of deaths attributed to officials increased.
The resulting communication allows the authorities to help with the problem to obtain information from Cape Dodhraa, a region in the north of the city of Palu that lies closer to the center of the sky which is hit by a 7.5 Richter scale.
In Palu, after a disaster, over 16,000 people were evacuated.
Below are a number of main facts about the city of Palu and Dodhra, on the island of Solavasi:
Palu is the capital of the province of Central Sulawesi, located at the edge of the western coast of the Sulawesi island, with a population of 379,800 in 2017.
When the earthquake and tsunami strike, this city is celebrating its 40th day.
Dothra, during that time, was a total area of more than 300 km (180 miles) from the coastal border to the west of the island of Sulaasi.
This property, which is an administrative area under the province, is thought to have 299,200 lives in 2017.
The economic eye of the South Sulawesi province is looking for fish and picking up crops, especially on the islands of Doha.
However, the size of the coal mine was important in this province, despite the fact that most parts of the island were located in Morowili, on the Sulawesi Sea.
As noted in the last 100 years, Palu and Dodhaa have been hit several times by tsunamis, based on data from the Indonesian Disaster Control Board.
In 1938, more than 200 people died in tsunamis and hundreds of homes in Dothan.
In 1996, nine people died in a tsunami accident in the western Doha area.
Ironically, Indonesia is located on the Pacific Ocean and its beautiful landscape will be orderly.
The number of earthquakes and large tsunamis that have occurred in recent years is as follows:
The year 2004: 26 December, Indonesia was hit by a massive earthquake, right on the west coast of the province of Aceh, in northern Sumatra, which also devastated the tsunami in 14 countries, until 226,000 lives were lost across the Indian Sea, and more than half the victims died in Aceh.
2005: At the end of March and early April, a massive earthquake struck the western coast of Sumatra.
In the Isle of Nias, on the shores of Sumatra, hundreds of people are killed.
2006: The 6.8 earthquake struck southern Java, the largest island in Indonesia, resulting in a tsunami on the south coast and almost 700 deaths in the world.
2009 year: It happened at 7.6 near the city of Padang, the capital of the province of Sumatra.
The death toll of more than 1,100 people.
2010: One of the islands on the island of Mantawai, on the coast of Sumatra, was also hit by a severe 7.5 earthquake, resulting in a tsunami of more than 10 feet [10 m] that suddenly engulfed the villages and destroyed about 300 people.
2016: Pidie Jaya's report, Aceh, also suffered a devastating and devastating disaster, as well as the surprise of those who were remembered for the disaster and tsunami that died in 2004.
Although this time it was not a tsunami, more than 100 people died as a result of an earthquake.
2018: Limbok, also known as the island’s tourist resort, also has a devastating effect on more than 500 people, most of whom live on the island’s northernmost edge.
The earthquake shook the foundations of the building and opened all the doors of the city’s walls.
Sarah’s grandson was captured by domestic violence
Track Palin, daughter of uncle Sarah Palin, governor of Alaska and presidential candidate, was arrested by an officer.
Palin, 29 years old, from Vasilla, Alaska, was arrested on the grounds of domestic violence, banned domestic violence and resisted arrests, as reported by the Alaskan National Police on Saturday.
According to a police report, when a woman's acquaintance tried to call the police to report any crime, she picked up the phone from the woman.
Palin was presented in Mat-Su's Trial Department, with a $500 security deposit, as reported by KTUU.
As reported on the news network, Palin attended the meeting on Saturday, he said, "It's not wrong, he's convinced" when he was asked about his mission.
Palin faced three Class A minor offenders, who could have been sentenced to one year's imprisonment and a fine of $250,000.
In addition, he was sentenced to one day in prison and to a fine of $2,000.
For Palin, this is not the first time.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaults on his father, Todd Palin.
His own mother, Sarah Palin, contacted the police to report the attack.
The case is now referred to the Supreme Court of Alaska.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, banned reports of acts of domestic violence, and possession of firearms under heavy conditions, which were also related to the incident.

In 2016, Sarah Palin was arrested by a veteran group because she associated her son’s violence with PTSD for the rest of her life in Iraq.
Tsunami and earthquakes in Indonesia: hundreds of victims died
On Friday, the island of Solási, Indonesia, was hit by a massive earthquake that claimed at least 384 lives.
The 7.5 Richter scale, which is capable of absorbing tsunamis, has reached thousands of homes.
The power grid and the communication network have been broken down, and the number of deaths has been estimated to continue to increase over the next few days.
The earthquake struck the Middle East of Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia.
Videos showing how tragic this disaster is spreading across social media.
Hundreds of people gathered for a sea festival in the city of Palu at that time, when tsunamis struck the sea.
U.S. government forces a death sentence that rarely occurs to suspect terrorist attacks at NYC
The New York federal court has tried to put an end to the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, suspected of terrorist attacks in New York City, where eight people have been killed -- including steps that have not been taken in the country since 1953.
Saipov, 30 years old, was expected to act as an attack by firing his truck from Home Depot into the foothills and bicycles along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, in October.
In the order to allow this death penalty, judges should provide evidence that Saipov "with intent" violated eight of the victims and "with intent" also caused serious bodily injury, based on a statement of intent to lower the death penalty, which was directed to South New York District.
On the basis of a judicial document, both cases were brought before the death penalty.
A few weeks after the attack, the federal court dismissed Saipov with 22 charges, including eight homicides in an act of rape, which was usually used by federal courts in organized crime cases, as well as allegations of violence and attempted motor vehicle abuse.
According to the prosecutor, the attack requires "substantial planning and early development," as a portrayal of Saipov's crime committed by "crazy, violence and behaviour."
It is stated in a statement of wish, "Sayfulllo Habibullavic Saipov has caused harm, danger, and loss to family and friends from Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnucci."
Five victims on that incident were Argentina's first victim.
The number one decade since South New York District dropped the death penalty for the last time.
In September 2009, Khalid Barnes, who was murdered by two drug addicts, was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment.
The last execution of the death penalty in the New York federal court in 1953 was committed in the case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were accused of spying on the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
His wife, Rosenberg, was sentenced to death on June 19, 1953.
According to the case - law document, Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, did not show how often the day and month after the attack was over.
When asked by the prosecutor, he said he was pleased with what he had done, the police officer.
Saipov also revealed to the authorities that his attack was a video ISIS video inspiration that was watched from his phone, as there was evidence.
He also requested an ISIS guard to be put in his hospital room, the police chief.
He said he was innocent of the 22 charges against him.
David Patton, one of the federal generals representing Saipov, said "explainly disappointed" about the decision of the prosecutor.
"We believe that the decision to execute death by accepting a criminal sentence for life without the guarantee of freedom will only prolong the trauma of the people involved in the incident," Patton said.
Earlier, the Saipov team had asked the judge not to file a death sentence.
NIGEL FARGE is responsible for Brexit's negotiations, says Tory MP.
Nigel Farage called for today's 'crowding people' in protest action at the Tory conference.
The leader of the UKiP said that politicians should "feel its heat" Eurosceptics (anti-European Union sensitisation) - because one of the parliamentarians, Theresa May, suggested that we be fair in negotiating with the EU.
Conservative group supporters, Peter Bone, told road action in Birmingham that England 'should go out' right now if Farage acted as Secretary Brexit.
However, the challenge faced by May in the reconnaissance of its shared position has been underestimated by the Remain Tories supporters involved in the separate protests threatening Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister fought to protect his Chequers' compromise plan to remain on its way despite the attacks of Brexitiers, Remainers and the European Union.
The combined countries stressed that they would be moved to reach agreement with Brussels, although they had a bad back reaction - and forced Eurosceptics and Burhu to determine the options between its package of solutions and 'cooky'.
Bone told the mass Leave Means Leave in Solihull that he wanted to leave the checks.
As a matter of fact, Farage has to show his colleagues to be entrusted with the responsibilities of negotiating with Brussels.
"If the answer remains with him, we're going out now," he said.
Members of Parliament Wellingborough added: "I'm ready to stand up for Brexit, but we need to get rid of Chequers."
On the other hand, it simply shows its opposition to the European Union: "We do not fight in the world's war to be submissive.
We want to establish our own laws in our own country."
Bone writes that public opinion has been able to bring about changes since the end of the 2016 vote: "The message that the British think has changed and wants the situation to continue is absolutely wrong."
Tory Brexiteer Andrea Jenkyns, who also participated in the mass action, reported to the reporter: 'Just like, I want to say: "O Minister, listen to your people.
"Checkers are not popular in public membership, but opposition will not choose it, because they are not popular with our parties and activists who are really really down the road and make us the first position.
Our request, leave the checks and start listening to us."
Through a message directed to May, he added: "The Lord of the Worlds will protect their work when their promise is fulfilled."
Farage says that political demonstration must be stopped in order to 'feel the heat' if they want to ignore the 2016 referendum decision.
'This is the most precious moment of faith between us - our people - and our political group,' he said.
'They're trying to defy Brexit and we're here today, insist that 'We won't let you do that.'
And he added in a message to the anti-violence society: "I want you to make our political party, who are ready to reject Brexit, feel its heat.
"We are moving the armies of this people, which shall overcome us in Brexit; and we will not give up until Britain comes up, and our own kingdom is established, and we will build.
During that time, the Remainers mass moved through Birmingham before spreading action at the city center for two hours.
Activism appears to have spread the torrent of Tories Against Brexit after breaking his line at the end of this town.
The members of the Group, Lord Adonis, are taking part in the Conservative Group's issue of the security of their party's application when the conference is opened.
"These are the people who tell us that they can manage the IT system and all technology for Canada, whatever, because of the limits of entertainment, in an unlimited free trade class in Ireland," he said.
‘It's really a show show.
At least there's no good Brexit,' he said.
Warren's planning to make a "serious blow" in the presidential election.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said he'd "break the presidential bell" after the election in November.
Boston Globe announced that the Massachusetts Democrats spoke about his future in the cities of western Massachusetts, on Saturday.
Warren, who was still threatening President Donald Trump, volunteered for the November elections against the GOP representative of the party, Geoff Diehl, president of the 2016 Trump campaign in Massachusetts.
In a national speculation, he was designated a 20th - century fighter against Trump.
The meeting on Saturday evening in Holyoke was the 36th with its voters, which was announced with the form of the city hall since Trump held.
One researcher asked him if he had any plans to take the lead in this regard.
Warren also answered, that this is the right time "for women to enter the Washington environment to restore our corrupt government, and that includes when women sit on top."
He's been caught by the Sims Shooter, the LSU player.
On Saturday, Baton Rouge, Louisiana, police announced that he was arrested by a suspected gunman until the death of Wade Sims, a basketball player from LSU, on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced that Dyteon Simpson, 20 years old, was arrested at 11 a.m. in the press conference.
They wrote a video of the shooting on Wednesday, where a man identified was asking for help as shown in the record.
At midnight, Sims, 20 years old, was shot and found dead near the Southern University campus.
"Wayde Sims suffered a headache and finally died," police chief Murphy J. Paul, to the media on Saturday, through 247sports.
Wade was trying to protect his friend and Simpson from shooting at him.
When questioned, Simpson admitted that he was in the scene, holding a gun, and shooting him at the wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without a fight. He was sent to prison in the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
A junior player with a height of 6 feet 6 inches, growing in Baton Rouge, that's the Sims team, has played in 32 games with 10 events last year and 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 ball straight in each game.
Don't miss the Grand Prix in Russia: Lewis Hamilton won the world prize after the team admitted his victory over Sebastian Vettel
It all became clear when Valtteri Bottas was in front of Lewis Hamilton in the qualifier on Saturday that would bring the Mercedes team's command to play a major role in the race.
From the field, Bottas had a good start position and almost left Hamilton because he defended his position on the first two sides and attracted Vettel to attack his teammates.
Vettel became the first to go into the pit and let Hamilton move into the camp at the end of the camp, something that should be very clear.
Mercedes went in and out after Vettel, but Hamilton continued to go after a few acts of curiosity that showed the preference of the Ferrari's mood left the part in the empty with the risk of staying behind after moving the gang to stay in the third floor.
Max Verstappen started on the back of the grid and was in position seven at the end of the first lap on his 21st birthday.
He then led most of the escape because he stopped the van change to speed up the solution and took the position of the Raikkonen Chemicals for the fourth position.
He finally went into the pit at the 44th Lapp but couldn't improve his step on the other eight because eventually Raikkonen took the fourth position.
It was a hard day because Valtteri did a fantastic job all along the town and a real man who left me.
The team has done a great job to have one," Hamilton said.
That's a very red body language.
President Donald Trump chased Senator dianne Feinstein on a rally on Saturday through his village, he did not break Christine Blasey Ford's letter on sexual violence against Chief Justice Brett Kavanaugh
Speaking in a rally in West Virginia, the president did not immediately make a statement made by Ford in front of the Senate Committee, but rather commented on what was happening in the Senate showing people who were "wicked and dishonest and dishonest."
"Something that can happen and a beautiful thing that's going on during the last few days in Paradise, when you see anger, when you see people angry and mean and dishonest," he said.
"When you saw the machine and boxing and then they said "Oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it."
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you break it?
Remember the answer... did you break the document-- "Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't break it."
Okay, wait a minute.
Did we break... No, we didn't break it," added, as a senator's impression.
Féinstein had sent a letter accusing Kavanaugh of previous July, and this was the first time that Féinstein had filed this complaint in September - but it was not from his office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's charges, I didn't break his story," said Feinstein to the committee, told Hill.
"He asked me to keep it secret and I kept it secret as he requested."
But it seems that the president, who commented during the rest of the Saturday night, said: "I will tell you, it is a very bad body language.
Maybe he didn't do it, but it's the worst body language I've ever seen."
Continuing his defense against the Chief Justice, who became a victim of sexual harassment against three women, the powerful president appealed to the democratic authorities to use charges against them for their own ends.
"They are determined to take power in various ways.
You see the crime, the result, they don't care who they hurt, they have to walk to get power and control," Mediaite reported on the president's speech.
Liga Elite: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer printed two balls for Giants when he faced Dundee
Dundee Stars spent a success on Friday at the League of Elite when fighting Belfast Giants by winning the game with scores 5-3 on Saturday.
Giant got two rounds earlier after two strikes from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie took the side of their family before Dwyer returned the Giants.
Francois Bouchard described the position of Dundee before two holes in Lucas Lundvald Nielsen as guaranteeing their success.
That's the three-year success of the League of Elits that happened to Adam Keefe's people, who succeeded in pursuing a stay and finally failed to win Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Wednesday night.
That's the fourth meeting in this period between the two sides, with the three Giants winning the previous game.
The opening from Dwyer was at 3:35 from Kendall McFaull, with David Rutherford when Beauvillier managed to break down four minutes later.
During the long opening period, Sullivan took the housekeeper’s side back into the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquartt became the chancellor of Cownie’s performance at 15:16.
Dwyer ensures Giant's survival during the first watch when he breaks the second round of night at the end of the first period.
The owner of the house returned and Bouchard once again renewed their position with the ball power play at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined to help Nielsen give Dundee an appeal for the first time at the end of the second period and he assured his team that he had won in the middle of the final period.
Giants, who have so far suffered four of their five victories, are on the verge of facing Milton Keynes in their next match on Friday.
And the Army's Lintas died to ensure hundreds of passengers on the safe air from the camp.
A driver went to the airport in Indonesia as a fugitive after his death by ensuring that hundreds of aircraft could safely fly.
More than 800 people died in the world, and many others died after a great earthquake landing on the Sulawesi Island on Friday, killing tsunamis.
The heavy rains continued to destroy the area and many were trapped in the ruins of the city of Palu.
But his friends fled for their safety, 21-year-old Anthony Gunawan refused to leave his post at a heavy-duty driver's fair in the Sis Al Jufri Army, Palu.
She chose to stay and make sure that Air Force No. 6321 at the time was on her way home, so that the land could be safely cleared.
Then he jumped out of the driver's tower and jumped when he felt that the tower began to fall.
He died in a hospital.
In a speech by the Indonesian Air Navigation Service, Johannes Sirait, he presented his decision to save hundreds of lives, a report from the ABC Australian news agency.
We arranged for a helicopter from Balikapan, California, to take him to a bigger hospital in another town.
I'm sorry we lost this morning before the helicopter hit Palu.
"We're all sorry to hear this," he added.
During that time, the authorities were concerned about the death of thousands of victims after the National Security Council granted them access to the cities of Dothria, Sig and Boutong.
"The victims are convinced that they will continue to grow because many bodies of victims are still missing and many others cannot be reached," said the national emergency panel spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
A six - foot - long [6 m] cross-country skirmish has made the tree climb that causes the mating on Sunday.
Airplanes and commercial aircraft carried relief supplies and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Ambulance brings death every minute.
Clean water has become scarce.
Minimum market anywhere in history"
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Red Indonesia Army is working hard to help the survivors but we don't know what they'll find there.
It's been a tragedy, but maybe it's getting worse."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo came to Palu on Sunday and asked the Indonesian national army: "I ask you all to work day and night to complete the entire task of evacuation.
Ready?" CNN report.
Indonesia at the beginning of this year was also hit by an earthquake in Lombok that killed over 550 people.
Micronesia’s plane crash: Niugini’s waters bring one missing after an emergency
Aircraft operations on the Pacific Coast of Micronesia reported one loss after 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated.
Water Niugini reported on a Saturday - day street, where she could not identify a man by his side.
The creationist said that his party had worked together with local authorities, hospitals and inspectors to find the man.
The Creator did not immediately respond to a request for more details about this pilot, such as his age or nationality.
Local planes help save passengers along with other crews, after the plane hit the water while trying to escape at Chuuk Island airport.
On Saturday, the branch office announced that seven people had been taken to a hospital.
The rest of the family shared in the preaching work on Saturdays, and all were in good condition.
What is behind all of this is not clear regarding what might happen as a result of natural disasters or what happens when they occur.
Both U.S. seafarers and seafarers reported that the planes landed on the coast around the coast.
Several eyewitnesses sensed that the plane was crossing a wave.
American civil engineer Bill Jaynes said that the plane came down very humbly.
"That's really good," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that he and others were able to cross a bridge through the middle of the tunnel through the middle of the tunnel.
He greeted the teachers with a big hug and a big hug, and he suffered some headaches in his head.
The U.S. Navy said that the crew working near the improved landing area also helped rescue the rescuers to catch people to land before the mid-aircraft was about 30 metres (100 feet) deep in the water.
Data from the Flight Safety Network indicate that 111 people have died in the disaster of registration-PNG-recording for the last two decades but not one involving Air Niugini.
Analyticals provide a line of time for night women burned alive
A request to prevent what happened on Saturday in the re-examination of a man who was charged with a life-threatening fire against a Mississippi woman in 2014.
An AS Department of Justice analysis Paul Rowlett witnessed for several hours as an expert in the field of intelligence analysis.
He made a huge list of how he used cell phones to collect various motion pictures of his 29 - year - old Quinton Tellis and his 19 - year - old victim, Jessica Chambers, on his death night.
Rowlett said he received the location data from some cell phones that showed Tellis on one location with Chambers on his death night, compared to the previous statement, announced by Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that the cell phone was still in one place with Chambers during that time, he argued that while he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police finally asked for an explanation from Sanford.
Sanford followed the custom on Saturday and he testified that he was not in the city on the day of the event.
When the investigator asked whether Tellis was right when he said he was in Sanford's truck on the night of the incident, Sanford said he was "false, because my truck was in Nashville."
Another inconsistencies told by Tellis is his statement that he knew Chambers about two weeks before the victim's death.
Telephone records often show them getting to know each other in one week’s century.
Rowlett reports that after the death of Chambers, Tellis sometimes removes messages, calls and contacting Chambers' information from his phone.
"He removed the victim from his life," said Hale.
The ceremony was scheduled to start the final statement on Sunday.
The judge said that he was hoping that the trial would follow.
The High Width: What is hip hop?
A trio hip hop group wants to resist the negative view of this genre by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed, from Bristol, claims to move hip hops away from the original political message and overcome social issues.
They want to go back to their farm and make a hip hop popular again.
Artists like The Fugees and Commons have seen this recent resurrection in the United States through some artists like Akala and Lowkey.
The other black people?!
The NYPD asked for a couple because of the attack after the "racialist" message was issued.
A New York prosecutor asked for one partner because he had been discriminated against after receiving a message not immediately from a mother who complained and said he was "other black."
The couple refused if they were considered racist, and they thought that it was more like "extreme."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, showed her frustration when she realized that her new child care provider, Giselle Maurice, was black since she first worked in 2016.
"There are no other people in the world," wrote Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman to her husband in a message.
Anyway, rather than sending her to her husband, she even sent her to Aunt Maurice, twice.
After acknowledging his mistake, Plasco-Flaxman shot Sister Maurice, saying that they had issued a complaint, which was an American citizen of the U.S. province, because she had done a bad job and she had more hope for the Philippines, based on New York Post.
Mrs. Maurice was paid one day for her work and was later transferred to Uber.
Currently, Maurice asked the couple to pay compensation for the subscription, and asked for about $350 a day for six months, as a reward for losing the job she had to work, although there was no contract.
"I want to show them, look, you can't do anything like that," he said to the Post on Sunday, then add "I know it's a discrimination."
The couple opposed the clima that they said they were racist, saying that Maurice's job was a reason to do, they were worried that they couldn't believe it after it was over.
"My wife has sent something she doesn't mean.
He's not a racist.
We're not racist," Joel Plasco's husband told the Post.
"But are you willing to let your children be treated by someone you've hurt, even though it's just a mistake?
Your new baby?
Come on."
As it is combined with "seriousness," says Plasco's wife just gave birth to her baby two months ago and is in "a very difficult situation."
"You're going to follow someone in such a condition?
It's not a good thing to do," the investment banker added.
While legal action is still in effect, the courts of the United States have upheld the right of divorce on social media, accusing them of being guilty of misconduct and of being guilty of being guilty of a crime.
Paddington's worried reader won't talk about the money, the new post is over.
His daughter Bond, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after her book was received, was explained in a letter. "It's hard to talk just without knowing where she was going, reading it for the first time before it was published.
Very funny to know how we know about the great success of Paddington."
Telling his father, who was a BBC camera before inspiring through the book of children with military games, which was very optimistic about the results of his work that had been rejected, he added the 60th year of publication that he felt like "the sweet" after his father's death last year.
For Paddington, whom he described as "a very important member of our family," he added his father quite proud of his success.
"He's a pretty quiet man, and he's not a proud man," he said.
"But since Paddington is very important to him, it's like you have a child who's got something: you're proud of them even though not all your efforts.
I think he looks at Paddington's success like that.
Although it was the result of his creation and imagination, he always praised Paddington himself."
My daughter's in a state of shock and I have to say goodbye to her on the phone.
At the time of her birth, her daughter was immediately taken to Nice Louis Pasteur 2, but the doctors failed to save her.
"Nad makes a call in peace to make it very bad, that he's probably not going to survive," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
Then I got a call from Nad who said he'd die in two minutes ahead and he asked me to say goodbye to him.
And I did it too.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, honey.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medications that doctors have been given to keep her heart steady are getting ready and leaving her body system.
He died a few years ago when the process of feeding continued and everyone seemed to die.
I can just sit there and wait, understand all this is over.
I can't walk, or cry or cry because I'm in a situation surrounded by family and people.
I really have to hold on to it all."
At last Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, now sad about the loss of her daughter, flying with other passengers--not knowing what she's been through.
"No one knows it," he said.
"My head is weakened and my eyes are kept fixed all the time.
It's very difficult to explain, but when I was on that plane, I felt so deep compassion for Nad.
That he needs love and understanding from me.
I know how much she loves him."
Women who are grieving post a card to avoid suicide at the door
Two women who lost loved ones in death tried to prevent others from committing suicide.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have posted cards at a door in Welsh with inspiring messages and numbers that can be connected to get support.
The son of Mr. Davis, Tyler, was 13 when he began to suffer depression and suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't want any parents who feel like I feel every day," he said.
Mrs. Davis, aged 45, who lives in Lydney, says that her son is a coke who promised with a smile that was coming.
"Everyone knew him from his smile.
They're always saying that his smile gives him a break."
But, he stopped working before he died, like he was "in a very dark place."
In 2014, Brother Tyler, then 11 years old, was found after he committed suicide.
Mr. Davis said, "I'll keep worrying if there'll be any further effects later."
Mr. Davis made those cards, "to let people know that there's someone else out there you can approach and talk, even if they're a friend.
Don't sit down and be quiet-- you need to talk."
Mrs. Humphreys, who spent years with Mrs. Davies, lost Mark, his wife for 15 years, shortly after his mother died.
"He didn't say if he felt sad or depressed or anything," she said.
"A few days before Christmas we noticed a change in her behavior.
And he was in the lowest part of the low part of the night when they opened their gifts to him, he saw them not, nor did he see them.
He said that his death was a great tragedy for them, but they had to say through him: "This is what has been done in the family.
It divides us.
But we have to go through it and fight."

The future of Brett Kavanaugh was in uncertainty when the FBI began its investigation.
"I think, if we really got something like what he asked -- a time-limited investigation, within his scope -- we might be able to bring some unity," said Mr. Flake on Saturday, adding that he was afraid of the "damage" committee in the middle of the decision of the building.
Why would Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republicans not want the FBI to investigate?
Their friendship was based on their love for each other.
Five more weeks later, on November 6, as expected, the Republicans would do worse than ever, and they would be very weak in their ability to make the choice of those whom they wanted to sit in the highest court there.
George W. Bush has contacted the senators, hired them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked on the White House for Mr. Bush and through him met his wife, Ashley, who is the secretary of Mr. Bush's personal affairs.
What happened after the FBI made the report?
There will be elections in Senate, where 51 Republics and 49 Democrats will sit.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh could get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the president's representative, to determine his victory and to sign it to the Supreme Court.
North Korea's "announcer" team under Kim
Hundreds of people from North Korea to South Korea have been down dramatically since Kim Jong-un took power seven years ago, following a member of the South Korean parliament.
Byeong-seug Park, quoted from South-South data, says there's 1,127 surveys last year - compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said that the control of the border between North Korea and Tiankok and the higher tariffs imposed by human traffickers was the key factor.
Pyongyang doesn't give a public comment.
Most Northese refugees eventually fled to South Korea.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most of the caves through Tingkok, which have the longest border with North Korea and are easier to cross than the Demilitarization Zone between the two of Korea.
Tiankok treated the refugees with contempt and often forced them to return to their homeland.
The relationship between the North and the South has improved dramatically in recent months.
At the beginning of this month, the two heads of state met in Pyongyang for talks on the subject of anti-corruption negotiations.
This happened after a historic meeting in June between US Presidents Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they agreed in a broad sense to work together on the nuclear-free Korean win.
But on the Sabbath, North Korean Foreign Minister Yong-ho accused the US sanctions of underdevelopment since then.
"Without confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and in this situation, we will not be able to put our weapons down side by side," Mr. Ri said in a lecture at the Public Prosecutor's Office in New York.
Nancy Pelois accused Brett Kavanaugh of "histeris," he said he was inappropriate to serve at the Supreme Court.
The head of Nancy Pelois Opposition Party accused the High Court of Brett Kavanaugh of "histeris" and said he was temporarily inappropriate to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made this comment in a Saturday conversation in Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I can't avoid thinking that if a woman is so powerful, they'll say 'histeris'," Pelois said about her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Commission of the Judiciary on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally charged that he had committed sexual assault on Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both young.
In his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional, several times almost crying and trouble talking about his family and his years in school.
He also falsely criticized Democrats in the committee, saying that he was "unreasonable and coordinated murder" organized by angry liberals because Hillary Clinton was missing in the presidential election in 2016.
Pelosi said he believed Kavanaugh's witnesses proved that he could not serve in the Supreme Court because he was used to Democrats.
"I think he's disqualifying himself with those statements and with his attitude toward Clinton and Democrat," he added.
Pelosi says it's important if he'll try to argue if he's agreed, and if Democrats get more votes in the Rakyat House.
"I'll say this -- if he doesn't really tell Congress or the FBI, then he's not only right to be in the Supreme Court, but also in the court where he is now," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is now a judge at the D.C. Supreme Court.
Pelosi adds that he as a Democrat is concerned about the potential of Kavanaugh's decision on the Health Service Foundation or Roe v. Wade, because he is considered to be an interpreter of conservative justice.
In the branch congregation, Kavanaugh avoided asking questions about whether he would make certain decisions by the Supreme Court.
"It's not time for someone who's hysterical and used to go to court and expect us to say, " Isn't that great," says Pelois.
And the woman needs to take it.
It's an ethical pollution, anger for months and years, and she can't get it out without crying.
"We cried when we were angry: Miss Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's weird, what do you think?"
He continued, "I'm very helpful by a woman who's executive in a place, who says she's also crying when she's angry, but develops a technique that means she's angry and starts to cry, she'll tell the person who's talking to her, "You might think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm angry."
And then he went on.
And I think it's brilliant."
The tears of the eyes are poured out as a way out of some anger because they are basically misunderstood.
One of my most powerful memories of my early work, in the office dominated by men, once I cried with unexpressed anger, was that of an older woman--a cold manager who was always a little frightened-- who drew me to a marriage.
"Never let them see you crying," he told me.
"They don't know you're mad.
They think you're sad and they're gonna be happy because they think they're successful."
Patricia Schroeder, a member of the Colorado convention, once worked with Gary Hart in the presidential election.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was arrested in an outside marriage on a ship called Monkey Business and withdrew from the election, Mrs. Schroeder, very frustrated, realizing that he had no reason for himself not to take over as president.
"It's not a mature decision," she said to me after 30 years of laughing.
"There are seven other candidates in the election, and the last thing they need is a new candidate.
Someone called it "Sales and Seven Creatures."
Since he's late in the campaign, he's left in the charge charge, and so he swears he won't follow the election unless he's able to collect $2 million.
It's a fight that leads to success.
He found that some of his supporters gave $1,000 to men only gave him $250.
"What do they think I got a discount?" he asked.
When he announced that he would not destroy the formal campaign, he was overwhelmed by emotions--thanks to those who support him, frustration with the system that makes the crime prevention so difficult and to suppress the election from the delegation, and anger against sexism-- making it difficult to talk.
"You may think I'm too nervous," cried Mrs. Schroeder about how the press reacted to her.
"You'll think that Kleinex is my sponsor company.
I remember, thinking, what would they write on my nose?
"He's crying?"
How the AS-Tiongkok business competition could be good for Beijing
The launch of the US-Tingkok trade dispute is so shocking, and while the war is still far from the words of effort, the two countries may have benefited from a long period of Beijing, according to experts.
Donald Trump, President of the U.S.A., launched his first warning this year by launching a campaign against Tingkok's key export goods, including solar panels, copper and aluminium.
A very significant achievement has been made this week at a new rate affecting goods worth $200 billion (£150 billion), effectively making half of all goods entering the United States through Tingkok.
Beijing's paid every time, recently costing up to five to ten percent of American goods worth $60 billion.
Tingkok has asked to honor the United States alone, and the second largest economy in the world will not change in the near future.
To tell Washington to return means to follow the will, but in public fighting against the US will be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, President Tingkok.
Nevertheless, experts say that if Beijing can play its cards correctly, US trade pressure can positively support Tingkok in a long term by reducing the gap between the two economies.
"The fact that rapid political decisions by Washington or Beijing can make economic movement in both countries more dangerous than what has been learned before," says Abigail Grace, an Asian research associate at the Center for New American Security, a researcher.
Syria's 'prepared' for the return of refugees, according to Minister Lear of the Country
Syria says they are willing to return to refugee camps and offer help to rebuild the country that has been devastated by more than seven years of war.
Speaking to Major General of the United Nations, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said the conditions in his country improved.
"Today the situation in the field is more stable and secure than ever before in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to enable the areas destroyed by terrorism to return it as if.
All the conditions are now present because refugees return voluntarily to the country they have to leave because of terrorism and economic decisions that make their daily lives and their future goals.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrian citizens have left their country since the war began in 2011.
Six million others who still live in that country need humanitarian help.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would receive help to rebuild the country that was destroyed.
But he insisted that they would not receive assistance or conditional aid from countries that supported the rebels.
