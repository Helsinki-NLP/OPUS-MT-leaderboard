I'm sorry about Tom.
Who's Tom visiting?
It could be Tom, not Mary.
What if you invited me to the locker?
Why doesn't Tom want to answer Mary's questions?
Is she married?
Tom wanted to know where Mary was and what she was doing.
I can't answer this question.

She knows who you are.
I want you to see her.
Well, you're gonna regret it.
You're tired.
We should win.
All answers must be written according to instructions.
Answer my questions.
