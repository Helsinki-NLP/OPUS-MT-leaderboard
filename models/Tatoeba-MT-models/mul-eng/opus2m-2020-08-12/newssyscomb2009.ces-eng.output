The triumph of right-wing populists in Rakouska, together, has 29%
Citizen weaknesses on both sides of the current major coalition and the significant strengthening of the right-wing populist parties have led to the first preliminary results of the non-pre-meditative parliamentary elections in Rakouska.
The Rakouska People's Party (ÖVP) suffered particularly severe losses, which seriously affected current President Wilhelm Moltler's position.
On the other hand, the Soviet Voluntary Leader for the Future of Rakouska (BZÖ), the Croatian Heitman Jörg Haider is seeking a triumphal return to national policy.
According to the preliminary results, the most powerful party in the country of social democracy (SPÖ) remains with 29.8 per cent of the votes in favour of the last vote in 2006 but with 5.5 per cent.
The OVP was still high, which cost 25.6 per cent of almost nine per cent of the votes.
These are the worst results of both of these great parties in the history of the cancerous holiday, and in particular in the people who called earlier elections, the fate of the disaster.
At the beginning of July, when ÖVP emerged from the coalition, people had a significant impact on their preferences before the SSP.
However, the lovers apparently stressed that they had let the government go of spending.
In the first responses to the results, speculation about the possible rejection of the president and vice-president Wilhelm Moltler.
The Court finds that this could be done by Monday at an extraordinary meeting of the Presidency of the Party.
Such development would likely facilitate the path to the most likely outcome from the voluntary result, thereby restoring the great coalition of SPÖ and ÖVP.
In view of the strengthening of both legitimate populist parties - free (FPÖ) were mainly 18 per cent and BZÖ 11 per cent of votes - but social Democrats also expressed concern about the repatriation of 1999, when the people agreed with the populists (at the time of the FPÖ was still a single one, in 2005 the BZÖ withdrew from the common government, which even imposed sanctions from the European Union.
This development is clearly part of Haider, who has already announced that he is ready to work with any party and intends to return to the See to the National Policy.
The Green Party was still in Parliament, but it was easy to lose and lose between the radical political parties from the third to the fifth.
None of the other parties apparently exceeded the four-percent limit and did not reach Parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Relations with India can be maintained
If it was not possible to solve the problem with Czech scientists who had been complained to India by the illegal collection of broccoli, it would be possible, according to Czech Foreign Minister Karl Schwarzenberg, to ensure that Czech-Indic relations are better.
The Minister introduced it to New York after today's meeting with his Indian opponent Pranabe Mukhardji.
"If it hadn't been resolved, then yes, it would have come to a certain relief," he noted after a meeting that took place from the Czech initiative.
The Mukherdji said after the trial that the executive may be too hard to deal with in court.
However, he pointed out that in the case of Petra Sváchi, who had been forgiven of the complaint and had been sentenced, the central government could deal with the local government in Dargilling, whose jurisdiction falls.
"His problem could be solved," said the minister.
For Emil Kucher, sentenced to three years in prison, it would be best for Mukhridji to appeal to the Supreme Court.
He can then ask for a leave of absence on the couch and wait for freedom, he explained.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his partner also appeared during the interview.
"It recommends calling to the Supreme Court, then it would be possible to pardon him," said the head of the Czech diplomat.
The only way the Czech party can be fully involved is by providing a "competite legal support", the Indian minister said.
At the same time, he said that such help is already being provided by an Indian side.
"We have the highest interest in maintaining with India the best relations that have long-term traditions.
The Indians also recognize it," Schwarzenberg said.
As the Czech Republic has said, the Czech Republic has stressed to its partner that the problem of Czech entomologists is of great importance.
"We really consider it a serious mistake to imprison and complain these Czech scientists," he said.
The answer to the question whether he had received an oath from the Indian side to avoid it was avoided by the Minister.
"I've already got a lot of promises," he just noticed.
Chech's judging the battle on the bottom of the sea
It will be accessible to an electronic map on which Australia and the adjacent maritime area are located.
But he doesn't care about the continent, but the little point lost in the ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia and with it the adjacent seabed.
At the same time, the area is large as the continent itself," says Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, who belongs to the thirty-member UN Division for Ocean Affairs and the Law of the Sea.
His boss, director of the division, Czech lawyer Václav Mikulka, follows and occasionally supplements the explanation.
He's gonna run a job opportunity and a promotion.
The seabed is still hiding a little known world rich on natural resources.
It can be found here on the root, root and other non-growth sources, but it is also still unknown living organisms that do not have the key to developing cancer medicine.
The bottom is larger than the strength
The coastal states today are becoming increasingly aware of the new sub-areas.
According to the UN Treaty, they also exercise their rights agreed upon in 1982 in Montego Bay in Jamaica.
It is mainly about the area of so-called Continental Shelf, which often takes up to a few hundred miles from the border of the country.
It has an exclusive compensation under the contract for all the sources of the continental shelf.
"Simply, therefore, as the continental boss, he has this part of the seabed and its base, which is the natural continuation of the continent under the sea.
Saha across the border of the coastal sea, often even outside the border of two hundred sea miles called the exclusive economic zone," explains Mikulka.
The application submitted by the country to the Commission to limit the external limits of the continental shelf must be based on a number of cost-effective studies and measurements.
It's the result of a series of years of preparatory work.
"One of our tasks is to provide legal and professional technical assistance to the Commission.
The Commission has already made five applications, namely Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
Only three of the last countries mentioned have already succeeded," Mikulka adds.
The World Declaration has recently noted Australia’s success, which has primarily expanded its coastal states.
But he also won New Zealand - the seabed that the Commission acknowledged last week is about 1.6 million square miles [1.6 million sq km], which is six times greater than the size of the state itself.
In both countries, millions of dollars were invested.
The profits they will receive from the use of the sea floor in the future will be priceless, as they promise.
It presents its requests to other States in a step-by-step manner.
They can do this up to ten years from the time they ratified the Montego Bay agreement.
Where the continental head ends, the area of the ocean floor begins, legally declared as "the common heritage of mankind".
There's no state here anymore. There's no way out.
The law of difficulties in this area shall award a contract to the international institution.
"The bottom of the sea, but there is no Klondak," says Director Mikulka in his statement, "the individual areas are legally restricted and their regime is legally indicted."
Chiche in the Pacific
Part of the seabed today is also part of the Czech Republic.
They are dealt with by other states of a certain Eastern block within the framework of the Interoceanmetal Joint Organisation.
This was obtained in 1991 under the contract, as investors in several other states, as well as the status of a "propocal investor".
It has the right to reside in the area of ClarionClipperton in the Pacific Ocean, located between Mexico, the Hawaiian Islands and Kiribati.
The investor's research area is something bigger than the former Czech Republic.
The bottom is the membership, which is what the Tater's submarine response is.
"It can be hung on the surface of a total radius of 75,000 square miles.
The area is a rich find of polymetallic concretes containing nickel, honey, cobalt and mangan," says next lawyer Ind Pakshi Rajan.
Macedonian staff member Rober Sandev's division brings up one such concrete.
It mentions a small drum or, at some fantasy, a green scheme that, according to legend, revived Golem.
Germany's special containment units were released by hand
The Egyptian government requested help from experts from Germany in resolving the crisis.
When the situation got worse, the special units were ready, but they didn't come up with it.
Further details of the conditions of release of eleven European tourists in Egypt are being made public.
According to the data of the defence ministries, the German Special Forces were also directly involved in the rescue action.
According to the Ministry's statement, both members of the German anti-terrorist group GSG9, the flight of the joint police, the Federal Criminal Service and also experts in logistics from the Technical Assistance Service (Technisches Hiffswerk) were released.
However, according to another communication by the speakers, the two ministers from the German side of the afternoon did not need to, however, because the prisoners left their jobs and fled when they recognized the signs of violent liberation.
The Government of Egypt accepted the aid offered by Germany as supporting forces for action on the ground.
"It didn't come to that accident," said one of the speakers of the Ministry of the Interior.
The refugees left a group of passengers made up of five Germans, five Italians, one Romanian and eight of their Egyptian leaders on the south of Egypt on September 19.
After entering the desert area south of Egypt, they moved their hands across the border between Egypt, Libya, Sudan, and Chad.
The identity of the appellants remained unclear at the last moment, as well as the details of the release or possible payment of the ransom.
At present there are rescues in Kahir.
Minister Steinmeier said the release of arms is in the care of the German Embassy.
He didn't show up for the details of the release.
There are no information available in Berlin when the rescue is returned to Germany.
According to the "Build" list, all five tourists should also travel with special forces from one of the German Airbus and arrive in Germany on Tuesday.
America Snymovna representatives refused a saved package
The first chamber of the U.S. Congress allowed a strong majority to drop a savings package for the financial market at $700 billion.
The Down Jones index has gone down a lot.
In proportion to 206 to 227 votes, the U.S. Senate rejected the government savings package for the financial market.
Over all the challenges of U.S. President George W. Bushe and the leading politicians, the majority of the parties to the programme that should calm chaos on financial markets have not been found.
The role of dramatic action, however, did not give rise to criticisms about the package of $700 billion.
Barney Frank, one of the democratic constituents, called before the vote of the delegation to express its agreement, although the plan is not popular, as it has been said.
"It is difficult to get political recognition to avoid something that has not yet been reached," he admitted.
While voting, the Down Jones index fell by more than six per cent, or 600 points.
The reason was the concern of the investors that the State-saved package could be dropped.
A short time before the end of the vote, the index value was drawn up so that after notification of the expiry of the package, it would disappear.
Experts are now counting on other major turbulence in international financial markets.
In order for the programme to enter into force, it needs to be agreed by the shadow representatives and the Senate.
Travel agents record growing booking numbers
It seems that winter will be good for German businessmen on the road:
According to one study, there was a significant increase in reserves for the next month compared with last year's work - in the winter season even more than 30 per cent.
Despite poor economic growth, the Germans continue to enjoy the journey without delay.
In the winter season, travel offices increased by 31 per cent during the same period of the same year as the German Travel Union (Deutscher Reiserverband, DRV) in Berlin on Monday.
According to a study by the GfK Market Research Institute, there are already an increase in the number of bookings for the sub-months.
According to the DRV statement, this was estimated at approximately 11 per cent higher in comparison with 2007.
According to these findings, GfK numbers are estimated each month to estimate data on reservations from 1200 German travel offices and interpolate them on the entire market.
This result included the reservations of the flights which took place by the end of July 2008.
Because of the poor dollar rate, they were asked for a trip to the United States first, DRW introduced.
On these trips, about one-third of the booking increases.
In this regard, in Germany there are in particular the objectives of Spain, Turkey and Greece, as well as domestic waters.
In particular, organised exercises are underway, announced by President Klaus Laepple.
In view of the rising costs for energy and food, the costs are "as easy as for a customer than for an individual organised permit".
Laepple explained that money can save consumers apart from other uses of discounts for temporary booking or offer all-inclusive.
Even in the summer months, the number of reservations was very good, so the number of Germans who made a trip will be re-emphasized in comparison with the previous year - even though according to another study, the number of Germans has dropped compared to the previous year.
My first Octoberfest
It is a docic repeated mouth, beer from the tops of the trunks and prominent in the legs of famous designers.
First on the beer.
Susanne Kronzucker and I don't really have much to do with it.
She's a blond, a television modulator and wears a quiet eardrum.
I have dark hair, I'm a student, and my watch is from the second.
But one thing connects us: we're not even three minutes on the beer lot, and we're already on the picture and killing full memory cards - it's my fault, because I'm on the Oktoberfest first.
That's how you can make friends.
It seems my cheap circle has fulfilled its purpose.
I'm here as a tourist and I live north of the club's equivalent, and that's how I felt comfortable in the corner more limited.
But right after I get to Theresienweis, it's better than it seems.
Almost everyone has a woman's skirt or a leather shirt; no one looks tired or badly affected - everything is completely normal.
Special views at the station with a bathroom in chocolate are just my closet.
One Mnichovank warns me that I was wrong about her: "You're free on the left, in the middle of a lady, right in front of her, right behind her."
They're going through the back of the stairs to the left.
"All right," she says, and she laughs.
The other subtle flitting techniques don't exist so much and they have simple plastic caps on them with the "This drink is got dressed!" and they hang on to the next bed.
A young man with such exhibitionist skills is named Bob, who from England and who also attended October.
It belongs to "gorgeous", with a long "no."
It'll tell me after he's gone on the same guy.
Right next to one of those hydrants, everyone thinks they're waste bags.
Bob is therefore one of the feared "Wildbieslers" as in Bavaria is said to be free of charge to the public.
The other people are lucky to get rid of this way of alcohol.
About eight evenings run around the square where Octoberfest rides, mostly doctors who have to take care of the divine drinks.
Healthcarers always appear in hives - in four clothes covered with a cover from the apartment to the apartment.
They work like most of the visitors' beer louces: empty there, full back.
Whoever's lying under the bed of this spider from the promenade, he can't see.
"It's the only one that can't go on anymore," calls me in answer to one of my questions and disappears.
Police have published the name of the accident victim
A name was published for the thirty-year-old woman who died in the hospital after she was hit by a car in Essex.
The accident on Shenfield Road in Brentwood on Friday afternoon arrived by Carole Paulson from the darker Chelmsford Road.
She was transferred to Queen's Hospital in Romford, but later she died.
After the accident a 10-year-old man was detained for suspecting an invisible train.
He was already released at the police station.
Turkish diplomatic observations are being expanded
Long before Turkey began its efforts to enter the European Union, European powers were sought to discover deep into the Turkish territory.
On the east coast of Bospor, perhaps only twenty steps in Asia, is one of the best memories of this unsuccessful imperial ambition.
The Hydarpaš railway station was designed by two German architects Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu in the neuronesan sector.
So they'll tell you the tourist guide.
The building sits around at the end of the exhibition with candles on each corner, looking at no distinction from any provincial German council.
The stone is spinal cord.
The whole building is slowly falling apart.
But once a person gets inside a fucking warehouse, there can be no doubt about the size of a company that was the most infamous defense station.
The stations opened in August 1908 by the German Consortium Anatolysko-Bgaddádska Corporation.
Germany, which later entered the empire, had in mind its ambition to manage the Middle East by means of this railway which had to be transported to Damascus, Baghdad and continued to the territory of Saudi Arabia today.
But the German imperial ambitions came to an end during World War I.
Their associates were attacked by Lawren from Arabia and his irregular units.
Relative isolation from surrounding areas caused by frozen borders of cold war is gone
The British and colonial units were proceeding from Egypt and disseminating Turkey and their German alliances from Palestine and Syria.
And bad news came to the Hydarpas station.
In 1917 he destroyed the explosion of the immune train in its planned explosion.
Turkish sources say it's about saboteza.
From that time on, she's gradually falling apart, and her stories are happening.
Today, however, this barrier to Anatolia and continues to serve in the east - at least figuratively - in order to reflect the increasing attention of Turkish diplomats.
The ruling party Justice and Development - AKP - has created a completely new foreign policy for the country.
Relative isolation from surrounding areas, caused by frozen borders of cold war, is gone.
The new policy is now being implemented - Turkey is engaged.
It is remarkable that the Turkish government has a good relationship with Israel and Syria, with the Palestinian factions Hamas and Fatah, with Iraq and Iran, of course with the European Union and the United States.
In order to review the parameters of this new policy, I set up a night train in the Turkish capital of Ankara, where I had to meet with one of the former AKP experts on foreign policy, Turkish Ambassador Suatkinilioglu.
The next morning - about ten and a half hours later - after a short ride on wheels that reminded me of the world’s rhythms of the famous night mail document, I arrived at the Turkish metropolis, designed as a new city for a secular state, which wants to turn back to its Ottoman past.
However, the AKP with its well-known Islamic roots represents the pursuit of the paradigm of the Turkish consensus.
She raised suspicions in the West, especially in Washington.
The taxi has led me to the main state of AKP, ultra-modern stone and metal buildings, which are designed to develop in the developing city, surrounded by half of the scattered business houses and shops, where the middle managers in business clothes - men and women - meet to make fast-impact trades.
Suat Kiniklioglu could be a medium-term policy from almost every other European political party.
Sako, damn it, I'm sure he had Blackberry too.
"The aim of the foreign policy of the party is to reintegrate Turkey into its closest environment.
The Cold War was anomaly," he told me.
Turkey was cut off from its purpose.
Today we have to look at the east and the west as well.
It wasn't a choice.
It had to do both.
"But surely it will come at a time," I asked myself, "when may Turkey have to decide?"
"Turecko," he said, "you didn't expect to have to come to such a decision."
He then highlighted what almost all the people I spoke to here said almost remember: Turkey's relations not only with the Middle East but also with the Caucasus and the Black Sea are similar to the benefits of Europe and the United States as well as Turkey.
With Turkey on deck it seems that Europe as a whole can, metaphorically, go along these roads to East Asia and to the Middle East.
Back at the Hydarpaš station, after most of the night, I was thinking of the two German gentlemen Herr Ritter and Herr Conu who were following the way this building was built hundreds of years ago.
How surprised they would be if they found out that European ambitions in the Middle East could now, on the other hand, be in Turkish hands.
And when I was waiting at the airport for a route back across the Bospor, I remembered that in those days Turkey was called "the sick man of Europe."
So at least at the time, there seemed to be no doubt that the continent would have a reward for this fascinating country.
Memorable lives: Vernon Handley and William Woodruff
Mark Brown writes: As a guideford music leader since 1962, Vernon "Tod" Handley (nekrolog, September 11th) was an elderly Guildford Philharmonic orchestra and congregation.
As part of the seasonal music plan, this year was founded by the great congregation of young Proteus.
He was to be 21 years old, but at the time Proteus finally sang in 1979, some of us were about 30 — we simply refused to give up.
The name "Proteus" (mythological variable of forms) represented the desire and ability of the congregation to get into any music that had been presented to him - whether already medals or Messiahs, whether it was either on its own or with the entire orchestra.
Musical adaptation created by such a young congregation was often encouraging, always exciting, and all thanks to the inspiration of this one man and the inspiration for the song that remained quite constant throughout the entire period.
As Tod often told us to "let the song speak for ourselves."
He said, "The storekeeper knows what he wants.
It's all in that song.
So sing it!"
His tactical technique was very clear and precise, but it was neither dictatorial nor flowering.
If he was already a musical standard anywhere, he'd always get it.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If there was to be any conductor attached to the knight, then it was Vernon Handley.
I knew him well in two decades when he was leading the Guildford Philharmonic from 1962 to 1982.
In the last 40 years, I've been reviewing more than 100 of his concerts, and I can honestly say that I've never been one of them, and I've been inspired many times.
Tod Handley had such a great combination of size and personal modesty.
He hated the leaders who, according to his word, simply "telephoned one or two pecks across the world."
He'll miss a lot of us.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
Your nephew William Woodruff (25 September) says that "in 1946 he returned to the economic history of Oxford and in 1950 became a researcher at Houblon-Norman... and also studied at BSc, MA and PhD".
This comes from Woodruff's author's notes at Beyond Nab End, but it's not accurate.
From 1946 to 1953 he studied economic history at the University of Nottingham, at the time he did dissertation work on the British rubber industry led by Professor J. D. Chambers, and then published it in 1958 as a publication by the British rubber industry.
In fact, he spent the years 1950-51 in America as a researcher at Houblon-Norman and in 1952 at the Illinois, Harvard and New York University.
In 1953 he finally left Nottingham and moved to Illinois.
We don't know why Woodruff passed this part of his career.
J. Vicente Resino at Philosophy College
"I recommend the exhibition of José Vicente Resiny "Flamenco and Life", because his documentary black photographs are amazing.
They have impressed me with the simplicity and the strong struggle with which it is so wonderful, and with the dignity and respect for the photographed.
A show that shows a lot of quotes.
Resino can catch magical moments."
The Honda subterranean is engaged with its bestseller
In November, Honda began to sell the second generation of the Jazz model.
If the predecessor of this single space vehicle already has a significant space, he now offers a more spacious interior.
This is accompanied by improved engines that increase the comfort of the trains and allow for greater fuel reductions.
Cannot initialise Evolution's mail component.
That's the second generation of Hondy Jazz.
Although the new jazz line is very similar to the previous model from the aesthetic perspective, there have been many changes in this single space vehicle.
It should be mentioned, for example, innovative design, new platform, larger sizes and new engines.
Before we examine a new model, it should be noted that a new Jazz comes on the market six years after the first generation was introduced.
So first of all, it's the fact that Honda needed to break this model down for a shorter period than other producers.
Although in Europe Jazz is a less-known model, in other markets it has become a phenomenon.
This is probably the case in Japan, the country where Jazz was the most marketed car in 2002, as well as during the year 2008.
In Japan, since the introduction of Hondy Jazz to the market, almost a million pieces of cheese have been sold.
The second market became an old continent with about half a million pieces sold in six years.
Honda, however, is willing to make it possible for a new Jazz to increase sales in its category.
Thus, while this Japanese company sold up to 83 000 Hondy Jazz coins in 2007, estimates are 100 000 cars in 2009, which would mean an increase of 17% on the European market.
As regards the Spanish market, since 2002, Honda has sold up to 8,000 pieces of the Jazz model, meaning 6.7% of the total sales of Hondy in Spain.
With regard to the new generation of Jazzu, the management of Spanish districts is expected to sell 2,000 pieces a year.
Just the arrival of the new Jazzo allows Hondje to significantly calm down the decline of sales in Spain.
So de facto driving is expected to end the year with the total number of 22,000 sales prices, which means 4 000 less than in 2007 and a decrease of 16 %.
In spite of this increase in sales, Honda increased its share in the Spanish market by 1.8 %, compared to 1.6 % of the year.
In 2010, this Japanese company is expected to reach 2%.
To achieve this part, Honda depends on the success of her next new model.
It has Honda Insight, a five-yard hybrid compact size with a length of 4,37 metres, from which Japan promises its worldwide sale of some 200,000 pieces a year.
As regards the market, the Japanese producer estimates that 50 % of Insight is sold in the United States, while the remaining percentage divides the old continent and Japan.
The start of the Hondy Insight sale is expected in the first months of the next year when the public's presentation will be held in Valencia in January.
In contrast to the first generation, all dimensions were increased in the new Jazzo.
Its length increased to 3.9 metres (five inches more), its width to 1.69 meters (two inches more) and its design to 2.5 meters, which means a length of five inches.
On the other hand, the height has not changed, and it continues to be 1.52 meters.
The increase in size has also resulted in an increase in internal space.
However, these benefits were achieved through the use of new platforms, but by the storage of fuel supplies in the middle of the vehicle used in the previous Hondy Jazz.
The volume of the condom space - which has a dual-day system - also increased by up to 399 litres, by 19 litres more than the volume of the condom space in the first generation.
It should be noted that these dimensions are expressed in version with engine 1.4 because the width of the hold space at Hondy Jazz 1.2 is 379 litres.
Another perfecting other than external elements - such as rear LEDs or the possibility of equipment driven by a panoramic layer - is easier access to the rear seat.
The doors leading to the second set of seats allow the opening of 80 degrees across 67 to the first model of Jazz.
The second generation of Hondy Jazz is new and motors.
From the start this small model will be offered with two petrol engines 1,2 and 1.4 litres.
Both engines use i-VTEC technology, which allows lower consumption, lower light oxygen emissions, and result in excellent improvements in the braking system as well as a high point time in the full range of engine circuits.
The first engine of 1,2 litres has a speed of 90 horses at 6 000 speeds with maximum point point time 114 Nm at 4,900.
This engine - which had a previous generation of Jazz 78 horses - has a capacity of 5.3 litres and 125 grams of CO2 emissions.
In contrast to the previous engine that reached 83 horses in the previous generation, it will now reach 100.
Honda Jazz 1.4 with 100 horses has combined consumption of 5.4 litres and emissions of 128 grams of CO2.
"A car's gonna stop fighting"
As I progress in the development of defense technology against accidents, Nissan has been inspired by nature, especially at home.
This Japanese company has created a job that takes you for a flight pattern, thus preventing strikes.
This is the bio-mymetic Car Robot Drive or BR23C, which represents the first step in the technology of preventing strikes.
Engineers of Nissan Motor Co. robotics developed in collaboration with the Centre for Progress in Scientific and Technological Research at the prestigious Japanese University of Tokyo.
According to Kazuhira Doie, Director-General for Public Relations for Technology, Research and Character Development, BR23C is presented as an extension of four areas of Nissan security.
The robot has the task of strengthening the ability to prevent collisions in vehicles with this sign.
During the year, each trainer creates its own personal space of the oval shape, which is very similar to Nissan's safety shield.
However, the most important are complex eyes, which are able to see in all directions in terms of more than 300 degrees, which enables them to fly in their personal space without stopping.
When creating this visual function, engineers designed what they called Laser Range Finder.
This includes obstacles which are located up to 180 metres in front of BR23C and are calculated the distance of the object and send a signal to the deck microprocessor which immediately transmits it to the front guard.
"At the moment when the obstacle is marked, the worker is like a movement and immediately changes the direction of rotation around the right or even greater role to prevent the fighter.
The greatest difference in the distribution of any existing system is the fact that all attractive manoeuvres are simply instinctive.
If that were not so, the robot would not be able to respond quickly enough to avoid obstacles," explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobile Laboratory and main engineer of this project.
The robot cannot move in the direction above and down or diagonally, its movement is limited only to two dimensions and to a direction which is allowed to rotate its circle, however, in the endless number of directions and possibilities as in the direction.
Not only did Nissan use the rotation function as a means of preventing an attacker from working.
"The Regulation only needs to process information every couple of seconds and to be kept in accordance with these data.
It does not require the storage of information or logical intuition from previous manoeuvres, which can work without interruption with only two dozen KB memory.
You may be surprised, but we don't even talk about giga or mega."
This is the first step in the development of new technologies to prevent sudden shock, technology, where Nissan requires use in serial cars within ten years.
The robot uses lithium polymer batteries that are easier and longer than lithium ion.
Another possible future use of this technology could be to build a unit into a GPS satellite navigation system that would lead the driver to the goal and avoid obstacles along the way.
Enjoy your fear before you take your hypothetical
It should be acknowledged that the U.S. Ministry of Finance has sufficient capital to deliver the injection, and there is no lack of finding.
It creates in the face of the crisis, and to prevent Americans from taking risk mortgages on banks with questionable solvency, it has created a popular-scientific online game "Bad Credit Hotel".
Or "Hotel of Bad Faith"... or a crowded hotel.
The hotel, in particular its receptionists, seems prudent to let a person think twice and three times about whether it is the right time to ask for a credit.
And especially where to ask what is likely to be her purpose.
The fact is, the game contains useful information, even if you don't get any details.
This page is more suitable for young people than space for the whole public.
And what happens when the game's over?
Inside the hotel is a dream room.
At least something because it's better not to talk about buying a house.
Morgan Stanley opens up his capital MUFG
The Banking House Morgan Stanley announced that Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), the largest Japanese bank that issues nine billion dollars to get 21% of its capital.
A week after they discovered their prior agreement, both banks explained that MUFG was able to buy 9.9% of Morgan Stanley’s shares at a unit price of $25.25, representing a total interest of three billion.
The combined price is 19 % lower than the accounting value of the securities by 31 August.
The MUFG Bank invests another six billion dollars in the acquisition of convertible securities that will provide it with 10% of its output and its exchange price is $31,25.
Morgan Stanley explained that the entire operation would be carried out on the basis of an average unit price of $29, i.e. 28 % under its current course.
Morgan Stanley's share, however, was 6.79% lost and reached $23.07 at around 17.00 Greenwich time.
"This strategic alignment represents an important opportunity to speed up the transition of Morgan Stanley to the bank holding status," explained John Mack, director general of this American group.
The new Statute adopted Morgan Stanley last week, which should allow him to distinguish his activities, but it is also under the supervision of the Federal Reserve Bank.
His agreement with MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis is pushing the biggest East from Wall Street to take a far more careful approach than before.
The terms and conditions presented on Monday, other than those, indicate that the agreement has been amended over the last few days: last Monday Morgan only announced that it sells up to 20% of its shares to the Japanese in the amount of $8.5 billion.
"We were thinking again a week ago," he explained in Tokyo Toshihide Mizuno, executive director of MUFG, "that our participation will consist exclusively of ordinary actions.
However, given the current economic and market situation, we wanted to reduce the risk to the minimum and also hide."
On the basis of the weighted average prices, MUFG will pay for Morgan Stanley’s securities by 7 % less than their accounting value.
The operation will result in a reduction in profit from the share of approximately 20%.
The agreement assumes that MUFG will be able to convert half of its preferential securities into normal shares for a year if the latter will be appointed to exchange for a price of 50 % over the exchange price, i.e. at $47 gross.
Morgan Stanley ensures that the capital that will bring MUFG will enable him to use investment opportunities, strengthen his balance sheet and increase his readiness.
However, the speakers refused to provide specific information on both new links on strategic projects.
Following the investment in MUFG, Morgan Stanley should pool around 15 % of Tier One payment capacity, then one of the best in the industry.
Morgan explained that since the end of August, he's been downgrading his balance sheet.
The last weeks were favorable for the group, as its stock exchange rate dropped by half, while the insurance costs against the risk of non-payment associated with early growth.
These costs were collected in the afternoon, but they remained high, about 12 %.
Last week Goldman Sachs, the only other "live" of the big Wall Street investment bank in Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynch, announced that she had picked $15 billion, which was part of Berkshire Hataway, Warren Buffett's group.
Rafael Correa on Monday in Quitu.
Re-establish the Republic around socialism in the 21st century.
This is the joint project of Venezuelan Hugo Chávez, Bolivian Eva Morales and Ecuadorian Rafael Correy.
In the past week, the third appointed person submitted a vote, following the example of his opponents and friends, on the proposal of the new Constitution.
And his mission was fulfilled, because 64% of voters, according to official results covering 80% of the votes, voted in the referendum "yes".
"No" according to these findings was 28 %, 7 % of the votes were unpaid and 0.7 % of the votes cast were empty.
In order to accept the proposal of the Constitution, he had to receive half of the votes plus one.
Two studies carried out in the east of the electoral premises and the number of non-governmental organisations indicated "yes" on Sunday of clear victory, with a 63% to 70% increase.
Last night of Sunday afternoon, Rafael Correa asked for the victory of his proposal for the Constitution.
"The institution won the whole race," he assured and congratulated the Ecuadorans in the governorship seat of Guayaquil, 280 miles south of Quita.
Of course, it is clear that Rafael Correa was blessed by Chavez and Morales, but also by his Chilean opponent, Michelle Bachelet.
The vote, which was taken in silence by the observer mission of the Organization of American States (OEA), concerns the text on 444 items that will be "new socialism" promoted by the president.
The proposal of the Constitution is very much for the state of the economy by granting it a "development plan" of a country living in particular from the difficulty of oil to foreign companies and from a foreign currency that sends its immigrants.
The proposal protected Correau, which was elected in 2006, also extends the powers of the Head of State, which will be able to carry out two consecutive four-year mandates and will have the possibility of releasing the draft.
Correa has already announced that it will take advantage of this power and will take on a new mandate in February 2009.
The Constitution also establishes the principle of free health and education, which the President has begun to implement in the country with 13.9 million citizens, where 50% of the population lives below the poverty line.
Finally, the ban on the presence of foreign troops ending the Washington-Qitem agreement on the use of Ecuadorian bases as an original point of American anti-drug operations.
In Chad 19 hands were released
The Egyptian command was attacked by eleven tourists and their eight-year-olds who were killed ten days ago.
They're in Cairo.
Eleven European tourists and eight Egyptian leaders who were held in the wilderness for ten days were transported to Egypt’s capital in the spring of life and health.
During the morning, Egypt's command was released in Chad.
The handcuffs flew around 15.30, apparently in good shape, on the deck of a special plane on the al-Maza military base, closely adjacent to the international airport in Cairo.
Suddenly they were transferred without having the opportunity to express themselves in the press, on the deck of a helicopter into the hospital in Maadi, the rural Káhiri district, so that they could be given a detailed medical examination.
"They're all healthy" and "no ransom was paid to foreigners," said Egyptian tourism Minister Zohejr Garran on the road.
Since its arrest on September 19, during the Safari in a vehicle with all four rounds on Mount Huanat, on the border of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, a group of hands were pulled from one hideout to another 35 unknown.
The group includes 11 tourists - five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian - and also eight Egyptians: two leaders, four drivers, one border manager of the Egyptian agency, the organizers of the Safari.
A certain lead representative of the Egyptian security components indicated that 30 members of the special units who approached the site on the deck of two helicopters had appeared on the roof during the night before dawn.
"There's been a shooting, half of the hostages were killed and the rest of the fugitives were killed," said this source, who wanted to stay in anonymity.
He noted that almost 150 members of the Egyptian special forces were sent from the blue unit to Sudan, where they received support from the German and Italian forces.
The head of Italian diplomat Franco Frattini from Belgrade, where he is right there, mentioned the role played by secret agents and compositions of Italian special forces.
"We must recognize that we have achieved this result through the professionalism and effectiveness of people from our secret services, from special forces," he said without further clarification.
He also claimed that it would be paid out in cash.
On the night before, the Sudanese army had declared that the driver had a vehicle with all four wheels on which the deck was located and six of them had been killed by a guard and two prisoners.
The army claimed that they were joined by a group of rebels in Darfur, the Sudan-Unit (SLA-U), which immediately refused the attack.
Letters - Quiet majority of the cultural resource
The debate on the financing of culture is full of handicraft headlines and is the subject of a pre-election campaign.
I'm on my way.
However, one area of our cultural life is still mentioned.
Who will rise up to collect the poor sums that are provided by small museums, archives, archaeological excavations and national monuments that are starving?
Which policy should remind the federal government that they forget their memories and their historical buildings?
That in Quebec, like in Canada, we don't have laws that would really protect our cultural heritage?
Did you know that the French government owes three and a half million euros to restore the Chinese castle in the valley of Loiry?
In our American neighbors it is written in the Charter that the protection of cultural heritage is part of American culture and that it must be protected by all citizens, all elected representatives and all national organisations, in fact.
In Québek, in the Federation for the History of Québek, it strengthens at least 40,000 volunteers to 211 companies for history, memory, archives and genetics, the preservation of a collection of private archives and the protection of archaeological remains for several minors.
Often these companies are looking at the dogs of our memories, which the hungry protest when promoters and leading makers release their bulldozers on old stones and forgotten remains.
When are we finally waiting for history and memories?
Government of Benelux State Bank Fortis
The Benelux states will help the Belgian- Dutch Bank Fortis, which has been the first in Europe to have a problem due to the widespread impact of the US mortgage crisis, partly because three countries support the monetary and insurance system, which also has a capital share in Hungary, a share of EUR 11.2 billion.
This week, the Belgian, Luxembourg and Dutch government agreed to take part in the European Central Bank and the European Commission for Economic Competition.
Fortis is the first euro area in which the international financial markets crisis, which has spread into waves for more than a year, has reached a major crisis and the decision made in this area could be considered from a certain perspective as previous.
In the sense of the decision that occurred on Sunday night, all three states will purchase almost half (49 per cent) of the bank's property.
The bank sells part of its capital shares, in particular the principal insurance - activities purchased in a long year from the Dutch Bank ABN Amro.
Bank shares Fortis began last week's first break, and in the second half of the week, serious signs of crisis have already appeared in the institution.
However, analysts agree that with their 85,000 employees, the bank is too big to let it go.
The company's securities fell only on Friday by 12 per cent, at least 14 years of age.
The value of the share of more than two-thirds of the value of the stock shall be calculated from the yield.
In view of the current stock prices, the total market capital value of the group is around EUR 14 billion, however, according to the company’s leading representatives, this is unrealistic.
The management of the company is ultimately due to the collapse of Fortis's action on the maritime market related to the adoption of an American package of $700 billion.
On Monday, the action's been taken in peace.
On Friday a new director general, Filip Dierckx, was appointed head of the bank.
The money institution was also looking for private buyers, and no one has ever signed up with a more serious offer.
The Belgian government has already announced that investors will not be afraid of their money.
The bank's clients have never panicked, and the sides have not been protected from the attack.
In Hungary the Fortis bank has its own side and has also purchased several lease companies.
Lisca in the kitchen
Health and health insurance in America, on the basis of data from people buying medicines, often precludes the conclusion of an insurance contract.
Data protection experts are afraid that the data market will become uncontrollable.
"There is a data protection programme which takes into account the use of prescription data in any case for authorisation of the person concerned.
This must be in the hands of someone independent, otherwise we believe the doll of a leaf," says Washington Post Richard Dicka, author of a program designed to monitor prescriptions.
Insurance companies shall make insurance and the amounts paid in the case of insurance events depending on the health status of the stakeholders and where the risk is assessed as too large, insurance shall not be terminated.
In the past, they sent medical examinations and concluded the contract only when they knew their results.
Ten years ago Dick developed a much easier process: based on the identification number of customers from the doctor, it is easy to find out which medicines he bought in the last year and half of which the program itself produces what he suffers from and what his health is.
For example, if you regularly buy large amounts of medicines to reduce cholesterol, it means that you have practically uncontrolled high levels of blood fat, which immediately puts it in a high risk category.
There are now several versions of the programme, some of which are at present also at risk, so there is certainly no work to do except paper, although there are few problems.
It is not surprising that lactating medicines can also be used for several purposes, such as anti-migraine or heat waves, but are effective against depression.
These represent a significant increase in risk in terms of commercial insurance, where the first mentioned problems are none.
For the purpose of requesting and processing data, special companies have been established which require patients for authorisation prior to receiving the necessary information from their doctor.
It's now being pushed by the authorities, maybe they're not stressed out for their lack of practice.
Some companies have recently been working on the results of laboratory studies related to the data on medicinal products used, which will enable them to provide a more accurate picture of the patient’s state of health.
Data has become increasingly available to companies, while their use will be better controlled.
There is a specific health data protection law, and its effectiveness applies only to health and insurance providers.
The proposal of a law which gives the authorities the right to control and the companies specialised in the provision of data is before Congress.
Richard Dick acknowledges that this is not enough: therefore, his programme has been developed so that the data collection is linked to the express agreement of the person concerned.
Another thing is that the authorisation concerned may only be difficult to withdraw, otherwise the insurance agreement will not be concluded with it.
So the blind are only some referenced to the leaves of good will.
Global Marseille Menu
The European Union and India dual trade
Since the European Union and India are each other's leading trading partners, this issue has led to other, particularly global problems, as well as the order of the ninth meeting at the highest level.
The French-Indian summit will also be concluded today, which will focus on cooperation in the field of nuclear energy.
However, the European Union acknowledges that India is developing democratic power, which should be given greater opportunity to talk about international affairs, although the Member State has not yet been able to find a common denominator in support of the permanent membership of New Dilła in the UN Security Council.
This question was not even further dealt with at the ninth summit held in Marseille yesterday.
French President Nicolas Sarkozy as current President of the Union, the European Commission’s President José Manuel Barroso and the High Representative for Foreign Policy Javier Solana welcomed Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, with whom they also agreed to double the trade by five years or to increase to more than a hundred billion euros.
In view of the fact that the exchange of goods between 2000 and 2007, from 25 billion to 55 billion is not an ambitious objective.
In this respect, twenty-six existing bilateral agreements with India on civil aviation were coordinated from a legal point of view, so Green achieved future and air transport.
By the end of 2009, India would like to sign a free trade agreement with the Union.
Sarkozy promised they'd be quick.
The aim is to balance the balance, while the EU is the first trading partner in India, New Dilli is between EU partners to the ninth place.
The Summit also focused on global issues.
The situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan, related to terrorism - both sides condemned in all its forms and called for the speedy convening of the UN Conference.
They also called for the end of their business relations with Dauha, although they both have a large share of its inconsistencies.
The European Union has confirmed that it will continue its energy and climate programme, although it would like to reduce the emissions of harmful substances by at least 20% by 2020.
It also agreed with India, as well as with the conclusion of a global agreement and the production of greenhouse gases at the climate conference next year to reduce the greenhouse effect by 50 per cent by 2050.
Both sides would also like to prevent the rise in food prices and support the convening of an international conference to deal with the financial crisis.
The Indian Prime Minister today is headed to the French capital city, where at a bilateral meeting he intends to close the trade on the peaceful use of nuclear energy.
Paris believes that the trust in the construction of Indian nuclear reactors in the value of EUR 20 billion is earned by French companies.
According to the Agency's reports, the agreement should be valid for 15 years.
In Frankfurt more than three Italian publishers
A large part of Italian publishers at the International Book Fair in Frankfurt.
More than three Italian publishers are participating in the 60th edition of the Buchmesse, the most important international meeting for the exchange of rights.
The International French Book Fair expects more than seven thousand exhibitors from one hundred different countries to take 171,790 square metres with more than four thousand and three thousand titles to see with Turkey as an honest guest.
The City of Culture Minister Francesco Maria Giro will represent the Italian government at the Inaugural Festival in Italy: Italy is actually participating institutionally with the Italian Centre (Punto Italy) – 264 meters of four exhibition sites.
The meeting with the press in Room Structure Buchmesse will be followed by a discussion in Pavilion 5.0: this will be an opportunity to present numbers, trends and prospects regarding the state of publishing in Italy.
According to the data, the importance of foreign authors' books is constantly reduced in proportion to the total Italian production, mainly with regard to literature for children and adults.
Found by Steve Fossetta, a millionaire who disappeared a year ago
The rest of the plane was found by Steve Fossetta, a millionaire who disappeared on 3 September 2007, while traveling to Nevada.
Troskeys were discovered at one altitude of up to three thousand metres above sea level, in the Mammoth Lakes area in Sierra Nevada, on the border between California and Nevada.
But there were no human remains within the flight.
Sheriff Madera County, John Anderson, raised doubts that remained: "The plane was found, we sent it to a team and now we're sure it's exactly what Steve Fossett said at a press conference on the day he disappeared."
The sheriff then explained that no human remains were found in the airport or in the surrounding area.
63 million years old is considered dead from the bear.
The U.S. Transport Safety Office (Ntsb) announced that a few hours after the introduction of the triangular flight was sent to an investigation team that finally identified the aircraft: it was precisely about Bellanca 8kcab, unknown since 3 September 2007, when Fosset landed from Yerington in Nevada for the third year.
Yesterday, still in California, not far from the border with Nevada, some Fossetto's personal items were found near their home in Mammoth Lakes.
It's two documents with Fosset's name, both issued by Illinois Federal Airport, cash in cash and one band.
The search for Fossetta was canceled a month after his disappearance.
The billionaire has gained a place in history thanks to the long collection of primers.
In 2002, at the sixth test, he became the first man to complete his journey around the world in an air balloon: two weeks a year on his own.
Three years later, he took over the world at the airport and did not have access to it.
Among its many records are also flying at a height of 15445 metres above Andami, even with a doll.
Glk, advertising you don't expect
One unusual Suv with original design and exactly defined determined lines, wide surfaces with precise roots.
This is, in short, the last-born GlK from "compattive" dinners at the star house, which helped Mercedes-Benz try to put faith in this sector.
Thanks to its non-traditional processing, it will be unexpected and unconventional and communication which will carry out the introduction of Suv Glk on the market and which will be available in the Mercedes-Benz showrooms since 17 October.
In this way the advertising campaign, which carries out the detachment of the new vehicle, also begins informal communication through a futuristic payment campaign in 3D, which is first used in Italy for the car ticket.
The Maxi poster project, divided into three different phases, will dominate the main Milan trading class, Corso Como, until 15 November.
The first phase of this new type of communication will begin with the representation of a car in a stereoscopic vision and with the help of special glasses that will be split near Corsa Como, it will be possible to see a new Suv in almost real sizes and in three-dimensional format.
In fact, when you look at the picture, you'll have the idea that the car is going out of bed.
Then, thanks to the use of the innovative technology Elumina8, the new Glk will be enlightened at various times in all its smallities so that it can then be re-committed into one image.
Mercedes is certainly trying to get this commercial something new into the steroid-type field of car communication.
Will he be able to arouse his interest in future customers in this way?
So we already know who the Italians are.
From Trivenet, they're risking Daspo.
Who are these 150-200 boys and girls who are now ashamed of Italy? They are members of the "Ultras Italia" group that has been following National Azzurra for years and who have, in fact, never made any problems.
She never met a fan of the enemy.
The group's orientation is right.
Founder's coming from Trivenet.
From Verony, Paddy, Test and Udine.
In Sofia, groups (in fact a small group) from Campania and Puglie were added.
They have three-coloured trains on which the cities of origin are shown: they were removed on Saturday evening so that they could not be identified.
They're inspired by English fans.
In Bulgaria they found real Nazi fans, Levsky.
Figc made available to the Italian fans 144 entrances to the game: all by name, so easily controlled.
And Viminale really checked all of them: among those who went to Sofia, there was no one with Daslem running, no one who would be forbidden to visit the stadiums.
Four blue fans who had earlier moved from the stadium were denied entry and banned.
Now Viminale is waiting to read reports from the Bulgarian police and then takes action: In this case it is possible to give Daspo for at least five years to fans who have been arrested or who have been identified during the investigation.
The Daspo International, which prohibits visiting not only Italian stadiums but also throughout Europe.
Our culinary, short, doesn't even go into one stadium anymore.
Good luck.
But now there is fear of emulation: this means that more than a hundred others are added to it.
"We must immediately extinguish this fire and not justify those who act this way," they confirm from Viminal.
So, "well-opened eyes, mostly because of national intervention in the middle of the hospital."
It's just in Puglia, there's a small support core.
Tomorrow we meet Osservatorio, in the morning Casms, which can also be counted with part of Aise, is a secret service that deals with the problems at the stadiums.
"Church Leader and Head of the Church and Revenge during Mamel Hymny? It's not a crime in Bulgaria..."
This is the opinion of Domenica Mazzilli (expressed in a very good way), who is director of the Viminal Osservatory for a few weeks (founded a place that was formerly Francesca Tagliente and then Felice Ferrizzi).
Mazzilli was previously a waitress in Torst, where there is the support core of Ultras Italia based in 2002.
It is true that Mazzill says that in Bulgaria there is no crime to celebrate the leader, but of course, the conduct of these 150-200 fans is a shame.
"I don't have sociologist - the Osservatorian unit - the crimes are committed in the country in which they took place.
So far this group has remained at the border, now we'll see what happened and we'll figure out what's going on in the future.
But let's also talk about starring at Mamly Hymmely: it's not even a crime, but if you allow it, it's an incompetence..."
