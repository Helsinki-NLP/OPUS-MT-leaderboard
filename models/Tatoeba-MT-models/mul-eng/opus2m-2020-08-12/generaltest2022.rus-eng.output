Germany: The Fourth Coronavirus Impairment
The fourth vaccination will be required by year or autumn 2022.
The expert believes that the current vaccination in Germany will not be final but will continue with a new force.
Despite the active private campaign in Germany, neither two nor three doses of coronavirus vaccines are likely to be insufficient for full protection.
This convinced the leader of the Association of Doctors' General Practices Ulrich Wigeldt.
This is what Die Welt reports on Saturday, 11 December.
“We expect the fourth vaccination to take place in the summer, the most late autumn,” the expert believes.
In addition, Wigeldt hopes that the fourth vaccine from crown virus can be carried out “in conjunction with influenza vaccine”.
This will help to achieve the best results.
In addition, enhanced vaccination can help to combat the spread of new cornovirus Omicron.
I'll tell you the new option is especially dangerous.
Yes, the probability of re-infection of Omicron three times higher than Delta or Beta.
This is reflected in the results of the preliminary study carried out in UAR.
As a result, BioNTech / Pfizer producers are planning to supply Omicron-adjusted vaccine by March 2022.
The companies emphasize that two doses of vaccines do not provide sufficient protection against infection with the new Coronavirus variant Omicron.
The BioNTech and Pfizer study showed that at two doses the effectiveness of the vaccine was significantly lower: "neutralising potential decreases by more than 25 times".
"This indicates that two doses of BNT162b2 do not provide sufficient protection against microbial contamination," BioNTech and Pfizer stressed.
Therefore, a third dose is needed.
Experts insist on speeding up vaccination rates in the country.
For example, the President of the German Society of the Infectious Disease Bernd Salzberger said that there was a reduction in the gap between the second and third quarters of the population.
In addition to the view of Salzberger, rapid vaccination has an impact on the spread of both delta virus and coronavirus micro-variant.
"The experience of Israel is very convincing," the expert stressed.
Wobler Pontoon21, Bet-A Vib, 54 Silent, 54 mm, 8.5 g.
The Bet-A-Vib series is a special family member of Bet-A from Pontoon21®.
It (as did the Kalikana Vib series) is different from the many other killings that were created in the light of the use of frozen fish, not just for catch.
These shots are more likely to be in close proximity to analogues, a certain weight that is likely to have a positive impact on the nuances of the use of these interesting assumptions.
Another known feature is the upper layer of solid and solid plastic, which creates additional fibrous decelerations in vertical and horizontal lines.
As a " Winter Kill" in Bet-A-Vib hunting, there is evidence of a sufficiently aggressive game.
Often the most common is simple monotonous animation, which is moving up and down almost without a break.
When planning a release from the vertical axis, it is not very much easier to catch in a limited area surrounded by underwater vegetation, corals and other obstacles to catch.
In addition, small deviations are present in the catch of the winter and the large oysters, especially in the middle of winter when precise and aggressive sampling is required.
At the end of the trajectory, Bet-A-Vib is gradually developed and returned to the original vertical.
Bet-A-Vib is also used successfully for the winter hunting of natural fur.
To agree with her caprizam, you can choose from two modifications: with or without NS (NanoSound).
It was also noted that Bet-A-Vib was able to distinguish a passive shot that did not even respond to the living.
The length and accuracy of the Bet-A-Vib catch is demonstrated.
The eyebrow is understood and not captivated, well coupled with the light and flat shrubs even with larger diameters.
To catch the shells, chest, throat or tail apart from the equivalent current and "step", sometimes with a "circling" at the bottom.
If you're hunting in the mines, you can change the front triangle to a double, which will reduce the probability of seizures.
One of the most sustainable in the work and, as a result, one of the most underprivileged, was admitted to his Bet-A-Vib class.
Equally successful can be used both in small and deep areas.

In Libya, there were 7 thousand Russian mercenaries
In Libya there are more than 7,000 private military contractors (Vagner).
On 12 December, the President of the High Council of the Republic of Haled al-Mishri made a statement.
"There are now more than 7,000 Vagner Vaccinators in Libya."
They also have planes.
They're also riding trucks in Sirte and Kuffre.
They have 30 reactive aircraft on Gardabiya Airports (also used as a civil airport in Sirte),” he said to Anadol.
Haled al-Mishri also indicated that the Russian mercenaries "are trying to capture" the central part of Libya, which extends from Chad to the Mediterranean Sea, after “bringing their own person to power” into the Central African Republic.
Keep the presence
According to the publisher, Moscow sought the country to maintain its presence in North Africa and "has settled in Libya".
Wagner has been in Libya since 2019, using the airport and port in Sirte, as well as the airport in Juffre, as well as in the Agency's publications.
The Russian authorities have officially rejected the support of the Vagner CVC for Kremlin.
Where Still Loans Can Be Found
According to the agency, Wagner is expected to operate in nine African countries -- CAR, Libya, the Sudan, Mozambique, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Madagascar, Zimbabwe and Angola.
The company provides military training of local forces, personal protection of leaders and protection of energy facilities.
In exchange for these services, Wagner ' s subsidiary companies receive certain privileges and licences for the use of useful and natural resources, as well as for the provision of arms, technology and military services in those countries," he said.
According to the media, "wagners" like they fought in Donbasse, Syria, Mozambique, Sudan and the CAR.
This group does not mean either in the force cells or in the jury register, but its fighters are not on the formal lists of persons.
This company is subject to US sanctions.
Remember, earlier on 27 EU countries had approved the resistance to Vagner.
This decision is expected to be adopted by the Council of the European Union on 13 December.
The situation in Libya
The Supreme Government Council of Libya is, in fact, the second Chamber of Parliament with advisory functions with the Muslims who dominate it, TASS writes.
This body has repeatedly called for a single day of vote on the election of Members of Parliament and Heads of State from 24 December as at least February 2022.
“The elections will last less than two weeks, and there will be a sharp reduction in the chances that they will be held within the time limit”, notes the material.
On this basis, the High Electoral Commission of Libya has deferred the announcement of the final list of candidates for an indefinite period, transmitted by Sky News Arabia.
Russian Foreign Policy
38 per cent of Russians see more success in foreign policy than failure, 29 per cent believe they are overreached.
Examples of success - "Syria protected, restored peace there", "Northern Stream-2", "All the world was afraid of the harsh weapon", "We were sorry".
The main failures - the conflict with Ukraine, the confrontation with the Western countries, the isolation of the world, - are referred to in a study by the Fund "The General Opinion".
The Government of Dubai has completely rejected the accounting procedure - all of the officials have also become digital.
The Government of Dubai reported a total rejection of accounting and digital technology.
All public services will also be provided exclusively by electronic means.
This is reported by the Emirat Information Agency WAM.
"Today, the start of a new phase of digitalization of all aspects of Dubai has been announced - we have completed the transition to a completely free government," said the heir prince of the Empire, President of the Dubaya Executive Council, Sheikh Hamdan Ben Muhammad Ben Rashid Al Maktum.
The internal and external documentation board of all Duba will now be conducted in digital form only through special information platforms.
The renewal has affected everything except industry: health, HCK, police, municipal bodies, courts and so on. Many commercial structures have also joined the Government ' s initiatives.
The transition to the e-government and the digitalization of the document exchange began in Dubai since 2018.
At the same time, it was estimated that the authorities had estimated 336 million books, comprising 14 million hours of human labour and $353.8 million in the cash equivalent.

The production and export of Turkish cars fell below the level of 2020
The production and export of Turkish cars declined rapidly in November on the basis of the free valuation.
As a result of the 11-month industry performance, Bloomberg reported a lower annual result, referring to the data of the Association of Automotive Manufacturers of Turkey.
According to the association, in November, 115 thousand cars were released in Turkey, 20 per cent less than a year earlier.
A total of 75.9 thousand vehicles were shipped to export, with more than 25 per cent coming from the previous year.
And if, after the first 10 months of this year, Turkey's car sector demonstrated a positive dynamic for the past year, the vehicle emissions by 11 months in 2021 had already been 0.3 per cent lower than last year.
As a result of this fall, there was a sharp decline in the course of the Turkish lira, which fell to 29 per cent in November with regard to the dollar.
This has led to a decline in economic activity in all sectors.
More than 500 SMEs received credit payments discounts in 2021
The first Deputy Prime Minister, Mr. Alihan Smailov, told of the situation in which small and medium-sized enterprises benefit, referred to the IIA Correspondent Kazinform.
“On the basis of information from the Authority on the regulation and development of the financial market, this year in compliance with the mandate of the Head of State from 1 April 2021, the President of the Agency adopted Order No. 127 of 9 April 2021 “On the approval of the procedure for the payment of payments for small and medium-sized enterprises”, wrote Alihan Smailov in his reply to a parliamentary request.
He recalled that the provision of the loan payment schedule provided for banks and organizations carrying out microfinance activities, for loans issued by IRB entities by 1 April 2021, including IPs, from 1 April to 30 June 2021.
The deadline was 30 to 90 days after the MSMB entity was selected.
The employer's statement could indicate a different period of payment.
In the period of retirement in respect of the borrower, claims were suspended, notification of the need for payment of the deferred debt, as well as acceptance by the creditor of commissions and other payments,” the Hatter noted.
In 2021, the second-level banks received applications for a delay in the payment of 603 MFIs, of which 553 MICs received a fine of 9.7 billion.
In the IMF, applications were made for a derogation of 131 MSB entities, of which 95 entities were granted a discount of 105.8 million tonnes," A. Smailov concluded.
Pulmonologist Purisev suggested that people with weak immunity could easily carry the omicron.
The doctor suggested that people with weakened immunity could carry it more easily than those with a strong immune response.
Plummonologist Sergey Prussiav explained why the cancer virus could be dangerous.
The cause should be sought under the conditions of the birth of the virus.
Scientists believe that Omicron is born into the body of HIV-infected or suffering from immunodeficiency.
That's, when he was mutated, he didn't meet any resistance to immunity.
As a result, he's more aggressive.
Because he wasn't answered to immunity, he got very fast.
We see, there he has these beads, chips, maybe more than it's supposed to be, their antibodies didn't come up during mutations -- comments pulmonologist Sergey Purisev.
The doctor suggested that people with weakened immunity could carry Omicron more easily than those with a strong immune response.
It turns out that the strong response of the body to anything, any infection, is not always good.
In such cases an organism can kill itself.
This is also true of pneumococcal infections when a 30-year-old boy dies and elderly people in their 60-year-olds carry it.
The immune response of a young man was completely inadequate: where only a finger could be threatened, he would be like a gun from his shoulders, he locked Sergey Prussian.
The doctor also recalled that Coronavirus has dangerous side effects and the most unpleasant of them is pneumonia.
Light combustion is bacterial and viral.
If the first treatment is very successful and fast, the second case often only symptoms can be bought - all hope for the body.
The first sign of developing pneumonia will begin to intoxicate the organism, namely temperature, weakness, failure.
Then there are respiratory symptoms: difficulty breathing, first in the throat, chest.
On the left or on the left, mental pain can also be a sign of a growing problem.
At that time in Russia, up to the end of the year, a growing generation may be vaccinated from 12 to 18 years of age.

Immunologists have exposed the hypothesis why people with light become victims of crime
The authors of the work examined the fatty tissue left from bariarterial surgery and found that the liver cells known as adipocytes could be infected with coronavirus.
Immune cells in the fatty tissue were also affected by macrophages, showing a strong reaction.
Scientists also studied the fatty tissue of patients who died from cod, and discovered parts of coronavirus in the liver that were present in different organs.
It is well known that HIV and influenza viruses can penetrate the liver through it as a reservoir in an attempt to avoid immune response.
It's probably SARS-CoV-2.
Biologists reported on reasons for dementia
The candidate for biological science, Semen Golocheikin, mentioned the causes of dementia and told of how it was prevention in the Sputnik radio interview.
According to WHO, over 55 million people suffer from this disease.
The syndrome is a gradual loss of cognitive functions, and with the time of work, even in a known situation.
Voloscheikin noted that the most common cause of dementia is neurodegenerative disorders, headaches, some infections, metabolic infections, and certain vitamin deficiency.
Some factors increase the risk of disease development.
This includes hypertension, diabetes, elevated cholesterol, vomiting, depression and alcoholism.
At the conduct level, the role of factors such as social isolation and lack of active cognitive activity is possible," he said.
Dementation also affects harmful habits, such as smoking, alcohol abuse, sleep abuse, and a life-threatening way of life.
Among the first signs, the expert noted the forget, inability to concentrate and reduce abstract thinking.
"It is known that loss of hearing can be an early occurrence of Alzheimer's disease, as well as one of the risk factors of its occurrence," biologist added.
In order to prevent the outbreak of WHO disease, it is recommended to support the necessary level of physiology, to train cognitive skills and skills that require memory and logic.

Egypt has returned some 30 thousand illegally exported artifacts from the country
In the last 10 years, the Government of Cairo has been able to return to the family about 30,000 artifacts that have been illegally exported from the country by way of contraband.
This was reported on Saturday, 11 December, by Al-Hayat, Chief Inspector General of the Department of Returns of the Ministry of Tourism and Ancient Affairs of Egypt, Shaaban Abdel Gauad.
Since 2011, 29 300 artifacts have been returned to Egypt.
Only this year in the Museum of Bibles in Washington, D.C., was 5300 memories of ancient Egyptian civilization discovered," he said.
Abdul Gauwad explained that all the artifacts exported were registered in archives.
The Department's staff are now working on their return to Egypt.
In particular, experts are “following auctions around the world and online sales” through foreign and Egyptian websites as well as social networks.
The Chief Inspector said that cultural values would be restored when returned and then displayed in museums.
According to him, one of the returned artifacts was discovered in Belgium by an ancient skeleton of man, which is now part of the exhibition of the Egyptian National Museum of Civilization in Cairo.
In 2020, the Egyptian authorities called on Interpol to help find the auction in London by Pharaoh Tutankhamon's bus.
Christie's auctionhouse on 4 July carried out trades with a bus of over 3,000 years sold for $5.97 million (about 680 million rubles).
This caused a lack of satisfaction from Egypt.
The Egyptian party also claims that art was illegally exported from the Karnak Temple in Luxor in the 1970s.
The head of Tutankhamon, depicted as the god of the Sun of Ammon, was kept in a private collection and was not placed on the market since 1985.
In what way the relic has emerged in Europe, it is unknown.
In recent years, Egypt has been actively receiving illegal repatriations from the country at various times of ancient monuments.
According to the authorities, 95 per cent of smuggled ancient works are the result of archaeological research by blacksmiths.

FT: Credit Suisse wants access to personal mobile devices of staff
Credit Suisse requires its staff to provide bank access to their personal mobile devices, says the Financial Times.
The fact is that in Europe and the United States, the Swiss bank does not issue corporate communications devices to its staff, rather than offering a discount on the acquisition of a mobile phone or smartphone to a partner of a telecommunications operator.
Under the existing rules, the Bank may review information on corporate devices issued by its staff, as they are used to deal with business issues with colleagues or clients.
The Bank shall be entitled to verify mobile devices in final cases, for example if a staff member has used it to meet with a client who has not been approved by Credit Suisse.
At the same time, after many staff members have moved into a remote mode of work, the Bank wishes to distribute this rule to all the devices that were used to address labour issues.
According to the paper, the management of the bank has set a deadline for staff to be identified by a new rule.
Officially, credit Switzerland does not comment on the new requirement.

Part 4
The last year of his life, Sergey Esena - 1925 - was fruitful in creation, but more difficult for the earthly being of poet and his "ego".
He's already out of some kind of literature associations, he's been involved with imaginism, he's himself, but he's well-known, he's been bitten by critical times, even bad, but the reading audience is ready to wear it on his hands.
A year has been written more than 60 cents, many of which are this Saturday, completed by the Persidic Motifs cycle, written under Anna Snegin, published 8 books, The Russian Council.
The main success was that at the end of June 25, Gossidad concluded a treaty with Esseni to issue its findings in 3rd instalments.
None of today's Sergey Alexander's poets have been so honored, he's the first!
This also resulted in a very good cash flow, which resulted in 1,000 rubles per month during the contract (for example, the factory director received 300 rubs per month, the engineer 200).
That year's funds were needed as never before.
Essen married his grandson Liv Tolsto Sofie Tolstoy, and had to be trained to be a family, to have Sister Katy and Sasha as well as a mother.
Life could have been a pleasure, but it was all beautifully decorated in dark tones by materializing a black man box (written in November 1925 and already published after Essena's death):
My friend, my friend,
I'm very sick.
I don't know where this pain came from.
Is that what the wind is?
Over the free and desolate land,
That's how I grew up in September,
It smells like brain alcohol.
Many notables have noted that Essen is very weak, it looks bad, apparently sick.
It's becoming more and more complex. It's nerve-screaming.
And the reason probably isn't just alcohol...
On the other hand, if such a diagnosis is an alcoholic, Sergey Aleksandrovic, someone who has become a victim of it, there are no reliable documents left.
As for May 1923, when Essen was still a fourth woman, Eisedora Duncan, an American, had recovered health at a clinic in Paris at Professor Peter Gannuskina (again two years later, in Moscow).
And here's the evidence of the poet, the scandals on the ground, the police's overcrowded by ten memoirs.
Since the beginning of the 20th century, the horror novel of the poet with the green snake has developed eagerly.
By the end of 1923, Essenin had recently settled in a friend, the inventor of Ivan Startzev.
Surprisingly, Esena never had her home in Moscow, or Peter, when she had very poor incomes, she turned to smiling rooms, hotels, or famous ones.
The old man recalls:
"He came only at night, and in most cases he was in a state of immoderate drinking.
Once, when she returned at four o'clock in the morning, Essen fell on a wooden floor...
I fell, I wiped my face and my hair off.
When he came in a little bit, he began to scream forever, waving all his simple blood..."
Yes, Essen himself after the war on Europe and the United States (then the dry law was in the United States, but Duncan accepted a similar supply of alcohol) acknowledged:
"Nothing I've seen in there, except coffee and street...
I've stopped forgetting...
Well, and the drink, of course...
And I drank 'cause my stomach's broken."

Matras Promtex Orient Duet Latex Economy 100x195
Promtex-Orient Duet Latex Economy is a modern implementation of the budget model in the premium class line.
The base of the matrix is a block of independent two-piece Duet.
Within a large hole is a smaller hole.
This allows for a balanced distribution of the load on the matras.
With both sides matras is supplemented by an art latex.
It's analog of natural latex, but it's more flat and less expensive.
The density and strength of this material increases the comfort effect of the matrix.
The artistic latex is a hypoalleric, it doesn't contain moisture and dust.
Matras will have a great deal of difference in weight (about 30 kilograms).

IMD Poland considers Belarus to use migrants as "arms" against the EU
IMD Poland believes that Belarus uses migrants as "arms"
The Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs of Poland Paul Yablonsky expressed the view that President Alexander Luschenko of Belarus had used refugees as "arms" against the European Union and intended to return to such "operation" next year.
The relevant statement of the IUD ' s mandate was made in the Australian Financial Review.
According to Yablonian, the sanctions against Belarus had been temporarily "remained by Lukaschenko", but he "was actively seeking new ways".
The Polish official is also convinced that illegal migrants will now be used as weapons “in many parts of the world”.
According to the kp.ru website, the European Union previously introduced a fifth package of sanctions against Belarus.
It was composed of 17 natural persons and 11 organizations.
In Europe, there was a readiness to further expand restrictive measures against the Republic "if the situation in the country does not improve".
Minsk responded by placing a food embargo on a wide list of goods from countries that had previously decided to impose sanctions on Belarus.

AliExpress has already noted the growing demand for barbaric men's pizzas in Russia.
According to the service analysts who arrived in Gazetu.Ru, they were bought 1.4 times more.
The most popular hot barbed wires with a flat and adjoining silhouette, the main colors are dark-flight, tabled, dark-green and, of course, black.
The average price of these models is between 3 and 6 thousand rubs, and men prefer to buy only pizzas - sets of barathe costumes they choose.
You can buy them not only online.
The budget options are in H&M, Mango, Next and Zara.
In the segments of Luke's pizza from the bar at this season are practically all brands - and Brioni, Paul Smith, Etro, and Saint Laurent.
The most desirable is the Gucci model, which went up to one of the top film director Dom Gucci, Ambassador Brande Jared Leto.
By choosing the trails of road markers, you can be sure that the barhoat is made of straw.
Thanks to their special transfer technology, they receive a flat roof with rising external texture and a smooth interior.
More budget options are made from a boy or a polyamide, but they also serve less.
The fashion expert Lamoda Elia Wahoshkin warns that in the case of a barhish pike, it is not his model or fashion, but his convenience.
"Barchat needs a night light, so that's why such a pizza is ideal if you've gathered for dinner or a funeral," explains Wahoshkin.
Another important criterion that allows the choice of a barge to be made is the status of its buyer.
"The male in the barhatta should first be aware of the right push with enough," the authors consider Telegram Canal to be a male fashion "Brammel" -- the owners of the barhattats usually belong to the box of people who buy tickets.
They are simply invited to dedicated world events where they are always indicated by the press code.
Elia Wahoshkin offers to combine a peach from the bar with the same stuff: classic blocs with arrows, single-toned rubles, chalk glasses,
Too simple and everyday things will look inappropriate.
The fashion experts from Brammel believe that it will not be appropriate to show up in the barbaric pool of a private agent on the corporation, and here's what's called "the manager of those who are conducting this event, "yes," to him on the subject."
If the staff member is lower and his aim is to advance higher in the company's complex hierarchy or to pick up financial bonuses, there is no hope for a better barbaric pizza.
This guide is exactly appreciated by the phrase "not in the blue hat", which is considered by the Telegram Canal editors to be a male fashion.

Immunologists stated that revaccination in 4-5 months would help to protect from corona virus strains of micron.
Revocation over four to five months may protect from a new strain of cornovirus infection.
Such a statement was made by Immunologist Nicolay Krückov, who called the appetizer after six months, given the appearance of the new stamp, "the great period"
"In the past, such a period was normal, but now it is best to conduct the procedure in five months and people with chronic diseases through four," said the expert, calling on the private campaign to revaccinate.
Crückov also noted that early revaccination provides a good title for neutralising antibodies.
"If a man has made two seizures and a booster, or he's been vaccinated or vaccinated, or he's been vaccinated and sick, he's got "hybrid immunity", it's an antidote to many and neutralising enough," the expert explained.
The Great Semerca warned Russia of the "great consequences" in the event of entry into Ukraine
The "Great Seeds" countries (United Kingdom, Germany, Italy, Canada, the United States, France and Japan) issued a statement following the meeting of the Head of the IUD in Liverpool.
It emphasizes that Russia ' s "military aggression" against Ukraine "will have a major impact and will be affected by the road" in Moscow, but specific measures are not described in the document.
“We, the Foreign Ministers of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States of America and the High Representative of the European Union, are united in our condemnation of the rise in Russia ' s military power and aggressive rhetoric against Ukraine,” said the statement.
The Ministers further call on Russia "to reduce easing, use diplomatic channels and respect its international commitments on transparency of military activities", as President Byden spoke on 7 December on video by the President of the United States Putin.
“We reaffirm our support for France and Germany’s efforts in the normative form to achieve the full implementation of the Mine Agreements with a view to resolving the conflict in eastern Ukraine,” foreign ministers also said "The Great Seed".
Any use of force to change borders is strictly prohibited by international law.
Russia should not doubt that further military aggression against Ukraine will have a major impact and a serious cost in response," they warned.
We reaffirm our unwavering commitment to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine, as well as the right of any sovereign State to determine its future.
We welcome the position held by Ukraine.
We will intensify our cooperation on our overall and comprehensive response," said the statement.
Earlier today, head of British diplomat Elizabeth Trass stated that Russia would be subjected to "a serious impact" on Ukraine ' s entry into it.
According to her, the meeting showed "the only voice of the "Great Samer" countries with a share of 50 per cent of the world's GDP, which made it very clear that Ukraine's entry would have a significant impact on Russia".
Pfizer was considered 32 times less effective than micron strain.
The effectiveness of vaccines from Pfizer-BioNTech against coronavirus micro-mixtures 32 times below compared with other types of disease.
To this end, scientists from the University of Hong Kong and the University of China of Hong Kong are transferring South China Morning Post (SCMP).
The vaccine was considered less effective by studies of antiviral activity in citizens receiving two doses of COVID-19.
"We see that in most people there has been a high level of anti-fraud activity against the original Sars-CoV-2 option, but this ability has been significantly reduced against microdiversity," said Professor Malik Pearis.
In this context, scientists have emphasized that vaccination remains the most reliable way to protect against serious disease when it is infected with coronavirus.
The previous London Schools of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine predicted the development of the cornavirus pandemic, taking into account its influence on the micronucleus.
The authors of the study concluded that micron strain may cause a new wave of virus circulation and increased mortality if no additional measures were taken.
The Head of Defence of Ukraine accused FRG of blocking NATO arms supply in Kiev
The head of the Ministry of Defence of Ukraine, Aleksey Reznikov, accused the Government of former Chancellor Frg Angel Merkel of blocking the acquisition of deadly weapons by Kiev within NATO.
In an interview with the Financial Times on 12 December, Reznikov recalled that last month Germany had imposed veto on the purchase of Ukraine's anti-shipper systems and Winchests to defeat the homeless.
It is noted, however, that Berlin later narrowed its position with regard to wines, recognizing them as immortal weapons.
According to the Minister of Defence, Kiev intends to acquire the above-mentioned weapons under bilateral agreements with the Union.
In particular, this is about the United States, Britain, Lithuania and France.
In the meantime, FT notes that the position of the new German Government under the direction of Mr. Olaf Scholtz ' s office on the authorisation of arms supplies in Ukraine remains unclear.
Earlier in the resurrection of the Ukrainian Ambassador to Germany, Andrey Melnik had expressed the view that Kiev should not expect the arms supply at Scholtz's office from Berlin.
According to him, the previous leadership of the FRG explained its refusal to provide weapons for the risk of the development of the conflict in Donbassa, despite the “occupation of Russia” of part of the Ukrainian territory.
The same "illegal" position, a certain diplomat, Germany will remain at the new office.
In August, Ukrainian leader Vladimir Zelenski stated that Kiev was awaiting assistance from Berlin to the sea fleet.
In Ukraine, Germany "will be a technical partner in Ukraine," the president added.
It was also noted that, last year, the co-chair of the Green Party, FRG Robert Habek, visited the Republic, where he had made a statement on the sale of defence weapons to Kiev.

G7 warned Russia about responsibility for Ukraine's invasion
Foreign Ministers of the G7 have warned Russia of "the serious consequences" if it continues its military aggression against Ukraine, as stated in the outcome statement by the parties.
The participants also noted that they condemned the strengthening of Russian armed forces within the country ' s borders.
"In Russia there should be no doubt that further military aggression against Ukraine will have serious consequences and serious costs," says a statement published on the British Government website.
The Ministers of the G7 countries and the EU High Representative noted that "they are united in their condemnation of Russian armed violence and aggressive rhetoric towards Ukraine".
The head of the IDI of the United Kingdom Elizabeth Trass at the press conference in Liverpool warned of "great consequences" for Russia in the event of an invasion of Ukraine.
We made it clear that any entry would have significant consequences...
G7 wants Russia to reject the aggression against Ukraine," she said (TAS quote).
Earlier at the summit in Liverpool, foreign ministers agreed that in order to address the crisis due to the increase in Russian troops at the border with Ukraine, negotiations would need to be restored.
It's about negotiations in Normandy.
The North Atlantic Alliance also spoke for dialogue on Ukraine in "Normandian format".
The media representative of Russia, Maria Zacharova, said that, calling upon Russia and Ukraine to return to the negotiating table, the G7 countries “were unable to take responsibility for their own mistakes”.

Discovery of the return of stolen money through the Internet
There are several ways to return money stolen through online stores and not become a victim of fraud in the future.
They were disclosed by information security experts in consultation with the BRC.
Thus, in order to reduce the risk of major losses when bank card data are dropped into the hands of criminals, it is recommended to keep the main funds on a card or bank account that are not used online.
Part of the collection can be deposited on a storage account and completed as necessary.
Experts also recommend that a separate card be placed for online purchases.
If money has been stolen at purchases in non-use of 3D Secure security technology, the refund procedure may be initiated.
“In the framework of the rules laid down by payment systems, under unauthorized transactions conducted without the use of 3D Secure, liability is placed on the participant in the calculation box that does not use this service”, explained the representative of Promwizbank.
An expert from the international payment provider ECompay Arthur Zaremba stressed that the buyer had the right to make a statement to the bank in question of the fraud operation no later than 120 days after the purchase.
In addition, if the offender has used a map on non-bifactory resources, the transaction can be resolved and money can be returned.
It is noted that in some cases Internet stores themselves return the client ' s funds if the order has not yet been issued.
On 19 November, a member of the General Chamber, Director of the Ekaterina Mizulin Security Internet Association, reported that 11 thousand cases of fraud were received only in 2021: from the sale of separate documents to the purchase of personal data.
In her view, an effective solution in the current circumstances could result in the creation of a single window for complaints against online fraud.
Scholtz arrived in Poland to discuss North Stream-2 and EU legislation
German newly elected Chancellor Olaf Scholtz arrived in Warsaw for negotiations on the crisis with migrants at the border with Belarus, the independence of the judiciary in Poland, the rise of Russian forces at the border of Ukraine and the situation with the Russian gas pipeline North Stream-2.
Although Scholtz stated his desire to maintain good relations between Germany and Poland for years, the leaders of two countries expressed unintended expectations for each other.
Prime Minister Polski Mateus Moravecky said he would call on Scholtz to speak against North Stream-2, which is intended to deliver Russian gas to Germany through Ukraine.
In his view, Russia could use a gas pipeline against Europe as a means of political pressure.
In turn, Germany supported Poland ' s efforts to stop the flow of migrants trying to flee the country from Belarus.
Berlin stated that it would help Warsaw and Brussels resolve this crisis.
The judicial system of Poland, however, remains one of the reasons for differences.
The European Court of Justice condemned Poland, stating that the judicial reforms carried out by the right party "Right and justice" violate EU legislation.
Poland refused to pay the fine and its Supreme Court decided that national legislation had priority over EU rules.
In spite of the demands of Poland and the United States, the new Government of Germany has not made a public commitment to halt North Stream-2 in the event of Russia's entry into Ukraine.
The American officials told Congress members that they had reached their understanding with Germany of the cessation of the gas pipeline if Russia entered Ukraine, a high-level officer of the United States Congress reported on Tuesday.
The German officials did not confirm these communications, but Scholtz, in the middle, warned of the consequences if Russia violates Ukraine's border, and this position was confirmed by the representatives of the Great Seed.

Your money in the wall of the church will pay $20,000.
The Santechnic, who found money in the church wall in Texas, U.S.A., will pay a prize.
This is reported in the press release of the non-profit organization Crime Stoppers of Houston.
The incident took place in a large evangelical church in Lakewood, where pastor Joel Ostin, who promised that godly Christians would be rich and prosperous.
In November 2021, Senator Justin Coulley repaired one of the church toilets and discovered thousands of packets of money and cash.
He handed the church’s discovery and, as he put it, did not even receive thanks from Austin.
"I wanted to hear him say, "You know, Justin, you did the right thing.
We understand what you've done and what you can do," he quoted KPRC-TV.
The court ruled that the finding was related to the theft that took place in the church of Lakewood seven years ago.
At that time, about $200,000 was lost and $400,000 was stored in a church safe.
The money was saved, so the church did not bring any losses.
Nevertheless, information on the offenders was declared a compensation amounting to $25,000.
Justin Coulley could not claim this amount because the time has come for the award.
Despite this, the non-profit organization Crime Stoppers of Houston, at its time awarded $5,000 and later received another $20,000 gift from the Lakwood Church, decided to reward the integrity of the senator.
He'll get $20,000.
It was reported earlier that the police had questioned the pastor of Joel Ostenna about the money found in the church wall of Lakewood.

In China, a new case of human infection has been identified by the virus of the avian influenza
The new case of human infection by H5N6 H5N6 highly pathogenic avian influenza has been established in China.
In this regard, the RTHK radio station, referring to the notification of Hong Kong health authorities, transmitted TASS.
The infection was infected by 68-year-old resident of the town of Huijjou in the southern province of Guangdu, which kept the poultry farm.
His condition is considered critical by doctors.
The first H5N6 infection in the world was diagnosed in May 2014 in the South-West Province of Sichuan.
Since then, there have been 53 cases in the country.
In Brazil, citizens were obliged to report vaccination passports on entry into the country
In Brazil, it was committed to require entry into the territory of the state of cod passport, which was decided by Judge of the Federal Supreme Court of Brazil (STF) Luis Robert Barroso.
This is reported by CNN Brazil.
The certificate of vaccination has been issued by a citizen who has been denied custody.
The list of exceptions also includes persons from countries where the absence of vaccines has been demonstrated.
“The situation is even more serious if it is taken into account that Brazil is a popular tourist destination for New Year’s, Pre Carnival and Carnival Celebrations, as well as other activities that require an increase in turpototo,” Barroso noted.
The former Brazilian authorities were obliged to observe the five-day quarantine.
Open-ended COVID-19 full protection scheme
The viruslogist, doctor of medical science, a Russian scientist Anatoly Altstein, in his speech with Ura.ru, opened up a full-fledged protection scheme against coronary infection.
It is said that this can be achieved through the introduction and use of a nasal vaccine.
The international use is made up of a large number of A immunoglobulins. This does not occur when the vaccine is introduced.
Immunoglobulin A protects the flexible eye, so the virus cannot penetrate the body.
And inside, after vaccination, we've got more and more immunoglobulins G (anthel).
And if you introduce both vaccines, you get a lot of immunoglobulins A and G. But there are no solutions for double vaccination," the doctor said.
The chief profilatologist Urfo, doctor of medical science Sergey Tokarev, in turn, stated that the main advantage of using nasal vaccination in conjunction with the injection was the possibility to stop being a COVID-19 carrier.
He added that this would help to ensure that, in such a case, the protection of the body is likely to be maximum.

Mass protests against vaccines are not halted in Europe
More than a thousand demonstrators were on the street in the Austrian capital, Vienna.

WHO has already discovered "micron" in six tenths of States
The World Health Organization (WHO) stated that the new corona virus strain “micron” has already been identified in 63 countries.
A number of experts have already said that the spread of the new stamp could have disastrous consequences.
The report of WHO discussed the pace of distribution.
According to the organization on 9 December, there were already 63 countries in all six regions of WHO.
That's because he's been active since the end of November.
WHO is also concerned about the high levels of distribution of the new variant of coronavirus.
WHO experts fear that a new state of provisional data can be spread to the extent that it is part, the same Indian version of crown virus that is now leading in all absolute countries without exception.
In the meantime, the Director General of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhan Hebreesus, said that microms could have a significant impact on the movement of crown virus pandemics.
Similar conclusions have also been reached in Britain.
The experts at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) believe that "micron" will push "delt" in the coming months.
The number of patients in Britain alone is about 1 million, while the number of people who are sick is currently officially "micron" in the Kingdom, while the estimated number is up to 10,000.
British experts predict tens of thousands of deaths from microns, and more than 2,000 people will be taken to the hospital every day.
The British health system will not be able to deal with this.
The situation is complex because, according to recent studies, the effectiveness of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine against the micron strain 32 times below compared with the other types of disease.
The response to the "micron" of the Russian "Sputnik V" until it's unknown will be understandable in the next few weeks.
The Hamalaya Center has just begun testing a Russian vaccine on a micron.

Dr. Paulova spoke of "migrating the day out" to workers
Several factors may lead to loss of self-sensitivity
The reason for the loss of self-sensitivity after work is often “migrating the day out”, said a well-known physician, a medical scientist, senior medical officer at the IGU basic medicine college, the head of the U.S. hospital of Zuhrahra Pavlov in his telegram channel.
In her opinion, this is especially true of those who suffer from headaches, blindness, and weakness.
Dr. Paulova noted that in addition to the week of pregnancy, there are sufficient objective reasons for the adverse reaction of the organism to change the conditions.
Our life has changed in the past.
"We've been sleeping for a long time, we've been sleeping all day, we're eating more, and we're eating more, and we're drinking less," the doctor argued.
Because of excess water and lack of water, heavy water and drought."

How many hidden saharas in traditional products?
Sugar is not the best source of useful nutrients.
Its failure in reasoning may lead to type 2 diabetes, as well as to cardiovascular and oncological diseases.
Consumers should be aware that under an unknown word, a hidden sucrose can be indicated as an ingredient, similar calories, composition and glycaemic index.
A few dozens of names can be presented on the label.
One of the most widespread and frequent encounters is glucose and fructose.
Other forms of sugar may also be dextrose (sugar obtained from maize), levelos (fruit sugar), melass (black path), agar syrup, etc.
These are all simple carbohydrates that are related to mono- and disacharides, and they can be not only in conditure products but also in cassava, in the doctor’s cane, bread, etc.
The most effective way to reduce the consumption of sugar is to use targeted and unprocessed products as well as to pay attention to the label and to the many different names of sugar.
The variety of sugars varies according to taste, but no matter what is called an ingredient in the composition of the product - syrup or nectar, processed or unprocessed, useful or white - it remains as sugar.
It is not only to be taken into account as the exact number of sugars specified by the manufacturer on the packaging, but also that the fruit, fruit, etc. contains a certain number of sugars.
Thus, the total number of saharas can be significantly higher than that indicated on the label.
Chancellor of Germany Scholtz: Gas loses importance for FRG over 25 years
The new FRG Chancellor Olaf Scholtz stated that the import of gas was of no importance to Germany, as the country continued to move towards economic decentralization.
According to him, Germany plans to completely withdraw from gas, oil and coal by 2045, becoming a climate neutral country.
"It is after 25 years of peace that the issue of gas transport in the FRG and Europe will play another role," said the Chancellor.
Scholtz noted that Germany continued to remain committed to transporting Russian natural gas and in the future, as this resource is currently important for energy transition.
He recalled that Germany and the United States had made a statement confirming support from Ukraine ' s Berlin Energy Transformation.
Former Head of Media Germany Annan Berbok stated that the process of certification of the North Stream - 2 gas pipeline continues.
According to the Minister, the Coalition negotiations and the Coalition Treaty had stated that European energy law should be applied to energy projects.
The diplomat also indicated that the pipeline was not "compliant to the requirements" of the EU.

The hackers broke Twitter account, Prime Minister of India Narendre Mody.

At the New Caledonia referendum, the majority voted against independence
In New Caledonia, the third referendum, held on 12 December, ended with the same result as two previous ones.
According to the first partial findings of the Resurrection Day, 12 December, on the morning, most of the inhabitants of New Caledonia voted at the time of a referendum against the independence of their territory.
At this level, participation in this third vote was significantly lower than in the previous two.
According to the preliminary results published by the local authorities, New Caledonia ' s independence from France was 3.51 per cent (2,755) of the votes cast, while 96.49 per cent (75,762) voted against.
Jawka accounted for 43.90 per cent, and more than 80,000 New Caledonians participated in the elections.
As France-Presse commented on these interim results, "the outcome of these elections did not leave room for doubt", as independent parties called on voters not to vote.
As the sponsors of the referendum, they spoke against it on 12 December, thinking that the new outbreak of the COVID-19 epidemic in the archipelago would be accompanied by a fully-evaluable and "true" pre-election campaign.
Thus, this non-participation opened the way for the third victory of the French New Caledonia Parties following the referendums held in November 2018 and October 2020.
In 2018 56.7 per cent of the population voted against independence in 2020 - 53.3 per cent.
As the separatists said, they did not recognize the results of the last vote and challenged them to the United Nations.
As reported on the Resurrection Day, 12 December, in the Elisesian Court, President Emmanuel Macron of France should address the outcome of the referendum.
The theme of New Caledonia ' s independence has been very much alive in the last few weeks of the presidential campaign in France.
Several candidates in the presidential capacity to remain in France, such as the “last region of the European Union’s presence in the Pacific”.
"New Caledonia must remain French," Eric Zemmore repeated several times.
The same statement was made by the Republicans of Valerie Peckers, who published a column in Le Figaro at the end of October, calling on the Canadians to remain in France.
In May 2018, Emmanuel Macron announced that he would not take the position "because it is not his responsibility".
Nevertheless, the President added: "France would be less beautiful without New Caledonia."
Prime Minister Jean Castex, on his side, expressed "a strong desire for the election of the Canadians to be the choice of France".

WSJ readers criticized the article on relations between Russia and the United States
The Wall Street Journal criticized Professor Christopher Hartwell, who described his view of Russia and the United States.
The author of the material expressed concern that the West Coop was bringing Ukraine into the victim of Russia.

At the end of Hartwell called on the Western countries to "be the only front against Russia".
WSJ readers expressed their disagreement with the position of an American professor.
“In this article there is a lot of false information,” says RIA News of one of the readers.
"Europe is not ours to "get it," and Ukraine is not our country.
The United States dollars and NATO allies will never enter a nuclear war with Russia because of Ukraine," noted another.

The magnitude 5.2 earthquake occurred in the Curial Islands region
The magnitude 5.2 earthquake occurred along the coastal island of Shikotan.
It is noted that the earthquake was at 231.8 km north-east of North Kurylsk.

Ukraine will begin to produce active offspring of new generations
At the new Ukrainian-Turkey plant, active non-pilot aircraft (BPLA) type ANKA will be established.
On 11 December, the head of Ukrainian President Aleksey Arestević ' s office was informed.
They are able to act against air objects, against other air carriers.
Not even a pilot's plane.
They will have Ukrainian engines and other Turkish aircraft: corpus and so on," he quotes Dialogue.ua.
Commenting on the main characteristics of ANKA equipment, Arestovic said that it was a matter of reactive rather than commodity BPLA.
According to him, this is a new generation of pilots after Bayraktar, who exceed it “in all its characteristics”.
The first part of BPLA must be produced by the plant at the end of the following year, Arestević concluded.
The ANKA aircraft was created by the Turkish Aerospace Agency in February 2014.
The unmanned development was carried out by the Turkish authorities in cooperation with a number of private companies since 2010.
The crackdown of the Ukrainian headquarters has been secreted by data on the use of Bayraktar and the Javelin rocket components during the military operations of the combined forces in Donbassa.
On 6 December, President Vladimir Zelenski informed the country that the construction of a factory for the production of modern warplanes had begun.
According to him, Ukraine is intended to use drones.
On 29 September, Bayraktar Savunma and the Ukrainian ammunition concluded an agreement on the construction of the Kiev Centre for the Training of Staff, as well as the testing and maintenance of the Turkish Bayraktar BPLA.
The press office of the Ukrainian leader called this memorandum “a great real step forward”.
Two lions fled from the container at the airport
At the Singapore airport, Changi escaped from the lions.
The Streets Times reports on this.
Two hunters were able to leave the container with a family of lions coming on one of the planes.
The issue noted that it remained unknown from which country they had been imported to Singapore and where they had been sent.
One of the runaway lions stepped over the container.
The animals were unable to get away from him because of a series of protective networks.
The opposition ended after the arrival at the airport of staff of Mandai Wildlife Group, which was known to all Singapore zoos.
They drove lions using tractors and plan to transport them to a quarantine facility.
Previously, it was reported that in Pnompe, the capital of Cambodia, Levi had escaped from the store and had been scattered across the streets of the city.
On that same day, the beast returned home willingly, and the people were not harmed.
Specialists warned about the risk of cancer due to vitamin B9
Studies show that vitamin B9, also known as follicle acid, can lead to cancer.
In this regard, the Daily Express had been issued.
Experts believe that there is great evidence that people who do not experience lack of follicular oxygen are less likely to suffer from some types of cancer, in particular colorectal.
However, the increase in the required dose of antibodies contributes to the growth of cancer cells.
Professor of the University of Alabama in Birmingham, Dietist Bet Kitchen advises to monitor the amount of follicle acids consumed during the day.
The optimal dose is 400 micrograms per day.
The risk of cancer shall be increased only if it is substantially avoided by this figure in the larger or smaller part.
China recommends that vitamin B9 not be taken in tablets without medical advice, be monitored for dosing and avoid infants with milk and other foods containing follicle acid.
Former food consultant Rachel Fein called follicle acid, which slows the aging process.
Because she, among other things, is in the avocado, Fina recommended that men over 50 years later have this fruit.
In Britain up to April, about 75 000 people die from micronucleus
British scientists have estimated that in the next five months there may be up to 75 000 deaths in England as a result of the distribution of cornavirus micronucleus, if not overhauling the limits of the winter.
The Guardian reported on this with reference to the study of experts at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM), which TAS transmits.
According to the most optimistic forecast of experts who are part of the emergency advisory group at the British Cabinet of Ministers by April 2022, at least 25 000 patients will be in the country, and some 175 000 patients will be hospitalized.
At the same time, more than 2,000 infected people will be treated daily.
"Serious measures to combat cornovirus may be required to prevent overload of the National Health Service if the micronutrient appears more vulnerable than the alternative to delinquency and existing vaccines may not be able to eliminate infection," said the mathematician Rosana Barnard of LSHTM.
The former United Kingdom Health Agency reported that if the distribution rate of micronutrition is maintained at the current level, about 1 million cases of infection will be detected at the end of the year.
By mid-December, micron can become dominant in the United Kingdom.
At present, there have been 1898 cases of cornavirus infection in Britain, 633 of which have been identified as having been reported for the last few days.
At the same time, on 9 December, British Prime Minister Sadid Javid indicated that the figure could already have reached 10,000 cases.
She wanted to write some wise comments, but she read:
"The noise caused by the incredible suffering of an unfortunate animal and its work on second job."

The question of super-growth in the world for the fourth
Buildings are superior in this year and orders for the next year are in the world all records, despite calls for a reduction in carbon generation and combating climate change.
In the World Register of Ships, the number of shipowners was 1200 - more than in the past year.
In the era of climate change for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, it is difficult to imagine that the number of people with a wish and money on a floating stock of $50 million and above will not be reduced, says the Guardian.
However, they are becoming more and more numerous.
In this year, 25 per cent of the vessels were ordered more than in the past.
Brokers say that such market abuse was not 20 years old.
The first reason is that many who can afford their own boat are afraid of pollution on dry land and prefer to hide from the pandemic on board their own ship.
The second reason is also related to coronavirus.
If all these people had gone to the office before and met with business partners personally, most of them are now working far away and negotiations are under way.
Broker Will Cristy told the press that the Verfis take orders for new yachts for 2025 and later.
This means that the contractors are willing to pay more than they are willing to pay, whether for a year or two before.
"People just want freedom, and the super-rich could afford it," he says.
In Western society many criticize the conduct of the rich and call it a decadent.
The rich, say sociologists, do not want to understand that in the time of the loss of travel in space, life on wheels or planes on their own aircraft, they are causing frustration in society because elite does not want to share responsibility for climate change with all other humanity.
Economicists call on Governments to act and propose new taxes and rules for the super-rich, although they realize that this will be very difficult to implement in such a monetary movement.
In the meantime, only the number of super-heats are printed, but also their characteristics.
Of the 1200 ships, 27 are over 100 metres long.
The Norwegian billionaire Recke spends 183 meters [183 meters] on the Rev Ocean.
It's gonna be the world's biggest ice after the water's drop.
The boat is equipped with a "lun base" as well as a underwater boat designed to study the deep sea.
In existing super-heaths, it was common for helicopters, filmmakers under open sky, and some of them, such as McGregore's battleship, a platform for unity. Professor of economic anthropology of the American University of Indiana Richard Wilke says that compared to the total number of greenhouse gas emissions, carbon followed by super-rich, low.
But it is symbolic if it is taken into account that there are over 2,000 people in the world who are multibillionaires.
This is just another example of the use of a very small group of people.
Scientists have discovered that the emissions of billions of billion billion more than the average population of the planet.
If one person produces an average of 5 tons of CO2 per year, the largest pollutants on the planet of Roman Abramovic are 33.9 tons of greenhouse gases that fell into the atmosphere in 2018.
At the same time, two thirds of the emission track landed on his Eclipse train, 162.5 metres long.
Even if the owner on board is not on board, the command continues to detonate the planet.
The owner may call the captain and allow the team to catch a hake from the Mediterranean Sea in the Caribbean.
Governors are not above the feelings of others when they, like the wealthiest woman of Australia, Jean Rainhard, who controls the continent, complain through Yutub that there is no place for their giant courts to talk.
It is also difficult to understand her call to build a marina for ships of 50 metres.
A dangerous weekly dose of alcohol leading to the development of lung cancer
American scientists have determined how much alcohol consumption per week increases the risk of cancer development.
This is what is written by the Daily Express.
Experts have concluded that the use of four and more alcoholic beverages per week is linked to increased risk of the development of oncology.
The likelihood of disease development is increased by increasing the amount of alcohol used.
Moreover, men with moderate drinking are at risk of developing lung cancer above women.
The exact cause of such oncology cannot be determined by scientists, noting only that certain factors are harmful to the body of the process.

Dogs can understand words and phrases at the age of two
Many, and more precisely all lovers of dogs are convinced that these creatures are very intelligent.
But they don't even remember how many four-year-olds are actually developing.
Over the years, biologists have experimented with various experiments in order to find out how life develops.
Although the vocabulary of dogs is not as extensive as human, a new study shows that dogs can respond to 89 words or phrases.
The work of scientists was published in Scientificalert.
Dogs can't play chess or create words that are not meant in politics, economics and art, but they often can hurt their owners.
The representatives of some communities believe that experts have shown better results in understanding the words of the human language, but statistics for accurate conclusions are still insufficient.
Yes, some species are traditionally considered to be seen as genes, such as labards.
Scientists have come to the conclusion that dogs are capable of thinking logic, and they do not enter a two-year-old child.

Preparations were made for the US and Russia market in Ukraine
The United States and Russia will "trading" for Ukraine's entry into NATO, an analyst named Alexander Kočetkov in his article for the publication of "Glavred".
In his view, Washington and Moscow are planning to continue negotiations on the United States guarantee that Ukraine will not enter the North Atlantic Alliance, despite the words of American leader Joe Byden on the right to “enter where appropriate”.
If you are offered something that is not acceptable, then, for example, selling a close relative into sexual slavery, you will not be able to trade but simply send a suggestion.
And there is a trade in Ukraine," an analyst wrote.
He added that Russia is not planning to attack Ukraine but is working towards dialogue with Kiev.
“They are preparing in secret, quickly and promptly, to commit acts of aggression, but do not wait until the group finds out and deploys opposition forces”, he noted.
China stimulates the development of rail transport industries
China's advanced technologies drew attention to companies from the United States, Germany, France and other countries at the China International Railway Exhibition and the production of equipment from 2021 in the city of Chechnya province of Huanë/Central China.
The main technologies developed by CRCZhuzhou Locomotive Co. Ltd. allow travel to automatically detect and diagnose technical irregularities, noted the representative of Hou Zjawen.
High-speed roads along the China-Laos railway line, which was introduced at the beginning of this month, have already been equipped with data technologies that will ensure greater reliability and mobility.
In the last six months China has significantly increased its exports of rail vehicles, and many Asian and European countries have become “China’s fastest” witnesses.
In May of this year, from the production line of CRCZhuzhou Locomotive Co., Ltd produced the first two-wheeled electric bicycles intended for export to Europe.
With a maximum working speed of 200 km during these journeys, Austria, Germany, Hungary and other European countries will travel by rail.
In November, the pilot operation of a metro train developed by an enlarged company for Turkey began.
The trip will be on the line of a metropolitan, which connects Istanbul to the city airport.
The metro movement on this line will be open next year.
This will be the fastest route in Turkey with a speed of 120 km per hour.
"The Chinese manufacturing industry for rail transport is one of the highest level of innovation and the highest international competitiveness," said Fen Yaosyan, head of China's International Trade and Investment Department for the Promotion of International Trade Development, KSRMT/.
"This industry is the main competitive advantage of China's high-class equipment production on the world market," said Fen Yaosyan.
After more than 60 years of forced work, carrying out a number of independent studies and developments, China has established an excellent system for the production of rail equipment, with a full range of auxiliary funds and large-scale production activities.
According to Fen Yaošan, the country is the first to engage in rail electrification and on the exploitation of high-speed and urban railways.
Biologists listed early signs of dementia
The candidate for biological science, Semen Golocheikin, in a speech with Radio Sputnik, listed early signs of dementia.
According to him, signs of future dementia may be forgetful, as well as a number of measurable congenital violations such as concentration, planning, reduction of abstract thinking.
The discussion is currently under way that hearing loss may be an early occurrence of Alzheimer's disease, as well as one of the risk factors of its occurrence, said a specialist.
Voloscheikin stressed that dementia may be caused by neurodegenerative disorders, headaches, some infections, metabolic infections, lack of certain vitamins.
He added that Alzheimer's disease and atherosclerosis of the brain are the most common causes of this syndrome.
Biologists noted that doctors today do not know how to treat dementia effectively.
Therefore, it needs to be timed for its prevention.
He said that reducing the risk of dementia development would help to study foreign languages and the active community.
WHO also recommends to support a moderate level of physical burden, regular training of cognitive skills through game and hobby that require intensive memory and logic
"There are recommendations for the use of various BADs, but their effectiveness and usefulness are still being discussed in the scientific community," said Golocheikin.
“The World Health Organization recommends the maintenance of a moderate level of physical burden, regular training of cognitive skills and skills through game and hobby, requiring intensive memory and logic," Golocheikin said.
The former charity dementia research organization in Great Britain stated that the disease is increasingly affecting people over the age of 40.
The doctors called the early symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease.
The first concern may be the problem of the patient ' s ability to identify objects.
Another sign of developing weaknesses has been called aphasia, a condition where one cannot find the right words to convey what he is trying to say.
The neurologist needed to send Saakashvili to foreign treatment
The former President of Georgia, Michael Saakashvili, was in need of psychological treatment and rehabilitation abroad, told neurologist Otar Toidé, who was a doctor's council established by the Georgian Ombudsman.
His [Sakashvili] neurological status is leading to his illness.
Stable problems are problems with movement, coordination, nature change," said the specialist, noting that this does not go beyond the normative framework and that the ex-president must now proceed to special rehabilitation.
"This is what we call neurorehabilitation and psycho-rehabilitation, which we did not find in Georgia," Toidde said, requiring Saakashvili to be treated at a special facility that is not in Georgia.
On the evening of 7 December, Saakashvili began to seek medical assistance after his prison staff were sentenced to disciplinary punishment.
Georgian policy has quickly been able to reverse the punishment and restore itself to previous rights.

There have been protests against COVID passports in Spain
In the Spanish cities of Barcelona and Valencia, protests against the compulsory COVID-19 vaccination certificate were carried out by the European Press Agency.
In the Catalan capital, the number of participants was about 3,000.
In Barcelona, the COVID passport became mandatory for access to bars, restaurants, sports halls, old houses and night-time entertainment facilities.
Many manifestists have come to action without mask.
They accused the State of thawing on their posters and called for respect for the choice of citizens.
In Valencia the vaccination passport will also be required for access to entertainment facilities and more than 50 people will be placed in a restaurant.
The protesters in the city declared a medical dictatorship and called vaccination an experiment.
Since the beginning of the pandemic, more than 5.2 million cases of coronary virus infection have been detected in Spain, and more than 88 000 patients have died.
Russia is also planning to impose restrictions on unaccompanied persons.
The Government introduced draft legislation on the single QR code system on 12 November.
It is expected that Russia will be able to visit the places of mass activities, cultural institutions, public food facilities and trade-distinct facilities with either a certificate of seizure or a disease transfer or a vaccine remedy.
The same rules will be laid down for travel on flights and aircraft.

The hard way: Chinese become mountaintops
The Olympics should attract millions of people and help create international corridors in the country
In China, it is hoped that the Olympics will not only attract 300 million citizens to winter sports activities, which will enable President Si Zzinypin to collect 1 trillion of Yuan, but also contribute to the economic development of the remaining remote provinces.
The Tayvo tour in Žanzjako, located near the place of the Winter Olympic Games, is becoming increasingly popular among Chinese people.
In addition to building infrastructure in the region, work is being done: workers are cutting down trees.
There are more than 700 mountain corridors in the country, but only 20 of them are large enough to be accepted at the international level.
In many regions of China, where there are resorts, including in Žanzeka, there are snow problems.
The main challenge for a long-term perspective is to provide a comfortable and interesting break at Chinese resorts to make all the news available.
However, it is still far away.
The Board of Directors of Game Justin Downs says that since his last visit in 2007, China's lying industry has changed to ignorance.
Every year, more Chinese are being sent to shelters.
Fiona, a neo-Bordist from Beijing, one of them.
Despite serious changes, it will take many years to create a mountain culture here, says Downs.
Many resorts are located in agricultural and mountainous areas.
These regions still need to develop actively and create the infrastructure needed to rest there.
70-year-old Gao Makong lives in Cunley, near the place where the Winter Olympic Games are held.
He notes that in recent years there has been a bombing of winter sports tourism.
Two years ago in Beijing, Chunli, one of the local residents suffered no work.
More and more shops are being opened for winter sports.
On the roofs are opening points of public opinion with national kitchens.
In Taiwan there is now even a test station at COVID-19.
China seeks to create a prosperous winter sports industry, its athletes must be leaders of major international events, and the corridors and equipment to reach the world level.
More than 500 million people in the world can face extreme poverty due to the pandemic, reported in WHO
More than 500 million people in the world may be placed in extreme poverty due to the pandemic of the crown virus, which has hampered mankind's progress in universal access to health services, reported in the World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Bank (WB).
With regard to the noted International Day of 12 December, WHO and BB have published two complementary reports.
They found that the pandemic had led them to failure to provide medical services, causing excessive stress in health systems.
In this regard, the immunization population decreased in the first 10 years and increased its mortality from tuberculosis and malaria.
WHO and WB stressed that the pandemic has caused “the poorest economic crisis since the 1930s, which has made it more difficult for people to pay for treatment”.
More than 500 million people are "in extreme poverty because they have to pay for these services from their charity".
In October, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterrich stated that the Coronavirus pandemic had put more than 100 million people in poverty, and more than four billion people had virtually no social support.

Reuters: Taiwanese Minister rejected transfers to the "Democratic Samities" at the request of the White House
The statement by Taiwan's Minister for Digital Technology Audrey Tan at the panel discussion during the United States-organized “Democratic Summit” has been translated into non-video mode, notes the YouTube summit.
The Reuters Agency, referring to sources, claims that the picture was deleted at the request of the White House.
It was reported that Taiwan had been awarded a map with a separate colour from the NRC, which was considered to be an island in its territory.
A map by Mrs. Tan was drawn up by the South African non-governmental organization CIVICUS and sponsored the countries of the world to ensure civil rights.
Taiwan was awarded to her green as "free", and KNDR, KNDR, Laos and Vietnam were red as "closed".
After the Minister showed the map, a picture from her side was replaced with a note that the discussion participants ' views were "not necessarily expressing the position of the Government of the United States".
The NRC was not invited to the Sammit for Democracy.
Reuters points out that the map, which the Taiwan Minister has shown, could go against the policy of "one China", which is maintained by Washington.
One of the sources of the agency stated that following the demonstration of the map, the National Security Council of the United States had been angry with the Department of Goods, accusing him of being a separate country of Taiwan.
The Alliance for Democracy, organized by Washington, D.C., took place from 9 to 10 December with representatives from 110 countries and territories, as well as civil associations and charitable organizations.
Russia was not invited to the summit.
During the “novel day” of the Nobel Peace Prize, editor-in-chief Dmitri Muratov called for the creation of an international fund through which money obtained through corruption would be given to charity.
Earlier today, the Under-Secretary of the Soviet Union, RF Yuri Averyanov, stated that the summit was bringing an “anti-rossian and anti-kinetic flag”.

IND spoke of "dangerous conclusion" in relations between Russia and the United States
The IDI of Russia, Sergey Rabkov, in the "Explosives" interview, assessed the prospects of relations between Moscow and Washington.
He noted that long-term interaction had led to positive conclusions, and the problems between the two countries had not begun yesterday.
One side of the negative predictability is, and here is some of the prospects for improvement of relationships that are not fully predicted.
This is a good outcome of the long way that we have been through with the current administration, with Trampo and with Obama.
Problems didn't start yesterday," said a diplomat.
According to Rabkova, the problems associated with the United States ' s desire to introduce Russia ' s multi-faceted approach to issues.
The MDGs added that they would not risk giving optimistic forecasts of the prospects for improvement of relations and would not expect changes in Washington ' s position.

Virusologist warned of the risk of vaccination by a non-patient COVID
Allergy and medical assistance may occur in the affected COVID-19 nasal vaccine, so the first points to attract this product should not be organized at airports and commercial centres.
TASS reported on this viruslogist, member of the RAN Correspondent, biotechnology lab, microbiology and neurology at the University of Novosibir State Sergey Netesov.
Organise vaccinations at airports and shopping centres more easily, but I would do so for the first time only in medical institutions.
The fact that there is a risk of allergic reaction to such a vaccine is small but it is desirable that a person should then have access to a doctor's office.
The doctor has special anti-allergic preparations that work literally in two minutes, which is sometimes very necessary," Netesov said.
In the view of the virologist, it is possible to think of vaccination at trade centres when experience in the use of the preparation is gathered.
He also stressed the importance of using a nasal vaccine to cause it to fall into a visceral field.
However, there is a likelihood that the vaccine will not reach a destination if the infected person is forced to leave after the injection.

Peskov warned of the suffering of Western countries that imposed anti-rossian sanctions
The President ' s press secretary, RF Dmitri Peskov, commented on the possible introduction of anti-terrorism sanctions in the case of continued “aggressive action” against Ukraine, including due to the alleged “intake” in the country ' s territory.
"Some restrictions are imposed on Russia and not to experience suffering on its own, it is impossible," said the official representative of Kramla in the Russian TV era.
Peskov says it's "they understand everything in the world."
It was previously reported that the United States was considering the possibility of introducing anti-corruption sanctions in the field of energy as an extreme measure.
In addition, Washington and the European Union are planning to impose restrictions on the conversion of rubles into dollars for Russian banks and the Russian Direct Investment Fund.

New Caledonians rejected the idea of independence from France
According to the final results of the third referendum on New Caledonia ' s independence, the majority of the participants refused to leave France.
On 12 December, the French television BFM.TV reported.
96.5 per cent of the votes cast were against independence.
The independence of France was maintained by 3.51 per cent of the inhabitants of the archipelago in the south of the Pacific Ocean.
The results were cancelled by 2.99 per cent of the booklets.
The voting rate on that day was very low: about 55 per cent of the residents of the archipelago were present.
In the opinion of experts, the low point is explained by the separatists ' calls for refusal to participate in the referendum due to the crown virus.
Paris refused to transfer the date of the referendum.
In October 2020, the inhabitants of New Caledonia spoke against the independence of France.
In 2018 a referendum on independence was held in the region.
Most of the residents supported the find of the archipelago in France.
New Caledonia is almost 20 miles [20 km] from mother France.
In 1853 France declared New Caledonia to be its government.
There are some 270 thousand people living in the archipelago, the territory assigned to special administrative and territorial status.
Between Paris and the New Caledonia Administration, the 1998 agreement provides that the region can hold a vote on its independence twice as long as it differs in two years.

WHO considers that "micron" is less dangerous than "delegate"
The World Health Organization (WHO) considers that microns are less dangerous than corona strains.
However, there are data on the reduction of the effectiveness of vaccines in the new COVID-19 option.
According to information dated 9 December, "Microny" was registered in 63 countries.
“Provisional data and significant change in the protein protein profile of micron allows for a reduction in the effectiveness of vaccines against infection and the transfer of the variant.
According to the preliminary findings of the UAR, it may be less difficult than in the case of the part, as stated in the technical report of WHO.
The organization notes that until all recorded cases of micronosis in the EU are easily or unsympathetic.
However, the new state, according to preliminary data, is being distributed faster.
In Russia two cases of microbial damage have been recorded.
They were "formerly immunized," reported the Hamalaya Centre.
The head of Rospopresor Anna Popov stated that there is still no reliable evidence that the new version of the corona virus is less dangerous than the rest.

Four scenarios were named in Ukraine for Green
The ex-member of the Supreme Council, Vadim Denisenko, listed four developments for President Vladmir Zelenski in 2022.
In his view, the Head of State may remain without the support of the West, and may also come to the Donbassa compromises.
On December 12th, Deniseenko told the press about this in the "Glavred" portal.
The first option, which Danisenko called the ideal storm, suggested that Ukraine would cease to support key Western countries by reaching agreements on the future of the country without its participation.
Such developments will contribute to the profound crisis that Kiev can face in 2023.
" Parallelly, there is a reduction in the prices of key goods that we traditionally export domestic protests and opposition of the authorities with key FPGs (financial-industrial groups. - Red.), " - the ex-Parliamentary added.
According to Danisenko, there is another scenario for the development of the situation - “war against all”.
This forecast arises in the event of high concern in world policy, where Ukrainian authorities are confronted with a number of problems.
As a result of this situation, Ukraine ' s leadership can lead to commitments on the Danube, which may result in domestic opposition.
At the end of the summer, Zelenco's position was weakened, and the probability of such a situation, according to the previous survey, was 50-55 per cent.
A third option for the development of the situation in Ukrainian policy is the opposition of the Green Group and the President, which is likely to take control of the force blockade and the implementation of “popular initiatives”.
In this context, the Green crisis will begin "reforming power", Danisenko added.
Another scenario is that of turning Green into "the father of the nation."
This can lead to an event that will become a major shock to society.
"The experience should be large enough to call on external partners and increase Ukraine's support," Denisenko said.
Such a development option is considered ex-deputation due to natural disasters, technological disasters or Russia ' s aggressive actions.
At the same time, the Russian side has not once rejected any “attack” chances in Ukraine.
In Moscow, it was noted that the Ukrainian authorities, NATO and the United States were increasing military activity at the Russian borders.
Earlier, on 11 November, the survey of the rating group showed that the Ukrainian President's rating had fallen to a record low, with 19.3 per cent.
This is the lowest indicator since the election of its Head of State.
Analytics predicted the situation in which, in the case of the next elections of President of Ukraine, the vote would be 21.8 per cent, while for the former President of the country, Peter Poroshenko, 14.5 per cent.
Only 19.3 per cent of the President ' s support was expressed.

The one arrested for action at the Red Square says, "For the quote of Evtusenko, 10 tons are giving, here she is, the power of the posada!"
At the beginning of the week, ten hundred were arrested by 21-year-old poet Alexander Volchenkov.
A U.S. student was detained in the Red Square with a poster on which a #ethro-throsie-mpoet was written.
This quote belongs to the writer Eugian Evtuschenko.
A Protocol on Administrative Article on the Reconnaissance of Public Action was drawn up in Alexandria.
For the first time, he was detained on 23 January at the Pushkin Square, at a meeting in support of Alexei Naval.
“The goal was to draw attention to the overall trend, now to her interest, to her regret, to the loss of a common culture in Russia, and also to the hope of encouraging unknown poets to write on the Internet their verses under this heading,” explains Alexander.
We contacted young people in order to clarify the conditions of detention and to reveal in more detail the meeting of his mission.

What were they asking in the department how they commented on your action?
At this time, staff members were more correct, keeping maximum, as if it were not funny in some context of the word.

Researchers have told how potatoes help to fight age violations
The study showed that potatoes are rich in vitamins and micro- elements that contribute to improved blood circulation and lower cholesterol levels.
Cornefruit contains vitamins of group B, vitamin C, phosphorous, potassium, magnesium, fishlavin, follicle and pantotenic acids.
All these elements contribute to the functioning of the system of the body.
In addition, potatoes help to fight age violations.
Due to the large contents of the shell it is useful for the heat and moisture treatment, and regular use can also help prevent hypertension and atherosclerosis.
However, for the most part, cornfruit is better cooked or cooked rather than consumed on oil.
Previously published The Daily Express warned that potatoes could be dangerous for diabetics as well as other products with high glycaemic levels.
These are products containing hydrocarbons that are rapidly absorbed into the sun, such as sugar, sweet non-alcoholic beverages, white rice, and white bread.
At the beginning of December, the Commersant newspaper warned of a possible lack of Russian tableboard, noted the decline in its production in private households and the increase in processing powers.

Of course, and the "Okraina-not Russia" slogan appeared in 1848.
Which, in general and in general, doesn't change much.
I watched her interview, the girl said that the biggest dream she had was to raise her wings, the pope always gave her up.
Well, it's all very suspicious.

Light bulb Maytoni MOD081WL-L13G3K Tessara.
The wide area covered by the “molecules” of the light provides a maximum levelal and light-lighting area.
The "atomic" or "molecular" design, reflecting the essence and nature of each object, does not lose its relevance and makes it useful to place emphasis on its interests.
One of the characteristics of such lighthouses is the invisibility of the construction.
Due to the thin, practically invisible waves that are controlled at the height, it is felt that the light is reflected in the air.
The metallic gold cabinet and the matto-white miniatur ceilings are easily added to any palette, and the posters presented in the collections will be ready for the guest, bedroom, comet.
Well, for taste and color, what's called.
I really liked Tarhun, not now, of course.

Three portions of syrup is a rehearsal, for my taste.
Two were the first time.
Matras Dimax Micro Ultimagate, size 160x190
The orthopedic spring matrix Micro Ultimet.
The model is comfortable that there are two different surface conditions – high density and more average hearing.
The product consists of only quality and primary supplements that recommended themselves to the best.
In the centre of the model, a block of independent "micropacket" cells is set.
This means that there are 2000 spirals at the end, which work fully autonomously.
That's why they're working on a unique exact structure.
Micropacket is the most common of the Dimax vacuum blocks, so it has a well-expressed orthopedic effect and is considered to be primitive.
Fillers: Top and bottom of the spring are the combinations of leather layers and natural latex.
The only difference is a flat order.
If there's a latex on one surface, another is a coconut.
Such a tandem has long been the state of classicalism, since it is not only orthopedic but also anatomical properties.
If it provides proper back support, the latex will adjust the surface under the human body.
Chechol: The model is set in the traditional trichotic steel Aloe Vera.
It can be made as pleasant as it is to the customer.
Total height of the product – 27 cm, recommended load at the end – 170 kg.
Warranty and security: security period - 3 years.
Matras received all necessary certificates and documents that confirm his full safety and reliability in operation.
The orthopedic pen used in the matrix has the CertiPUR certificate.
Estonian scientists will look for life in Venezuela
The Massachusetts Institute of Technology, in cooperation with the Tartu Observatory and other research agencies and companies, is preparing three space missions to Venezuela to look for signs of life in the atmosphere, reported in the "Actual Camera".
The objective of the five-year mission missions is to assess the viability of the Venetian clouds and then search for life there.
For the project, Turkish scientists offered instruments to measure acidity and oxygen content in the fields of Venezuela.
At the same time, it was assumed that the Venus cloud near the Earth was too acidic so that life could exist there, but it is likely that Venus was the planet of the earth.
During the third mission, a test should come from Venezuela.
We assume that if we find life there, the main issue will be whether it looks earthly or different.
If so, it will be evident that life on earth did not begin.
If it is different, it may become more likely that life was born on Earth," said the Estonian team leader of the Venus Life Finder project, Michael Pausalu.

Metawasques change in Russian business
The topic of meta-was a popular theme this year when Mark Zuckerberg announced that he was turning Facebook into Meta.
This was an important signal for the market: the biggest game has confirmed the development of a new format of digital interaction between people.
This means that businesses in Russia, as well as the rest of the world, will invest in the creation of their own metals and their subsequent monetaryisation.
Meta villages should be considered as continuing objectively existing trends.
On the one hand, the trend to create distance interactions in terms of pandemic conditions is that people are unable to communicate and limit themselves.
On the other hand, this is the result of the business effort to develop ecosystems and adapt operational models.
Thirdly, they are a logical continuation of the asset digitalization trend when any rights, valuable books, art production and even money are transferred to digital format.
Anya, you're right, changing food is a process of consciousness.
When you start eating properly, you don't want anything too heavy and expensive.
Of course, we'll have a holiday and a traditional olive tree and a seat under the shrub, but no one's gonna let me eat all of a sudden.
You can sit on the bed, try - and it's enough.
Before and after ten days, you can prepare any delicious and useful flowers.

She also understands that it will not last 4 years before the next Olympic, i.e. it will never be an Olympic champion.
And whoever wasn't involved in sports or can't present all the rounds that she's been through, doesn't have to do it.
British economist could not predict 2022
British economist Jim O'Neill was unable to predict 2022 because he felt that such attempts would turn into failure.
He wrote about this in an article for Project Syndicate.
The expert believes that next year there will be an unpredictability pool and any trend may change trade.
The most important factor remains the pandemic of Coronavirus and, secondly, inflation.
O'Neill also acknowledged that he did not know whether the increase in prices on goods was temporary or not.
As a specialist pointed out before the pandemic, it was clear that “the world of the permanent generosity of central banks has already lived by itself” and that it is early to come back to the ratios of inflation rates to be adjusted at expected rates of GDP growth.
O'Neill noted that, on the basis of the pandemic, the continuation of excessive economic policy could, in the opinion of some experts, lead to new inflation.
In addition, attention should be paid to productivity growth, as well as increase in poverty and climate change, O'Neill summarized.
The former head of the Global Research Division "Investment of Investment " Michael Schulgin reported that positive expectations for the 2022 dollar are maintained and growth will be less significant.
The risk to the course of the dollar was called the FRS monetary and credit policy, the oil price dynamic and the threat to the background of the crown virus pandemic.
We have to agree.
But one is happy: compared with ourselves, five years ago the containers were smaller.

The Russians gave car dealers around 4.5 per cent of GDP to the country
As a result of 10 months of 2021, Russia lost 2 trillion euros of new cars, with 28 per cent more than the same period last year as the Russian Automotive Market Research (NAPA).
To understand the scale, about the same amount (about 3 trillion rubles) was spent by the State to support citizens and economies during the crown virus pandemic.
In a recent September meeting of the heads of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, President Vladimir Putin said that such an amount would be more than 4.5 per cent of the country's domestic gross product (GDP) for 2020.
Russia's market revenue is leading the Korean brand Kia.
In 10 months of this year, he was able to drive 325.7 billion rubles, almost 24 per cent more than a year ago.
In the family Kia brand Hyundai, the increase is even more significant - more than 35 per cent, and car sales are estimated at 279.3 billion rubles.
In leading positions, the brand and by increasing the average car price - has grown to almost 21 per cent per year in Hyundai, up to 1.94 million rubles - a stronger travel dynamic was only in Changan, Chery, Geely and Mercedes-Benz.
In this context, sales in the Korean brands have not increased significantly: according to the statistics of the Committee of Autoproducers of the European Business Association in Russia, Kia achieved 9.4 per cent of the same period over a year earlier.
Hyundai is almost 12%.
It closes three sales leaders in the Japanese Toyota currency - the Russian car lost 10 months of 275.5 billion rubles, more than 14 per cent more than a year ago.
According to Japan, Mercedes-Benz, with an indicator of 266.1 billion rubles (+75 per cent), sales and sales (37 per cent) were increased in the German premium and the average car price (about 28 per cent, up to 8.2 million rubles).
"In Mercedes-Benz there is a steady increase in sales and medium-sized prices - more than in BMW - from here and more financial savings - Napi Director Tatyana Abadji explained.
As sales increase, fantastic indicators show Chinese brands, as well as a significant increase in financial efficiency in this year."
The Russian Lada on income growth dynamics shows average (up to 28 per cent), and the Russian car has been lost in 10 months by 229.4 billion rubles.
At the last year's level, there were companies that sold cars in 2021, including Volkswagen, Mitsubishi and Nissan.
The U.S.A. and at least 10 months later, Russians lost 12 billion rubles against 12.4 billion rubles a year ago.
On the basis of the problems with the delivery of components and cuts in production across the world, car companies continue to adjust prices continuously. The same "AutoVAZ" increased the value of Lada's models seven times a year, the last trip (8-10 thousand rubles) took place at the end of November.
They regularly record prices for their production and other car manufacturers.
Russia's car market will increase in currency and further, in addition to the lack of car input, inflation and the desire of car companies to play past losses are considered by experts.
In the absence of cars, I believe that many of the car companies have even been able to transfer to the consumer the costs of past periods that they could not afford before,
"VTB Capital" is an analysis of the VTB on Vladimir Bespalov Autopromo.
I believe that in financial terms car manufacturers feel very good now, supporting high margin sales."
As a result of this, the rate of growth in the value of cars observed during 2021 is an indication that prices for new vehicles are increasing faster and the expert explains.
In the long term, the market will grow and in quantitative terms and in cash, but mainly through inflation and the construction of the most complex machines, Bespalov predicts.
The potential for price increases will be limited.
The Russian authorities continue to grow in monetary terms and in the coming year, even if the cost of cars is slowed down, the car manufacturers will be able to earn their income by volume, notes an independent car consultant Sergey Burgasliev.
In view of the increased demand and insufficient proposal, the car manufacturers are now seeking to obtain the maximum revenue from each car sold, notes Burgasliev.
The increase in car production is not expected at least in the near future, while in Russia there is still uncertainty about the future of citizens.
On the basis of the situation on the market, the car had become an unharmed investment facility - a year ago bought back by the car, even though it could now be sold at a certain price, the expert noted.
Byeden said that the United States military re-examination in Ukraine had occurred in the case of Russia
The U.S. leadership has never considered sending American soldiers to Ukraine in the case of "intrusion" of Russia.
US President Joe Byden made this statement.
"There have never been such plans," said the head of the White House, replying to the journalist's question as to whether the United States had rejected such an idea.
Byeden noted that in the case of an increase in the situation around Ukraine, Russia would face economic consequences.
He stressed, however, that the United States and NATO had no obligation to use military force to protect Ukraine in the event of ejaculation.
The U.S. leader also stated that the possibility of U.S. troops being used unilaterally for Ukraine ' s defence was not valid.
Byeden explained that if Russia enters Ukraine, the United States will transfer forces to NATO (Bulgaria, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Czech Republic and Estonia).
"We have to send more American and Natto troops to the eastern flag, B9 - all NATO countries with a sacred obligation to protect them from any attack by Russia," Byden said.
Former Russian press secretary Dmitri Peskov stressed that Moscow had no intention of entering Ukraine.
In doing so, he indicated that Moscow saw a problem in the fight against the use of Turkish drones by Kiev and that “American weapons are approaching our territory”.
