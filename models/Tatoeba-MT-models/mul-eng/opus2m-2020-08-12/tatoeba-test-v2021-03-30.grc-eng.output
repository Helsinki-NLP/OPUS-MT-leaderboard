Kats writes.
It's about who's in charge.
We believe it's true.

I'm sorry.
Not at all.
Well, you're half a year old.
The army's on board.
This is the end of the process, and it is the right thing to do.

I'm afraid you're afraid you're going to give it up.
I'm on my way.
What's going on?
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
He's gone.
I've been at sea because you're on the island.
The tree of the wicked is bringing forth its fruit.
Come on, let's talk about it.
That's how we fought.
