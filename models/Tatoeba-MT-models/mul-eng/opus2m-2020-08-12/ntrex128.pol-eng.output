Members of the Valiant National Assembly are afraid that they will be called muppets
Among some members of the National Assembly, there has been confusion, which is the effect of the proposal to change their title to Members of the Welsh Parliament (e.g. Member of the Welsh Parliament, in the short MWP).
The idea was based on plans to change the assembly to the Wallis Parliament.
Members of all sides of the political scene are concerned that they can become the subject of kpin.
One of the parliamentarians of the Labour Party expressed concern about his group, saying that the new name was addressed with the words "twp" and "pwp".
For readers outside Wally: in the Valian language the word “twp” means a fool, and the word “pwp” is gone.
One of the party's politicians, Plaid Cymru, said that its grouping was "unsatisfied" with the proposal and presented other solutions.
A member of the Wally Conservative Party said his party is "open" to change the name. However, he noted that the word "MWP" is very close to the word "muppet".
In this case, the walaiku letter "w" is similar to the letter "u" in the English Yorkshire dialect.
As part of the meeting of the Commission currently working on the draft amending legislation, the following opinion was adopted: "Of course the final decision on the future title of members of the assembly will be theirs".
The Act of the Government of Wales of 2017 granted the Wally National Assembly the right to change its name.
In June the Commission published the results of public consultation on the proposal, and the change of assembly to the Wallis Parliament received broad support.
In addition, the Commission supported the proposal for a change in the title of members of the "Valiary Parliament", i.e. the WMP in English, although this short "MWP" enjoyed the greatest popularity among society.
The members of the group propose alternative solutions. The difficulties of reaching consensus are the oppression of Elin Jones, the leader of the group that should present the draft law in the next week.
The reform legislation will also take into account other changes in the way of assembly work, including the withdrawal of members and the structure of the committee system.
Members of the National Assembly will be able to vote on their future title during the discussion of the Constitution.
Macedonians vote in referendum on the change in the name of the country
In the next Sunday, the voters decide whether their country will soon bear the name of the Republic of Northern Macedonia.
A general vote will help to strike up the ongoing decades of conflict with neighboring Greece, where the region is known as Macedonia.
The Court of First Instance in Athens has long argued that their northern neighbour's name is territorial growth and has repeatedly opposed the attempt to join the European Union and NATO.
Žorge Ivanov, President of Macedonia and the rapporteur on the change in the name, said that he was relieving the results of the vote.
However, freedom of movement, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaew, maintains that change is necessary in order to enable you to join the European Union and NATO.
The calls in the New York church of St. Marcina's milk due to the problems of the church in Harlemia
"The older people I'm talking to say there were bars and churches that could be found every year," said Michael Henry Adams.
"There's probably no trace of them."
As he says, the disappearance of the colors is understandable.
"People are currently making friends in a different way," he said.
"The bars have ceased to be a regular meeting place for members of society."
In the case of the churches, however, it is concerned that the measures from the sale of property are not sufficient for as long as they are considered decisive and that “first or later they are at the point of departure”.
He added that the churches could be replaced by apartments occupied by people who would not support the rest of the surrounding churches.
As he said: “The overwhelming majority of the people buying housing in such buildings will be white breeds, and it will soon close the churches because it is unlikely that new residents will become members of these paraphernalias.”
Both churches were built by a collection of white believers, even before Harlem joined the metropolitan community in 1870 (the church of St. Marcina joined the community a decade later).
The first collection of white methods left the division in the 1930s.
The Afro-Americans' round gathering took over the property right to the building.
The Church of St. Marcina was taken by a group under the leadership of John Howard Johnson, who brought a ban on the sale of 125th Street (the main street in Harlem), which opposed the employment or promotion of the Afro-Americans.
The fire in 1939 seriously damaged the building, but John Howard Johnson’s parafiance began the construction of the shrine and repaired the telephone group.
Dear David Johnson, son of John Howard Johnson and his successor in St. Marcina's church, had in mind called the new charylion "the call of the poor".
The expert who died in July described it in another way as "cultural treasure" and "unreplaced historical instrument".
Tiffany Ng, an expert at the University of Michigan, also noted that it is the first charylion in the world served by black music. This was the artist Dionisio A. Lind, who moved 18 years ago to the Riverside Church, where he was expected by a larger group.
Malcolm J. Merriweather said St. Marcina's church didn't replace him.
During the last months of the Church of St. Marcina, a number of complex events with the participation of architects and performers occurred. Some of them were led by church leaders, and others by the Diocese of the Episcopal Church.
In July, the Parafical Council (the governing body of a paraffin composed of worldly leaders) addressed its concerns to the diocese, saying that "it wants to cut costs on the Council", although the Council did not participate in the work of architects and performers sent to the place.
Part of the paraffin also contributes to a lack of transparency on the diet side.
Rein wounded 13-year-old nursing in search of homer in California
The authorities found that on the last Saturday the river attacked and wounded 13-year-olds looking for homeers in California.
The attack took place seven o'clock in the morning near Beacon's Beach in the American city of Encinitas.
Chad Hammel brought the KSWB-TV station to San Diego on Saturday morning, he spent about half an hour napping with his friends when he heard a call for help. Suddenly a group of friends moved to the boy to help get him out of the water.
As Hammel said, at first he seemed to be undercitizened by homer arrest, but soon he realized that the child cried out: “I’ve been shocked!
I've been bitten!"
After arriving at the scene, Chad Hammel noticed that the boy had a completely broken skin around the village.
"I started screaming to everyone to run away from the water: "There is a river in the water!" Hammel added.
The boy was transferred by helicopter to the Children's Hospital of the Children Council in San Diego. His condition was defined as critical.
The species of the river responsible for the attack remains unknown.
During a press conference, Captain Larry Giles said the fish had already been observed a few weeks earlier, but it was recognized that it was not part of the cat of the dangerous rivers.
Larry Giles added that the victim found some serious damage to the top of the roof.
In order to conduct the investigation and for 48 hours safety reasons, the authorities closed access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami Beach in Ecinitas.
Larry Giles observed that the area is inhabited by more than 135 species of sharks, although most of them are not considered dangerous.
The Sainsbury's network plans to expand activities on the British cosmetic market
The Sainsbury's network sends handcuffs such as Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams, bringing into its supermarkets cosmetics that connect style to shops, as well as specially trained vendors.
Within a significant investment in the British cosmetic market – which is worth 2.8 billion pounds and is constantly growing despite the decline in the fashion industry and domestic economic articles – more rules will appear in 11 networks with cosmetic products.
Return to the cosmetic industry results in the search for ways to store the space previously occupied by televisions, microphones and household business articles.
According to Sainsbury's network, it will double the number of cosmetic products and will offer even 3 thousand articles. In the assortment for the first time, goods such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman or Dr. PawPaw will appear.
Currently sold Marek L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees also receive more locations and remote areas near these famous boots.
In addition, the supermarket network plans to refresh its offer of products to Boutique's kitchen. Most of the articles will now be accepted for the wedding, which is often called for by young customers.
In addition, perfum Fragrance Shop creates test points in two Supermarkets Saninsbury's. The first opened last week in Croydon, in southern London, and the second in Selly Oak, in Birmingham, in the late year.
The prevalence of online sales and daily purchases of small amounts of food in local stores makes supermarkets have to encourage more customers to visit.
Mike Coupe, President Sainsbury's, said that sales points will be increasingly remembered by stores because the network is trying to fight discontinuities such as Aldi or Lidl by offering more services and products than food.
Sainsbury's has placed points on the Argos network in hundreds of slots and has introduced a series of Habitat network points since the two companies took over two years ago. The company considers this to help increase the sales of food products and increase the profitability of investments.
The previous attempt to reorganise activities with cosmetics and pharmaceuticals has ended.
At the beginning of the 21st century, Sainsbury's created a joint venture company with Boots. However, cooperation was completed after the conflict on the share of income from ops operating in supermarkets.
Sainsbury's introduces a new strategy following the sale of 281 copies of Celesio, owned by Lloyds Pharmacy network, for 125 million pounds three years ago.
According to Lloyds, it will contribute to the implementation of the plan by introducing a wide range of luxury brands for skin care, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, to four networks.
Paul Mills-Hicks, director of Saninsbury's business, said: "We have developed the appearance and nature of space activities in order to improve the impact of customers.
We invested in special training for employees in order to help consumers during purchases.
Our brands are able to satisfy all needs, and friendly environments and suitable locations allow us to pay attention to customers looking for cosmetic products, as well as to discuss up-to-date ways of making purchases."
Peter Jones "done" after Holly Willoughby was fired from the 11 million-pound contract
Peter Jones, the star of the Dragons' Den TV program, was "slow" when he found out that Holly Willoughby was planning to pull out of the worth of 11 million pounds of lifestyle brands to join the new so-called collaboration with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Holly Willoughby has no time for their brands offering accessory and domestic business articles called Truly.
The activity was consistently compared to the Goop brand belonging to Gwyneth Paltrow.
This morning the 37th-year-old president announced his departure through the Instagram service.
The decision to leave a well-prosperating lifestyle mark and to join the new so-called Marks & Spencer and ITV team, adopted by Holly Willoughby, welcomed Peter Jones, the star of Dragons' Den.
As a source, Peter Jones was "slow", when a popular television presentation announced during a nervous Tuesday meeting at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire that because of new contracts of up to 1.5 million pounds, it would not have time to dedicate their March accessory and household business articles to Truly.
The company was previously compared to the Gwyneth Paltrow brand Goop. It also had to double Holly Willoughby's property valued for 11 million pounds.
Following the announcement of the decision to leave Truly mark by 37-year-old Holly Willoughby in the service of Instagram Peter Jones left Great Britain, joining one of his summer homes.
As the source says: “Mark Truly was a priority for Holly Willoughby.
She was married to her future and wanted to take care of her for the next few decades.
The decision to withdraw from the operation completely surprised all the persons involved.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, it was so close to entering the market.
In the Marlow Store are ready for sale."
Experts believe that the rejection of this Morning's presentation and one of the most successful stars in Great Britain can cost a million pounds of money from significant investments in products – including postage articles by clothing and household business articles – as well as further delays in entering the market.
It can also mean the end of a long-term friendship.
Holly Willoughby (the mother of three children) and her husband Dan Baldwin for ten years maintained close relations with Peter Jones and his wife Tara Capp.
Holly Willoughby, together with Tara Capp, founded the brand Truly in 2016, and 52-year-old Peter Jones joined them in March at the president's position.
The couple had been spending time together, and Jones included 40% of the participants in the TV company in Dan Baldwin.
Holly Willoughby is to be Ambassador of the M&S brand and will be replaced by Ant McPartlin in the role of I'm A Celebrate in the ITV station.
The source near Peter Jones said last night: “We will not comment on his business affairs. ”
Hard talk, "and then we fell in love with each other"
The president drew attention to the media criticisms that some considered to be “a man who is not a man-made man” as well as a positive relationship with North Korea's leader.
Why did President Trump give so much?
The crowd said in a loud voice to the television presenter:
"I didn't give anything."
The President pointed out that Kim Dzong Un was interested in the second meeting. The first meeting took place in Singapore in June and was called upon by the Trump to take a great step towards the denuclearization of North Korea.
However, negotiations on nuclear disarmament are slow.
More than three months after the Red Cross in Singapore, the North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho told World leaders at the United Nations General Assembly that he did not see "analogous response" by the United States to the early actions of North Korea aimed at disarmament.
He noted that, instead, the United States supports sanctions and pressure.
President Trump expressed a much more optimistic view in his speech.
"It's great meeting with North Korea," he said.
"We were planning a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would die.
Now we're maintaining a wonderful relationship."
The President said that his efforts to improve relations with Kim Dzong Un had had positive effects: they had led to the end of rocket tests, helped free the hostages and returned home to the rest of the American soldiers.
In addition, he defended his unprejudiced approach during his discussion with Kim Dzong Un.
"It is easy to act after the president, but instead of 10,000 people waiting outside and trying to get to the busy stadium, we would have 200 people here," said Trump, pointing his finger at the back of the crowd right in front of him.
The tsunamis and earthquake in Indonesia have successfully destroyed one of the islands by killing hundreds of people
After the earthquake on the island of Lombok, foreign management organisations were told that their assistance was not needed.
Despite the loss of roof over the head by more than 10% of the residents of Lomboku, the authorities have not announced animal welfare gaps, which is a prerequisite for speeding up international aid operations.
"In many cases the authorities have made it very clear that they do not require international support. So the situation is difficult," said Selina Sumbung.
Although the organisation Save the Children is preparing to travel to the Indonesian city of Palu, there is no doubt that an international staff will be able to work at the event site.
Sutopo Purwo Nugro, the head of the National Food Chain Agency, said that the Indonesian authorities are assessing the situation in Palu to see if aid should be granted by international organisations.
In view of the persistent tensions in Indonesia, the country remains totally unprepared to meet with the forces of nature.
Although protected by tsunamis in the province of Aceh, they are rare in the case of the rest of the coastal line.
The lack of oxygen warning against tsunamis in Palu — despite the threat of death — was likely to have an impact on the number of victims.
Even in the most favourable conditions, travel between Indonesian islands is a challenge.
Lifeboats are even more difficult to logistics.
The hospital ship, which was stationed on the island of Lombok, is dying with the help of an earthquake victim to the city of Palu. However, it will take at least three days to reach its destination.
President Joko Vidodo made an improvement in Indonesian infrastructure at the main point of his campaign and appointed a lot of road and rail funds.
However, in view of the future elections, the President's administration is not able to take any measures.
In addition, Joko Vidodo was under pressure from the remaining religious pressure in the country. Members of the majority Muslim society accepted a more conservative form of faith.
Over a thousand people died, and tens of thousands of residents lost their lives as a result of the struggle between Christian and Muslim gangs using maczets, wolves, bullets, and other simple weapons on the streets.

The Memorial of Cromwell before the British Parliament was the last victim in the "recording of history" dispute
The removal of the memory would bring justice for the memory of the Taliban’s actions to destroy many of the English cultural and religious remains by its radical, Puritan supporters.
However, the Cromwell Society has described Jeremy Cricka's proposal as "the madness" and "the attempt to write history on new".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: “In view of the current ongoing debate on the removal of memories, the issue of Oliver Cromwell’s status before the Westminster Palace was a matter of time.
In the course of the English civil war, Cromwell had neither received nor performed any of the grueling acts.
It may be that for the actions of his predecessor Thomas centuries ago it was decided not to punish Cromwell.
The way Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft presented Cromwell at the Memorial shows how this policy was held in the 19th century and that for many people it is a position that still deserves to be remembered.
John Goldsmith said in a report for The Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell was observed by many people – perhaps part of the 19th century than at present – for the defense of Parliament against external pressure.
The assessment, as far as it's concerned, is the subject of a continuous historical debate.
It is certain, however, that the conflict of the 17th century has created further development of our people, and Cromwell is a well-known form of reconciliation between the parties.
Its achievements as a protector's lord are also worthy of consideration and consideration."
In China, the death of a farmer was caused by swine
As local media are provided, trade in the south-western part of China has resulted in a deadly attack of pigs on the farmer.
On Sunday, the South China Morning Post reported that a dead man named Yuan was found bleeding and bleeding in the closet near the shop in Liupanshui, Kuwait.
The pig breeder is preparing for vaccinations in the province of Qinghai, China, on 30 May 2005.
According to the report, the man came to the market with his cousin from the nearby Junnan province to sell 15 pigs.
The next morning, the kitchen found a man's body and noticed an open door to a nearby store.
He said there was a lot of blood in the bread.
The section confirmed that it was about 250 kilograms of pigs that fatally disturbed the farmer.
"My cousin's legs were bloody and twisted," said a man named Wu quoted by the Guiyang Evening News service.
On the material from the surveillance camera, see that Yuan came to the market on Thursday at 4:40 p.m. to feed the pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed a man didn't belong to Yuan or his cousin.
The trade manager said in a report to the Guiyang Evening News service that at the time of the collection of evidence by the police, a request was made to avoid further attack.
According to the family, men and trade authorities negotiate the death penalty.
There have already been reported cases of dog attacks on humans, although they are rare.
In 2016 the pig attacked a woman and her husband on the farm in Massachusetts. A man brought fatal wounds.
Ten years earlier, about 300 kilograms of pigs had driven the farmer to the tractor. A man's wife managed to pull the animal off.
After a farmer from Oregon was eaten by pigs in 2012, one of the farmers in Manitoba told CBC News that these animals are not usually aggressive, but the taste of blood may allow them to experience brutal behavior.
“They just want to have fun.
They're so competitive about anything... they don't want to hurt anyone.
We just need to show them appropriate respect," he said.
The rest of Rosa’s throat causes intense flooding in the southwestern part of the United States
According to Huragan Rosa's projections, it loses its force by moving over the coldest waters of the north coast of Mexico.
However, in recent days it has caused intense flooding in northern Mexico and in the southwestern part of the United States.
Huragan Rosa knows about 137 km/h. On Sunday at 5:00 a.m., he was awarded category 1. He was then located 620 km south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico.
According to the forecast on Sunday, Rosa will move north.
In the middle of the Pacific Ocean, it begins to form as we move towards the east coast of the United States. On Monday, Rosa will approach the semi-Califorian island as a tropical storm, moving the bulk of the wind to the north, to the south-west United States.
On Monday it will bring damages of up to 25 cm in part of the territory of Mexico.
In the next few days, the tropical air entering into close proximity causes floods in the South-West United States.
In some places accidents of height from 2.5 to 10 cm lead to urgent causes, pollution and possible damage in desert areas.
The wind of the tropical air causes an impact from 5 to 7.5 cm per hour. This is particularly true of parts of the Nevada and Arizona areas.
Even 5 to 10 cm of rain is expected in some South-West regions of the United States, especially most of Arizona.
In view of the widespread nature of tropical floods, there are urgent causes and drastic changes in conditions.
In the face of the threat of tropical rain, it is decided to move the sand across the desert.
The oil deficits can change cannons in the river, and storms with storms cause local wind surges and the transfer of the forests.
This is more than bringing local floods on the southern coast of California.
The total height of above 1,3 cm can be determined by floods which can cause minor pollution and road safety.
It would be the first floods this time in the region.
The past tropical rains will begin to get closer to Arizona next Sunday and early Monday. On Monday afternoons and Tuesday afternoons, there will be more areas.
In the second half of its territory, the four Corners region is located in the western part of the United States and is located in the middle.
In October, along with a cooling in the Arctic region across the United States, temperatures can be reduced. However, in the intercontinental area, temperatures will be much warmer.
This may lead to a severe change in temperature in small distances.
A good example is the difference in temperature in the middle of the States.
Between Kansas City (city Missouri) and Omaha (city of Nebraska) and St. Louis (city of Missouri) and Des Moines (city of Iowa) differences range from almost 10 degrees Celsius.
In the next few days remaining summer temperatures can be re-increased.
In most parts of the central and eastern United States, temperatures will be around 26 to 32 °C. Low temperatures will be around the north-east of the United States.
On Tuesday in New York the temperature can reach a value of 27 degrees Celsius, or about 5 degrees above the limit.
Long-term climate forecasts indicate the high likelihood of excessive temperatures in the east of the United States in the first half of October.
Over 20 million people saw Bretta Kavanaugh's hearing
More than 20 million people were watching in six television stations, starting a fourth hearing of the candidate at the Supreme Court of Great Britain and Christina Blasey Ford, women charged with sexual harassment during the 1980s.
Despite the lasting political impact of the fifth commentaries, they had to stop regular programmes in order to inform the immediate return: the agreement proposed by Senator Jeff Flake, under which the FBI would conduct a weekly complaint investigation.
Christine Blasey Ford admitted before the Senate court that it was 100% certain that Kavanaugh had raped her in an indiscriminate manner and tried to get rid of her at a high school party.
In his emotional confession, Kavanaugh said that he was convinced that this situation had no place.
It is possible that the fifth number of televisions was even greater than Nielsen 20.4 million.
The company calculated the average number of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC stations.
However, for other stations including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network data were not yet available.
In addition, Nielsen usually has difficulty in measuring visibility among people at work.
The number is closer to the visibility of the American football matches or the award of the American Film Academy.
According to Nielsen Station Fox News Channel, which the representatives of Kavanaugh's nomination were standing in favor of the highest visibility. It won an average of 5.69 million views during the full-day hearing.
On the other hand, ABC station with 3.26 million views was located.
CBS had 3.1 million views, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million, and CNN 2.52 million.
The issue remained high after the hearing was completed.
Jeff Flake became the key figure of five events.
In the early hours of the morning, CNN and CBS were arrested by CNN and CBS after the office of this moderate Republican made a statement that he had decided to oppose the appointment of Kavanaugh.
Fleke, with his head down for a few minutes, heard urgent opinions. The whole event was transmitted by CNN.
"I stand here before you and ask.
Do you think he's telling people the truth?
You have strength in the face of so many women," he heard from a demonstration of women.
Before closing the door of the windshield Jeff Flake said that his office had issued an appropriate statement and that he would speak during the hearing of the Commission.
Later, television stations continued to transmit events waiting for a vote on the transfer of the nomination of Kavanaugh before the whole Senate.
Flake said that only before the nomination, when he knew that the FBI was investigating the charges in the coming week, what the least of the Democrats were responsible for.
Fleke was convinced of the part of the conversation with her friend, Senator Chris Consonance of the Democratic Party.
Flake made a decision after meeting with Chris Cossen and several other senators.
The choice of Fleke was important because the Republic would not have the votes necessary to approve the appointment of Britta Kavanaugh without any follow-up.
President Trump initiated the FBI's proceedings on the charges filed at Britta Kavanaugh.

The populace from the volcano Popocatepetl reached the southern parts of Mexico’s capital.
On Saturday, the National Centre for the Prevention of Animal Cholesterol Malaria allowed residents of Mexico to approach the volcano as a result of increased crater activity and 183 cases of gas and heat emissions over 24 hours.

On that day, thousands of people participated in demonstrations that reminded themselves of the first anniversary of the referendum's close emotion on the Catholic session.

It also reached its end in the late part of the day. To stop the police force fighting, they used a stick.
In a few hours, groups supporting the lack of independence complained, "We don't forget, we don't forgive." The opposition of the session shouted, "They live in Spain."
As a local pig, forty people received medical assistance in connection with minor injuries related to protests.
After the year of the referendum of 1 October the pressure was not weak. Although the authorities in Madrid considered it illegal, it is still the reason for the celebration of the desired Catholic session.
The majority of those voting in the majority said that they did not agree, but the frequency was low due to a wide-ranging ban on opponents.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly a thousand people have been arrested last year in brutal age with the police trying to make it impossible for them to vote in local elections.
On Friday evening, groups of people supporting the region's independence decided to prevent demonstrations of police support.
The demonstration took place despite this, but a change of path was required.
Narcis Termes, 68-year-old electrician taking part in a separatist protest, said he no longer hoped for the independence of Catalonia.
“In the past year we have experienced one of our most beautiful moments in our lives.
My parents cried out with joy that they could vote, but now we're stuck in the point without leaving," he said.
Despite the significant small success in the local elections in December last year, the parties supporting the Catalan session have difficulties with continuing action. Many of the most well-known leaders have decided to go out or wait for arrest in connection with the role played in the referendum and subsequent announcement of independence.
Joan Puig, a four-year-old protesting machine on the phone, said that politicians on both sides of the dispute are facing a conflict.
"The situation is getting more and more tense," he said.
On Saturday Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders arrested since the end of last year, announced the wish to start in future elections to the European Parliament.
"Candidacy in the elections to the European Parliament is the best way of reducing the crisis of the value of the democratic Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: men arrested after driving home
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 were arrested after a multiple hit by a car in Londonderry.
The event took place in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday about 19:30 British Time (BST).

The Mengi Bramka ensures the winning Livingston over the Rangers 1:0
The first goal of Dolly Mengi for Livingston brought the team to victory
Since this season, the Livingston Club extraclassed the Rangers into disintegration, giving Steven Gerard a second victory in his 18th match at the Ibrox Park club trainer's position.
Dolly's brand of Mengi was successful, and Gary Holta's team moved to the second place on the table with Hibernia.
The group under the direction of Gerard will remain in this season without success on its way out to Premiership. The next Sunday, the group will meet with the leader Hearts, who will lose eight points.
Earlier, because by Thursday, Rangers will be hosting the Rapid Vienna team within the framework of the UEFA League of Europe.
Livingston extends a series of victories in his division to six matches. Coach Holt has not won any victories since he took his position in the last month of Kenny Miller.
Livingston missed several occasions against unsatisfied opponents
The team led by Holta should have been taking a long time earlier since the team game had caused a lot of problems.
First Scott Robinson broke through the defense and shot in the light of the arm, but he couldn't shoot himself naked, and then Alan Lithgow didn't hit after Craig Halketta's head.
The farmers allowed Rangoonsor to play closer, knowing that they could threaten rivals during the constant fragments of the game.
And that's exactly how it fell to the breaking arm.
After the Rangers gave a free route to the Livingston team, Declan Gallagher and Robinson jointly created the situation of Mendze, who had been naked in the middle of the prison.
At this stage, Rangers had more possessions, but they were unable to strengthen their defenses and did not cause more problems to Liam Kelly's nurse.
This scheme was repeated in the second half, and Alfredo Morelos gave one shot on Kelly's shoulder.
Scott Pittman's test was chosen by the Ranger's Bracelet Allan McGregor, and Lithgow was unable to find a frame in the light of another permanent fragment on the subject of Livingstone.
The Rangers continued their attacks in the Livingston Army field, but they could not use the situation. Two criminal routes were requested after Halketta's intervention against Glenna Middleton's variable and one side of his hand. However, in both cases the defendant's claim was rejected.
"Fenomial" show Livingston – analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland in Almondvale Park
Great performance and result for Livingston.
He thought they played great, and then another time out of the wait.
Their style and composition have almost changed since their return to extra-class. However, Holta needs to be evaluated to motivate the team to play.
This game had lots of rich men.
Captain Craig Halkett played a huge role in leading a well-organized defense. Menga made Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall very important for the whole game.
The rank of a fighter is missing.
Although they were under Gerard's water at great moments, they did not uphold their standards.
There seemed to be something missing in their game: it was only once that they were able to pass through the defense of their masters. It should be a serious warning to the Rangers who were in the middle of the table.
Mixed reactions to the visit of Erdogan in Colonia
During the Sunday morning in Berlin (29 September) the leaders of Turkey and Germany accompanied the smiles and beautiful weather.
This was the last day of President Erdogan's visit to Germany. The visitors were aimed at improving the relationship between NATO allies.
There have been differences in issues such as human rights, freedom of movement and the accession of Turkey to the European Union.
After the meeting, Erdogan joined the Colonia, where he opened a new, huge game.
In this city is the largest number of Turks outside their father's village.
As the police put it, for security reasons, a 25,000 crowd gathered before the festival was blocked, but the president's constables gathered around to see their leader.
The networks of Erdogan opponents, including many Kurds, also decided to express their opinion by strengthening Turkey's leadership policy and the German government's decision to adopt a policy in the country.
Opposition is reflected in the parts that prompted the visit of a rich man-made politician by a part of Turks living in Germany and recognized by others as being autocratic.

Emergency causes caused by Rosa’s hurricane threaten Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City (probably beneficial effects on dry areas)
It is not too late for tropical depression to reach the state of Arizona. It is likely to occur at the beginning of next week. The remains after the invasion of Rosa are moved to the desert areas of the South-West, creating a threat of sudden consequences.
The National Weather Service has already issued a warning on the possibility of emergency events on Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona, southern and eastern Nevada, southern California and Utah, including in cities such as Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
According to a forecast on Tuesday, Rosa will go directly over Phoenix. On Monday afternoon the floods begin.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix reported on Twitter service that “from 1950 onwards, only ten tropical cyclones have maintained the state of storms or tropical depression at 320 km from Phoenix.
Huragan Katrina (in 1967) approached a distance of 65 km from the state border of Arizona".
The most recent models of the National Hurricane Center predict impact from 5 to 10 cm. In some areas of Mogollon Rome in Arizona, they can reach up to 15 cm.
In the rest of the desert areas of the South-West – including in the middle of the Skalti Mountains and the Great Coast – there is likely to be a height of between 2.5 and 5 cm, and in some areas up to 10 cm.
In addition to the areas threatened by the immediate effects of the hurricane with the hurricane Rosa, people may bring a debt as the region has been struggling with drought for some time.
Although the causes pose a serious threat, some accidents will improve the situation in the South West where they take the dry state.
As soon as the weather.com portal comes, U.S. Drought Monitor estimates that almost 40% of the Arizona area is able to cope with the affected wastes belonging to the second largest category.
Huragan Rosa is the first one to reach the Halfway of California in Mexico.
On Sunday morning Rosa continued to move with a hurricane, reaching a speed of 137 km/h. It is now 620 km south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico and is heading north with a speed of 19 km/h.
Huragan's trend towards the coldest waters of the Pacific, causing his weakness.
According to the forecast, he will hit Mexico with a tropical storm on Monday afternoon or evening.
In some parts of Mexico, intense flooding can create a major cause risk.
Portal weather.com reported that "in the area of the semi-Califorian to the north-western part of the state of Sonora there is an impact of 7 to 15 cm, although it can reach 25 cm".
Next, the hurricane Rosa will cross north in the shape of a tropical storm. On Tuesday, in the early hours of the morning, it will reach the state of Arizona as a tropical depression. On Tuesday night it will sail to the southern part of Utah.
“The most serious threat posed by hurricane Rosa or its remnant is the most devastating floods in the semi-Califonian Peninsula, in the north-western part of the state of Sonora and in the south-western part of the United States of the desert areas of the United States,” says the National Hurricane Center.
According to the forecast, rain causes a life-threatening cause and the transfer of pollution into the desert and the forest of mud.

The trumpet claimed that Brett Kavanaugh "recognizes the substantiation and anger" of the Democratic Party
"The vote delivered by the Kavanaugh Court is against the perceived and disturbing action of the Democratic Party," said Trump, aged Wheeling, in West Virginia.
The trumpet claimed that Kavanaugh "recognitions of contentment and anger" of the Democratic Party during the nomination process.
In the fourth quarter, Brett Kavanaugh acknowledged before the congress. He stood up and emotionally opposed Christina Blasey Ford. A woman claims that a few decades ago when they were both teenagers, a man allowed himself because of her sexual assault.
Ford also acknowledged during the hearing of her findings.
On Saturday, the President said that "Americans could be convinced of the flexibility, class and dignity" of Kavanaugh.
"The vote delivered at the Kavanaugh Court is the voice of support from one of the most significant lawyers of our time, knowing the right to large social benefits," he said in front of a group of seniors in West Virginia.
The President did not simply refer to the nomination of Britta Kavanaugh, talking about the importance of the frequency of the Republicans in half of the presidential elections.
"The most important choices in our life have given us five weeks.
I don't start in these elections, but I'm very active," he said.
"I'm still fighting against our great candidates."
The Group claims that the Democrats correct the policy "to build up and strengthen activities".
As CNN said one of the assistants of the important political party of the Republican Party, the first key vote on the appointment of Kavanaugh is expected at the latest on Friday.
Hundreds of victims of earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia. The number of victims increases
As the authorities gave up on Saturday, at least 384 people died, many of which were destroyed by high beaches, following a strong earthquake and tsunami that visited the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
On Friday in Palu, hundreds of people gathered on the beach to take part in the festival city. On the beach they attacked a pool that reached up to 6 meters high, killing many people and destroying everything on their way.
The tsunami was the result of a 7.5-degree earthquake.
"When there was a threat yesterday, the beachers didn't run away immediately and fell victim to the tsunami," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the head of the Indonesian BNPD biodegradation agency.
"Tsunami attacked everything on its way by driving cars, ice creams and houses," he said. He then added that he had moved to the sea at 800 km/h before he reached the coast.
As he said, some of them survived the climb on the tree and survived.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
On aerial images published by the Food Chain Agency, there are many destroyed houses and houses, damaged and damaged bridges and water-contained maps.
On Saturday, the coastal city was visited by second parties.
On the ground, 2.4 million people have reached a series of earthquakes.
According to the Indonesian Agency for the Evaluation and Use of Technology (BPPT), the energy generated by the wide fifth earthquake was about twice as much as the nuclear bomb dropped into Hiroshima during World War II.
The statement indicated that the location of the geographic cities at the end of the long, narrow siege could have been affected by tsunamis.
Sutopo Purwo Nugroho described the damage as "significant" and said that there were hundreds of homes, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels.
He then added that the victim's body was found under damaged buildings, 540 persons were arrested and 29 were deemed missing.
Nugroho said that the death and damage victims could be larger along the coastal line 300 km north of Palu, in the area called Doghrea, which was located near the earthquake epicenter.
According to Nugro, the communication "was fully co-operated" so there were no imports from the province of Doghrea.
“The residence is over 300 thousand people” can be read in a Red Cross statement. It has also been added that workers and volunteers are able to move to the places affected by the plague.
"We can now talk about the tragedy, although the situation may lead to a significant deterioration," stated the statement.
On Saturday, the agency met with a general criticism from the lack of information on the impact of tsunamis in Palu. However, the authorities pointed out that the flag had arrived just after the warning was issued.
On the amateur record available in social media, you see a man screaming out of the building, trying to warn of the coming tsunamis of people on the street.
Within a few minutes, the wall of water broke down on its back, destroying buildings and cars.
The Reuters Agency was not able to immediately confirm the authenticity of the recording.
The earthquake and tsunamis caused significant gaps in the supply of goods, making it impossible to communicate within the Palu area. This also made it difficult for the authorities to coordinate military operations.
According to the military authorities, the shipment of transport aircraft from Jakarta and other cities began, but the evacuated persons still desperately need food and other basic articles of the first need.
The airport located in the city is open only for transport with humanitarian aid. The airport will remain inactive until October.
On Sunday, President Joko Vidodo is to visit the centre for those evacuated in Palu.
More than 800 victims of tsunamis in Indonesia.
The situation is very bad.
As Doseba T. Sinay, director of the World Vision, the staff of this organization safely obtained protection from the province of Doghrea to the city of Palu and found protection in the premises of the state of the office.
"They told me they saw a lot of destroyed houses," he said.
The situation is very bad.
Although part of the group was slowing down the relief process, the voices of criticism appeared that foreign humanitarian workers with a rich experience were unable to travel to Paul.
According to Indonesian law, funding, resources and staff from abroad can only be started after a disaster has been announced in the area of national crime.
Not at all.
"We are officially still dealing with a regional disaster," said the head of the Indonesian Red Cross.
"When the government recognizes that it has reached the national level, we can begin to accept international assistance, but it has not yet happened."
Two days after the fifth earthquake and tsunami in Palu, friends and families of the missing continue to live with the hope that their loved ones will find some miracle in the midst of destruction.
A little boy was taken out on Saturday from the canal.
On Sunday, the soldiers released a woman who had spent two days in the caves beside her mother's body.
Gendon Subbandono, an Indonesian paralysing trainer, taught two missing pilots participating in the finals of this month in the Asian Games in Indonesia.
As Petra Mandige said, the other people at the Roa Roa Hotel were his students.
"As an experienced pilot, I struggle with my own emotional burden," he said.
Gendon Subbandono told how, within hours of the appearance among the paralysers of information about the arrival of the Roa Roa Desperacko Hotel, the news was sent by the WhatsApp communiqué to the athletes participating in the beach festival.
His messages were marked by only one shitty hacker instead of a couple of hackers in the sky color.
"I think it means that the news has not been delivered," he said.

Kanye West: rapper changed its name to Ye
Raper Kanye West decided to change his name to Ye.
In proclaiming his purpose in Twitter on Saturday, he wrote about himself: “A person known before as Kanye West”.
Twenty-one-year-old music has been used by the pseudonym Ye. It is also titled his eight album released in June.
The change occurred before the visit to the Saturday Night Live program. It is expected that during the event the artist will present his new album, pt. Yandhi.
It will be replaced by singer Arian Grande, who, according to the authors, has rejected the role "for emotional reasons".
West has previously stated that the word “Yes” is not only short of its present artistic heritage, but it has religious significance.
“I think ‘yes’ is the most frequently used word in the Bible. In the Scriptures it means ‘You’,’ – said West in an earlier period of the year, talking about the title of the album with the radio presentation on the Big Boy pseudonym.
"So I'm you, I'm us, it's us.
First I was Kanye, which means one person. Now I am Yes – reflecting all our good, evil and evil traits.
The album shows us who we are."
The West was in the band of other hearing rappers who decided to change their name.
Sean Combs, known under Puff Daddy's pseudonyms, P. Diddy or Diddy announced this year that he wanted to be called Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, was a West staff member, also writing his pseudonyms in different ways, with no connection, no great letters.
The President of Mexico Andrés Manuel López Obrador is committed not to use the army against civilians
In the preceding 50th anniversary of the bloodbath of students' demonstrations, President Andrés Manuel López Obrador (AMLO) promised never to use the war against civilians.
On Saturday at the Three Culture López Obrador promised "never use the army to repress the Mexican nation".
On October 2, 1968, the soldiers opened fire in the direction of a peaceful demonstration, killing even 300 people. It happened when the left-wing movement began to develop throughout Latin America.
López Obrador promised to support young people in Mexico, providing Commission financial assistance for learners as well as creating more free public schools.
He said that unemployment and lack of an educational opportunity for young people to join criminal groups.
The United States should double the funding of research on artificial intelligence
As Kai-Fu Lee says, an investor and an expert in artificial intelligence working for Google, Microsoft and Apple groups, together with an increase in China's activity in this area of the United States, should double the costs of research in the SI field.
This is due to reports of artificial intelligence published by various government agencies in the United States, although the United States does not have an official SI strategy.
In the past year, however, China has presented its plan to be the most innovative country in the field of artificial intelligence by 2030.
"At first, we must double the budget for research on SI: all other countries are far behind the United States, and we are trying to make a further break in this area," said Kai-Fu Lee.
In his report this week, the CNBC also said that double-decking funds could increase the chances of further crossing in the U.S. field of artificial intelligence.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, president of the Sinovation Ventures company. The company invested in one of China's most significant companies of artificial intelligence known as Face++.
In the 18th century Kai-Fu Lee worked at Carnegie Mellon University on the creation of the SI system, which performed the best American player in the Othello game. He then took the lead in Microsoft Research and was president of the Chinese company Google.
Lee recognized the success of earlier technological initiatives of the US government, such as organized by the Advanced Research Projects Agency in the field of Defence (DARPA) in the most successful job projects. He also returned with a question of the next deadline for editing the winnings, as he said it would help him find future spectators.
As Kai-Fu Lee said, scientists in the United States often have to work hard to get government grants.
"These are not China's best representatives of the academic environment, but corporations," said Lee.
For a few years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have been working hard on artificial intelligence.
According to Lee, changes in immigration policy could also help the United States in the development of SI.
"I believe that people who are engaged in artificial intelligence who have obtained doctoral degrees should automatically recognise a green card," he said.
In July 2017, the Chinese Council published a plan to create artificial intelligence for the next generation.
As noted by Lee, China’s National Science Foundation (National Natural Science Foundation of China) provides funding for members of academia in a way that is closer to the American National Science Foundation and other government organizations that provide funding for American scientists. However, the quality of academic activity in China is lower.
In the early part of this year, the United States Department of Defence called the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which will be engaged in the work of the partners from the world of industry and science. The White House announced the establishment of the Selection Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
In this month, the DARPA agency also reported on the allocation of US$ 2 billion to the AI Next initiative.
The National Science Foundation currently invests over US$100 billion per year in an SI survey.
At the same time, the American initiative aimed at creating the National Committee on the Safety of artificial intelligence has not been moving forward since the month.
Macedonians shall vote in the referendum on the change in the name of their country
On Sunday, the Macedonians voted in a referendum on the change in the name of their country to the Republic of Northern Macedonia, which would allow for a several-year dispute with Greece blocking the country's efforts to join the European Union and NATO.
Greece, in whose territory the historical territory of Macedonia is located, maintains that the name of the northern neighbours constitutes an increase in its territory and therefore involves the accession of the country to the EU and NATO.
In June, both governments reached an agreement on membership, but it is claimed that the change would reflect the ethnicity of the majority of the population of Macedonia.
President Čorge Ivanov said he would not take part in the vote. The campaign encouraging the fight has raised doubts as to whether the frequency reaches a minimum level of 50% required to recognize the referendum as binding.
The referendum asked the following question: "Are you supporting NATO and the EU's accession following the adoption of an agreement with Greece?"
Freedoms of name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaew, claim that it is worth paying for the possibility of joining Macedonia – one of the countries that have emerged after the fall of Yugoslavia – to organisations such as the European Union or NATO.
"I voted in favour of the future of my country so that young Macedonians can live free under the European Union's umbrella. EU membership will provide us with greater security," said 79-year-old Oliver Georgievska from Skopje.
Although the referendum is not legally binding, enough parliamentarians have stated that it is taking advantage of the results of the vote.
The amendment of the name requires the support of two thirds of Parliament.
The Committee of State informed the electoral committee that no adverse events had been reported until 13 p.m.
However, the frequency of this hour was only 16% compared to 34% in the last parliamentary elections of 2016. At the same time, 66% of authorized persons were voting.
"I voted in favour of my children. Our place is in Europe," said 62-year-old Tanewski, a Skopje voter.
On 30 September 2018, in the city of Strumica, Macedonia's Prime Minister Zoran Zaew, his wife Zorica and son Dusko voted in a referendum on the change in the name of the country to open the way for NATO and the European Union.
Before the building of Parliament in Skopje at 54 years of age, Vladimir Kawardarkov prepared a small stage and set up a cross-sectional front of the people facing the referendum.
"We support NATO membership and the EU, but we want to join these organisations with the Union's head rather than the back door," Kawardark said.
“We are poor countries, but we have our own dignity.
If they don't want us as Macedonia, we can return to other countries, such as China or Russia, and become part of the Euro-Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zaew says NATO membership will bring necessary investments to Macedonia, where unemployment rate is more than 20%.
"I believe that the vast majority will object to the change in the name of the referendum because 80% of citizens support the European Union and NATO," Zaew said after voting.
He said that the vote on "that" would be "confirming our future".
In a survey published last Monday by the Macedonian public research institute from 30 to 43% of voters declared their wish to participate in the referendum. This is less than the required frequency.
According to another Macedonian television poll, Telma TV in the Sunday referendum plans to vote 57% of respondents.
Seventy percent of respondents said they had changed their names.
In order for the vote to be successful, the frequency must be 50% + 1 vote.
The victory in the referendum would be the first major milestone in the policy of the previous government since the fall in power in May last year.
See: Sergio Aguero from Manchester City wins the entire defense of Brighton and wins the prize
Sergio Aguero and Rahem Sterling sent the Brighton defence home on Saturday meeting at 2:0 for Manchester City. The match was released at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
The flag obtained by Aguire in 65 minutes looked like a child's light.
The action began when it was administered in the middle of the fight to the Argentine attacker.
The shooter's been following three Brighton defenses.
Then Aguero was found among four Brighton lawyers.
First he beat one of them and then chased the others and found himself in the end of the county of Brighton.
Then he played the ball on the left side where he was waiting for Sterling.
The English attacker from time to time gave the arrow back to Aguery in the military field, which defeated Brighton Matthew Ryan's armchair and shot at the right side of the bow.
"Aguero is struggling with foot damage," said the coach Manchester City Pep Guardiola.
"We talked about the possibility of 55, 60 minutes.
That's exactly what happened.
We were happy that he got a bow at that time."
However, Sterling provided the bloc's first lead in the Premier League.
The brake he's talking about fell in 29 minutes.
In this action, Aguero received a deep arrow at the Brighton.
He sent a great presentation along the left side of the forest to Leroy Sane.
Sane made a couple of moves, allowing Sterling to move to a distant hole.
The Manchester City attacker pulled a bullet into the net just before it hit the car.
Manchester City will meet with Hoffenheim at the UEFA Teachers' League on Tuesday at 12:55 p.m.. The meeting will take place at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena stadium in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to give you a chance to win Rockies.
After losing the chance to participate in the play-off phase by Washington Nationals Scherzer he didn't have to be in the first set.
However, it is the hope of scherzer’s loving rivalisation to attend a Sunday meeting against Colorado Rockies, if only Rockies keep a chance to perform at the play-off stage. Currently the team has one more victory than Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West Division.
Rockies can count at least on a wild card if they win a fifth meeting against the Nationals by 5:2. However they still want to get their first title, master of division.
"Despite the game "of nothing", at least we will go to the forest, knowing that the atmosphere in Denver and the presence of opponents will be at the highest level as in the rest of the season.
Why should I not take part in this meeting?"
The Nationals have not yet announced the start of the meeting on Sunday. However, the team is concerned about the Scherser show in the first edition.
This would be the thirty-fourth of Sherzer's first performance. The coach took part in the fourth rowing training and hoped to attend Sunday.
The Washington team's legislator notes the results of 18-7 and ERA 2,53. 300 times eliminated the bullets and spent 220 and 2/3 rounds during the season.
Veec Trupa in West Virginia
The trumpet did not simply refer to its appointment by Britta Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court of Justice, discussing the importance of the frequency of the Republicans in half of the presidential elections.
“In November we will put on the side of all the current achievements.
From one of the most important choices in our life, we've been given five weeks.
Although I'm not starting, I'm still very active. I'm still defending our wonderful candidates," he said.
He then continued: “We have to deal with a huge group of radical Democrats, and we see their actions in our own eyes.
They are determined to acquire power by any means possible. They are corrupt and corrupt.
They don't care about who they hurt and who they have to hurt in order to gain power and control.
Democrats, as he said, are carrying out the mission "to build up and strengthen activities".
"It was very good to see it in the last four days," he said, calling Democrats "bad, bad, unhappy and unfair".
The President referred to the Senate Justice Commission, calling on the names and names of the US Senator from the Democratic Party of Diane Feinstein, which met with a vote on behalf of the crowd.
“Do you remember her answer?
Are you responsible for removing the document?
"Eh, do I hear?
No... it means... no." Her body was mortal, it was the worst body I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer a group of people with different views.
The Party is neutral in relation to persons expressing their own opinion
I wasn't surprised when the Momentum organizations in my party voted against me for my appointment.
Finally, I am a member of the Group of Ambassadors of the Labour Party, who has recently been told that they are not fair-looking, and this is all because of their own opinions.
My fellow MP Joan Ryan met with a similar treatment because she opposed anti-Semitism.
In my case, the request for a loan was made from the difference between me and Jeremy Corbin.
The differences concerned the importance of responsible economic policy, national security and Europe. As for irony, Jeremy Corbyn opposed the position of previous leaders on these issues.
In a Friday announcement on the meeting of the parliamentarians of the Nottingham East Party, we could read: "We want the meetings to be open and productive".
For eight years, I have been serving as a member of the Working Party, most of the meetings of the General Committee on Fridays have been that way.
Unfortunately, many of the meetings are now being held differently, and it has long been forgotten about the promises of a "more heartful and easier" policy than ever before.
More and more clearly, the Labour Party does not tolerate different views. Each opinion is assessed in accordance with the party’s guidance.
It all started soon after the position of President Jeremy Corbina. colleagues who seemed to me that we had similar views began to expect me to change my direction and take positions that I would not agree with before, such as national security or the single EU market.
After every public event – regardless of its content – I meet in social media with attacks calling for nominations, centrifuge or resignation of the Labour Party.
It's not just my experience.
I'm happier than some of my colleagues because the attention I receive from my address is more political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of colleagues who experience daily sexual or racist treatment but do not avoid further action.
One of the most disheartening aspects of the current policy is the transition to the agenda with respect to others.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn said the Labour Party should support a culture of tolerance.
In fact, we are no longer the grouping of people of different views, with every request for "independence" and every change in the principle of the choice of the world view of the party is bound.
Over the last two years, I have been advised repeatedly not to give up and discuss certain issues, so everything would be "all right".
That's not why I've been involved in politics.
Since my accession to the Labour Party 32 years ago, as a result of the government's failure, Margaret Thatcher, who led to the collapse of my school class, I am trying to look out for better quality of public services for those in need – both as local councils and as ministers.
I've never covered up my beliefs in the last election campaign.
Everyone in the Nottingham East knew my position and knew about different views with party authorities.
I would like to say to those who have supported the fifth proposal that I cannot understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the presidential labs in the form of Brexit, which is damaging to the economy, businesses and public services.
The most important message, however, is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to my voters (both members of the Labour Party and others): I am proud to be able to serve you. I promise that no threats to the return of nominations or any political objectives will not prevent me from acting in accordance with my beliefs and in the best interests of all of you.

Air vs Melrose 38:17 – Uncomplicated Air again
Two later additions could sometimes have denied the final result. However, there is no doubt that the Air team had earned a victory in this unusual game of Scottish extraliability.
The team was at first in the table and there was only one unarmed team.
In the end, this excellent defense and better use of opportunity led to a team of masters to win. Coach Peter Murchie could be satisfied with his favorites.
"The game of time was a challenge for us, but we are still imperfect, so I'm satisfied," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose's team said: "We need to give respect to the Air. Better use of opportunities than we have."
Air went out to conduct at 14 minutes after Grant Anderson's accession and Frazier Clim. However, the gold card for the damage of Rory Hughes, who came to the team from the Glasgow Warriors, allowed Melrose to compare the result when Jason Baggot seized the arrow after an unusable opportunity to raise it.
The climate has increased air traffic since the end of the sentence just before the end of the first half of the first half. He first got his crew, and later used his chance to raise it, with a result of 17:5 for Air.
Melrose started a second half, and Patrick Anderson's presence, raised by Baggoto, reduced the loss to five points.
Then came to a long stop of the game because of the serious concussion of Ruaridha Knotta. The driver was removed from the box on his nose. After Air was renewed, he increased his driving after Stafford McDowall and the rise of the climate.
In the next performance of Captain Air Blair Macpherson's duties, Melrose has received a gold card. Melrose has re-used his number: the attachment with the unusable attempt to raise Bruce Colvina reduced the conduct.
The economy took the initiative when Struan Hutchinson received a gold card to relieve the climate without a bullet. MacPherson got an attachment on his back to the nearby defense.
The climate used the chance to raise it. Then he was able to raise the result even after the game was resumed when Kyle Rowe caught a gun from the prison line and allowed Gregor Henry to obtain a fifth hit for the economy.
The Still Game series star begins career in the gastronomic industry
Ford Kieran, the star of the Still Game series, seems to be starting business in the gastronomic industry. Recently it was discovered that he was the director of the restaurant management company.
The 56-year-old actor took part in Jack Jarvisi in the popular BBC station site. He also presents a series together with his many-year-old comedy partner, Greg Hemphill.
Duet announced that the next nine season will be the last in the history of the series. It all indicates that Ford Kiernan is planning for the future after leaving Craiglang.
According to the official data, he was the manager of the company Aposimorn Limited.
The actor rejected the comment on this subject, but the Scottish Sun informant suggested that Kiernan strives to engage in "the developing gastronomic industry" in Glasgow.
"The Sea Belongs to Us": Free access to the Bolivian Sea is alive hope that the Court will reopen its way to the Pacific
The Marines patrol the bases of the war mariners in La Paz.
The public buildings say the blue flags.
“ The sea is ours in the power of law, ” states a marine warlord from Lake Titicaca after the Amazon.
His recovery is our duty."
In the absence of access to the Bolivian Sea, the mention of the coastal line lost to Chile in the bloody conflict of the 19th century is still alive.
These hopes may be greater than a few hundred years. Bolivia is awaiting the outcome of the International Court of Justice. It will be issued on 1 October following the five-year process.
"Bolivia's actions are broken down. The residents are united, optimistically set up and counted on a useful verdict," said the Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadilla.
Many Bolivians throughout the country will jointly observe the International Court of Justice meeting. They hope that an organization based in Hadde will recognize Bolivia's growth and, after ten years of informal talks, Chile will have to join the negotiations on the award of an independent country of access to the sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatic President of Bolivia, who will be in the wake of the upcoming re-election struggle in the coming year, also puts hope in the Monday decision.
"We are very close to going back to the Pacific," he said at the end of August.
However, some analysts say that the chances for Bolivia's benefits are small and that even a temporary decision would not change much.
The United Nations body with its headquarters in Hadje has no authority to grant Bolivia the Chile territory. It has also noted that it will not influence any talks.
As Paz Zárate said, Chile's international law specialist, the International Court of Justice's decision will be issued six months after the submission of final arguments.
Unfortunately, Bolivia has been able to leave the country for the last four years.
"The issue of access to the sea has been raised by the current Bolivian administration," Páz Zárate said.
The inalienable rhetoric of Morales saved the Chileans from any remnant of good will, suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will be talking again at some point, but this will be very difficult in the face of the real situation.
In both of these countries since 1962, there has been no change of ambassadors.
Eduardo Rodríguez Veltze, who was president and representative of Bolivia in Hadde, did not agree that the decision-making process was very fast.
Monday will bring Bolivia "a unique opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile" and the possibility of "the end of the 139-year period of competition with mutual benefit", he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales — one of the most popular presidents of Latin America — used the issue of sea access as an element of political turmoil.
"Bolivia will never give up access to the Pacific," he added.
"The decision is a great opportunity to make sure that we have to fight the past."
North Korean leaders claim that nuclear disarmament will not occur until they can trust the United States.
North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his people will never forget nuclear weapons until he can trust Washington.
Ri spoke on Saturday at the UN General Assembly.
He called on the United States to comply with the promises made during the Singapore summit between the leaders of both countries.
His comments appeared at the time when U.S. Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, seemed to be ending the renewal of the suspended nuclear diplomacy more than three months after a meeting in Singapore with North Korea's leader, Kim Jong Unem.
Ri says it's like the lack of sanctions and the United States against the declaration of the end of the Korean war has ever left North Korea on its knees.
Washington does not want to agree with the signing of a declaration without prior adoption by Pjongjang of concrete disarmament measures.
Both Kim Jong Un and the President of the United States Donald Trump want another meeting.
There is, however, a general scepticism that Pjongjang is seriously leading to the liquidation of the arsenal, which is seen in North Korea as the only security measure.
Pompeo plans to visit Pjongjang next month as part of preparations for the second Kim-Trump site.
Parisian fashion show increases the appearance of the latest line of big heads in clothing bars.
If you want to increase your collection of hats, or you'll get to sleep in front of the sun, we have good information for you.
The designers of the Valentino and Thom Browne fashions presented a series of twisted, superimposed heads that entered their collection last year in 2019, which were worn out by the style during the weekly fashion Paris Fashion Week.
This year's Instagrey was an extraordinaryly unusual capelus. The noted designers decided to present their stunning creatures to escape.
The distinctive part of Valentino was a wide-eyed bead capellus with a wide, pear-shaped round of the main model.
Other ultrasound accessories included ambers decorated with linens, natural hats, and even pineapples — however, they were not designed to burn their heads.
Tom Browne also showed a number of personal masks — at the same time on Halloween.
Many colorful masks had oral protection and remembered Hannibal Lecter style more than haute Couture.
One of the creatures mentioned the instrument of skating with the foot and the eyelids, and the other looked like the dissolved ice.
And if you don't want to fuck with a lot of fashion, you're lucky.
Style observers provide that large capeluses can be found in clothing pockets.
Unmapped capelluses also carry La Bomba, a slender hat with a width of 61 cm, which they all wore — from Rihanny after Emily Ratajkowski.
The cultural brand behind this extremely unusual capellus, which passed through the social media, represented another great creature — a slender beach bag almost as large as it is with a model taken into the cabin.
The accompanying orange bag of Rafia, finished with rafia leaves and painted with a white cut handle, appeared in the collection of Jacquemus La Riviera in 2019 during the Paris Fashion Week week.
Luke Armitage, a star stylist, said to the FC: “I hope that large chapels and plastic bags will appear in the caves next year — given that the projector has been able to exert such a great influence on the projector, it would be difficult not to use the demand for excessive accessory. ”
John Edward: Language skills necessary for citizens of the world
Independent schools in Scotland will continue to enjoy their scientific achievements — in 2018 they could be praised for the following significant results of studies, individual and collective success in sports, art, music and other social enterprises.
The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) of schools where more than 30,000 students throughout Scotland attend the best level of services provided by students and parents.
Independent schools are designed to prepare students for further and higher education chosen by them by careers and to show them their role as citizens of the world.
As an educational sector with the opportunity to develop and implement a school-based learning programme, we see that the languages needed are still popular and desirable for the choice of school subjects.
Nelson Mandela never said: “If you speak to another person in the language he understands, then it’s going to be his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, that's what happens to his heart."
This is a clear reminder that we cannot rely solely on English when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
The results of the last review this year show that languages take the first place in legal rankings, with the highest performance indicators in the case of independent schools.
Overall, 68 percent of the students who learned native languages received higher A.
Data collected from 74 SCIS member schools showed that 72 per cent of students received higher A in Mandarin, 72 per cent of German students, 69 per cent French students and 63 per cent Spanish students also received A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support citizens’ languages as necessary skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Language science, such as selection subjects, is currently carried out in the same area as STEM subjects (Stem science, technology, engineering and mathematics) under education programmes in independent schools and elsewhere.
A 2014 study conducted by the UK Commission on Employment and Skills showed that due to difficulties in the availability of free jobs by workers in 17 per cent, there was a lack of language skills for language candidates.
That is why language skills are becoming increasingly common, allowing young people to prepare for careers.
These skills are needed in a globalised world with a growing number of jobs requiring language skills,
Learning a new language will ensure a great deal of effort in the future — regardless of the path of professional development.
The possibility of direct agreement with people from other countries automatically increases the chances of multilingual persons in relation to competition.
According to the 2013 YouGov survey, involving more than 4,000 British adults, 75% of them were unable to speak in the public language in such a good way, and French was the only language of which the percentage of people serving was bilingual, i.e. 15%.
That is why investment in learning native languages is so important for today’s children.
The knowledge of several languages, in particular the languages of developing economies, will provide children with a greater chance of finding appropriate employment.
In Scotland, each school will vary according to its language.
Many schools are grouped into more classical new languages, while others will learn languages that are considered the most important for Great Britain in 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of the interest of the child, in independent schools there will always be many languages to choose which will be taught by the specialized educational staff in this area.
Excellent schools are devoted to creating an environment of learning that prepares children and equips them with the skills needed to make success — regardless of what the future holds for them.
At present, it cannot be denied that the international business environment continues to play a key role in the future of the country, so it must be reflected in education.
The required languages should be treated as "international communication skills".
Schools that are independent will continue to offer a great choice, diversity and level of youth.
That's just right.
John Edward, Chairman of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
Debout LeBron in Lakers' team on Sunday in San Diego.
The fans who wanted to see LeBron James Debout in Los Angeles Lakers were finally waiting.
Luke Walton, Lakers trainer, announced that LeBron James was playing in a weekly pre-sessional match against the Denver Nuggets team in San Diego.
We don't know how long he'll be playing.
"More than one but less than 48," said Walton on the official website of Lakers.
The Lakers team reporter, Mike Trudell, on Twitter, announced that James is likely to play an incomplete number of minutes.
After the training that took place at the beginning of this week, James was asked about his plans for six Lakers' preliminary games.
"At this stage of my career I don't need to participate in pre-conceived games to prepare," he said.
Already selected in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump starts tonight at Wheeling in Virginia's Western electoral season.
It's the first of five planned by the Tempe of the election evenings that will take place next week, along with his presence in his friendly places, such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
In addition to a vote confirming its decision to hold a stand-alone vote in the Supreme Court, the Supreme Court is committed to building support in the upcoming elections in the half of the governments, as the Republic may be threatened by the loss of control over Congress when the votes are delivered in November.
What time will it take tonight to pick up the trumpet in West Virginia and where will it be viewed on the Internet?
It will be held today at 19:00 a.m. on Saturday, 29 September 2018.
You will be able to live on the Internet via the YouTube service.
The Group is likely to refer to this week's hearings of the candidate appointed to the Supreme Court, Bretta Kavanaugh, who took place in a tense atmosphere in connection with the allegations of sexual misconduct and also by a vote taken in Senate on the suspension of the election for a maximum of one week, during the time of the FBI investigation.
However, the main objective of this series of elections is to provide support to the Republicans in the form of difficult November elections.
The five-year-old President's campaign, therefore, is aimed at "mobilising volunteers and volunteers to help the Republicans in the protection and expansion of the majority in Senate and the Election of Representatives" — Reuters.
"The control of Congress is so important in the President's timetable that as the best season of the campaign draws closer, he will visit as the largest number of states," said the spokesman for the Trump campaign, who did not agree to give his name to Reuters.
Today's election year in Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling can attract volunteers from "Ohio and Pennsylvania, as well as the media from Pittsburgh" — West Virginia Metro News.
On Saturday, Trump visited Virginia West — the state in which it won more than 40 percentage points in 2016 — the second time in the last month.
The trumpet seeks to help the candidate of West Virginia to the Senate, the Republican Patrick Morrisey, who is playing in the polls.
"This is not a good sign for Morrisey when the president comes to support him in the polls," said Simon Haeder, a politician from West Virginia University — Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: The United States Society shows a spirit of struggle, maintaining hope for victory in Sunday singles
After three single sessions, the forum format that took place on Saturday afternoon could be what Ryder Cup needed.
The resulting wave of dispersion is a completely conceived sport concept, but the one in which professionals really believe, and most of all, on such professions as these.
So what does their distribution look like right now?
"They've been running six points, and now they're only four, so I think we have a little break," Jordan Spieth said.
Of course, Europe is running four points while it is still twelve.
Americans, as Spieth says, however, feel wind in their wings and have good examples to follow, especially in the form of Spietha and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each could be praised for getting three points out of four.
Spieth is dangerous in all areas and provides an example.
The screams on the whole throat as a sign of undercitizenship became more and more loud during his rounds, hitting the key pout and playing the game when he and Thomas got two shots in two.
His return to the country that won them the success of 15 met a similar challenge — one that makes it realize that the American team is still in the game.
"It's enough to get together and worry about your own game," said Spieth.
That's all that's left for each of these professionals.
18 hits to win.
The only players who in the last two days won more points than Spieth and Thomas were Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, an undisputed story of Ryder Cup.
It's weird, but a couple of European teams won four out of four and she didn't lie.
"Moliwood" is the only pair that didn't beat bogey on Saturday afternoon, but also avoided bogeys on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and back on Friday morning.
The way of games and how their energy seems to flow to and from the voices of the team proves that these players should be defeated on Sunday, and that there is no better player than Fleetwood or Molinari, who could contribute to the potential victory of the European team on Le Golf National.
It'd be best if they played on different waves at the same time.
However, it is too early to speak of the European team's victory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly played Sergio García, the early Fourball hero when he was rescued by Alex Norene.
Bogey and double double on the front of them buried Hispan and Swede into a hole that they would never get out of.
There's no one on Sunday who can help get out of the hole.
Fourball and foursome formats are so fascinating because of the interaction between the support, the advice they do, the advice they don't do, and how at one time changes might occur.
Europe has been playing better as a team this day and has been making significant progress on the last day, but the forum has also shown that the US team has a tendency to fight, in which some, especially in the United States, have doubted.
Europe with 10-6 results includes running on Ryder Cup's final day.
Europe with a significant move on the last day of Ryder Cup after winning 10-6 Saturday fourball matches and foursomes with the United States.
The inspired Duet — Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari — has allowed the race to rise by two victories over the fighter Tiger Woods, increasing its current success at Le Golf National to four points.
The European team of Thomas Bjorna, trying to preserve the tropheum that was lost in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the American team in the morning form of fourball, winning a series with 3-1.
The United States has put more opposition in foursome format, playing two games, but they couldn't lose.
To maintain the tropheum, Jim Furyk's team has to get eight points from 12 singles that will take place on Sunday.
Fleetwood is the first European Debtor who received four points from the series, while along with Molinari (the group was called "Mollwood" after the sesension weekend) are just the second pair in the history of Ryder Cup, which received four points in four open games.
After moving Woods and Patrick Reed into a fourball style, the famous Woods and American Dechambeau Dechameau Dechameau debulant got even more empathy.
Woods, who struggled with two weekly games, occasionally showed a pass of genius, but this time he lost 19 out of 29 games in fourball and foursome formats, and it's seven of the series.
Justin Rose, who did not participate in the morning fourball format, returned to Henrik Stanson in foursome format to complete 2&1 Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepkä’s performance — taking part in the world ranking according to paragraphs 1 and 3.
However, the European team did not think of this pleasant, cold day on the southwestern part of Paris.
The three main winners Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set a point of reference for the Americans, winning two points on Saturday.
They won a decisive victory with 2&1 over Hispanic John Rahm and Ian Poulter in fourball format and later returned to defeat Poulter and Rory McIllroy with 4&3 in foursome format, playing two opening balls.
Only twice in the history of Ryder Cup has happened to make the team lose a four-point loss, starting single, although the Fury team would only be remiss in order to keep the trophies.
However, two days before the second place, the non-participated contract seems to be less likely.
North Korea says "stabilizes no" to one-sided disintegration without confidence.
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of North Korea said in his speech to the UN on Saturday that the lack of sanctions only deepens the lack of confidence of North Korea in the United States and there is no reason for the country to unilaterally withdraw from nuclear weapons in such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho said at the annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken "significant measures of good will" last year, such as the suspension of nuclear and missile tests, the demolition of nuclear testing sites and the commitment to non-proliferation of weapons and nuclear technology.
"We do not see, however, any concrete answer from the US," he said.
"Without confidence in the United States, there will be no guarantee of our national security and in such circumstances there will be no mention of the unilateral proliferation of North Korea."
While Ri repeated known North Korean complaints about Washington's failure to “step” approach to denuclearisation, which would reward North Korea for its gradual action, its statement seemed significant because it did not reject unilateral denuclearisation as it did in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Una and Donald Trump on the first in history between the United States official president and North Korea's leader, who took place in Singapore on 12 June when Kim Jong Un committed himself to the work of the "nuclearization of the Korean peninsula", and Trump promised North Korea's security assurances.
North Korea expected the formal end of the Korean war (between 1950 and 1953), but the United States representative announced that Pjongjang must first withdraw from nuclear weapons.
Washington also relied on calls for relief of the international severe sanctions against North Korea.
“The United States is committed to ‘nuclearization in the first instance’ and increases pressure by means of sanctions to achieve its objective in a forced manner, even contrary to the signing of “the declaration of end of war’, Ri said.
“The fact that sanctions can throw us on our knees is hate people who act in a way that ignores us.
The problem is, however, that lack of sanctions deepens our uncertainty."
Ri did not mention plans for the second honor between Kim Jong Unem and Donald Trump, which he spoke at the beginning of the week of the United States leader at the UN forum.
Instead, the Minister drew attention to the three meetings between Kim Jong Unem and South Korea's leader Moon Jae-ine over the last five months, adding: "If South Korea were a party to denuclearization and not the United States, it would not have had such an impact on South Korea's denuclearization."
However, the tone of speech of Ri was quite different than the year before when he said during the UN General Assembly that the healing of North Korea's rocket in the United States territory is inevitable after Mr. Evil President Trump called Kim Jong Una "rocket man" on his suicide mission.
This year at the UN Forum Trump, which had threatened the "total destruction" of North Korea last year, commended Kim Jong Una for his reaction to taking steps towards disarmament, but also said that much work needed to be done, and also said that until North Korea would not be released from nuclear weapons, sanctions would not be removed.
In the middle of the trip, he said that he did not mention this part of the time, saying: “No matter whether it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn’t matter. ”
China and Russia claim that the UN Security Council should reward Pjongjang for the steps taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Thursday to the UN Security Council forum: "The enforcement of the sanctions of the Security Council must be continued and suspended until we establish full, final and verified denuclearization".
Since 2006, the Security Council has unanimously launched sanctions against North Korea, trying to undermine the financing of the Pjongjiang nuclear and ballistic missile programme.
Pompeo met with Ri outside the UN General Assembly forum and later said that he would visit Pyongjang again in preparation for the second visit next month.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit cannot be called success.
He left Pjongjang in July, saying that progress had been made, after which North Korea had helped him to "put up gangster demands" within a few hours.
North Korea committed itself this month to a meeting with Moon Jae-enem to demount the rocket test site and the nuclear complex if the United States will take "the appropriate measures".
He said that Kim Jong Un told him that the "adequate measures" on which he depended were security guarantees that the Trump committed in Singapore and that it was taking steps to normalize relations with Washington.
Harvard students participate in the course of appropriate long-term rest
A new course at Harvard University, which took place this year, gave all the students more dreams, which were aimed at combating the growing macho culture, which was based on the study of "all-night students with caffeine."
Academic students from the best universities in the world often have no idea of the reasons for their concern.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, developed a course that he considered to be the first type in the United States.
To create the course, he was inspired by a speech presentation on the impact of sleep depression on science.
“After the conversation, one girl came to me and said, ‘Why does this tell me right now when I'm in my last year of studies?’
She said that no one ever told her the meaning of the dream that surprised me," The Telegraph said.
During the course that took place for the first time this year, it explains how good sleep-related habits help to achieve good results in education and sport, as well as improve the general feeling of students.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and the Executive Director of the Health Service, said that the course was decided to introduce it after it was said that students suffered from severe sleeplessness during the week.
The hourly course includes a series of interactive tasks.
One section includes a picture of the room in the academy where students click on the cups for coffee, lunch, exercise and books to get information about the effects of caffeine and light and how sleep deprivation affects sports results, as well as how important it is to maintain regular sleep.
In another section, participants learn how long-term sleeplessness can increase the risk of heart failure, brain damage, depression and innovation.
The map of the campus with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
"We know that this does not result in immediate changes in students' behaviour.
But we believe that they have the right to know — just as everyone has the right to know what health effects of paper burning are with themselves," added Professor Czeisler.
The culture of "full-time science" continues to exist, adding that modern technology and increasing pressure on students are increasingly leading to a problem of sleeplessness.
A sufficient amount of sleep for good quality should be a “secret weapon” for students who struggle with stress, fatigue and anxiety, and even to avoid weight loss, as lack of sleep causes the brain to pass through the process of cooling, which the student is constantly hungry, he said.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California biologist studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Ceisler to develop a course after participating in one of his last year in Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to press for the course for the entire campus.
The next step is to ask all secondary students to complete a similar programme of studies before moving to a competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommended that scientists set up a reminder alarm when to go to bed and when to get up, as well as to be aware of the harmful influence of "airlight" emitted by the screens of electronic devices and LED lighting, which can spread the noise and cause sleep problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga provides Gerrarda team
The Rangers next suffered during the battle on their way out to Livingston when Dolly Menga led his gun to the defeat of the dismounted team of Steven Gerard, receiving a 1-0 result.
The Ibrox Stadium team wanted to record its first victory from the famous triumph 4-1 over St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team won Gerarrd a second time in 18 matches, leading to his team's difference of eight points with the leader Ladbrokes Premiership — Hearts.
Menga shot naked seven minutes before the end of the first half of the first half, and the Rangers' lack of involvement didn't seem to make it right.
While the Rangers noticed a fall in six places, Livingston jumped into a third — even for the Hibernian lost one goal.
The Rangers may have further difficulties due to the need to monitor the head injury of the Caluma Spence line judge after he has been treated by an item released from the guest's trial.
Gerard made eight changes in the team, which allowed Air to move forward and move to the semi-final of Betfred Cup.
Holt from the train went through with the same unit Livingston, who took the heart's point last week, being impressed by the way his well-trained team tortured every step of its opponents.
The Rangers may have fallen into possession of the ball, but that team Livingston made more of it when they got it.
They should have got naked in just two minutes when it was Mengë's first shot to meet Scott Pittman with Allan McGregor's arm, but the assistant didn't use his chances.
Next, Keaghan Jacobs directed a deep-rooted line to Captain Craig Halketta, but his colleague Alan Lithgow, who was playing in the defense position, could only remain in the back position.
Rangers got control in the third quadrant, but it looked like they had more hope than faith in their game.
Alfredo Morelos certainly believed that he belonged to the gang for fifteen minutes before the end of the game, when he and Steven Lawless fell into it, but Judge Steven Thomson had grown up in Colombia.
The Rangers were able to deliver only two precious shots in the first half, but they were Ibrox, Liam Kelly, who was worried about Lassany Coulibaly's head, and I'd lose Ovie's Ejaria's gun.
While obtained by Livingston in 34 minutes the ball opening the game could be against the passage of the game, no one can deny that they deserve it for the effort put into his acquisition.
The Rangers again didn't deal with the deep permanent pieces of game played by Jacobs.
Scott Arfield didn't respond when Declan Gallagher threw a bullet into Scott Robinson, who kept it calm, giving it to Mengi for easy execution.
Gerard didn’t break in and exchange Coulibaly for Ryan Kent — this change immediately affected the crossing that pushed the arrow into Morelos, but the pressure that Kelly had enabled her to block by getting out of her position.
Livingston's company continued to attract guests into the game exactly what they liked when Lithgow and Halkett performed long sessions with each other.
Holta's team could've increased its conduct in the last few minutes, but McGregor had a good time before Jacobs, after which Lithgow left the game from the orphanage.
The Rangers' Reserves, Glenn Middleton, had another hope for the team when he was married to Jacobs, but Thomson returned the scene.
Almanac: Roger's finder
And now the page from our issue "Sunday Morning" German: 30 September 1882. — 136 years ago... the day that John Wilhelm was born in Germany came the physics of "Hans" Geiger.
Geiger developed a method of detecting and measuring radioactivity that eventually led to the establishment of a device known as the Geiger number.
Since then, the number of Geigers has become both an element of science and pop culture, such as in the 1950 movie Bells of Coronado, where you have had very little chance of being a cobbler, Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
The man said, "What's wrong?"
Rogers: “This is the number of Geigers used to locate radioactive minerals such as uranium.
When you start these hearing cells, you will hear the effects of radioactive minerals on the action of atoms."
Evans said, "Now listen to me!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name lasted until today.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "keep track of" the enemy of cells.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "keep track of" the enemy of cells and destroy them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to identify the enemy of cells in the treatment.
This method is intended to separate resistance cells from the patient and to change them into the laboratory.
At the same time, they can "keep the white one" together for many newborns, and then they are re-injected into the body.
The test vaccine shows promising results in patients with different types of innovation.
In one woman treated with a vaccine, learning resistance system for detecting cell enemies, there was a lack of ovarian innovation for more than 18 months.
The method is to separate resistance cells from the patient, to change them into the laboratory so that they can "keep" the protein together for many new products called HER2 and then re-inject these cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Institute of Cancer in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results show that this vaccine works very well.”
HER2 "increasesing the growth of several species of plants", including the growth of berry, eggs, lungs and pellets, explains Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach to the collection of resistance cells from patients and their "assessment" location has been used in treating certain types of protein.
Kanye West runs a pro-trumpow diaphragm in the Saturday Night Live program — with the MAGA button on its head.
It didn't go too well.
Kanye West was "stirred" in a study during the Saturday Night Live program after he praised the President of the United States Donald Trump and said he would apply for government in 2020.
After that night of his third creation entitled Ghost Town, during which he had a chapter based on "Make America Great", he conducted a protest against the Democrats and reiterated his support for the Turp.
“I talk to white people several times, and I hear, ‘How can you like Trupa? That's racist!’
If I were to practice racism, I'd be out of America a long time ago," he said.
The SNL program started with Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star introduced Bretta Kavanaugh's statements before the Senate's judicial commission on sexual assault charges by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although he was not transmitted, the West's record was sent to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
We don't know if Rock wanted to kiss West, moving the post.
In addition, West complained to the public that he had problems with his hat.
"They've been following me.
They said I didn't get out of that hat on my head.
They took care of me!
And then they say I have no way out," said Washington Examiner.
West went on to say, "I don't have to go out?" adding, "I'm setting up a superman fire, so why can't you tell me what I'm going to do?
Let's accept it."
His words were twice called "publishing" by the public, and SNL members appeared to be in trouble — brought by Variety. A person in the study during these events: "The study had a grave pressure".
West was invited to the program instead of singer Arian Grande, who was a boy, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days earlier.
The West has inspired many executions of I Love it in the prevention of Perrier's water bottle.
The West received support from the head of the TPUSA Conservative Group, Candace Turner, who posted the following tweet: "To one of the most important things: DIÜKUYS FOR PUSTAWIE MAFII".
The leader of Karen Hunter's show on his Twitter site said that the West just "was himself and it's absolutely amazing".
"But I will not reward people (by buying their music or weapons or by supporting it "the arts") who, as I think, accepts and spreads harmful ideology to my society.
It's free.
We're free just like that," she added.
Before the raper program, he announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and that now it is "formally called Kanye West".
However, he is not the first artist who changed his name — he follows Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy, and P Didy.
Friendly rapper, Snoop Dogg, adopted the name Snoop Lion, and the legend of music, Prince, changed the name to symbol, and then an artist known as Prince.
Inflammation of the murder of foot-and-mouth disease in the restaurant in Belfast
The 45-year-old man was charged with committing murder after he hit a man's knife at a restaurant in East Belfast on Friday.
The event took place in Ballyhackmore as the police arrived.
The accused is to be brought before the Grand Court in Belfast on Monday.
The arrests will be examined by the prosecutor.
Star Kit Harington throne game raises toxic male issue
Kit Harrington is known for his role as Jona Snow in the medium-term series of HBO "Torn Game".
31-year-old actor hit a macho steroid by saying that showing such roles on the screen causes young boys often to think they have to play hard to be respected.
In his report Sunday Times Culture, Kit claimed that "something went wrong" and wondered how to deal with the toxic problem of men at #MeToo time.
Kit, who recently married his partner in the Tron Game Plan, 31-year-old Rose Leslie, admitted that she felt "too sure" by pushing this issue.
He said: "I personally feel quite certain at this point — where did we make a mistake on the subject of sex?"
"What have we taught men during their growing up, given the perspective of the problem we are currently dealing with?"
Kit believes that the development of toxic male may be partly responsible for the presence of very male status television.
He continued: “What sort of persons ought you to be in holy acts of conduct and deeds of godly devotion, awaiting and keeping close in mind the presence of the day of Jehovah! ”
What does it teach on television and on the streets, making young boys think they have to stand on a certain side to be male?
I think this is one of the most important issues of our time — what can we do to change it?
Clearly it's not all right with young men."
In the report he also admitted that he no longer played in any prequel or series of games on the throne after the end of the series in the following year, saying that "he ended with battle fields and horses".
Since November, Kit will play in the art “True West” Sam Shepard, who is the story of the film producer and his brother — the thief.
The actor recently revealed that he considered his wife Rose to be the best thing that happened to him in Game about the throne.
"On the plan I met my wife, which gave me my future family and a new life," he said.
In this multi-winning prize Emmy, Rose’s fantasy series, played Ygritte — an object of loving interest in the role of Kita, Jon Snow.
In June 2018, the couple arrived in the territory of Leslie's family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China notes 14 percent increase in new cases
China reported a 14-percent increase in the number of people living with HIV and suffering from AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are affected by the health problems of health workers in this country.
About 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
Most of the new cases were transmitted by sex, which means a change in the past.
Traditionally the HIV virus spreads rapidly in some parts of China as a result of the blood transfusion.
However, the number of people infected in this way has been almost entirely reduced by HIV, as the Chinese health officials said at the Yunnan province conference.
However, by year the number of people living with HIV and suffering from AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
The transmission of HIV sexually transmitted diseases is a serious problem in Chinese society LGBT.
Homosexualism was criminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is widespread.
Taking into account the country's conservative values, studies estimate that 70–90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women.
Many cases of transmission of disease result from insufficient insurance during the treatment of sex in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese Government has provided general access to HIV medicines in efforts to address this problem.
Maxine Waters objected to the fact that one of her team revealed data to the senators of the Republican Party — “dangerous lies” and “piskey theory”.
The member of the United States Committee, Maxine Waters, rejected the statement on Saturday as a member of her team replaced the personal data of three Republican senators on the side of Wikipedia by the legislators.
A member of the Los Angeles Democrats Party ensured that these charges were filed by experts and websites related to "opportunity."
"Catholics, lies and even more worthless lies," Waters reported on Twitter.
The information published included similar addresses and phone numbers of US Senator Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch from Utah.
The information appeared on the Internet on Thursday. It was placed by an unknown person at the Capitol during the hearing of the Senate panel on sexual harassment charges against the Supreme Court, Britt Kavanaugh.
The search took some time after the Kavanaugh candidate was asked by three senators.
Conservative parties, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, reported that the IP address identifying the source of posts was linked to the Waters Office and published information about a member of the Waters team — as Hill reports.
"This baseless charge is completely false and it's a hundred-percent lie," Waters continued.
‘The member of my team — whose identity, personal data and security have been violated by these fraudulent and false charges — was not in any way responsible for the disclosure of these information.
This baseless charge is completely false and it's a thousand-percent lie."
Waters ’ statement quickly prompted criticism on the Internet, including by Arie Fleisher, former tax collector of the White House.
"This way of resisting is evil," Fleisher wrote.
"It suggests that she does not have the appropriate temperature to be a member of the Congress.
When someone is accused of something he hasn't done, it can't be bad.
He can't procrastinate.
He can't question the reasons of the person making the statement.
That's what we need to keep peace."
Fleisher seemed to compare Waters' reaction to the criticism of Democrats at the address of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of an excessive wickedness during the fourth hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate starting in mid-term elections to replace the Waters position, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
"The worst thing if it's true," he wrote on Twitter.
In her statement, Waters said that her cabinet announced "the competent authority and authority to investigate these false charges".
"The judges will be demobilized and forced to take legal responsibility for all their actions that are a threat to any member of my team," she said.
Review of Johnny English: Nokaut — family of spy with weakened Rowan Atkinson
The search for references to Brexit in each new movie with the British flag has already become standard. This seems to apply in the case of a new part of the series of films from the action gate and comedy "Johnny English", which started in 2003 from "Johnny English" and returned to the cinema screen in 2011 with "Johnny English: Reactivation".
Will the self-sustainment satirical about how hopeless we are become a new country's export goods?
In any event, always surprised by the rubber-shaped face, non-compliant Johnny English was again licensed to participate — his name and name more than anything else indicates that he is an elaborate, comical product intended for non-English-language views.
He's certainly a stupid secret agent, who despite his amazing appearances to the smoothie glamour, has a little bit from Inspector Clouseau, Jessia Fasoli's vaccine and this guy's captivating one of these guy's needs for the lead cariots of Fire at the opening ceremony of the Olympics in London in 2012.
In the past he was also a traveler and a world-secretary man — Atkinson had ever played in forgotten television advertisements Barclaycard, where he had left behind chaos.
The latest film from the Johnny English series is one or two good moments.
I liked the scene where Johnny English approached the helicopter, being picked up in the middle of the gun, while his helmet was hit rhythmically by the spinal cord.
On the screen you can clearly see Atkinson's gift for physical play of comedy, but the sense of humor seems to be quite low and unnecessary, especially that currently also "serious" film brands, such as 007 and Mission Impossible, offer comedy elements as part of the film's composition.
Humorous elements seem to be directed towards children rather than adults — I think Johnny’s crazy experiences are not as thoughtful and coherent as those in the German Atkinson movies about Jasi Fasoli.
From this point of view, it is that the United Kingdom has serious problems.
Ciberhaker is transferred to the British supercomputer network of spies, revealing the identity of all British agents working in the field — at the expense of a service agent, Kevin Eldona, who was unfortunately playing a small role.
This is the last body in the hot war of the Prime Minister, which is a positive, depleted state of mind already and so painfully affected by the breakdown of the nerve caused by a lack of political popularity: Emma Thompson does everything in her power by learning to be Theresy May, but the scenario does not give her the opportunity to develop the cross.
Her intelligence agency consultants inform her that because of the identity of all active spies, she will have to return to the service of one of the emigrant agents.
And this means a young Johnny English in his own person who is currently employed as a teacher in some elegant school, sharing informal lessons about how to be a secret agent — a few minors in the course of English spying.
English is invited to Whitehall to rehabilitate, re-connecting with his former assistant Bough, played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man associated with a submarine pilot — a sailor but a bit of a weakened condition played by Vicki Pepperdine.
So Batman and Robin's party in Her Royal Place's secret service are returning to action, meeting a beautiful dead woman, Ophelia Bullet, to become played by Olgo Kurylenko.
At the same time, the prime minister is dangerously dominated by a charismatic billionaire of technology, who claims to be able to solve the computer problems of Great Britain — he's Jason Volta's fish, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough are starting their cruise from absurd situations: cuts for kellers support the French restaurant; they introduce chaos, working on the luxury yacht of Volty; and English is using a set of virtual reality to meet the inside of Volty's house.
In this last sequence, all restrictions are removed, but despite good and fair executions, the entire film is very much reminiscent of television for children.
A typical middleman.
Like other films from the Johnny English series, I couldn't resist the idea: couldn't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that would really meet his talent?
The Labour Party objected to the development of a plan providing for the four-day work week for the British to receive a five-day salary
Jeremy Corbin's Labour Party will consider the introduction of a radical plan in which the British will work four days a week, receiving a wage in five days.
The party likewise wants the heads of the company to deliver to the rescue workers the result of the revolution related to the development of artificial intelligence (AI), giving them an additional day off.
As a result, employees could enjoy a third week, getting the same amount of remuneration.
The sources suggest that this idea will "enter" into the economic programme of the party and the country's exit plans against workers.
The four-day work week was supported by the Conference of Trade Unions as a way of using workers to change the economy.
An older member of the Labour Party, speaking with The Sunday Times, said: "It is expected that before the end of this year a policy change will be announced."
"This will not happen from day to day, but the fourth week of work is something that is part of the party's approach to restoring economic balance to the benefit of the worker as well as in the general strategy of the industrial party.
The Labour Party is not the first party to support this idea — the Green Party has committed itself to introducing a four-week work during the election campaign in 2017.
However, these plans are not currently supported by all members of the Labour Party.
The speaker of the Labour Party said: "The Thursday work week is not a party policy and its introduction is not considered by it."
John McDonnell, Chancellor from the customs office, used a conference of the Labour Party last week to present his vision of the socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to regain power from "faceless directors" and "speculants" in public utility companies.
The Canclerza plans from the Office also mean that current water companies can not fully recover their share, as the Government of the Labour Party could make "debts" based on the discovered burden.
He also confirmed the plans to place employees in corporate administrations and to set up an integrated ownership fund to transfer 10 per cent of their own capital from the private sector to employees who receive annual dividends of up to 500 pounds.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy respond in the program "60 minutes" to the question whether the FBI's study on Kavanaugh can make them change their settings
The FBI's investigation of charges against the Court of Justice of Brett Kavanaugh delayed the final vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court for at least a week and raised questions as to whether the establishment of a post could lead to the withdrawal of the Republican senators.
In the report on Sunday, "60 minutes" by Scott Pelley asked the Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find out something that could lead to their change in their settings.
Kennedy was more open than his South Carolina colleague.
"Of course," said Kennedy.
"On my way to the hearing, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
So I called him after what happened when the storm appeared and I asked him, "Did you do this?"
He was stable, determined and unique."
The Graham opinion, however, seems to be the result of the stone.
"I have made a decision what to Britta Kavanaugh and to change it it is necessary to have a strong urgency," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know it's: Brett was standing against it," Graham added, turning to Christine Blasey Ford.
‘No person giving it was able to verify it.
It's been 36 years.
I don't think anything will change."
What is the event of Global Citizen Festival and has contributed to a reduction in poverty at any rate?
The next Saturday in New York, the Global Citizen Festival will be held, the annual music events that can be admired by the impressive composition of the stars and the equally impressive mission — the eradication of poverty in the world.
The 7th Global Citizen Festival visits tens of thousands of people arriving at the Great Lawn Central Park to enjoy not only the events of stars such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to support the most important goal of this event, which is the liquidation of the 2030 year of extreme poverty.
The Global Citizen Festival, launched in 2012, is an expansion of the Global Poverty Project, an international group working on combating poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
In order to get free tickets for this event (if it was decided to buy a VIP ticket), the concert participants had to perform a number of tasks or "actions", such as volunteerism, e-mailing to world leaders, telephone execution or other significant actions that would help raise awareness about the purpose of poverty eradication.
But what success can the Global Citizen have in the next 12 years to achieve its goal?
Is the idea of awarding people free concert is a good way to convince them to demand action, or a further case called "clickivism", when people feel that they are doing something important by signing an online petition or by posting on Twitter?
The Global Citizen Organisation claims that since 2011, it has noted over 19 million "actions" of people supporting the action, reaching many different objectives.
It also claims that these actions have helped to encourage world leaders to announce commitments and regulations of more than $37 billion, which are expected to affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
By the beginning of 2018, the group had allocated 390 commitments and declarations resulting from its actions, which had already paid or financed at least $10 billion.
The Group estimates that the security measures have taken an immediate impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, the British partnership of investors and investors involved in "helping children achieve their full potential" which promised Rwanda to transfer $35 million to help eradicate malnutrition in that country, after Global Citizens posted over 4700 tweets.
"With the support of the British government, donors, national governments and members of Global Citizen, like you, we can make the social injustice that is not happening in history" — Tracey Ullman, Ambassador Power of Nutrition, during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The Group also said that after more than 5,000 activities called for by the United Kingdom to improve the quality of food for mothers and children, the government announced the financing of the Power of Nutrition project, which will reach up to 5 million women and children with food problems.
On one of the most frequently asked questions on its website, which said, "How can you be sure you can eliminate extreme poverty?",
The global reader replied in the following way: “It will be a long and hard way — at times we’ll get along and deal with defeat.
But just like in the case of the never-ending great moves on civil rights and the fight against apartheid, we will make success because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, the Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monae are among the stars that occur during the New York event that will be held by Debora-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use a war mariner for the Russian energy export blockade — Secretary of the Interior
Washington may "if necessary" run into his warship to prevent the influence of Russian energy on the markets, as well as those in the Middle East, revealed by the Secretary of the United States of America, Ryan Zinke — Washington Examiner.
Zinke maintained that Russia’s involvement in Syria — especially where it acts at the request of a legitimate government — is a prerequisite for the exploration of new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason why they are in the Middle East is the desire to intervene in energy trade, as it is in Eastern Europe," he said.
According to the official, there are ways and means to solve this problem.
"The United States of America on its warships has the opportunity to ensure that the seabed remains open and, if necessary, to create a blockade to ensure that their energy does not fall into the market," he said.
Zinke spoke to participants of an event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that identified itself as a "voice of energy consumer" in the United States.
He also compared Washington's approach to Russia and Iran, noting that they are actually the same.
"The economic option of Iran and Russia is less likely to use and replace fuels," he said, comparing Russia to "a single-scraper" with an economy based on fossil fuels.
These statements appeared when the Trupa administration continued its mission aimed at increasing the export of land-based gas to Europe — a much more advanced option for European consumers than Russian gas.
To this end, the authorities of the Corps Administration, including the President of the United States Donald Trump, are trying to convince Germany to break up with the "inappropriate" gas pipeline project Nord Stream 2, which according to the Turpa made Berlin "newer" Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that North Stream 2 gas pipelines worth 11 billion dollars, which will double the existing flow to 110 billion metres per year, are only an economic project.
Kremlin argues that the fires against Washington towards the implementation of this project are only for economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe that we share the view that energy cannot be a means of preventing pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers," said Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak after meeting with the Secretary of Energy of the United States of America Rick Perrym in September in Moscow.
The U.S. position has caused a violent reaction by Germany which has confirmed its commitment to the project.
The leading German industrial organisation, the German Federation of Industry (BDI), called on the United States to remain neutral in EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I think this is a big problem when a third country is ingesting our energy supplies," said Dieter Kempf, head of the German Industry Federation (BDI), after a recent meeting of Chancellor Angel Merkel, President of Russia, Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren, Senator Massachusetts, said he was considering the president's candidacy in 2020
Elizabeth Warren, Senator Massachusetts, said on Saturday that after mid-term elections she would consider the president's application.
At a meeting in Holyoke in Massachusetts Warren confirmed that she was considering her candidate.
"The time has come for women to go to Washington and repair the missing government. It is also about women who are in the highest position," she said, “The Hill.
"After 6 November I shall consider my candidate for the position of the President."
At Warren's meeting, she mentioned President Donald Trump, saying that he "will lead the country in the wrong direction".
"I am concerned about what Donald Trump is doing with our democracy," she said.
Warren without a garden voiced his criticism of the trumpet and his candidate to the Supreme Court, Bretta Kavanaugh.
On Friday, Warren wrote on Twitter: "Of course we need the FBI's investigation before the vote."
However, published on Thursday, the survey showed that most Warren voters do not think they should apply in 2020.
Fifty-eight per cent of choosers from Massachusetts choose the option "probably" said that the senator should not apply for the outcome of a survey conducted by the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent supported the candidate.
The survey showed more support for former Governor Deval Patrick’s candidate — 38 per cent supported his potential candidate and 48 per cent opposed it.
Other well-known names from the democratic defence team, with regard to the potential candidateship in 2020, were Vice-President Joe Biden and Senator Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he'd take the official decision to begin with, as the Associated Press said.
Sarah Palin says about the PTSD Track of Fire at the age of election Donald Trump
Track Palin (26 years old) spent the year in Iraq after he was drafted into the army in September.
On Monday night he was arrested and charged with domestic violence.
"What my own son has to go through after his return, I understand other families who feel the effects of PTSD and the wounds our soldiers return with," said the audience at the age of the election of Donald Trump in Tulsa in Oklahoma.
Palin called her son’s arrest “the subject of taboo”, after which she said of her son and other war veterans: “They return a little rest, they return to the wounded, they return, wondering whether they would be appreciated for what their military colleagues, planes and all the other members of the army had given their country. ”
He was arrested on Monday in Vasili in Alaska and charged with domestic violence against women, with having false reports of domestic violence and having a weapon in non-violent status, as did Dan Bennett, chief of the Vasili Police Department.
18 states and District of Colombia support the fight against a new asylum policy
Eighty states and the District of Colombia support the legal challenge for the new United States policy, which refuses to grant asylum to victims fleeing from gangs or domestic violence.
The representatives of 18 states and districts in Washington placed a list of friends in order to support the asylum seeker — according to the NBC News.
The full name of the call for Grace v. Sessions, which the American Civil Liberties Union organisation submitted in August against federal policy, was not disclosed.
She said her partner "and his brutal sons from the gang" were upset with her, but the U.S. officials rejected her asylum request on 20 July.
She was detained in Texas.
The prosecutors of the states supporting Grace described Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, where there is a large number of people seeking asylum in the United States as countries struggling with common problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new US asylum policy broke the 2014 Board of Immigration Appeals decision that allowed undocumented immigrants to flee from domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Karl Racine, Prosecutor General of the District of Colombia, said in a fifth statement that the new policy " ignores the tenties of state, federal and international law".
"The federal law requires that all asylum applications be discussed on the basis of specific facts and circumstances, and such a prohibition violates this principle," as stated in the list of friends curië.
The prosecutors further argued in the list that the policy to refuse immigration damages the United States economy, claiming that they can become entrepreneurs and "make the necessary labour force".
In June, the Prosecutor General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to stop the administration of asylum for victims of domestic violence and gangs.
“Azil is available to those who leave their country of origin because of persecution or fear on the ground of racial, religious, national or social or other political convictions,” said the Sessions in their statement of 11 June on asylum policy.
He never intended to solve all the problems — even those of serious concern — that people from all over the world are fighting each day.
Desperate rescue tests in Palu in a situation where the number of victims of death doubled to the point of finding ovals
For the general situation, it has become more and more tragic.
"It's a very intense feeling," said 35-year-old mother, Risa Kusuma, pushing her hot son to the center of the evacuation in Palu.
"With one minute the ambulance will import the body.
There's no clean water."
The inhabitants were seen returning to destroyed houses searching for water and trying to save everything they could find.
In the early years, hundreds of people were injured by earthquakes of 7.5 degrees.
Some wounded, including Two Haris, who had suffered from spinal cord fractures and seizures, rest outside the military hospital in Palu, where patients were treated outside because of severe second strokes.
His eyes filled with tears as he spoke of a violent earthquake that shook the room at the fifth hotel he shared with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save.
I think I've been impressed by the Romanian wall," Haris said Associated Press, adding that his family came to the city for a wedding.
“I heard my wife calling for help after her voice stopped.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they're safe."
Ambassador of the United States charges China with "injurious" propaganda.
A week after the official Chinese newspaper posted a four-page commercial in the U.S. newspaper, which praised the mutual benefits of the US-China trade, the United States Ambassador in China accused Beijing of using American pears to spread propaganda.
The president of the United States, Donald Trump, in the middle of the run-off, referred to China’s Daily Addendum in Des Moines Register — the most popular newspaper in Iowa — accusing China of attempting to enter into the U.S. Congress on November 6th — that China is against this price.
As a result of Pekin's attempt to enter the U.S. elections, he confirmed what the U.S. officials told the Reuters agency that this was a new stage in the campaign by Washington aimed at producing press in China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to place commercial advertising with their countries, Beijing and Washington are currently leading to a scale of trade war which has led to the rise of tariffs on imports.
China’s oil tariffs at the beginning of the trade war had to touch exporters in such states as Iowa, which supported the Republican Party — the Chinese and US experts said.
Terry Branstad, Ambassador of the United States of China, who was a long-term governor of state of Iowa, the main exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing had been dealing with American workers, farmers and businessmen.
Branstad stated in an article in the Sunday edition of Des Moines Register that China "now with double force is beginning to drown, placing propaganda advertising in our own free press".
"In view of its propaganda, the government of China is benefiting from a so-called American tradition of freedom of speech and free of speech, placing a pay advertising in the Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
For this, there will be no votes against in the streets of Beijing and no real reflection of the various opinions that the Chinese may have on the disturbing economic direction of China, bearing in mind that the media are under the strong control of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of the most famous Chinese newspapers refused to publish" his article, although he did not say which newspaper.
The Republics appear before the mid-term elections of women with the right to vote by the Kavanaugh case, warning analysts
While many of the Republicans support the arms and weapons appointed to the Supreme Court of Great Britain in the light of several appeals for sexual assault on the ground, the analysis warns that members meet you during the upcoming mid-term elections with a strong response, especially by women.
The economies accompanying this event are very large, and most Republicans want to vote officially.
"This can't be repeated," said Grant Reeher, professor of political science at Maxwell School at the University of Syracuse on Saturday.
Reeher said there is doubt as to whether Senator Jeff Flake (Arisona)'s efforts to conduct a recent investigation by the FBI are sufficient to calm all the voters.
“Women will not forget what happened yesterday – they will not forget this morning and will not forget it until November,” said Karine Jean-Pierre, the senior consultant and national lecturer of the MoveOn progressive group, as reported in Washington.
On Friday morning, protestors were protesting the title "The Day of November", demonstrating in the Senate the decision of the Republicans controlling the Commission on the non-compliance with the appointment of Kavanaugh despite the statements of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, as Mic gave.
"The level of democratic enthusiasm and motivation is beyond the scale," said one of the information pages Stu Rothenberg, a free political analyst.
“People say it was already high — and it’s true.
But it may be higher, especially among undecided women and young voters from 18 to 29 years of age who, although they do not like the president, often do not vote."
Before the public opinion, the analysts suggested that if the Republic decided to approve the candidacy, it could be met with a violent response.
"The Republican Party must fight with a small bacon," said Michael Steele, president of the Republican National Committee, at the beginning of last week, as told by NBC News.
"It is not only about the vote of the Commission or the final vote or whether Kavanaugh will be elected, it is also about the way the Republic has dealt with this situation and how they have treated Ford," said Guy Cecil, US Director of Priorities, a group that helps in the election of Democrats.
However, the Americans seem to be divided into something to believe in Ford and Kavanaugh's opinions, while there is something more to support.
The new YouGov survey shows that 41 per cent of respondents had either decided or rather believed in Ford's statements, while 35 per cent claimed that they had or did not believed in Kavanaugh's statements.
In addition, 38% of respondents said that Kavanaugh was either likely to have lied during the hearing, while only 30% said it was for Ford.
After the Flake's press, the FBI launched an investigation into the charges issued by Ford, as well as at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez — according to The Guardian.
Ford admitted last week under an oath before the Senate of the Court of Justice that Kavanaugh had attacked her by alcohol at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that the appointed Supreme Court showed her her genitalia during her studies at Yale University in the 1980s.
The World Wide Web network is planning to launch a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook platforms.
Tim Berners-Lee, the founder of the World Wide Web network, runs a startup that competes with Facebook, Amazon and Google platforms.
Inrupt is the latest technology legend project based on a platform of open source – Solid – owned by Berners-Lee.
Solid allows users to choose where their data are stored and which persons have access to specific information.
In his report on the exception for Fast Company Berners-Lee, he argued that Inrupt’s purpose is “to dominate the world”.
"We have to do this now," he said, referring to the beginning.
"A historic moment has come."
The application uses Solid platform technology to enable people to create their own "internet store with personal data" or other POD.
It can include contact lists, list of things to do, calendar, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are available in one browser at the same time.
The unique feature of the internet store with personal data is that it depends entirely on the user who has access to the information.
The company calls it "a personal improvement through data".
According to company president John Bruce, the idea Inrupt is to provide resources, processes and appropriate skills to help make solid platforms available to all people.
Currently, Berners-Lee, Bruce, is part of the company's security platform purchased by IBM, several developers employed in the project and the community of volunteer programmers.
Since this week, technology manufacturers around the world have been able to create their own decentralised applications using tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are not talking to “Facebook and Google about whether to make a complete change which from day to day causes the return to the top of all their business models.
"I don't ask them for permission."
In a paper published on the Berners-Lee platform on Saturday, he wrote that "the mission of Inrupt is to provide trade and ecosystem energy to help protect the integrity and quality of the new network built on the Solid platform".
In 1994, Berners-Lee changed the Internet when it set up the World Wide Web Consortium at the Institute of Technology in Massachusetts.
In recent months Berners-Lee has been very involved in the debate on network neutrality.
Calling on Inrupt Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, Web Foundation and Open Data Institute.
"I am extremely undercitizened, thinking of the next era in network development," added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: The spiritual designation of the Victoria Cross during World War I
The memory of the only spiritual Church of England, which in the time of World War I was marked by the Victoria Cross, was celebrated 100 years later in its home city.
The noble family Bernard Vann was appointed on 29 September 1918 to be born in Bellenglish and Lehacourt.
He was killed by a sniper four days later, never knowing he was appointed by the highest British military order.
On Saturday, his two grandsons sent stones to commemorate during a parade in Rushden in Northamptonshire.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said that the release of the stone exactly in the sixth anniversary of his grandfather's appointment was “extremely symbolic. ”
According to London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, the Vann carried his battalion through the Saint-Quentin Canal "in a very thick milk and under a strong shot from the field and machine guns".
He then rushed to the fire line and led her to the “most revamp” after one attack on the position of the field, replacing three of them.
The tribe of Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 — more than a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann (72 years old) said that his grandfather's actions were "something I'd never give up on but something humble."
Along with his brother, Dr. James Vanne, he presented the wedding after the end of the parade conducted by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he felt "very honored, able to participate in the paradise" and added that "the glory of the true rich man is reflected in the support he receives from many people."
The MMA fans didn't sleep all night to watch Bellator 206, instead they got the Pepp Svenk.
Imagine that you haven't slept all night looking at the packed emotions of Bellator 206 and finally couldn't see the main battle.
The program in San Jose may have included 13 battles, including six on the main map, and was shown alive at night in Great Britain on Channel 5.
At 6:00 a.m., when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for the battle, the views in Great Britain were shocked by the change in the program to Svynk Peppa.
Some were disappointed when they didn't sleep in the early hours of the morning especially after seeing this fight.
One of the fans on Twitter described the use of a child's shirt as "some kind of sick joke".
"In accordance with the government's regulation, it is inappropriate to leave it at 6:00 a.m., so as to change the programme for children," said Dave Schwartz, senior marketing and communication vice president of the Belator organisation when asked about transmission.
"Pep's pig, yes."
The president of Bellator's organization, Scott Cooker, said they're working on harmony to take into account the future views of Britain.
"When I think about the situation again, I think we can fix it," said Cooker.
"But it is Saturdays six mornings, so that we will not be able to resist it until Sunday according to our time, and on the Monday according to their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when a change of program occurred, we were covered by a mass of comments that no one had ever heard of.
We were trying to fix it... we thought it was a technical strength.
But it wasn't just a matter of law.
I can promise that this situation will no longer happen again.
We're going to limit the program to five wars rather than six — to the standard amount.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt " worse" because of sexuality
Tom Daley, an Olympic water jumper, says he grew up feeling worse than anyone else because of his sexuality, but it gave him reason to succeed.
At the age of 24, he said he didn't think that everyone wasn't like him until he went to high school.
In the Desert Island Discs program Radio 4 conducted by Lauren Laverne said he was talking about gay rights to give another "I hope".
He also said that being a parent had made him less involved in winning the Olympics.
The usual driver of this broadcast program, Kirsty Young, has taken several months off due to the disease.
Speaking in the program for the first time conducted by Laverne, Daley said that growing up, he felt “lower” than others because “the love of boys and girls at the same time was not socially acceptable”.
He said: “To this day it is a feeling of low value and being different is something that gives me the strength to deal with success. ”
He said he wanted to prove it's "something worth" so he wouldn't disappoint everyone when they finally found out about his sexuality.
A double-track Olympic medalist has become a popular LGBT society and has used his performance on the annual Games of the League of Nations in Australia to attract more countries to criminalize homosexuality.
He said he was going to express himself because he felt happy, able to live an open life without any implications, and wanted to give another "hope" in this way.
Three times the world's master said that his love for a man — American filmer Dustin Lance Black, who met him in 2013 — “was shocked. ”
Daley went with Oscar's recipient (who is 20 years old) last year, pointing out that this age difference had never been a problem for him.
"When you're going through so many years of age," he meant his first 14 - year - old Olympic and his father's death because of cancer three years later, he said that it was difficult for him to find anyone at that same age who had experienced similar injuries and accidents.
The couple stayed in June with a boy's parents named Robert Ray Black-Daley.
"It was most important for me last year to get a gold medal," he said.
“And you know what? These are more important things than the Olympic gold medals.
My gold medal is Robbie."
His son bears the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after his brain cancer.
Dale said that his father did not accept that he was dying, and one of the last things he asked about was whether he had tickets to the Olympics in London in 2012 — he wanted to have a place in the first round.
“I couldn’t tell him, ‘You won’t be with us to be first, Dad’” he said.
"I held him in my hand when he stopped breathing, and just when he stopped breathing and died, I realized that he wasn't upset," he said.
The following year Daley participated in the 2012 Olympic Games and won the race.
“ I knew that this was what I had been dreaming about for the rest of my life — to jump into the water before the crowd at the Olympic Games — it was the best feeling possible, ” he said.
It also inspired him to choose the first song — Proud in Heather Small — which accompanied him in preparation for the Olympic Games and which continues to prepare him for a serious score.
The Desert Island Discs program is broadcast at BBC Radio 4 every Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Displaying no Mickelson form on the keyboard during the Ryder Cup Saturday part
American Phil Mickelson will set up a record on Sunday when it's on his 47th game in Ryder Cup, but he'll have to work on his form so she doesn't print his five.
Mickelson, who played twice during the two-year event, was sent to the hunt by Captain Jim Furyka at the time of Saturday's fourball and foursome games.
Instead of being in the centre of action, as was often the case in his case in the United States team, the five-fold main winner had to spend the day on teaming and work on improving his game in order to correct the causes of his launch.
48th-year-old who never gave up the most simple attacks, even at the moment of his career, he needs to check well on the dark field of Le Golf National, where the wrong attacks are inevitably caused by long-distance roughs.
And if the field itself is not enough to discourage Mickelsson, in the ninth game on Sunday he has to put the precision of the winner of the British Open — Frances Molinari, who has joined forces with Debt Tom Fleetwood to win all four games this week.
If America (with the loss of four points at the beginning of 12 singles) starts a game with a worm, the game Mikkelson may be extremely key.
Furik expressed confidence in his employer — he could do nothing else.
"He fully understood his current role, put me in my back, held my hand and said he'd be ready tomorrow," Furyk said.
"He's very sure of himself.
He's in the famous gallery, and he's got a lot of his teams in the past as well as this week.
I didn't think he was playing two games.
I thought it'd be more of them, but that's what happened and we had to do it.
He wants to play all the time, just like everyone else."
Mickelson's gonna beat Nick Faldo's record about the Ryder Cup games played on Sunday.
It could mean the end of his career in Ryder Cup, which never compared him to his individual achievement.
Mickelson has 18 winnings, 20 winnings and seven remixes, and Furyk said his presence had led to a lot of team.
"It's fun, sardistic, funny, funny and good to have it in the group room," he explained.
"I think young players played well with him this week, which was nice to see.
He's asking for more than I'm playing."
European team captain Thomas Bjorn knows that the great emphasis on points can be short-lived
Thomas Bjorn, the European team captain, knows from experience that a significant push before the start of the single on the last day of Ryder Cup can easily turn into a difficult mess.
In 1997, he was awarded a prize in the field of Valderram, where with his companion Deputy Captain Seven Ballesteros, he had five points over the Americans, but the year line had passed as short as possible, winning 1411⁄2-131/2.
"I can't forget that we had a great drive to the Valderram field; we also had a great drive to the Brooklyn field where we lost, and in the case of the Valderram field we just won the hair," said Bjorn, in the picture, after winning 5-3 Class of 2018 both on Friday and yesterday, which gave 10-6 on the Le Golf National field.
Time will show me and all members of the team that it's not over yet.
You're giving it all to yourself tomorrow.
Go out there and do everything you can.
The end will be only when the points appear on the table.
We have the goal of getting tropheum, and we need to concentrate on it.
I said from the beginning that I am a group of 12 players who are on our side, but we also know who people are on the opposite side -- the best players in the world."
Bjorn, who was impressed by the way his colleagues moved into a difficult field, added: “I wouldn’t do that better.
But tomorrow is something else.
They're starting to be single tomorrow, and that's another question.
It's good to play with a partner when everything goes right, but when you play in one, your golf skills are tested to the limit of the possibility.
It's a message you need to send to players, it's to give you everything tomorrow.
A partner must also give everything to himself."
Jim Furyk, in contrast to Bjorna, will expect his colleagues to achieve better results in one than during the game with his partner, except Jordan Spietha and Justin Thomas, who won three out of four points.
Sam Furyk experienced a great return to action on the last day as a member of the victory team on the Brooklyn field, after which he won the victory after the European Group had done "a miracle on the Medina field".
"I remember every word," he said in response to the question, how Captain Ben Crenshaw, in 1999, was engaged in fighting his lawyers on the last day.
“In the morning we play 12 important games – you would like to start the game at a fast pace as it took place in the fields of Brooklyn and Medina.
If this foot goes on one side, it'll cause a lot of pressure on the middle of the game.
We set up our composition and set up boys in a way that would allow us to start tomorrow."
Thomas has been entrusted with the task of carrying out the contract by putting Rory McIlroy's heart in the main game, as well as Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter — other European team staff members in the full half of the programme.
"I decided on this group of guys in this future, because I think it's going to work out during the whole game," Bjorn said about his choices on a single basis.
New German warships are back late
The latest German warship flag should be issued for use in 2014 to replace the ageing rounds of war from the cold war, but this will not occur until at least next year in view of the fragile conditions and rising in fear of the cost – as local media have given.
The use of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", a major turn of the new Baden-Wuerttenberg class, was transferred to the first half of 2019, as the newspaper Die Zeit put it, referring to the words of the military chief.
The ship should be included in the warship in 2014, but as a result of the problems arising after delivery, it was necessary to amend this ambitious project.
Four units of the Baden-Wuertemberg class, ordered by a war mariner in 2007, will replace the old Bremen class frigates.
Of course, they will be equipped with powerful action, a number of anti-foul and anti-foul pressures, as well as technological solutions that enable detection, including reduction of radar, sub-red and acoustic traces.
Other important features include longer conservation periods — the operation of new frigates should be possible for even two years from parental ports.
However, continued delays indicate that these modern war zones, which will enable Germany to respond to situations beyond its borders, will be advanced at the time of the start of the service, notes Die Zeit.
The F125 unfortunate frigate appeared on the first pages of the newspaper last year when it was a German warship who officially refused the ship to operate and returned it to the Blohm & Voss warehouse in Hamburg.
It was the first time the warlord returned the ship to the port after delivery.
There were few reports of reasons behind the return, but the German media reported on a series of key "software and equipment damages" that made them useless in the war mission.
In particular, there were software defects as Baden-Wuertemberg ships are to be served by a crew of about 120 sailors, or less than half of them in the case of older Bremen class frigates.
It has also been shown that the ship is too heavy, which reduces its achievement and limits its ability to carry out the warship of future modernization.
It is considered that a significant 7,000 tonnes of Rhineland-Pfalz is twice as heavy as similar ships used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to heavy equipment, the problem is also the cost of the entire project — including training for the Foundation.
It is said that it reached an estimated level of EUR 3.1 billion (USD 3.6 billion), while the initial cost was EUR 2.2 billion.
The problems with the use of new frigates are particularly important in the light of the latest warnings that the German fleet's force is being sucked.
At the beginning of this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament Defence Commission, admitted that mariners "have completed ships capable of use".
He also said that this problem in time had increased as a result of the removal of old units from operation without the security of replacement ships.
In addition, he expressed his discontent with the fact that none of the Baden-Wuertemberg class frigate could be included in the Navy fleet.
National Trust Listens to the Secret Life of Netoperity
New studies carried out in the field of possession in the highlands are aimed at showing how the country is not being exploited when it receives food.
It is expected that the results of the studies will shed new light on the behaviour of these exceptional flying bags and will help to focus future actions on their protection.
The research carried out by researchers from National Trust for Scotland will involve political and small boycotts, as well as bravado bats with long ears and nostalgia from the families of the Ruddens in Inverwe Gardens in Western Ross.
In key locations around the holdings, special registries will be placed to monitor the activity of netoperase throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also carry out field studies using portable detectors.
The audio analysis of all records shall be carried out to determine the frequency of signals sent by netoperase and the way in which individual species are kept.
The seating map and the report will then be developed to create a detailed picture of their country-wide behaviour.
Rob Dewar, a Nature Protection Advisor in NTSC, hopes that the results will reveal which areas of the habitat are the most important for non-topers and how they are used by each of the species.
This information will help to identify the benefits of plant management-related work, such as the creation of leaves, as well as the best way to maintain forest areas for non-topers and other related species.
The population of non-tolerance in Scotland and throughout Great Britain has decreased significantly over the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development work that has an impact on crops and waste of crops.
Air turbines and lighting installations may also pose a threat, such as soft dust and some chemical agents used in construction materials and even domestic cats.
However, they're not really blind.
However, due to nighttime habits, their ears are more helpful than their eyes are getting caught.
They use the complex eco-location technique to search for jobs and obstacles on their way.
The NTS, which is responsible for the care of over 270 residential buildings, 38 important gardens and 76 000 hectares of land throughout the country, is treated very seriously.
It consists of ten trained experts who regularly carry out research, field control, and sometimes even military operations.
The organization even established the first and only reserve of non-territory in the territory of Drave in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of the 10 Scotch Cats of Netoper.
David Thompson, the owner of the property, says she's for an ideal territory.
"Threave has a wonderful area for non-toperity," he said.
“We have old buildings, a lot of old trees, and sign a settlement.
However, there are still many unknowns in this area. The work we do here and in other properties will help us better understand what they need in order to develop."
It underlines the importance of monitoring the extent to which there is a lack of access to conservation work in the holdings, since the accidental destruction of one grain can kill up to 400 Sami and young people, which can lead to the disappearance of the entire local population.
They are protected — either by killing them, by beating them or by attacking them, or by destroying their village.
Elizabeth Ferrell, Scottish officer Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged public opinion to help.
She said: "We still have a lot to learn about our problems, and we don't even know how their populations are doing."
Ronaldo rejects the charges of violence, while his lawyers intend to call the German magazine
Christian Ronaldo has defined charges against him regarding violence as “fake news, ” saying that people “want to promote themselves, ” using his name.
His lawyers are going to call the German intelligence magazine Der Spiegel, which published these statements.
The Portuguese attacker Juventus was charged with rape of an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in the hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
According to the fifth report, Der Spiegel was supposed to pay a woman $375 000 for the silent treatment.
Ronaldo (33 years old), a few hours after the announcement of appeals, in an introductory life transfer to his 142 million followers, identified these references as "fake news".
“No, no, no, no, no.
Today's delivery is fake news," said a five-time gold bullet winner.
“They want to promote themselves using my name.
Nothing new.
They want to be famous by saying my name, but it's part of my job.
I'm happy and everything's fine," added the gunman with smile on his lips.
Lawyer Ronaldo prepares to call Der Spiegel’s magazine on the names that have called “an unacceptable communication of suspicions in the field of privacy” – as Reuters puts it.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said that the prosecutor would be demanding compensation for “the moral damage in the amount corresponding to the amount of damage that is likely to be one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years”.
In June 2009, it had to be located in the hotel room Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After a meeting at the night club, Ronaldo and Mayorga likewise went to the shooting room where they were said to have raped a woman anal — as a result of documents filed at the local court Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Majorga says that after the river came down, Ronaldo fell on his knees and told her that "99 percent is a good guy", which was visited by that "one percent".
According to Ronaldo's documentation, he confirmed that the couple had been having sex, but it was a general agreement.
Maorga also claims that she went to the police and took pictures of her injuries in the hospital, but later she agreed to a constitutional agreement because "she was afraid of death" and "public humiliation".
34-year-old says he wants to make an agreement right now because he can't forget about the river entrance.
During the alleged attack, Ronaldo moved from Manchester United to Real Madrid, and this year he moved to Juventus after paying for his amount of EUR 100 million.
Brexit: Great Britain "after all the time it would regret" leaving car manufacturers
Britain's "will regret it all the time" if after leaving the European Union it lost the status of the world leader in the production of cars, Business Minister Greg Clark said.
He added that "he was concerned" when the representative of Toyota UK reported to the BBC that if Britain leaves the EU without agreement, production in the factory in Burnaston would soon be suspended in Derby.
"We need an agreement," said Clark.
The representative of the Japanese car manufacturer said that the effects of delays on borders in the absence of an agreement on Brexit could lead to reduced jobs.
The factory in Burnaston, where the Auris and Aventis models are produced, produced nearly 150 000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the other European Union countries.
"I think that if Britain comes out at the end of March from the European Union without agreement, there will be a stop of production in our factory," said Marvin Cooke, director of Toyota's company in Burnaston.
Other British car manufacturers are afraid of leaving the EU without agreement on how to operate cross-border trade, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW intends to close its Mini car factory in Oxford months after Brexisia.
The main concerns are, as car manufacturers say, the risks associated with the chain of supply in the case of leaving the European Union by Britain without agreement.
Toyoty's production line operates on a "just-in-time" basis, within which parts reach 37 minutes from suppliers both in Britain and in the EU in the case of vehicles produced on the contract.
If the United Kingdom leaves the EU without agreement on 29 March, it may face difficulties at the border, which, according to industry representatives, may lead to delays and disadvantages.
As the company's representative said, Toyota would not be able to keep more than one day without delivery to his factory in Derbyshire, which would stop production.
Clark said that the Chechers Theresy May plan on future EU relations is "expertly designed to avoid border controls".
"We need agreements. We want to achieve the best possible agreements that will not only enable us to enjoy the present success but also allow us to make the right use of this situation," said BBC Radio 4.
“Not only Toyota’s statements, but other producers will testify that we must be able to continue what has been a very fair set of delivery chains.”
The representative of Toyoty was unable to determine how long production would be stopped, but he warned that in the longer term additional costs would reduce the company's competitiveness leading to employment reduction.
Peter Tsouvallaris, a 24-year-old member of the Union's Association Board, said that members of the association are increasingly concerned: “From experience, I know that if it comes to the liquidation of the workplace, they will never be returned.
The government spokesman said: "We have presented a precise and reliable plan for our future relations with the European Union."
The meeting with Rosensteine can be delayed as you give the White House
An important meeting of Donald Trump with the deputy prosecutor General Rod Rosenstein may be "retired next week" due to an ongoing battle of candidate to the Supreme Court of Bretta Kavanaugh, as he did on Sunday in the White House.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller, who investigates the possibility of Russia's interference in the elections, the link between the close staff of Trupa and Russia and the potential challenge to the measure of justice by the President.
Whether Trump will release the Deputy Prosecutor General, threatening the same independence of Mueller, has been a hot topic in Washington since the month.
At the beginning of this month's New York Times reported that Rosenstein spoke about hearings in order to record talks with Trump, as well as the possibility of removing the president from his position on the basis of Amendment 25.
Rosenstein's been here for a while.
Last Monday, however, he went to the White House in the form of supplies, such as a dynamism.
The deadline for the meeting with Trump, who was currently in UN headquarters in New York, was scheduled for Thursday.
The troops said they would not release Rosenstein. A meeting was scheduled to be held to avoid colliding with the hearing of a senate judicial committee during which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual abuse, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
On Friday, Trump conducted a weekly FBI study on charges against Kavanaugh, which further delayed the vote in Senate.
The trumpeter Sarah Sanders appeared on Sunday at Fox News station.
When asked about her meeting with Rosenstein, she replied: “The deadline for this meeting has not yet been set, it may take place this week and may be moved over the next week, taking into account all events related to the Supreme Court.
We'll see. I'm sure I'll inform you about this."
Several journalists questioned this claim: Sanders did not hold a press conference on the White House on September 10.
The chairman of the program, Chris Wallace, asked why.
Sanders said that a small number of empty conferences were not caused by the lack of "sustaining" TV journalists, which added: "I will not hide that they are "sustaining".
She then suggested that direct contact between the Trump and that they should be increased.
"The Vice-President is holding more "question and Answer" sessions than any other President before him," she said, adding, without giving evidence: "We met with numbers".
The press conferences will continue to take place, Sanders said, but "if journalists have the opportunity to ask the President of the United States directly, that is much better than talking to me.
We are trying to do this regularly, and in the last few weeks we have been doing it very often, and the press conferences will be held at a session where we can talk directly to the President of the United States."
The team regularly answers questions when leaving the White House or participating in open sessions or free conferences with host dignitaries.
Solving press conferences are rare.
This week in New York, the president may have demonstrated why he is so, acting so freely and sometimes surprisingly before the massed journalists.
Minister for Health letters to workers from European Union countries employed in NHS Scotland in the form of Brexit-related concerns
The Minister for Health used a letter to workers from the European Union who were employed in the health service in order to express their appreciation to them from the country and to ask them not to leave for Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter less than six months before the end of the Great Britain from the European Union.
The Scots Board has already committed itself to cover the costs of examining applications for ‘setled status’ for EU citizens working in decentralised public services.
Freeman wrote in his list: “In the year the negotiations on Britain’s exit from the European Union continued, and appropriate decisions will be taken in the autumn of this year.
The British court also intensified the preparation of a possible exit scenario without agreement.
I know it's a very disturbing period for you all.
That is why I wanted to repeat once again how much I appreciate the contribution of each member of the staff, regardless of his nationality.
Colleges from across the EU and beyond provide valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health services and benefit the patients and societies we serve.
The boat is your home and we really want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie undergoes surgery due to head injury
The group of Tennessee State Tigers, Christion Abercrombie, passed the operation due to a head injury on Saturday with Vanderbilt Commodores, which ended up defeating the Tennessee team with 31-27, reported Mike Organ.
Rod Reed, Chief Trainer of the Tennessee State, told the journalist that the lawyer had received an injury shortly before the end of the first half.
"He went to the side line, after which he moved on the ground," Reed said.
Trainers and medical personnel gave Abercrombies a backline, after which they placed it on their noses and carried out further studies.
The representative of Tennessee State told Chris Harris of the WSMV in Nashville (Tennessee) that Abercrombie was operated at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there are no details about the type/size of the injury" and Tennessee State is trying to establish when the accident occurred.
Abercrombie (a student of the second year released from high school per year to teach his skills) is playing his first season in the Tennessee State after his transfer from Illinois.
On Saturday before the end of the game, he had five cheeses, which gives him 18 cheeses throughout the season.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher charge on the purchase of real estate in Great Britain
In accordance with the new foreign-producing tax plans, higher fees for the purchase of real estate in Britain will be calculated. This way the funds will be used for home care.
This is the reason why Jeremy Corbina's actions aimed at attracting the young electorate have been successful.
The higher fees will include persons who do not pay taxes in Great Britain.
The Ministry of Customs provides that it will thus earn even 120 million pounds per year for home care.
Theresa May reports today that foreign buyers of real estate in Great Britain will be charged a higher charge and that additional measures will be made to help the homeless.
This move is taken as an attempt to eliminate Jeremy Corbina's efforts to attract the young electorate to the promises of dance homes and to increase the burden of the more deprived.
High charges will be imposed by individuals and non-tax companies in the United Kingdom. Additional measures will help the government in combating homelessness.
The additional fee — calculated in addition to the current current charge, including the two years ago higher rates for other houses and rental housing — may amount to three per cent.
The government's cost is expected to allow this move to get even 120 million pounds per year.
It is estimated that 13 per cent of the newly built property in London is purchased by residents of other countries, leading to a rise in prices and difficulties in purchasing the first house or apartment.
Since many foreigners buy property and most of their time is spent abroad, many regions — especially the capital — have become “the city of spirits. ”
The new rules come in just a few weeks after Boris Johnson's call for a reduction in the cost, which would help young people to buy the first house.
He accused large developers of maintaining high prices of real estate by taking the land, but not using it. He also called on Prime Minister May to remove the limits of such dwellings in order to eliminate the “dwelling scandal” in Great Britain.
Jeremy Corbyn announced a series of attractive housing reforms, including regulation of actions and the end of the "no reason" issue.
He also wants to give local authorities more power to build new houses.
Theresa May said: “In the past year, I said that as a prime minister, I was engaged in the reconstruction of a British marriage so that every generation would be better off than before.
It also means improving our attractive housing market.
Great Britain will always be open to people who want to live here, work and build their lives.
However, it is not okay that people who do not live here, as well as foreign companies, can afford to buy here things that are difficult to work for British residents.
For too many people, the marriage of their own home has become very distant, and this pollution related to the need to stay on the street is still real."
Jack Ross: "My biggest ambition is to be a Scotch Selection"
Sunderland team coach Jack Ross says his "most ambition" is to be a Scottish elector at some point.
This 40-year-old Skot is involved in the healing of the North-East club, which currently takes up a third place in League One with a three-point loss compared to the best team.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this year after he introduced St. Mirren to the Scottish Premiership last season.
"I wanted to represent my country as a trader,
But I was able to get to the B framework," Ross said in his report to BBC Scotland's Sports Sound.
“As a child, I watched with my father the game of Schkoci in Hampden, and it always touched me.
However, this option will only come under the condition that I will be successful as a club coach."
Among the leaders of Rossa at the position of trainer Sunderland were Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardice, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyt and Paulo Di Canio.
Former coach Alla Athletic says he doesn't feel embarrassed by taking part in such prominent personalities in such a large club, rejecting previously proposals from Barnesley and Ipswich Town.
“I will probably be able to see whether I will be able to bring this club back to Premier League.
Taking into account his structure and the satisfaction he has, there is no doubt his place" — he adds.
"It won't be easy to do this, but I'm sure I've been successful here only if I'm successful."
The career of coach Rossa has been only three years. He has been a trainer assistant in Dumbarton and has been part of the Hearts training team for 15 months.
Then he helped Alla to make progress again after graduating into the third league, and in the next season he brought St. Mirren out of the fall into the master's title.
Jack Ross says he feels much more comfortable now than when he played at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"It was a real turning point," recalled the position of Coach Alla.
“I really believed that running a team is much better for me than playing.
It's funny because I've been born as a professional, I've been very busy and I've achieved some great success.
But it's a heavy piece of bread.
Every week you have to change through different situations.
They still meet me when it comes to stress and pressure related to trainer work, but I feel good about this role.
I've always wanted to train others, and now I'm doing it. I can say that I feel the most at the moment in my adult life."

Studies show that the best time for beer is 17.30 a.m. on Saturday.
The summer’s wave of fire caused a strong pressure of customers to British pubs, but it turned out to be a shock in the restaurants.
Studies showed that in July sales in pubs and bars increased by 2.7%, but restaurants fell by 4.8%.
Peter Martin, of the CGA consulting company that developed the data, says: “The ever-increasing and longer-than-expected part of England in the World's Monetary Union resulted in similar redouts from July when it grew by 2.8 per cent, with the difference that restaurants were even more low.
The 1.8% drop in sales in restaurants in June has increased further.
The offer of beer and beer gave them the best choice — their sales growth was higher than the downs in restaurants.
Pubs serving food also suffered during the summers, although not as much as restaurant owners.
It looks like people were just beaten up.
The sales of alcohol in managed pubs and bars increased by 6.6 per cent this month, and food fell by three per cent".
Paul Newman of the RSM analysis of the entertainment and tourism industry says: “These results are part of the trend that we have observed since the end of April.
The most important factors affecting consumption 'outside the house' remain the weather and major sports or social events.
The fact that restaurants are experiencing difficult times is not surprising, although the decline in sales of 4.8 per cent compared with the previous year will have a particularly relevant impact if it takes into account the constant cost-reduction pressure.
The long and burning years have come at the least beneficial moment for local food and time owners to show whether any more moderate temperatures that we had in August will bring such necessary relief."
The joint increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, taking into account these new open ones, was 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting the slowdown in the development of marques.
Coffer Peach Tracker, which is involved in monitoring sales in the pubs, bars and restaurants sector in Great Britain, collects and analyzes data on the efficiency of 47 operating groups with total turnover of over 9 billion pounds. It is a recognised industry standard.
One in five children has a secret account in social media that is hidden from parents
Studies have shown that one in five children — some only 11 years of age — have a secret account in social networks that covers parents and teachers
An survey of 20 thousand elementary school students showed an increase in the number of "fake Insta" sites.
These people have agreed that they have sex content published on them
Twenty percent of students said they have a "main" account that shows parents
One for five children — some only 11 years of age — put an account on social networks that do not reveal to adults.
An survey of some 20,000 elementary school students showed a rapid increase in the number of "fake Insta" accounts — a name for the Instagram service in which photos can be shared.
They were concerned that these accounts were used to publish content about sex.
Twenty per cent of students admitted that they were conducting a broken "main" account that shows parents, and they also had a private account.
One of the mothers, who happened to be on the secret side of her 13 - year - old daughter, met a teenager who told others to “get raped. ”
The study carried out in independent schools by the Digital Avariness UK Agency and the Headmasters" and HeadMistles" Conference (HMC) showed that 40 per cent of students aged 11 to 18 are carrying out two profiles. Half of them are allocated to maintaining private accounts.
HMC Association President Mike Buchanan says: “It is disturbing that so many teenagers create their own places online where parents and teachers cannot find them.”
Elih Doyle will become "a voice of athletes" in the Scottish Athletics administration
During the annual general meeting of the Scottish Athletics Elidh Doyle, he was elected to the board as an executive director.
Elidh Doyle is the most popular chocolate. President Ian Beattie has identified it as a perfect opportunity for people who manage sports to benefit from her rich international experience that she has gained in the last decade.
“It is a great respect for Scottish, British and World Lekoatelet society and we are confident that its introduction to the government will bring great benefits to the Scotch Lekoattie,” Beattie said.
Doyle said: “I am very glad that I will have the opportunity to deliver the board of athletes, and I hope I can really help in managing the sport in Scotland.”
The American who, among his four gold medals of Olympic gold, won 200 and 400 metres on the Olympics in Atlanta in 1996, and is now regularly in the BBC as an expert, cannot succeed in a bloodless attack.
He wrote on Twitter: “A month ago I had a stroke.
I couldn't go.
The doctors said it'll show me how much time I'll get back to reality and how much.
It was a hard work, but I was completely healed, I learned to walk again and I got back to training!
Thank you for all the words of support!"
The advertising of lactators that compares mothers to blood arouses strong emotions on the Internet
The factory producing lactating plant has launched an online competition by publishing a commercial that compares breast-feeding mothers to blood.
In order to announce the introduction into the market of “the first silent lactator to wear under protection”, Elvie’s producer published a comical advertising in the form of a television that emphasizes the freedom he provides for his mother.
It presents the four real mothers dancing in a full-fledged dance to the creature in which they hear the words: "Yes, I hope, but don't see the fire" and "If you didn't notice, it doesn't just change my tits."
Refren goes on to say: "Drop them, throw them, feed them, feed them, throw them, throw them out, I hope my lord."
The advertising that was published on the facebook page of the company caused great controversy on the Internet.
The film currently has 77 thousand views and scores of comments. Users express a strange opinion, many of them say it is inappropriate to play with "horror" which has a place in the dairy industry.
"The use of blood to advertise this product was very bad idea.
Like people to give milk, they have to go into pregnancy and give birth to babies, including their children being taken a few days after birth," wrote one of the users.
Elvie’s lactator can carry a non-observance of boustonosis to carmine (Elvie/Mother)
Another commented: “It is of course traumatic for both the mother and the child.
All right, let's use the roofs to advertise lactating for mothers who can stop their children."
Another added: “This advertising is completely driven by reality.”
Another gunman, one of the women, said that she thought the song was “for fun. ”
"I think it's a great idea.
If I were to keep my hair dry, I'd buy it for myself.
I felt like a bear when I was pulling out of my food.
The commercial's a little crazy, but I don't get into it the other day.
It's a great discovery," someone wrote.
Another commented: “This is a fun commercial directed at a mother who takes food (often at work or at a toilet) and feels like ‘ blood. ’
It is not intended to glorify or criticise the dairy industry."
At the end of the film, it turns out that women were dancing with lactators that were deliberately attached to the breast.
The campaign was inspired by the fact that many pregnant women feel like cows.
Elvie’s lactator, however, is completely quiet, has no cables or pipes and can wear it without noticeable under the boustonostones into the food that allows women to move freely, keep the children on their hands, and even leave the house while they are taking food.
Ana Balarin, a creative partner and director of Mother’s company, said: “Lactator Elvie is such a revolutionary product that he deserves a respected and provocative prime minister.
By putting together the caring women and the milk cows, we wanted to show all the challenges associated with the withdrawal of food, by presenting the experience in a fun and coherent way of feeling the freedom it provides.
This isn't the first time Elvie's lactator hit the newspaper.
During London Fashion Week in the course of Marty Jacubowski's show, the mother of two children with the product attached.
Hundreds of immigrant children have been secretly transferred to a rural village on the border with Texas
The number of children detained by immigrants is growing rapidly, although the number of persons crossing the border every month has not changed. This is partly due to the fact that the harsh rhetoric and principles introduced by President Trump's administration have made it difficult for children to be placed in sponsors.
Most sponsors are often also undocumented immigrants who are afraid of deportation if they report after their child.
This risk increased in June when the federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adults living in the common economy would receive fingerprints that would then be transferred to the immigration authorities.
Last week, an senior officer at the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency, Matthew Albence, admitted before Congress that his agency had already arrested dozens of people who reported sponsors for children left without care.
The Agency later confirmed that 70 per cent of the arrested were not previously registered.
“At least 80 per cent of people who are sponsors or live with them in one domestic economy are illegal in the country, and most of them are criminal offenders in the past.
That's why we're following them forever," said Albence.
The security staff say that, as part of efforts to speed up the situation of children, officials have introduced new rules requiring some of them to appear in court within a month of detention — not after 60 days, as was the case with the previous standards.
Much will be done through the videoconferencing, not by yourself, to request an immigration judge to legislate their status.
Those who do not qualify for release will be deported immediately.
According to shelter workers and reports published in recent months, their children are under arrest, which can easily become restless or depressed, which may lead to attacks of aggression or attempted escape.
Defenders have found that these problems are even more serious in the case of larger centers, such as Tornillo, where it is easier to ignore signs that something bad is happening with a child.
They also added that the transfer of children to a homeless camp without providing them with adequate time for emotional preparation or telling their friends about the trauma that many of them already experience.
Syria calls American, French and Turkish "occupational forces" for immediate exodus
During his visit to the UN General Assembly, the Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Mouelam also invited refugees from Syria to return home, although the war in this country had lasted for eight years.
Moalam, who also played the role of the Vice-President, said that the citizens are living in the Syrian country illegally, in the context of the fight against terrorism, and "we will deal with them accordingly".
"They have to break up immediately and unconditionally," he announced to the Assembly.
Moualem says that "the war with terrorism has almost ended" in Syria, where more than 360 thousand people have died since 2011, and millions have been forced to leave their homes.
It says that Damascus will continue to "take its sacred battle until Syria's territory is cleansed" both by terrorist groups and by "all the wrongdoers who are on it illegally".
Today in Syria he is stationing around 2000 American soldiers who are primarily involved in training Kurdish and Syrian forces against President Baszzar al-Asad and their advice.
In addition, more than 1,000 French soldiers are still in the country of war.
In the case of refugees, Moual said that the conditions were good enough to allow them to return, and he accused "some countries in the West" of "increasing non-reactional fear" which would discourage them from returning.
"We have asked the international community and humanitarian organizations for assistance in these returns," he said.
"They're policy-making things that should have a clean human dimension."
The United States and the European Union have warned that, until President Assad reaches a political agreement to end the war, Syria will not receive any assistance for reconstruction.
UN-wide diplomats say that the latest agreement between Russia and Turkey on the establishment of a buffer zone in the last large settlement of the rebels in Idlib has created the possibility of continuing political talks.
The Treaty between Russia and Turkey has helped to prevent a major Syrian attack by Russia in a province where three million people live.
Moalalem stressed, however, that the agreement has a "expressive time frame", and expressed the hope that military action will be measured in the Jihadists, including those who are related to Al-Qaida Front of the Protection of the People of Lebanon, who will be "extended".
Ambassador of the UN, Staffan de Mistura, hopes to call soon on the first meeting of the new board of directors and opposition parties to prepare a draft Syrian military constitution and prepare for elections.
Moualem highlighted the conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the Commission, saying that the work of the panel should be limited to "checking the records of the current constitution" and cautioned against interference.
Why does Trump win the election again
According to this logic, President Trump would have been elected to a second term in 2020, unless, as many liberal observers are sure to hope, his presidency will end earlier with the removal of the office and the scandal.
It would certainly be "the most dramatic end of the Presidency".
As it is, there is no sign of visual impairment.
Since 2014, the CNN channel's visibility results in the primary team have doubled and reached 1.05 million views, while the MSNBC channel has nearly doubled to 1.6 million views.
According to the Nielsen Fox News agency, an average of 2.4 million views per hour of the highest visibility, which is an increase of 1.7 million over four years, and reported on the MSNBC channel "The Rachel Maddow Show" has achieved the highest results in cable television, attracting up to 3.5 million views of evening information programs.
"People are treating us like a fire – that's something we don't understand," said Neal Bear, the main producer of the ABC series "Designed Survivor" about the secretary of the office who will be president after the attack on Capitol.
Nell Scovell, experienced comedy creator and author of the book "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys" Club has another theory.
She recalls how she went to Boston before the 2016 elections.
The manager said he'd vote on the trumpet.

When I met Mike Fleissem this week, the weather on the north coast of the island of Kauai where he had his home was great, but he sat in the middle, watching MSNBC and recording CNN.
He was unable to answer that, not when Brett Kavanaugh stood right before the Senate's Court of Justice and considered the future of the Supreme Court.
"I remember how we used to do all these crazy programs and people said 'this is the beginning of the end of Western civilization'," Fleiss told me.
"I thought they were joking, but it turns out they were right."

The effect of money on the campaign to be chosen for Congress
It is not surprising that, after the reorganization of electoral zones, resulting in a single position, two present-day congressmen are now active, until the 17th electoral district of Pennsylvania is flooded by the river of cash.
This newly established Pitzsburg sub-sector is represented in Congress by the representative of the Democrats, Conor Lamb, who took his place in another district during the special elections of the former spring.
Lamb competes with another current congressman, Keeth Rothfus, who is now represented by the 12th district in Pennsylvania, which is largely covered by the new 17th district.
The map of the districts was adjusted following the initial judgment of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, which found that the old districts had been misappointed, which gave the Republicans the advantage and was incompatible with the Constitution.
In the new context of the 17th round, the campaign on the financing of the party's main funding bodies was launched by the Commissions of the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NCRC).
The name Lamba has gained popularity in Pennsylvania after winning hair in the widely commented elections to the 18th electoral district, which took place in March.
This position has been in the Republican since more than a decade, and Donald Trump has won 20 points in this area.
Political experts have given the Democrats little notice.
The United States considered Salvador's attack to support China, but they resigned from that idea.
The diplomats noted that Dominicans and Panama have already recognized Beijing, despite the mild opposition of Washington.
In June 2017, President Donald Trump met with Prime Minister Panay, Juan Carlos Varel, and by the time of his departure from the management team of the Trump Organization, he had a hotel in Panama.
Officials of the State Department decided to call the heads of American diplomatic missions from Salvador, Dominican Republic and Panama "on the basis of recent decisions to stop Taiwan's recognition", said the Department's spokesman Heather Nauert in his statement this month.
However, the sanctions under consideration were to be imposed only on Salvador, which, according to estimates in 2017, received $140 million from the United States for assistance among others in the fight against drugs and support for development and the economy.
The proposed sanctions which would include restrictions on financial assistance and visas for certain persons would be very relevant to this Central American country, which is struggling with high unemployment and high homicide rates.
As a result of the progress of international meetings of North American and Central American officials, a high-level conference on security and economic well-being was scheduled to take place in order to make proposals for a similar meeting last year, which was seen as a step forward in attempting to prevent immigrants from moving to the United States.
In September, the highest level administration officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place in this way any consideration of sanctions against Salvador.
The diplomats say that at the conference, which is now scheduled to take place in mid-October, Vice-President Mike Pence is going to be a witness to an invitation to meet with the representatives of the administration.
Three US envoys returned quietly to Salvador, Panama and Dominicans, and they did not accompany any new serious communications or punishments from Washington.
John Bolton from the White House rejected the comment on the details of the debate presented by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to speak in-house talks under the terms of anonymity.
Their relations were confirmed by an external analysis of the administration's environment, which was also anonymous.

Rangers Club, Graham Dorrrans, with optimism waiting for a match with the Rapid Wieden team
The Rangers take the Rapid Viennas on Thursday with the awareness that the victory with the Austrians achieved after the impressive return from Villareal reached this month in Spain is significantly more likely to qualify from the G League of Europe.
Until the 2nd of Villareal's knee concussion enabled Graham Dorrance's assistant to play this season, but he believes that this effect on the Rangers as a trampoline to greater success.

Fear of the memerital survival speed for women of age
Although the people taking part in the poll knew exactly how they wanted to take care of them, few talked to the family about it.
In a study conducted by Nationvide, about half of the participants claimed that she had talked to her partner about long-term care costs.
Just 10 percent said they talked to the kids about it.
“People want a family member to take care of them, but they don’t take it for granted,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of the Nationalwide life insurance company.
From what?
Talk to your spouse and children: You do not prepare a family to take care of yourself unless you express your will in advance.
With the consultant and the family, talk where and how you want to be cared for, because this choice will be an important factor in determining costs.
Ask for financial advice: He can help you find ways to pay these expenses.
Long-term care funds can come from traditional police to such care, hybrid police that enables you to pay cash to cover such expenses or from your own property — if you have it.
Prepare legal documents: You will avoid these legal battles.
Mark a reliable health care officer who will monitor and monitor it so that the persons concerned will act in accordance with your will if communication becomes impossible.
Consider, too, the employment of a full - time minister who will take care of the finances.

Land mines and tsunamis in Indonesia
According to official reports, at least 384 people died as a result of a severe earthquake and tsunami that occurred in the fifth Indonesian city of Palu. The number of victims will increase.
As a result of the failed communication of the warlords, no information was received from Pope Doghur, who is north of Palu, near the 7.5 degree earthquake epicenter.
After the disaster in Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated.
Here are some of the most important information about the city of Palu and Doghrea on the island of Celebes:
Palu is the capital of the Central Celebes, the province located at the end of the summer camp on the west coast of the island. It is estimated that in 2017 there were 379,800 people.
When the earthquake struck the land and the tsunamis devastated the city, the 40th anniversary of its establishment took its course.
Doghera is a bbupaten (the administrative unit below the province) extending along the north-west coast of the island for more than 300 km.
It is estimated that in 2017 it was inhabited by 299,200 people.
The main branches of the Central Celebean economy are fisheries and agriculture, which have developed in particular on the coast of Doghrea.
Another source of the province's income is total nickel, but they are mainly found in Morowal, on the opposite coast of Celebes.
According to information from the Indonesian Disaster Relief Agency, over the past 100 years the earthquake and tsunamis have visited Palu and Donghura several times.
In 1938 more than 200 people were killed by tsunamis in Donghar and hundreds of homes were destroyed.
In 1996 there were nine deaths due to tsunamis in western Doghrei.
Indonesia is on the active semi-annual Pacific front of the fire, which causes earthquakes to occur on a regular basis.
The largest earthquake and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: The great earthquake that struck the west coast of the Province of Aceh north of Sumatra on 26 December caused tsunamis that hit 14 countries, killing 226,000 people on the Indian Ocean, from which over half of them live in Aceh.
2005: At the end of March and at the beginning of April, Sumatra visited a series of powerful earthquakes.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias on the coast of Sumatra.
2006: On the south side of Java, the most frozen island of Indonesia, the earthquake hit the country at 6.8 degrees, causing tsunamis that hit the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.

The oldest son of Sary Palin arrested under the names of domestic violence
Track Palin, the oldest son of former governor of Alaska and candidate for Vice-President,Sary Palin, was arrested under assault.
According to a report published on Saturday by Alaska State Troopers from the town of Vasilla in Alaska on 29th of August, he was arrested with threats of domestic violence, difficulties in reporting and opposition before arrest.
According to a police report when the suspect's knowledge tried to call the police to report the crime, he took her phone.
The KTUU station reports that Palin is in the arrest following Mat-Su and has a significant bailout of $500.
According to her information last Saturday, she stood before the court where she said she was "certainly innocent" in her defense speech.
In the Philippines, three classes of A are serious, which means they can get a prison sentence even for a year and $250,000 for crimes.
He was also charged with class B exorcising, which threatened the prison day and was guilty of a fine of $2,000.
This isn't the first time that Palin's men were shot.
In December 2017 he was charged with assault on his father, Todd Palina.
Then his mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the attack.
The case is currently before the Alaskan Court of Justice for Veterans' Growth.
In January 2016 he was accused of domestic violence, of making a report difficult and of having a weapon in a state of non-refoulement due to this incident.
His partner says he hit her face.
In 2016 a group of veterans criticized Sarah Palin, who linked the aggressive behavior of her son with a group of porous stress that she had gained during her service in Iraq.

In social media, movies are filming a time of disaster.
When the tsunami hit the coast, hundreds of people were found on the beach in Palu, where the festival was held.
Federal prosecutors require death penalty for suspected terrorist attacks in New York
Federal prosecutors from New York are calling for the death penalty for Sayfulla Saipova suspected of committing a terrorist attack in New York, resulting in the death of eight people. It is a rare penalty — it has not been committed in this state for a federal crime since 1953.
To carry out an attack that took place in October on a railway route along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, 30-year-old Saipov reportedly used a used home Depot truck that drove dogs and rovers on his way.
According to the South-South district of New York, a notification of the intention to require the death penalty to justify its necessity would have to prove that Saipov 'intelligent' killed eight victims and 'fully' caused serious body damage.
According to the judicial document for both of these charges, the death penalty is a threat.
A few weeks after the attack, the Federal Court of Auditors presented Saipov's complaint Act containing 22 items, including eight charges of murder in the context of illegal activity — which is a procedure commonly used by federal prosecutors in matters relating to organised crime — as well as violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
According to the prosecutors, the organization of the attack called for "solid planning and thinking." The way Saipov conducted it, they defined it as "constitutional, cruel and immoral".
"Sayfulllo Habibullaevic Saipov has brought harm, damage and loss to family and friends Diego Enrique Angelinigo, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darrena Drake's, Ariel Erlie, Hernan Ferruchie, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damiana Pagnucca," says the report.
Five of the victims were the citizens of Argentina who lived in New York for tourism.
The last time the death penalty in the South District of New York was imposed ten years ago.
The accused Khalid Barnes was convicted of murdering two drug dealers, but finally in September 2009, he heard the cause of his life.
The death penalty was last executed in New York in 1953 on Julius and Ethel Rosenbergch. Marriage was lost after two years before they were recognized as guilty of conspiracy and anxiety over the Soviet Union during the Cold War.
Both Rosenbergs were lost on 19 June 1953.
According to the Saipov court documents from Uzbekistan, there were no summaries during the month following the attack.
The police say he told his followers that he felt good about what he did.
According to Saipov's charge act, he was admitted by the authorities to be inspired by ISIS films he watched on the phone.
According to the police, the ISIS flag was also required to be released in its hospital room.
In the case of an action of 22 charges, it is not appropriate.
David Patton, one of the federal defenders representing Saipov, said they were "for obvious reasons disappointed" by the prosecutor's decision.
"We believe that the decision to demand the death penalty and to refuse life without the possibility of an earlier release after being granted the guilt is only a matter of suffering which has led to all interested persons," he said.
Saipova's defence team earlier asked the prosecutors not to want death sentences.
The MEP says NIGEL FARGE should take responsibility for the Brexitu negotiations
During today's protest, which took place during the Toris conference, Nigel Farage married "to mobilize people's army".
The leader of the United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP) said that politicians must "feel hot" fighting Eurosceptics when one of those MPs theresy May suggested that they should take responsibility for negotiations with the European Union.
A Conservative Member, Peter Bone, told a demonstrators in Birmingham that if Farage was a Secretary of Brexit, "the United Kingdom would already be outside the Union".
However, the addition of the towers which prefer to remain in the Community to a personal protest against Brexit, which took place in the city, further stressed the burden of the commitment of its deeply divided series before Theresa May.
Your Prime Minister is making it difficult to implement its Chechers compromise plan between attacks by Brexit Volunteers, its opponents, and even the European Union itself.
Its allies claim that despite the opposition, it will continue to conclude an agreement with Brussels and the need for Eurosceptics and Laboratories to make a choice between its proposal and "chaos".
Peter Bone told the Group Leave Means Leave in Solihull that he wanted to "reject a plan from Chechers".
He suggested that Nigel Farage should be a full-time doctor who should be entrusted with the responsibilities of negotiating with Brussels.
"If he did, we would already be outside the Union," he said.
Wellingborough's MP added: "I support Brexit, but we have to throw out a plan from Chechers."
Presenting his opposition to the European Union, he said: “We have not yet fought in the wars of the world to be subject to one another.
We want to establish our rights in our own country."
Peter Bone rejected the suggestion that citizens have changed their vote in 2016: "The idea that the British have changed their mind and they want to stay in the Union is totally wrong".
The demonstration was also attended by Brexit Andrea Jenkins from the tour group who told the reporter: “I’m just saying, Mr. Prime Minister, please listen to people.
The Chechers plan does not enjoy general support, the opposition will not vote for it, our party or our activists who mislead the streets and choose us, nor will they support it.
Please leave the plan with Chechers and start listening."
In her statement to Prime Minister May, she added: "The Prime Minister keeps his position when he keeps his promise."
Nigel Farage stated that the policy involved in the demonstration must "feel hot" if they were to make the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
"Now this is the issue of trust between us — people — and a political class," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit, and we're here today to tell them we won't let you do it."
Turning to the disunited mob, he added: “I want you to make the politicians who are on the side of Brexit’s betrayal feel hot.
"We mobilize the army of the people of this country who gave us victory in the referendum on Brexisia, and we will not start until we become independent, independent, proud United Kingdom."
At the time, Brexit’s opponents were expanding through the city center, where a two - hour demonstration took place.
The mob of activists beat the banners "Torys Against Brexit" after the group was set up this weekend.
The lab activist, Baron Andrew Adonis, spoke to conservatives about the security of the party application at the beginning of the conference.
"These are people who claim to be able to organise information systems and all technology to support Canada's plus, river border, free trade with Ireland without borders," he added.
‘This is a complete race.
There's nothing like good Brexit," he added.
Elizabeth Warren is planning to "exactly consider" the candidate to the president
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says that after November's elections "he will seriously consider the candidate to the president".
As The Boston Globe reports, the representative of the Democrats from Massachusetts spoke about his future during a meeting with the voters who took place on Saturday in western Massachusetts.

Killing the killer of the LSU's dead player, Wade Sims
The Baton Rouge police in the state of Luizjana reported on the arrest on Saturday of a suspect in the fifth shooting in which the LSU killer, Wade Sims, died.
The police department in Baton Rouge reported on the arrest of 20-year-old Dytheon Simpson at the conference, which took place at 11:00 a.m. on the east.
On Friday, a shooting record was published with a request for help in identifying a man visible on it.
Twenty-year-old Wayde Sims died as a result of a shooting near the Southern University campus on Friday morning.
"Wayde Sims was shot with a gun in his head, as a result of his death," said the police chief Murphy J. Paul, according to 247sports.
Wade was in the defense of a friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was heard and admitted he was at the crime scene, had a gun with him, and shot Wayde.
After his arrest, he was transferred to the East Baton Rouge State Police.

Grand Prix Russia: Lewis Hamilton is approaching the world title after the team's order made him win with Sebastian Vettel
Since the time Valtteri Bottas qualified before Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it has become clear that the command of the Mercedes team will have a great impact on the outcome of the trip.
Bottas, who started from the first field, began very well and almost defeated Hamilton by defending his position in the first two rounds and forced Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel went to the service point for the first time and allowed Hamilton to go into the fire of the plot, which he should decide about bad luck.
The trader Mercedes went into the box next round and appeared after Vettel, but after a round of action, as a result of which the driver Ferrari voluntarily left the inner part of the tower, risking his life to defend himself after a double movement of the sailor with a view to protecting the position on the third floor, Hamilton resigned.
Max Verstappen started at the end of the season and at the end of his 21th birthday, he was at the seventh place.
He then led a large part of the expedition by not changing the opposition in order to carry out the rapid finalization and recovery of Kimi Raikkone's fourth position.
Finally, he went to the service point on the 44th round, but in the other eight rounds he couldn't speed up any more.
"It was a hard day because for the whole weekend Valtteri was doing a great job and became a real gentleman when I was told to leave him.
The whole team gave it all up to take the first two places," Hamilton said.
It was really bad body language.
At a meeting on Saturday, President Donald Trump met with Senator Dianny Feinstein, who maintained that she did not disclose the contents of a letter from Christina Blasey Ford, in which she accused her of sexual assault by the Supreme Court of Great Britain of Kavanaugh.
Speaking at a meeting in Virginia in the West, the President did not refer directly to statements made by Christina Ford before the Commission of Justice, and instead stated that what was happening in the Senate showed that people were "submissive, abusive and lying".
"What may have happened is one, but this beautiful situation in the Senate which we have witnessed for a few days when we see evil when we see people who are angry, angry, abusive and lying," he said.
"We see what has been published and revealed, and then they tell us 'Oh, I didn't do it'.
I didn't do it.
Do You Remember?
Deanno Feinstein, did you find out?
Do you remember her answer... or did you reveal the contents of this document?
Oh, no.
I didn't reveal it."
Wait, wait.
Did we reveal... No, we didn't reveal"--he added, warning the senator.
Dianna Feinstein received from Christiny Ford a list of her drawings towards Kavanaugh in July and her content ran out at the beginning of September.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's insinuation, I didn't reveal her history," Feinstein admitted before the Commission, as The Hill newspaper reports.
"She asked me for discretion and I did not disclose these contents in accordance with her request."
However, her statement did not convince the president, who commented at the Sunday meeting: “I tell you, this was really a bad body.
Maybe she didn't do it, but it was the worst thing I've ever seen in my life."
Continuing the defence of the candidate to the Supreme Court of the Supreme Court, which three women accused of sexual harassment, the President suggested that Democrats use insinuation for their own purposes.
"They are determined to take all measures.
They don't care about who they hurt to get power and control," said the President of the Mediaite service.

Aeroplane traffic controller, helping hundreds of people in the plane to escape from the earthquake
The air traffic controller from Indonesia was hit by a hero after he died, helping safely launch a plane with hundreds of people on board.
More than 800 people died, and many were identified as missing after the great earthquake that struck the Indonesian island of Celebes on Friday, causing tsunamis.
In the region there are still strong tensions on Tuesday. In the city of Palu many people have been trapped in holes.
Although his colleagues fled, saving their lives, 21-year-old Anthony Gunawan Agung refused to leave his position in the abandoned flight control line at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri airport in Palu.
He was there to make sure that Batik Air (lot number 6321) aircraft that was located right on the starting line was safely launched.
Then he jumped out of his neck when it seemed to him that they were getting involved right away.
He died in the hospital.
According to the Australian station ABC News, Air Navigation Indonesia, Johannes Sirait said that the control decision probably saved hundreds of lives.
We organized a mob from Balikpan to Borneo to take him to a bigger hospital in another town.
Unfortunately, Anthony left this morning before he got to Paul.
"This message has broken our heart," he added.
At the same time, authorities fear that thousands of victims may be killed. The national disaster relief agency informs that the possibility of entry into the cities of Doghrea, Siggi and Butung is limited.
"We believe that the death rate continues to grow, as many bodies are still under threats and cannot be affected," said the spokesman of Sutopo Purwo Nugro.
Six feet [6 m] away from the woods destroyed Paul, where on Sunday a mass funeral of the victim will take place.
Military and civilian aircraft provide assistance and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, said to Sky News station: “Ambulances are constantly importing bodies.
She's getting out of drinking water.
The small holes are filled."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is pushing for help with the oval, but we don’t know what to stand for.
It's already tragedy, and it can be even worse."
On Sunday, the president of Indonesia, Joko Vidodo, who returned to the army, came to Paul: “Please all of you work day and night to carry out all the evacuating duties.
Are you ready?" CNN says.
This year Indonesia has already visited the earthquake that killed over 550 people on the island of Lombok.
A plane crash in Micronesia — Air Niugini line shows that one person is lost after a plane crash
The flight service lines that crashed on the ground in Micronesia in the Pacific report that one person has been killed. All 47 passengers and crew members have previously been safely evacuated from a tonne plane.
Air Niugini reported that according to data on Saturday afternoon, there was no man who traveled by feral plane.
They made sure that they were together with local authorities, hospitals and followers trying to find him.
However, they did not immediately respond to requests for additional passenger details such as his age or nationality.
After an aircraft hit the water during a flight attempt to land on the island of Chuuk, the rest of the passengers and crew helped the local ship.
The officials informed on Friday that seven persons had been transferred to the hospital.
The airlines said that on Saturday there were six passengers left in the hospital, all in a stable state.
It's not clear what caused the disaster.
The U.S. military line and the Navy claim that the plane has been on its landing shortly after the start of the flight.
According to some witnesses, he fell out of the dog.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane was very low.
"That really helped us," he said.
Jaynes said he and other people were able to turn water into an emergency tonnage plane.
According to him, members of the crew were panicking and screaming, and he himself had a dangerous headache.
The U.S. military officer reported that the rescue action also helped sailors who worked near the coast to modernize the coast. With the help of a steaming ship, they were able to transport people to the shore before the plane sank to a depth of about 30 metres.
According to the Aviation Safety Network database in the last two decades, 111 people died from air traffic accidents registered in Papua New Guinea. However, Air Niugini does not have any of these lines.
The analysis reconstructed a night event when a woman was burned alive
On Saturday, the prosecutor concluded the submission of evidence in the retrial of a man charged with burning a woman's life in Mississippi in 2014.
A U.S. Department of Justice analysis, Paul Rowlett, has for many hours been recognized as a fugitive judge in the area of information analysis.
He described to the judges how the cell phone records opened up a 29-year-old defendant, Quinton Tellis, and 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, from the night she died.
As journalist Clarion Ledger reports, Rowlett has obtained data on the location from various cell phones that showed that Tellis was from Chambers, and that's what he said earlier.
When the data confirmed that while Quinton was supposed to be with his friends, Michael Sanford, his cell phone was at Jessica Chambers, the police decided to listen to Sanford.
On Saturday, Sanford admitted he wasn't in town that day.
When the prosecutors asked whether Tellis was telling the truth, claiming that he was in Sanford's truck that night, he replied that he had lied because my truck was then in Nashville.
Another drawback is Tellis' claim that he's known Chambers for about two weeks.
The cell phone records showed that they knew each other only from week to week.
Rowlett said some time after the death of Chambers Tellis removed her contact data from her phone, as well as SMS and connection.
"He took her out of his life," said Hale.
The final defense shall begin on Sunday.
The judge said that it was likely still on the same day that the case would be handed over to the jury.

Ninja from New York invites a couple to leave after the "resistivist" SMS
Ninja from New York invites a couple to leave her work on the basis of a racist post-retirement SMS, in which the child's mother complains she's a "all black person".
The couple refuse to be racist, comparing the call to "santazen".
The mother of two children, Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, was clearly upset when it became evident that a new nurse, Giselle Maurice, who was your first day at work in 2016, was black.
"NIEEEE, CZARN AID" – she wrote to her husband in a text.
But instead of sending him to him, she sent him twice to Mrs. Maurice.
According to the New York Post, when Plasco-Flaxman found himself in a full-flax case, Gisell Maurice released, claiming that the heartless ninja, who is an Afro-American, had failed to carry out her duties, and she was not expected to leave the Philippines.
Mrs. Maurice was paid a day's work and then she was sent to Uber's house.
It is now expected from a couple of damages for release of $350 a day multiplied by six months, which was initially employed by the resident, although it did not sign the contract.
"I want to show them that this isn't happening," said the Post newspaper on Friday and added "I know it's discrimination."
The couple defends allegations of racism, claiming that the end of cooperation with Mrs Maurice was justified, because after their drawings, they were afraid they would not be able to trust her.
“My wife sent her something she didn’t intend to say.
He's not racist.
We're not racists," said Posto's husband, Joel Plasco.
Would you believe your children who have committed sins, even if it was a mistake?
Your newborn baby?
Come on."
Comparing the call to "santazu", Plasco said his wife was born just two months earlier and was in "very difficult situation".
“Do you intend to give up something like this?
It's not too nice," added the investment banker.
Although the case in court has not yet ended, public opinion quickly appeared on a couple of occasions in social media, critical of her behaviour and her way of thinking.
A new paper reveals that the publishers of the book of Paddington were afraid that readers would not feel any connection to the exciting mission
The author’s daughter, Michael Bonda, and Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book’s warm reception, say of the list: “It’s hard to put herself in the place of the person who first read it, even before it was published.
It's very fun now that we know what we know about the great success of Paddington."
She says that her father, who inspired her before the small plush city to write books for the children, worked as a cameraman in BBC, was sure that her work would be rejected. She also adds that after her death in the last year 60th anniversary of the book’s release, she appears to be a “dear-grandfather”.
Paddington, described as “a very important member of our family, ” says her father was proud of his success.
"He was a quiet man, he didn't help himself," he adds.
“ However, since Paddington seemed very real to him, it was almost like having a child who had something to do with it — you feel proud of him, although it is not your reward.
I think Paddington's success has been seen in a little less way.
Although he designed and created himself, he always gave the benefit of Paddington himself."
My daughter died, and I had to tell her on the phone.
After her daughter was expelled, she was transferred to the hospital of Louis Pasteura 2 in Nice, where doctors tried to save her life.
"He called over regularly and said it was really bad that he wouldn't come out of it," says Tanya Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then he called to say that Natasha would die within two minutes, and I have to tell her.
That's what I did.
I said, “Tashi, I love you so much.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medicines that doctors gave her to maintain her heart rate gradually stopped working and were removed from her body.
She died a while ago, and it was the end of everything.
I could just sit down and wait with the awareness that this is all going on.
I couldn't go out and cry or cry because I was among other people.
I really had to stay."
At the end of Tanya Ednan-Laperouse, who had already complained of the loss of her daughter, went into the store with other passengers who were unaware of what milk she had been through.
"No one knew," she said.
I had a broken head, and my tears flowed all the time.
It's hard to explain, but in the plane, I felt all the way to Nada's compassion.
I felt I needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Women's posters are supposed to help prevent suicide on site
Two women whose loved ones have committed suicide are trying to turn others away from the purpose of saving their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys are located in Welsh post offices with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can get help.
Mrs. Davis, Tyler, was 13 years old when he was diagnosed with depression.
“I don’t want any parents to feel the way I feel every day, ” she says.
The 45th-year-old Sharon Davis, who lives in Lydney, says her son was well-informed about the funny smile cook.
"Everyone knew his smiles.
They always said they could explain every room to him."
Before his death, however, he gave up work because he was “in a really black place. ”
In 2014, Brother Tyler was 11 years old and he found his brother when he committed suicide.
Mrs. Davis says, "I'm always afraid of the effect of the domination."
Sharon Davis created cards, “to tell people that they are people who can come back and talk to them, even if we know them.
Don't sit still, talk to somebody."
Kelly Humphreys, who has been friends with Sharon Davies for years, lost Mark, his 15-year-old partner shortly after the death of his mother.
"He didn't say he felt hurt, sad or anything," he says.
"A few days before the birth of God, we noticed a change in his behavior.
At Christmas he was already in complete doll. When the children opened their presents, he didn't even look at it."
He says that his death was very painful for them, but they had to reason with him: “This is a family crisis.
He's breaking us up.
But we must continue to live and fight."

The future of Bretta Kavanaugh's village in Italy because the FBI is beginning the investigation
"I thought that if we were able to really get what he asked for — a time-limited investigation and a limited area — we could be able to achieve some consensus," said Jeff Flake on Saturday, adding that he was afraid that the Commission would "fall" on the opposing arguments leading to the impact.
Why did Brett Kavanaugh and his Republicans not want to investigate the FBI?
It's been a while since they've been out.
The elections to Congress are already in a few weeks — November 6th. If, according to estimates, the Republic loses them, the choice of a particular person to the highest court in the country is significantly reduced.
George W. Bush has already raised the audience to call the senators and invite them to support Kavanaugh, who worked for him in the White House and through him met his wife Ashley, who was the personal secretary of the president.
What happens when the FBI makes a report?
The Senate of 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats will take place.
It is not certain that Brett Kavanaugh will receive at least 50 votes from senators, which would allow Vice-President Mike Pence to break the impassion and bring him to the Supreme Court.
Under the Kima governments, the number of refugees from North Korea is small
According to South Korean leader Kim Dzong Un, since seven years ago, the number of people who have fled from North Korea to South Korea has fallen.
Citing data from the South Korean Ministry of the United Nations, Park Byeong-seug said 1127 refugees were recorded last year, and in 2011 - 2706.
According to him, the key factors that have influenced this situation are more precise controls on the borders between North Korea and China and higher rates of human trafficking.
Pyongjang didn't give a public statement in this case.
The vast majority of refugees from North Korea are finally proposed for South Korea.
According to the authorities in Seoul since the end of the Korean war in 1953, the border has illegally crossed over 30,000 Koreans from the North.
Most of China's refugees, which have the longest border with North Korea, make it easier to cross it than the closely protected area of demilitarized (DMZ) between the two of Korea.
China considers refugees to be illegal immigrants, not refugees, and often send them back to their country.
The relations between the North and the South, which are theoretically still in the state of war, have been clearly improved in recent months.
This month the leaders met in Pyongyang, where discussions were held on the negotiations on denuclearization that had previously taken place at the March point.
This was followed by a historic meeting of the President of the United States, Donald Trump, with Kim Dzong Unen, who took place in June in Singapore. This meeting is the result of a general agreement to clean up the Korean peninsula with nuclear weapons.
However, on Saturday the Minister of Foreign Affairs of North Korea, Ri Yong-ho, accused the United States of lack of progress on this matter.
"Without confidence in the United States, there will be no guarantee of our national security and in these circumstances there will be no opportunity for us to develop ourselves as the first one," Ri said in his speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Bretta Kavanaugh "historic" and says he doesn't expect to work in the Supreme Court
The minority leader of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, called the Supreme Britta Kavanaugh 'historic' and said that he did not, of course, expect to work in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made those words on Saturday's report during the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin.
"I think that if a woman acted in this way, she would be known as a 'historic'," said Pelosi about her reaction to a statement made by Kavanaugh before the Justice Senate Commission on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally opposed the charge of the so-called sexual harassment of Dr. Christina Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
In his early speech, Kavanaugh showed strong emotions — almost screaming and losing his voice when discussing family matters and academic years.
He also clearly won the Democrats from the Commission, setting out the serious allegations of "grotesque and co-ordinated closure" organised by the Liberals that Hillary Clinton had won the presidential elections in 2016.
Pelosi claimed that according to her report, Kavanaugh showed that he did not expect to work in the Supreme Court because it revealed his prejudices to the Democrats.
"I think he's been disqualifying himself by giving these statements as well as by the way he attacked Clinton and Democrats," she said.
The question is whether he would attempt to withdraw Kavanaugh from the office if he received his nomination and if the Democrats obtained a majority in the Election of Representatives, Pelosi was concerned.
"I say this: if he does not tell Congress or the FBI the truth, he should not only sit in the Supreme Court but also be in the court where he is currently working," she said.
Kavanaugh is currently a court of appeal in the District Court of Colombia.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, he was afraid of the possible decisions of Kavanaugh regarding the Affordable Care Act or the Roe v. Wade process because he was considered a conservative judge.
During the trial of the confirmatory Kavanaugh, the question was whether some of the decisions of the Supreme Court would be taken.
"It is not the time to bring into the hierarchical court of the former person who will expect us to say 'the ale is wonderful'," Pelosi added.
And women have to control it.
It's an obedient diaphragm, a month and years of wind blowing, and she can't throw it off without pay.
"We'll cry when we're tired," said Gloria Steine to me 45 years later.
"It seems to be quite common, isn't it?"
She added: “A woman who was the manager of a company helped me greatly. She said that she was also crying when she was upset, but she imagined that when she was upset and started to cry, she told the person she was talking to 'You must think I am sad because I am crying.
I'm tired.
He's still doing his job.
I thought it was genius."
The tears are allowed as a sign of anger in part because they are generally misunderstood.
One of my most vivid memories of one of the first groups in the office where I was raised by a man is how I once started to cry from an unexplained university.
"Never let them see how you're crying," she said.
"They don't know you're upset.
They think you're sad, and they're happy that you're touched."
Patricia Schroeder from the Democratic Party, a former member of the Colorado Congress, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Hart was arrested with a lovek on board a ship named Monkey Business and resigned from the island, shaken to Patricia's border, she felt that she could actually consider the idea of owning the president.
"It wasn't a decision," she said, laughing 30 years later.
"Seven other candidates have been present for the elections and the last thing they needed has been further.
Someone has identified this situation as the "Kingly Snow and Seven Splendors."
As the campaign has been for a long time, Schroeder has been busy collecting funds and promised he wouldn't be able to get on unless he's got $2 million.
It was a battle that won.
She then discovered that some of her men who gave her $1,000 for her were only 250.
"Do they think I have any discounts?" she wondered.
During the talk she announced that she would not be conducting a formal campaign, she was so overwhelmed by emotions — thanks to those who supported her, frustrated by the system that made it so difficult to raise money and return to voters, not delegates, and to all the sexism — that she was put in the backyard.
"You might think I've been through nerve damage," he recalls the reactions of the pigs.
“You may think Kleineex sponsors me.
I remember thinking about what they're writing on my wallet.
'Did she cry?'
What benefits can the war between the United States and China bring to Beijing?
The saloons that began the economic war between the United States and China were aghast and, although there is still a lasting battle, the conflict between these countries can be of benefit to Beijing, says experts.
The first warning was launched this year by United States President Donald Trump, imposing a duty on key export goods in China, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most important scaling took place this week after the introduction of new tariff rates for goods worth $200 billion (150 billion) which resulted in the taxation of half of all goods flying to the United States of China.
Each time Pekin moved to nature, raising the last cost of US goods of $60 billion from $5 to 10 per cent.
China is determined to respond to each United States attack and does not seem to have a second economy in the world to come up soon.
The forced removal of Washington means acceptance of requests, but public humiliation before the United States would be too embarrassing for President Xi Jinpinga.
According to experts, however, if Beijing is good at winning its cards, the pressure from the US trade war could in the long term strengthen China by reducing its dependence on both economies.
"The fact that a rapid political decision taken in Washington or Beijing could create conditions for economic chaos in one of the countries is, in fact, much more dangerous than it has been given to observers in the past," said Abigail Grace, an Asian researcher at the Center for New American Security.
According to the Syrian Minister for Foreign Affairs, refugees are "ready" to return
The Court claims that Syria is ready for voluntary return of refugees, and requests for assistance in rebuilding the country that has been devastated by the end of the seven-year war.
In his speech before the UN General Assembly, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Syria, Walid al-Moulam, said that conditions in the country were improving.
"The situation on our territory is now more stable and safe thanks to progress in the fight against terrorism," he said.
As a result of the return of normality, the government is building up areas destroyed by terrorists all the time.
All conditions have already been met so that refugees who had to leave the country because of terrorism and unilateral economic movements measured in their daily lives and means of maintenance can return to it voluntarily.
According to UN estimates since the beginning of the war in 2011, Syria has left more than 5.5 million citizens.
Another six million people still living there need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Mouele said that the Syrian regime would gladly accept assistance in rebuilding the destroyed country.
He stressed, however, that he would not accept aid under the conditions or offered by the countries sponsoring the rebellion.
Europe promotes victory in Ryder Cup in Paris
The European company won the Ryder Cup 2018, winning the US team from 16.5 to 10.5 in the Le Golf National field in Paris.
In Europe the United States has already lost six times a row and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe received a trophy when, under the leadership of the Danish Captain Thomas Bjorna, it received 14.5 points that were necessary for the United States.
The American star, Phil Mickelson, whom most of the tournament didn't go well, hit a ball from the ground just to the water at PAR3, giving the same game to the French Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari has been bluffing all rounds and has become one of the four players since 1979, when this first tournament took place in the current format, was able to achieve 5-0-0.
American Jordan Spieth was awarded the 57-4 award by the lowest ranked player from Europe, Thorbjörn Olesena from Denmark.
Dustin Johnson, who takes the highest position in the world ranking, won two rounds before the last match with Angelic Jane Poulter, which may have been the last round of Ryder Cup.
As a European with the highest number of successes in Ryder Cup, Hispan Sergio Garcia has already participated in eight such tournaments and won 25.5 career points.
“I usually don’t pay, but I can’t stop today.
It was a tough year.
I'm so grateful to Thomas that he believed in me and chose me.
I'm so glad I got the gun back.
It's the success of the entire team and I'm glad I could help," said the inspired Garcia after winning the team from Europe.
He's sending his father-in-law, John Rahm, who won a single American golf game on Sunday, Tiger Woods, result 2&1.
"I feel a great deal of pride about the winner of Tiger Woods. I grew up watching his game," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods won all the games in France and now has 13-21-3 results in Ryder Cup.
It's an indisputable statistics, like one of the biggest players of all time, who got 14 of the most important titles and just happened to Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. company had all weekend problems with finding current, except Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played at a really high level throughout the tournament.
After the disappointment of his American Captain Jim Furyk’s composition, he said: “I am proud of the boys who fought.
At some point this morning, we had a little pressure on Europeans.
We got rid of each other.
Head pockets in front of Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players played really well.
We will change the composition of the group. Together with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Commission we will find ways to move forward.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud I can be their captain.
I'm so surprised at the opponents.
They played much better than us."
