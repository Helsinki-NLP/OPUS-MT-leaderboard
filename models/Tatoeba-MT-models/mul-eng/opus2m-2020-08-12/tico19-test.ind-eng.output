Cumulative Insidence of Coronavirus (COVID-19) in the European Union/European Economic Area and the UK, 1 January to 15 March 2020
The cumulative incidence of koronavirus cases (COVID-19) shows that trains similar to those in the European Union/European Economic Area and the UK confirm that, although they vary depending on countries, COVID-19 pandemics are growing very rapidly across all countries.
Based on the experience of Italy, the country, hospitals and intensive care units, it should improve its readiness to extend COVID-19 patients who will need health care, especially intensive care.
On December 31, 2019, the pneumonia cluster was reported undiscovered in Wuhan, Hubei Province, Tingkok.
On 9 January 2020, the Tiankok Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported that this is a new cancer virus that is now called coronavirus acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-COV-2).
Since then, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection has been called Coronavirus (COVID-19).
Evidence so far shows that approximately 80% of COVID-19 patients suffer from rare diseases, i.e. respiratory infections with or without pneumonia, with most of this disease healing.
In about 14% of cases, COVID-19 develops into a more serious disease and needs hospital care, while 6% of other cases experience critical diseases that require intensive care.
Mortality of patients treated at COVID-19 patients approximately 4%.
In this study, we studied the COVID-19 convulsive insident trains in Europe/The European Economic Area (EU/EEA) and England Raya (UK) and compared them to the insidin in Hubei Province, Tingkok.
We also compare the number of COVID-19 cases now in the EU/EEA and the UK with the number of cases in Italy for 31 January–15 March 2020.
COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA and UK
After Tiongkok, COVID-19 experienced a more far-reaching geographical and dynamic COVID-19 pandemic in other parts of the world while following the pandemic dynamics in Tiongkok.
On March 11, 2020, the Director General of the World Health Organization (WHO) said COVID-19 as a pandemic.
In Eurosurvellance 2020 published 5 March, Spiteri et al. reported the first Europeans with the COVID-19 case confirmed on the basis of the WHO case definition.
In the EU/EEA, three first confirmed cases were reported by France on 24 January 2020 by those who returned from Wuhan, Hubei Province, Tingkok.
On 15 March 2020, COVID-19 cases have been detected across 30 EU/EEA and UK countries, between 31 December 2019 and 15 March 2020 including 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths reported, with 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths from Italy alone.
Get cumulative numbers and cumulative incidences of COVID-19 cases
At the European Centre for the Prevention and Control of Diseases (ECDC), the number of COVID-19 cases reported in each country worldwide is announced every day at 8 p.m., only from official sources such as the National and Regional Health Authority and WHO.
This data is used to evaluate COVID-19 trains in the EU/EEA and the UK and compare them to trains in Italy.
As an active prevalence proxy for COVID-19 cases, we count the cumulative incidences of 14 days, so counting the natural COVID-19 journeys in each EU/EEA and the UK, between 1 January–15 March 2020.
We also estimate the cumulative number of cases reported in each country until 15 March 2020 at 8 p.m. compared with the Italian case for the period 31 January–15 March 2020.
COVID-19 train in EU/EEA and UK
Cumulative insident trains were held on 14 days of the COVID-19 case in EU/EEA and the UN generally followed trains in the Province of Hubei (Tiongkok) (Gambar 1).
For the EU/EEA and the UK as a whole, the COVID-19 cumulative incidence began to rise on 21 February and then increased on 28 February 2020 (additional information).
This train is mainly driven by rapid increase in the number of cases reported from Italy, but all other EU/EEA countries and the UK show similar cumulative incidence growth of COVID-19 (additional material).
Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA and the UK compared to the cumulative number in Italy for the period 31 January–15 March 2020.
The data suggests that, until 15 March at 8 p.m., 15 other EU/EEA countries and the United Nations reported a total number of cases similar to the total number of Italian cases three weeks earlier or less.
As a result, we indicated that the number of COVID-19 cases reported increased rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
A trained train on the COVID-19 cumulative incident indicates that pandemics increase at a similar rate in all countries.
This is due to the different levels of national responses, the differential response to public health, and the possibility of different definitions of cases between countries and the different protocols to select patients to be tested for COVID-19 confirmation, which includes the treatment test.
At the beginning of March 2020, doctors in the Italian region who apparently explained the situation about 10% of COVID-19 patients needed intensive care and media sources reported that hospitals and intensive care units in this area have reached their maximum capacity.
Currently, COVID-19 cases were received in hospitals and/or intensive care units at EU/EAA levels only 6% and 1% of cases (data not shown).
However, data must be collected systematically to complete surveillance data at this time focused on the number of cases reported and the number of deaths reported.
A study conducted in 2010-2011 showed a significant variation in the availability of intensive and public health care facilities in Europe, ranging from 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 per 100,000 in Portugal.
This means that countries can have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 places of intensive care and public health care per 100,000 populations in 2010-2011).
The modeling scenario is related to the complexity of health care capacity, with the estimate of prevalence of COVID-19 cases due to each EU/EEA and UK risk-related risk >90% above the capacity of intensive care facilities, provided in the sixth ECDC rapid risk assessment report on COVID-19.
Since this distance is the most classified case in certain areas of the EU/EEA and the UK, and hospitals and intensive care units are often serving the population of certain regional services, information on cases and intensive care should be provided at the United States level for Statistics 2 (NUTS-2).
Experiences from Italy and current trains in other countries show that COVID-19 pandemics are growing very rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Therefore, countries, hospitals, and intensive care units should prepare themselves for the SARS-CoV-2 community transmission scenario and increase the number of COVID-19 patients who need health care, especially intensive care, such as those in the lightest regions of Italy.
As shown in recent ECDC rapid risk assessments, rapid, proactive, and understanding approaches are essential to delay the SARS-CoV-2 preaching, with changes in the protection approach to mitigating approaches, because an increase in the number of cases, such as diagnosis, may not give the decision makers sufficient time to understand, accept, and adapt the correct response if this is not previously implemented.
The rapid assessment of the risk also presupposes social health steps to launch pandemic detection.
There is a short opportunity window when the country has the possibility of improving its control in slowing down SARS-COV-2 and reducing stress on health care.
If it fails, other EU/EEA health care systems may be faced with long-term patients who need intensive care within a few days or weeks.
Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19), caused by coronavirus acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has long killed more than 3,000 people and infected more than 80,000 people in Tingkok and other parts of the world, causing human disasters.
Along with its homologous virus, SARS-CoV, which caused SARS to thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 may also be transmitted from the lungs and cause similar damage through similar mechanisms.
Nevertheless, COVID-19 has a lower rate of fatigue and mortality than SARS, but more and more about lancia than young people, as well as more about men than women.
In response to the rapid increase in the number of publications on this new disease, this article seeks to provide timely and comprehensive information on emerging research subjects.
We're going to discuss basic epidemiology, ethics, virology, diagnosis, care, predictability, and disease prevention.
Although we still had many unanswered questions, we hoped that this study would help us to understand and deal with the threat of illness.
The Semi Musim Festival on 25 January 2020 has become an unforgettable memory for all Tiononghoa people who are ordered to stay home for a few weeks after the new virus epidemic.
This virus is highly homologous with coronavirus (CoV) that causes serious serious infection syndrome (SARS) in 2003; therefore, it is called SARS-COV-2 by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 February 2020, and the disease it causes is called CoV Dicease-19 (COVID-19).
The epidemic started in Wuhan, Tingkok, and quickly spread throughout the country and nearly 50 other countries around the world.
By March 2, 2020, this virus has affected 80,000 cases of COVID-19 confirmed, with over 40,000 patients diagnosed and 3,000 patients died worldwide.
WHO warns that COVID-19 is "a number 1 killer and potentially more destructive than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nyk.gov/pubmed/), within a period of less than two months from the first report on 7 January 2020 setting a sequence of virus isolates from some patients, more than 200 have been published on COVID-19, which includes virology, epidemiology, ethics, diagnosis, and treatment.
This trend is compounded by a growing trend in new areas of the world.
Maybe we're going to try to compare COVID-19 with SARS and other COV diseases, that is, the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS, published in 2012).
We will also consider what we have learned so far about preventing and predicting disease and some other questions that have not yet been answered.
Based on tradition, COV is considered nonletal pathogens for humans, especially because of about 15% of the 4.
However, in this century, we have found a very pathogenic CoV for humans twice, namely SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, each of which started in Tingkok in 2003 and Saudi in 2012, and immediately spread to many other countries with morbidity and terrible mortality.
So, COVID-19 right now is the third COV paper in recorded human history.
As indicated in Gbr. 1.1, the pneumonia cluster was first reported from Wuhan on 31 December 2019 to the National Health Commission for the People’s Republic of China.
Seven days later, the CoV sequence was destroyed.
On January 15, 2020, the first fatal case of Wuhan was reported.
During that time, the epidemic spread rapidly to neighboring towns, provinces, and countries.
On 20 January, health care infection was reported, which indicates that human-human transmission may occur.
On January 23, the circuit work was held in Wuhan City, and the general public was arrested.
On January 24, the first clinical study on this disease reported that only 21 patients directly contacted the Wuhan marine food market, from 41 patients with confirmed cases, who were considered to be the starting point of infection from an unknown animal source.
On January 30, WHO published this journal as a global health story.
By the time it was written, it had spread to nearly 50 other countries throughout the world.
Because the situation is going very fast, the end and the spread need to be fixed.
On 11 February 2020, multi-centred study of 8,866 patients, including 4,021 COVID-19 patients, confirmed the following updated epidemiographic images (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bbbbdA).
SARS-COV-2 infected people every year, but especially at 30-65.
Nearly half (47.7%) of those over 50 years of age are infected, only a few are under 20 years of age, and only 14 are under 10 years of age.
SARS-CoV-2 more infected men (0.31/100,000) than women (0.27/100,000).
COVID-19 spread into the classroom, especially inside and around Hubei.
COVID-19 consumes 5-rate times (2-9) days from delivery to diagnosis.
The rate incubation period is 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
The time of the rate from spring to death is 9.5 (4.8-13) days.
The basic reproduction number (R0) is 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05) and R0 is 2.23-4.82.
The number of infected people increased exponentially before January 23, 2020, according to the time of mass transportation before the Semi Museum in Tingkok.
The mortality of patients with major cases was confirmed by 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10-1.86%) and mortality was recommended for all major patients 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02-4.59%).
Three main risk factors for COVID-19 are the type of pneumonia (pria), age (≥60 years), and severe pneumonia.
CoV is a subfamily of a large virus meeting that contains each RNA sensor.
CoV can be divided into four genes, namely alpha, beta, gamma, and delta, with alpha- and beta-CoV known as human infection.
Glycoprotein tonnulance or speech (S) combines with its cell receptors, angiotensin-increasing enzyme 2 (ACE 2) and peptidase 4 (DPP4) per tonne for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and then copper fusion occurs.
The RNA gene is released into sitoplasma; after replication through the virus, RNA is genetically combined with total glucoprotein and nucleocapsid protein forms a viral vaccine, which then experiences fusion with plasma membranes to release the virus.
The economic sequence SARS-CoV-2 was first reported on 10 January 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 is a new type of beta-CoV with more than 99.98% genetic equality among 10 successive samples; this sample is taken from the original site, the Luhan Sea Food Market in Wuhan.
Genetically, SARS-CoV-2 is more like SARS-CoV than MERS-CoV.
Through the transmission electron microscope, the SARS-CoV-2 particles are found in the epithelium part of a very dense human respiratory tract.
ACE2 humans found are receptors for SARS-COV-2 as well as SARS-COV.
However, S SARS-CoV-2 protein is associated with ACE2 humans more weak than S SARS-CoV protein, which is consistent with the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes non-interruptible infection of SARS-CoV in patients.
SARS-CoV-2 can also form new short protein that is accompanied by orf3b and protein that is derived from the Orf8 word.
Protein orf3b SARS-CoV-2 may interfere with the pathogenicity of the virus and the inhibition of the expression IFNb; however, Orf8 does not have a known functional domain or motive.
On February 18, 2020, Zhou, et al. reported the complete human creao-EM ACE2 structure on resolution 2.9 Å in complex with amino acid carriers B0AT1.
They found that the complex, which has open and closed conformity, together with the diameter and complex ACE2-B0AT1 can bind two S proteins, which are evidence of infection and COV infection.
B0AT1 can be performed therapeuticly in the treatment regimen to stress SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Mother of origins and borders
SARS-COV and MERS-COV are known from the desert and each is transmitted to humans by means of waves and waves.
By comparison of SARS-CoV-2 phylogenetics with other CoVs, the patient is considered to be the original parent of SARS-CoV-2 because this new virus is 96% identical to two CoVs similar to SARS from the so-called SL-CoVZX45 and SL-CoVZX21.
However, the interlocking process that helps the virus to develop species is still unknown, and the transmission route is still to be explained.
Ji, et al. suggests that the bear is carrying the virus from the lungs to humans that involve homologous recombination in the protein S.
According to a study, a study in Guangzhou, Tingkok, suggested that interfering, long-term breast-feeding materials commonly used in traditional Tinghoa drugs, potential as a single parent of SARS-CoV-2 are based on 99% genetic homology of CoV found in the surrounding and SARS-CoV-2.
However, 1% of the difference that is widespread throughout the gene remains a major difference; therefore, the results as concrete evidence have not yet been achieved (G.3).
The physical characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 are not yet known.
In vitro, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can last for 48 hours in a low environment and up to 5 days at 20 °C and 40%-50% decrease.
Sars-CoV-2 might have a similar quality.
It is reported that SARS-CoV-2 is sensitive to ultraviolet light and heat at 56 °C for 30 minutes; ether, ethanol 75%, chlorine-containing infections, perazide acids, chlorforms, and other fat killers, but not chlorhexidine, effectively activates the virus.
In general, the entire human population has no immunity to SARS-COV-2 and because it's rare to this new virus.
At present, no specific study has been reported on the immunological response to SARS-CoV-2.
Therefore, we can only refer to other coV research previously, in particular SARS-COV and MERS-COV (G.4.4).
In general, after invasive inhalation, the virus is known by the immune system through the PRR receptor, which includes C-type lectin-like receptor, Toll-like receptor (TLR), NOD-like receptor (NLR), and RIG-I-like receptor (RLR).
Through different routes, the virus induces the expression of inflammatory factors, dendritic cell maturity, and the synthesis of Type I interferon I (IFN) that restricts virus transmission and speeds up fagostois antigen virus by macrophag.
However, N protein on SARS-CoV can help the virus avoid immune reactions.
Soon, the adaptive immune response joined in the fight against this virus.
Limfosit T, which includes CD4+ and CD8+ cells, plays an important role in this protection.
T CD4+ cell stimulation B cell to produce an antibiotic specific to the virus, and T CD8+ cell killed the virus infected cell directly.
The T cell assists in producing proinflammator systokin to help protect the cell.
Nevertheless, CV can slow T-cell function by leading apoptosis T-cell.
Sexual immunity, which includes complements, such as C3a and C5a, as well as antibodies, is also important in the fight against virus infection.
For example, an antibiotic isolated from a patient who has been healed controlled by MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, excessive immune reactions produce a large number of free radicals locally, which can cause damage to the lungs and other organs, and, in the worst scenario, failure of the immune system and even death.
Sars-CoV-2 infection, identified by the lead cluster, is more about lancia with breast cancer and pregnant women.
In general, those who are infected with a large number of viruses or who are infected with immunodeficiency syndrome have a higher chance of infection than those of others.
The estimate of the SARS-CoV-2 incubation period is 1-14 days, most 3-7 days based on study of 425 first cases in Wuhan.
However, a study of 1,099 cases showed that the rate-incubation period was 3 days and affected from 0 to 24 days.
A more recent study, as explained above, shows that the invasion period was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days based on demographic 8.866 cases.
Most importantly, the health authority adapts the time of its quarantine effectively based on the most accurate period of incubation to prevent infection, but without hesitation, it transmits the virus to others.
As a general rule, people who have been infected with HIV or who have been infected with it often have to be quarantined for 14 days.
Should the quarantine be extended for 24 days?
Smoking is often a major and initial COVID-19 disease, with or without other ailments such as fever, breathing problems, headaches, headaches, rhinoria, chest pain, diarrhoea, nausea, and vomiting.
Several patients experienced dyspnea and/or hypoglycaemia a week after the disease occurred.
In severe cases, the development of patients is rapidly becoming acute inflammation syndrome, septic fever, metabolic asidosis, and coagulopathy.
Patients suffering from fever and/or fever and acute fever should be diagnosed with the virus for local diagnosis, even if there is no difference in lung arthropod.
Demographic studies at the end of December 2019 show that the percentage of cases of high fever is 98% for fever, 76% for fever, 55% for dyspnea, and 3% for diarrhoea; 8% of patients need ventilator support.
The same finding has been reported in these two recent studies, namely studies in the family and clusteres that have caused the transmission of asymmetrics.
Similarly, a study of demographics in 2012 showed that MERS-CoV patients also experienced dementia (98%), fever (47%), and dyspnea (55%) as the main cause.
However, 80% of patients need ventilation support, far more than COVID-19 patients and consistent with MERS loyalty higher than COVID-19.
Diare (26%) and heart disease (21%) are also common in MERS patients.
In SARS patients, dedam (99%-100%), shortness of breath (29%-75%), dyspnea (40%-42%), diarrhoea (20-25%), and heart disease (13-25%) were shown to be the main cause and ventilation support needed for approximately 14%-20% of patients.
By 14 February, COVID-19 mortality increased by 2% with confirmed cases reaching 66,576 worldwide.
Similarly, SARS mortality in November 2002 was confirmed by 10% of 8,096 cases.
For MERS, based on a demographic study in June 2012, 37% of the 2,494 cases were confirmed.
Studies have previously reported that R0 SARS-CoV-2 reaches 6.47 with confidence interval (CI) 95% greater than 5.71-7.23, while R0 SARS-CoV only affects 2 to 4.
SARS-COV-2 comparisons with MERS-COV and SARS-COV in terms of pregnancy, mortality, and R0 are given in Table 1.
These figures show that SARS-CoV-2 has a higher dissemination capacity than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but not reducing MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
So it's a challenge to control SARS-COV-2 pandemics greater than MERS-COV and SARS-COV pandemics.
Avalanches are often found in one family or another by such means of transportation or transportation as public transportation.
Patients often have on-going travel or stay in Wuhan or other areas of light or contact with infected people or patients during the last two weeks before their arrival.
However, it is reported that people can carry the virus without showing more than two weeks of pregnancy and patients who have been treated from the hospital can carry the virus again.
At the initial stage, patients had peripheral white blood cells (especially lymphocytes) normal or low.
For example, lymphopenia with white blood cell count < 4x109/L, which includes lymphocyte count < 1x109/L, and aspartate aminotransferase aspartate and increased virality were found in 1,099 COVID-19 patients.
The incidence of heart enzymes and bone marrow and myoglobin increases in the blood of a number of patients, as well as C-reactive protein and non-blood sugar increases in most patients.
In patients with severe cases, D-dimmer increases, i.e. fibrin in the blood, and lymphocyte count decreases progressively.
The contrast toraks photo was found on large scale as COVID-19 patients and was indicated by bilateral ossetia or ground-glass opiates in the lungs.
Patients often experience acute pneumonia, acute lung damage, and acute respiratory syndrome (ARDS).
When ARDS occurs, tachycardial inflation, the accumulation of air pollution, and progressive fibrosis are very likely to prevent gas pollution.
The dysfunction of Type I and Type II pneumositis lowers the surface level and increases the pressure of the surface so that it reduces the ability of the lungs to develop and increase the risk of fractures.
As a result, the worst finding on toraks photos is often parallel to the worst disease ever.
On February 18, 2020, the first analysis of COVID-19 pathology showed a diagnosis of pneumositis, renal membrane development, and interstitial lymphocyte infiltration, as well as the sensory cell was present in several patients who died from this disease, according to pathology of virus infection and ARDS and similar analysis of pathology of patients SARS and MERS.
RNA SARS-CoV-2 detection through reverse polymerase transcriptase response (RT-PCR) is used as the main criterion for COVID-19 diagnosis.
However, given the level of false negative levels, which can speed up the epidemic, clinical manifestations have begun to be used for diagnosis (which no longer depends on RT-PCR) in Tingkok on 13 February 2020.
Similar situations occur in the SARS diagnosis.
As a result, combinations between the disease epidemics, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests, and radiology are very important and a waste of effective diagnosis.
On 14 February 2020, Feng Zhang explained the SHERLOCK-based technical application protocol for detecting SARS-CoV-2, which detects the RNA SARS-CoV-2 synthetic fragments at 20 × 10-18 mol/L to 200 × 10-18 mol/L (10-100 mol/L) using the cell block within less than one hour without needing a limited instrumentation.
Fortunately, this new technology can do much to increase sensitivity and flexibility if it is verified on clinical samples.
Because of lack of experience with new CoV, doctors in particular offer support to COVID-19 patients, while trying various treatments that have been used or previously recommended for other COV treatments, such as SARS-COV, MERS-CoV, and other viral diseases (Table 2.2).
This therapy includes current therapy and potential therapy with antiviral drugs, immunosuppression, steroids, plasma from healthy patients, traditional Tinghoa medicines, and psychological support.
Even plasma from patients who have been cured is recommended for use in therapy.
The pharmaceutical industry is fighting to develop antibodies and vaccines against this virus.
At the initial level, SARS-CoV-2 mainly attacks lungs and may also attack other organs that express ACE2 at a lower level, such as gastrointestinal and ginal systems.
However, the most important threat to the health and well - being of patients is death.
Therefore, breathing support is very important to alleviate fatigue and save lives, which includes general oxygen therapy, high blood pressure oxygen, noninvasive ventilation, and invasive mechanical ventilation, depending on the level of disease inflammation.
Patients with severe inflammation should be supported by extracorporation oxide (ECMO), i.e. the modified cardiopulmoner approach technique used to treat heart failure or life-threatening inflammation.
In addition, maintenance of electrolyte equality, prevention and treatment of secondary infection and septic disease, as well as the protection of vital organ function are also important for SARS-COV-2 patients.
The most known immune system reactions have been associated with systogenous reactions in patients with SARS and MERS.
Sitokin bagai is a systemic inflamatory response form identified by the presence of sitokin release cells, including TNFα, IL-1b, IL-2, IL-6, IFNA, IFNb, IFNG, and MCP-1.
These sitokins induce immune cells to release a large number of free radicals that are the main causes of ARDS and failure of the immune system.
Immunosuppression is very important in the eating of stimuli, especially in patients with severe arthritis.
Corticosteroids and Tocilizumab, an anti-IL6 monoclonal antibodies, have been used to treat sycokin bands.
Other immunosuppressive reactions to systokin strains include modulation of immune response ordered by cell T; IFN-g, IL-1, and TNF blocking; JAK inhibition; blinatumumab; sytokin signalling; and HDAC inhibitor.
Steroids, as immunosuppressants, are widely used in SARS care to reduce inflammation.
However, steroids at high doses are not useful for weight loss in patients with SARS and COVID-19.
On the other hand, steroids can affect the effects of gravity, especially osteonecrosis, which can have a major impact on forecasting.
However, short-dose corticosteroids are encouraged to be carefully administered to COVID-19 patients who are critically ill.
At this time of writing, no effective antiviral therapy has been confirmed.
However, intravenously remdecivir, a nucleotide analogue, was found specialising in a COVID-19 patient from the United States.
Remdesivir is a new antiviral drug developed by Gilead, once again for the treatment of Ebola and Marlburg virus.
Later, remdecivir also shows inhibition of RNA virus alone, which includes MERS and SARS virus.
Based on this, Gilead has prepared this animal for Tingkok to do a test test on SARS-COV-2 infected people, and the result is very expected.
In addition, baricitabineb, interferon-a, lopinavir/ritonavir and ribavirin have been recommended as potential therapy for patients with acute respiratory problems.
Diare, nausea, vomiting, heart damage, and other side reactions may occur after combination therapy with lopinavir/ritonavir.
The interaction of this therapy with other medicines used should be monitored in a consistent manner.
Plasma from patients who have been healed and who have been treated with antibiotics
There is a long history of blood collection of patients who have recovered from the disease to treat other patients suffering from the same disease or to prevent health problems.
Of course, patients who have recovered often have relatively high levels of antibodies in their blood.
Antibodi is an immunoglobulin (Ig) produced by lymphocyte B to fight pathogens and other foreign substances, recognize unique molecules on pathogens, and directly control them.
Based on this, plasma was collected from a group of patients who had recovered from COVID-19 and was reduced to 10 patients with severe disease.
They recovered within 24 hours, including a drop of influenza and viral load and increased oxygen levels in the blood.
However, verification and clarification are needed to establish this method for large scale use before a specific therapy is developed.
Further, in addition to the therapeutic effects, some plasma-related deficiencies need to be considered in general.
For example, antibiotics can stimulate immune response more extensively and cause systolic release syndrome, which is a potentially life-threatening toxicity.
Concentration of antibodies in blood is usually low and plasma is required in large numbers to treat patients with critical illness.
The development and production of specific antibodies with sufficient speed to combat global epidemics is difficult to do.
Therefore, it is more important and practical to isolate B cells from patients who have been healed and identify genetic codes that detect effective antibodies or make effective antibodies to important proteins for the virus.
In this way, we can easily increase the level of antibodies production.
TCM has been used to treat various diseases in Tiankok for thousands of years.
However, most effects are based on combinations of different components in the formula. This formula varies depending on diagnosis of disease based on TCM theory.
Most effective components are still unknown or unclear because it is difficult to extract or verify this component or its optimal combination.
Now, as effective and specific therapy for COVID-19 has not yet been available, TCM has become one of the main alternative therapies for patients with mild to moderate renal impairment or for those who recover from serious illness.
For example, Caps. Shu Feng Jie Du and Lian Hua Qing Wen were found following COVID-19 therapy.
In some COVID-19 patients, treatment with tetanus was performed in Tiankok provinces using TCM in 87% of its patients, including Gansu (63.7%), Ningxia (50%), and Hunan (50%), while in Hubei province, which only used TCM in approximately 30% COVID-19 patients, had a lower level of treatment (13%).
However, this comparison is still valid because many other factors, such as the number and severity of patients, need to be evaluated.
On February 18, 2020, Boli Zhang and friends conducted a study that compared only western drugs (WM) with WM and TCM related therapies.
They found that the time needed to restore body heat, lose weight, and sleep is much shorter in the WM+TCM group than in the WM group.
More interestingly, the degree of evasion (from small to weight) is much lower for the WM+TCM group compared to the WM group only (7.4% compared to 46.2%) and mortality lower than the WM+TCM group compared to the WM group (8.8% compared to 39%).
Nevertheless, the effectiveness and safety of TCM still await a better test at a larger scale and at more research centres.
Another interesting thing is to define the working mechanism and classify effective components in TCM therapy or combinations, if possible.
Most patients who are expected or confirmed COVID-19 feel very afraid of a highly contagious disease and even dying of it, and those who are suspected also feel free, lonely, and angry.
Further, infection rates, such as fever, hypoxia, and stones, as well as side effects such as immunosuppression caused by corticosteroids, can lead to increased stress and stress.
In the initial phase of the SARS paper, psychiatric morbidity, including depression, fatigue, panic attacks, psychomotor seizures, psychotic disorders, deliriums, and even suicides have been reported.
The development of contact travel and mandatory quarantine, as part of a public health response to the COVID-19 issue, can make people faster and feel guilty about the effects of neglect, quarantine, and stigma on friendship and friends.
Therefore, mental health care should be provided for COVID-19 patients, those who are expected, and those who are contacted with them, as well as the necessary public society.
Psychological support should include the development of multidisciplinary mental health teams, clear communication with routine and accurate coverage of SARS-CoV-2 publications, and therapy and use of professional devices and electronic applications to avoid contact with each other.
Effective vaccines are very important to determine the transmission range from animal reserves and humans infected to pregnant mothers and are often able to complete antiviral therapy in control of the epidemic caused by the virus.
The vaccine has been developed to develop protein-based vaccine S, which has long and effective antibodies that protect against SARS-CoV.
For SARS, life-threatening vaccines have been evaluated on test animals.
However, the efficacy of this vaccine candidate in vivo on lancia and the model of lethal resistance and its protection against zoonotic infection should be determined before the clinical study is started.
This is probably because SARS died 17 years ago and no cases have been reported since then.
On the contrary, the sporadic and meRS cluster cases continue to take place in the Middle East and spread to other areas because there are still zoonotic sources in the endemic area.
The vaccine strategy has been developed for MERS using an activated virus, DNA plasma, virus vector, nanoparticel, virus-like particles, and recombinant protein subunits and some have been evaluated in test animals.
The development of vaccines for safe and effective SARS-COV-2 people is a very urgent and important task to control the epidemics that are emerging.
However, this problem is not easy to deal with because of the long-term development of vaccines (ranges 18 months) and the dynamic COV variants.
As a new disease, COVID-19 has just begun to show its full clinical journey to thousands of patients.
In most cases, the patient can get better without being crushed.
However, like SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also linked to morbidity and high mortality in patients with severe cases.
Therefore, the design of the disease forecast model is very important for health care bodies to give priority to their services, especially in areas with limited energy resources.
Based on the clinical study reported so far, the following factors can affect or relate to patients COVID-19 (Table 3):
Usia: Usia is the most important factor for the SARS forecast, which also happens for COVID-19.
COVID-19 occurred in particular at the age of 30-65 with 47.7% of patients over 50 years of age in the study of 8,866 cases as explained above.
Patients in need of intensive care depend on the developmental comorbidity and complications as well as significantly older than patients in non-intensive treatment (mean 66 years of age compared to 51 years of age), which prescribe age as a prognosis factor for the end result of COVID-19 patients.
Kind of peace: SARS-CoV-2 more infected men than women (0.31/100, compared to 0.27/100, as explained above.
Comorbidity and complications: COVID-19 patients who need intensive care are more likely to experience acute heart damage and arrhythmia.
A heart attack is also the main cause of death among SARS patients.
SARS-COV-2 is also reported to be able to interact with collagiositis with ACE2-positive, which can affect the heart function of COVID-19 patients.
It needs to be noted that age and disease are very complex and can affect one another.
Abnormal laboratory findings: C-reactive protein (CRP) in blood represents inflammation or network injury and is recommended as a potential prognosis factor for disease, response to therapy, and final recovery.
The correlation between CRP levels and evaporation and COVID-19 forecasts has also been recommended.
In addition, increases in dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and kinase (CK) creatinine (CK) may also help to predict the outcome.
These enzymes are very high in various organs, especially in the heart and heart, and released during network damage.
So these enzymes are a traditional device for the heart and heart functioning.
Main clinical experience: Toraks photos and the development of temporary clinical experience should be considered together with other things to predict the end result and COVID-19 complications.
The use of steroids: As explained above, steroids are immunosuppressants that are commonly used as long-term therapy for infectious diseases that reduce inflammation.
Because high dose corticosteroids are widely used in patients with severe SARS, many who survive this disease have eventually suffered osteonecrosis with life-threatening abilities and poor quality of life.
Therefore, when necessary, steroids should be used at low doses and for a short period of time in COVID-19 patients.
Mental pressure: As explained above, during the COVID-19 issue, many patients suffered extraordinary stress because they had to pass their long-term quarantine and extreme uncertainty and witness the death of close family members and fellow patients.
Psychiatric advice and long - term support should be given to help this patient recover from stress and return to normal life.
Based on this long-term demographic study, COVID-19 seems to have an epidemiological picture different from SARS.
In addition to applying in the lower respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 can effectively apply in the upper respiratory tract and cause minor or non-infectious bleeding in the early phase of infection, like other CoV causing seizures.
As a result, at the early stage or incubation period, infected patients can produce a large number of viruses during day-to-day activities, which lead to major difficulties in controlling the epidemic.
However, the SARS-CoV transmission is believed to occur when the patient is sick and most do not occur at the initial stage.
Thus, the COVID-19 paper is now much more dangerous and difficult to control than the SARS paper.
At present, great efforts are being made in Tingkok, which includes the quarantine of the Wuhan region and cities around and the quarantine continues almost all the population with the hope of deciding to transmit SARS-COV-2.
Although this approach has been very damaging to the economy and to other sectors in the country, the number of new patients has declined, which indicates an epidemic.
The most optimistic estimate is that the paper will end in March and the breeding phase will last for 3-4 months.
However, some scholars disagree.
Paul Hunter et al. estimates that COVID-19, which seems to be far more distant than SARS, will not end in 2020.
Ira Longini, et al., made a model to predict the end of the epidemic and said that SARS-COV-2 could infection two thirds of the global population.
The Canadian study group reported that SARS-CoV-2 was detected in mid-conca and infected patients who had recovered and returned from the hospital 2 weeks earlier. This indicated that the virus identified could be a relapse, similar to influenza.
However, the signs promise to take place in Tingkok, if found on the basis of the new number of cases, which show that this strategy can be successful at this time.
Ebola reprediction will result in one million cases of death.
However, with quarantine and severe isolation, this disease can eventually be controlled.
Maybe also, like SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 weakens its ability to infection and eventually loses or becomes a virus that is not too pathogenic to humans.
The comparison of COVID-19 epidemics with SARS and MERS epidemics is given below (G.5).
SARS-COV-2 is very easy to transmit through stones or tanks, and maybe also through direct contact with materials contaminated by viruses.
This virus is also found in the fascicles to trigger the possibility of a new transmission, i.e. the feses-ke- mouth transmission.
A recent study in 138 cases reported that 41% of cases may be caused by non-nosomial infections, which include 17 patients with other prior diseases and 40 healthcare providers.
Therefore, joint preventive measures must be taken to protect people, especially health care providers, social workers, family members, workmates, and even those who are in danger of contact with patients or people who are infected.
The first protective line that can be used to reduce the risk of infection is through the use of facial masks, good masks and N95 respiratory masks (the number of the 1860 series) to help control virus transmission.
The mask is made available so that the person who has the potential to be infected will not be caught in the air or attached to the surface of the material.
However, only the N95 mask (the number of series 1860s) can protect against viral inhalation with a minor size of 10 to 80 nm, with only 5% virus can be fully depleted; SARS-CoV-2 is similar to SARS-CoV in terms of size, both have approximately 85 nm.
Since the particle is able to transmit even five masks that have been hit into one, the patient's immediate health care provider must wear N95 (the number of the 1860 series) rather than the mask.
In addition to masks, health care providers must wear appropriate isolation shoes to reduce contact with the virus.
The virus can also cause infection by means of the eyes.
On January 22, 2020, a SARS-CoV-2 infected doctor even though he wears N95 masks; the virus may enter his body through eye contact.
Therefore, health - care providers should also wear eyeglasses or glasses while working with patients.
For public society in the lightest or most vulnerable areas, it is highly recommended for everyone to wash their hands with contaminated soap more often than usual, try to stay at home using solitary quarantines, and avoid contact with people who are potentially infected.
The three feet were secured to guard the patient’s distance.
These actions are an effective method of reducing the risk of infection and preventing the spread of virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 is a new virus for the human world, its high homology with SARS-CoV, as reported on 7 January 2020, has to be a major warning for Tingkok that has strong memories of the 2003 SARS paper.
Nevertheless, on 19 January 2020, the Director of the Wuhan Disease Control Centre satisfied the population by saying that this new virus has a low quality of human communication and limited reproductive capacity and prevention and protection of this disease is not a problem.
This message is so comforting to society, especially when the entire country is preparing for the Semim Festival, so that this critical time is over to include a small scale disease in Wuhan.
Tingkok’s disease control team should learn from this and make great improvements in the future.
For example, this body should (1) be more careful when making public announcements because every word is observed by the population and can change their attitudes and decisions; (2) more sensitive and responsive to unaccompanied information from the clinic than to wait for official reports from a doctor or a competent official; (3) more limited use of the epidemic potential at the initial level, and not to try to please the public; and (4) more often outlets targeted and effective use of public awareness about the disease epidemic and tests and improved social response systems.
The COVID-19 version was caused by a new SARS-CoV-2 virus that began to attack at the end of December 2019.
In less than two months, newspapers have spread throughout Tiankok and more than 50 countries around the world at the time of this release.
Because this virus is very similar to SARS-COV and COVID-19 and SARS also, the COVID-19 paper has an impact like the SARS paper returned.
But there are some clear differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are very important to contain epidemics and treat patients.
COVID-19 is more about lancia than young people and more about men than women, and the level of death is also higher than that of young people.
SARS mortality is higher than COVID-19 (10.91% is compared to 1.44%).
COVID-19 patients transmit the virus even when they are not infected, while SARRS patients usually transmit the virus when they are ill, making it more difficult to build COVID-19 preaching.
This explains some of the reasons for SARS-COV-2 spreading faster and wider than SARS-COV.
The routine RNA function to check SARS-CoV-2 may produce negative results in some COVID-19 patients.
On the other hand, patients who have been healed can still have a positive effect on the virus.
This discovery has greatly increased the risk of HIV transmission.
With the rapid increase in COVID-19 research, some important issues still need to be addressed, namely:
Where does Sars-CoV-2 come from?
Although a major genetic homology found 96% between SARS-COV-2 and two CoV-SARS is similar to the battalion, we still cannot conclude that SARS-COV-2 is from the battalion.
What kind of animal became intermittent species to manipulate the virus from its original mother, to tell its offspring, to humans?
Without knowing the answers to numbers 1 and 2, we can't decide to transmit effectively and we can't get back at any time.
Although molecular models and biochemicals show that SARS-COV-2 is related to ACE2, how exactly does the virus enter the respiratory cell and affect subsequent pathology changes?
Is this virus also related to the cell that expresses ACE2 in other organs?
Without a clear answer to these questions, we cannot achieve rapid and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will this epidemic last?
How does the virus develop genetically during human transmission?
Will this pandemic become global pandemics, end up like SARS, or return periodically like flu?
The answer to the above questions and many other statements is very important, but it may take time to find them.
However, whatever the cost, we have no choice but to stop this epidemic as soon as possible so that we can return to normal life.
Original zoonoses of human crown virus
For thousands of years, mutations and adaptations have caused co-evolution of the crown virus (CoV) and its mother, including humans.
Prior to 2003, two HCOVs (HCOVs) were known to cause rare diseases, such as sore throats.
The release of acute radiation syndrome (SARS) and mid-MERS (MERS) radiation syndrome reverses the situation and reveals how HCOV infection can be very damaging and life-threatening.
The appearance of SARS-CoV-2 in Tingkok centre at the end of 2019 has made CoV a backdrop and surprise us with high transmissions, but with lower pathogenicity compared to his brother, SARS-CoV.
HCOV infection is zoonoses, so our original understanding of the zoonotic HCOV will benefit us.
Most HCOV comes from the wild, and on this animal, the virus is not pathogenic.
Some HCOV reserves are also known.
The identification of the mother of animals has an immediate impact on the prevention of human disease.
A study of the interaction of CoVs in animals can also provide important information on the pathogenicity of CoV in humans.
In this survey, we're looking at the current general picture of the seven HCOV, with a focus on the history of its discovery and its zoonotic origin and transmission of its inter-species.
Most importantly, we compared and contrast HCOV with the summaries of evolution and recombination.
The COV 2019 disease epidemic (COVID-19) is currently being discussed in this context.
In addition, the conditions for effective breast - feeding and the involvement of the virus in the disease’s development were also listed.
Corona virus (CoV) comes from the Coronaviridae family, which is composed of a group of RNA viruses that combines, is positive, and survives alone.
This virus has the largest genome of 26 to 32 kilowabs between RNA virus called "CoV", because its morphology looks like a court in a microscopate.
Based on its structure, CoV has non-segregated genes that have similar access.
About two thirds of the genome consists of two large open readings (ORF1a and ORF1b). Both translated into pp1a and pp1ab polyprotein replication.
Polyprotein experienced further breast-feeding to form 16 non-structural proteins, called nsp1~16.
The rest of the genome is made up of the open reading order (ORF) for structural proteins, which include tonnage or spike (S), pellets or envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleoprotein (N).
A number of complete proteins that are specific to a specific line of descendants are also followed by various lines of CoV.
Based on differences in protein sequence, CV is classified as four genes (alpha-CoV, beta-CoV, gamma-CoV, and delta-CoV); among the four genes, beta-CoV has the largest HCOV gene and is divided into four successive lines (A, B, C, and D).
The phylogenetic evidence shows that mammals and mammals are the main source of alpha-CoV and beta-CoV, while snakes are the primary reserves of gamma-CoV and delta-CoV.
For thousands of years, COV has continued to pass through species limitations and some COVs have become vital pathogens to humans.
So far, there are seven human coV (HCOV) known.
Among the seven of these viruses, HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 are alpha-CoV.
Other five beta-CoVs include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2.
HCOV-229E, HCOV-OC43, HCOV-HKU1, and HCOV-NL63 are often due to small
On the other hand, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 have very pathogenic properties, resulting in low blood pressure infections in relatively many patients and have a higher chance of developing into acute respiratory disorders (ARDS) and manifestations outside the lungs.
The first HCoV-229E strain, B814, was isolated from the patient's nose that fell in the middle of the 1960s.
Since then, more and more knowledge has been collected through a deep study of HCOV-229E and HCOV-OC43, both of which are causing their own health problems.
In fact, this concept has been widely accepted that HCOV infection is generally harmless, until the SARS epidemic occurs.
The 2003 SARS report is one of the most devastating reports in history, which has infected more than 8,000 people with the number of violent deaths of about 10%.
Ten years later, the Middle East virus (MERS) spread the epidemic in the Arab Hemisphere by its sporadic preaching in various parts of the world.
HCoV new 2019 (2019-nCoV), hereinafter called SARS-CoV-2, is a cancer virus epidemic agent of 2019 (COVID-19), which has killed more than 3,120 people and infected more than 91,000 people to 3 March 2020.
The alarm has been sounded and the world has to prepare for the Sars-CoV-2 pandemic that will come.
The seven HCOVs all have zoonotic origins from bats, ticks, or conservation animals.
Many evidence supports the evolution of all HCoVs from colleges. In college, CoV adapts well to non-pathogenicity, but it shows great genetic defects.
The COVID-19 epidemic has led to medical, scientific, social, and moral challenges for Tingkok and the world.
The HCOV zoonotic design gave the task of understanding nature’s movements, motions, and decommissioning factors were intertwined with species.
This study can also lead or facilitate the search for the mother of reserve animals, inter alia, and SARS-CoV-2 amplification, which has an important role in preventing future preaching.
In this survey, we gave general descriptions of zoonotic origin, inter-species transmission, and HCOV pathogenicity.
We particularly looked at and discussed the general theme that HCOV native virus usually has non-pathogenic properties in its natural reserve, but became pathogenic after transmission of aninterspecies to the new gene.
We also explained the HCOV evolution train that increased transmission capacity is often accompanied by pathogenicity.
The end result of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic is also discussed in this context.
CoV animals have been known since the late 1930s.
Before insulation of HCov-229E strain B814, the first of the patient's accepted noses, various CoVs have been isolated from all infected animals, including turkeys, rabbits, dogs, cats, and dogs.
In the last few years, seven HCOVs have been identified.
A brief overview of the history of HCOV’s findings in chronological order (Table 1) is an informative guide.
The first HCOV-229E strain was isolated from the patient's respiratory system that experienced respiratory infection over 1966, which was subsequently designated to be released on the WI-38 line.
Patients infected with HCOV-229E show bone marrow failure, which includes headaches, headaches, nausea, and constipation disorders, including nausea and stones seen in 10~20% of cases.
Next in 1967, HCOV-OC43 was isolated from organ culture and series of pathways in the still offensive brain.
The clinical description of HCOV-OC43 infection appears to be similar to the infection caused by HCOV-229E, which is not statistically comparable to the infection of other respiratory pathogens such as influenza A and Rhinovirus.
HCOV-229E and HCOV-OC43 are distributed worldwide and the most widely transmitted centres during the winter season in the dry areas are present.
Usually, the time to incubate these two viruses is less than a week and is followed by a period of illness for about two weeks.
Based on a voluntary human study, HCoV-229E infected healthy people experience rare
Only a small number of patients with weakened body fats show a serious respiratory infection.
SARS, also known as "atypical pneumonia", is the first HCOV outcome that has been well documented in human history and its etiology agent is SARS-CoV, which is the third found HCOV.
The first case of SARS can be traced back to the end of 2002 in GuangDong Province, Tingkok.
The SARS epidemic results in 8,096 cases reported with 774 deaths, reported in many countries and territories.
Disappearing from the super speaker, each case is thought to cause about two second cases, with 4 to 7 days incubation time and the head of the virus shown on the 10th day of the disease.
The patient who was first infected with SARS-CoV suffered nausea, headaches, headaches, nausea, and vomiting, followed by dyspnea, stones, and respiratory disturbances as a further level disorder.
Limfopenia, abnormal heart function test, and kinase creatinine development are different from that of SARS.
The effects of alveolar infusions, epithelial cell proliferation, and macrophagus increases are also observed in SARS patients.
Next, about 20-30% of patients need intensive care and mechanical ventilation.
In addition to low blood pressure, some organs that contain gastrointestinal, heart, and kidney cells can also be infected in serious cases, often accompanied by systokinitis, which can cause death, especially in patients who are weak.
The virus was first isolated from the lung biopsy opened up by a zero patient's friend traveling to Hong Kong from Guangzhou.
Since then, much has been done for HCoV research.
HCOV-NL63 was isolated from children seven months of age from the Netherlands at the end of 2004.
This virus is initially highly contagious to small children, alone, and vulnerable to respiratory infections.
The image of corizus, conjunctivitis, germs, and bronchiolithitis is found in the disease caused by HCOV-NL63.
Another independent study explains the same virus isolation of the male nasal species of 8-month-old boy suffering pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although it has been identified in the Netherlands, it is actually spread worldwide.
It is thought that HCOV-NL63 represents about 4.7% of generalised respiratory disease and its peaks occur at the beginning of the summer, spring, and winter.
HCOV-NL63 is associated with obstructive larynitis, which is also known as cancer.
In the same year, HCOV-HKU1 was isolated from 71-year-old men who were treated well because of pneumonia and bronchiolithism in Hong Kong.
In addition to pneumonia and community bronchiolitis, HCOV-HKU1 has been reported to be associated with acute name abuse.
Similar to HCOV-NL63, HCOV-229E, and HCOV-OC43, HCOV-HKU1 were found worldwide, resulting in rare respiratory diseases.
The four HCOV communities have all adapted to humans and generally have a small probability of being very pathogenous. However, the case is exceptional because of unknown reasons, such as in the newly reported HCOV-NL63 subtype subtype, which causes serious respiratory infections in Tingkok.
In general, when it comes to the ability to move efficiently and to maintain self - control in humans, this HCOV virus and pathogenity is also lacking.
MERS-CoV was first isolated in 2012 from a 60-year-old patient patient age who had acute pneumonia and failed kidney in Saudi Arabia.
Although most of the cases were confirmed by the laboratory from the Middle East, the cases were reported in the European and Tunisian countries as a result of one second of the second.
Another secondary issue occurred in South Korea in 2015 with 186 cases confirmed.
The MERS clinical manifestation is similar to the SARS clinical manifestation, which is characterized by acute progressive pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many MERS patients also experience acute renal failure, which has occurred only in MERS among HCOV-related diseases.
More than 30% of patients showed gastrointestinal failure, such as diarrhoea and vomiting.
By 14 February 2020, more than 2500 cases of laboratory confirmation were reported with high deaths, namely 34.4%, making MERS-CoV one of the most horrendous virus known by humans.
In the middle of December 2019, a retrospective pneumonial class of patients was found in Wuhan, Hubei Province, Tingkok.
The World Health Organization (WHO) says that the epidemic of low respiratory infections that are occurring and caused by SARS-COV-2 as the Global Health Authority and the disease COVID-19 is growing.
Up to 3 March 2020, 90.053 cases have been confirmed worldwide, with the deaths of 3.4% of the most serious cases.
It is important to note that deaths in Hubei, Tingkok, are greater than 4.2%, while deaths outside Hubei are greater than 1.2%.
SARS-COV-2 causes serious respiratory infections such as SARS-COV and MERS-COV with paints, stones, and breath loss.
Diare was also found in a number of patients.
Pneumonia is one of the most serious diseases and can develop rapidly into acute respiratory disorders.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are very similar because of high nucleotide homology, 82%, they both climb into different phylogenetic trees.
Sars-CoV-2 pathogonism is clearly lower, but more variable than SARS-COV and MERS-COV.
The SARS-CoV-2 infected subject has been reported undisputed and may be participating in the rapid SARS-CoV-2 preaching worldwide.
Comparing and dividing SARS-COV-2 by six other HCOV shows a very interesting equation and difference.
First, the time of the invasion and the cycle of HCOV’s disease is very similar.
In this case, Sars-CoV-2 followed six other HCOV general trains.
Second, COVID-19 outbreaks are placed between SARS-CoV and four other HCOV communities (HCOV-229E, HCOV-OC43, HCOV-HKU1, and HCOV-NL63).
On the one hand, the SARS-CoV-2 infection shows a more general picture of the HCOV Community infection, which includes non-specific or even non-exhaustive
On the other hand, some of the little cases of COVID-19 that are bad can look like SARS-COV infection, though with a slightly lower ration.
Thirdly, the SARS-CoV-2 transmission also shows interesting polar characteristics, comparable to the HCOV community as well as SARS-CoV.
On the one hand, the ability to transmit SARS-CoV-2 is at least as high as the HCOV community.
On the other hand, it's not possible to transmit SARS-COV-2 after a few roads on people still need to be differentiated, such as the SARS-COV and MERS-COV cases.
Finally, like the other HCOV, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected by the fashion model.
"Is SARRS-CoV-2 fecal-oral transmission important, such as in the case of SARS-CoV transmission, at least in certain situations, it still needs to be clarified by the next study."
What's also important to know is whether SARS-COV-2 is as seasonal as in the case of HCOV community.
However, the SARS-CoV-2 image, which includes the ability to transmit, pathogenicity, and further communication in a number of human roads, will have a profound impact on the final achievement of the ongoing COVID-19 paper.
Four HCOV communities that have caused smallpox have adapted to humans.
From another point of view, it can be said that humans have adapted to these four HCOVs.
In other words, good HCoV and humans may be the species of HCoV pandemic.
HCOV, which causes serious disease in humans and humans with HCV, has been diagnosed.
In order for this to happen, HCOV must apply in humans at the same time to allow the accumulation of adaptive mutations to use against the factor of breast clearance.
As a result, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 paper survives and the more people are infected, the greater the likelihood of this virus being fully adapted to humans.
If the virus adapts well, human transmission will be difficult to stop with quarantine or other infections.
For years, four CoV communities have spread into the human population and poisons people with immunocompetence.
This virus doesn't need an animal reserve.
On the other hand, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV very pathogenic have not yet adapted to humans and its transmission into humans cannot be preserved.
Both must defend themselves and make preparations in zoonotic reserves and seek opportunities to spread to humble human goals, perhaps through one or more intermediate and amplification thresholds.
SARS-COV-2 has a picture similar to SARS-COV/MERS-COV and four HCOV communities.
SARS-COV-2 is very easy to transmit like HCOV community, at least now.
However, SARS-CoV-2 is more pathogenic than HCOV community and not pathogenic SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
It still needs to be checked whether SARS-COV-2 will adapt fully to humans and circulate in humans without the mother of reserve animals or between them.
Before we talk about the origin of HCOV animals, we need to discuss the definitions and characteristics of the mother of evolutionist, nature, reserves, environment, and the expansion of HCV.
Animals act as HCOV evolutionary mothers if they have a high degree of proximity and share high levels of homology at the level of the nucleotide sequence.
A major virus usually adapts well and is non-pathogenic in this strain.
In the same way, the mother of the conservatory carried HCOV on further and later in the centuries.
In both cases, the mother is naturally infected and is the mother of the mother of HCOV or the mother of the virus.
On the other hand, if HCOV recently entered the interlocking zone before or about the time of the virus entering humans, the virus has not yet been adapted to the new and often pathogenic mother.
This interlocking mother can function as a zoonotic source of human infection and play as an amplifier mother by allowing the virus to be applied temporarily and then transmit it to humans to amplify the human infection scale.
HCOV may experience oral infections if it is not able to keep its transmission in the womb.
On the other hand, HCOV can also adapt to interlocking and even long - term endometriosis.
In this case, the gap between the banks becomes a reserve of nature.
The epidemiology data indicate retrospectively that the case of zero SARS has a contact route with pets.
A follow-up study of seroprevalence indicated that the animal seller had an IgG anti-SARS-CoV prevalence higher than that of the general population.
The moon (Larvata Larvata) and the common dogs on the animal market are the first identified to carry SARRS-CoV virus that is almost identical to SARS-CoV.
This is not directly supported by the fact that no further cases of SARS have been reported since all attacks on that market have been killed.
In addition, it has been reported that the moon eclipses from the wild or unexploded animal market resulting in a negative test for SARS-CoV. This indicates that the moon eclipse may only act as an interpolation wave, but not the SARS-CoV natural resource.
It should be noted, as 80% of all animals on Guangzhou market have anti-SARS-CoV antibodies, it cannot be approached that many small species may also function as an amplifier among SARS-CoV.
All this mother seems to be the last mother of Sars-CoV.
The search for native animals for SARS-COV next revealed a close-looking CoV bat, called the Rhinolopus family-SARS HKU3 (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3), which is located on the Tingkok horse.
This test results in positive test results for anti-SARS-CoV antibodies and followed by SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3.
This CoV and the other coV researchers share the following nucleotide homology 88-92% with SARS-CoV.
This study has become a foundation for a new concept that bats are fine for new human pathogens.
Some CoVs are similar to SARS (SL-CoV) are also identified from the classroom, but only one, named WIV1, can be isolated as a live virus.
Angiotensin 2 (ACE2) is known as Sars-CoV receptor.
WIV1 from the example of the lighthouse phase is shown using ACE2 as light, light, and human receptors to enter the cell.
Interestingly, convalescent SARS patients can control HIV1.
In the past, WIV1 represented the most closely associated celebrity with SARS-CoV in the classroom, with a 95% nucleotide sequence homology.
Released from the high level of homology between these two viruses, it is generally believed that WIV1 is not a direct parent virus SARS-CoV and that the village is not the mother of the immediate reservoir SARS-CoV.
Phylogenetic analysis grouped MERS-CoV into the same group as CoV-HKU4 bats and CoV-HKU5 bats.
CoV-HKU4 and MERS-CoV use the same breast receptor, i.e. peptidase 4 (DPP4) as a path to virus entry.
The RNA polymerase sequence depends on-RNA MERS-CoV in a phylogenetic way closer to its support in beta-CoV uniquely identified from Europe and Africa.
So far, there's no MERS-CoV alive found in the rural village.
MERS-COV and close-up CoV-HKU25 students only share 87% of the homology of the nucleotide sequence.
As a result, the student may not be an immediate reserve ring MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, the study in the Middle East shows that the Arab army produces seropositive results for specific antibodies that are central to MERS-CoV, such as the Middle East branch in some African countries.
MERS-COV lives identical to the virus found in humans are isolated from the Arab nasal bear's jaw, which further indicates that the brain is the real reserve ring for MERS-COV.
It is also important to note that massive virus explosions are usually rare to treat at the test site infected with MERS-CoV.
It has to be noted that the infected brain is infected not only by the flow of oxygen, but also by the phecal-oral route, which is also the main route of the virus flow from the lungs.
However, the question is still not answered because many confirmed MERS cases do not have contact with animals before birth, possibly the consequences of human-human transmission or transmission routes that involve unknown animal species carrying MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 shares 96.2% nucleotide homology with CoV of RTG13 isolated from Rhinolophus affinis.
As in the SARS-COV and MERS-COV cases, the difference between SARS-COV-2 and RTG13 is too large to establish parental relationship.
In other words, the bats may not be the direct reserve of SARS-CoV-2, unless CoVs that are almost identical were found later in the day.
Perhaps, the mother of an animal between SARS-CoV-2 is among the species of wild satwa sold and killed in the Great Sea Food Market. Many of the early cases of COVID-19 are related to this market, which indicates the possibility of the transmission of animals and humans.
Some recent studies on the basis of metagenomial sequences show that a group of dangerously endangered small materials, known as jamgling (Javanica Manis), may also lead to high beta-CoV associated with SARS-CoV-2.
This new coV straining gene divides 85-92% nucleotide sequence homology with SARS-CoV-2.
However, the CoV is closely related to RTG13 with a 90% greater level of nucleotide sequence.
Both are grouped into two sub-sequent viruses like SARS-CoV-2 in the phylogenetic tree, one of the most common receptor binding domains (RBD) similar to SARS-CoV-2, with a sequence of amino acids greater than 97.4%.
Interestingly, RBD SARS-COV-2 and RTG13 are far different, although the level of secondary homology is higher through higher.
The previous study in the disease stringling also reported HIV contiguous detection of lung samples, which was also shown to be related to SARS-COV-2.
This study adopts a different method of contamination and manicure to produce a partial gene sequence based on about 86.3% complete virus.
We can't afford to interfere as one of the great animals between SARS-CoV-2.
However, there is currently no evidence that supports SARS-CoV-2 directly from tension because of the sequential differences between SARS-CoV-2 and beta-CoV associate SARS-CoV-2.
Moreover, the distance between SARS-COV-2 and RTG13 is even closer than the distance between SARS-COV-2 and beta-COV-SARS-COV-2.
The path of SARS-CoV-2 evolutionists in colleges, amplifiers, and other materials must still be set.
Although the highest secondary homology in RBD is found between SARS-CoV-2 and beta-CoV associate SARS-CoV-2 interpolation, SARS-CoV-2 and RTG13 share the highest homology at the level of the entire genome.
It's too speculative if it's said that the height of similarity between RBD beta-CoV-SARS-CoV-2 relationships is too high and SARS-CoV-2 is driven by convergence evolution whose selectivity is mediated.
Hypothesis also supports recombination between beta-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 straingling and RTG13 in third wild animals.
As a factor in the movement of evolution, many recombination occurs between beta-CoV.
Researchers have not yet been able to decide on the zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2.
In addition to very pathogenic HCOV, HCOV-229E, HCOV-OC43, HCOV-NL63, and HCV-HKU1 are also processed.
Phylogenetic evidence indicates that HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E may come from collavar CoV, while HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 strains have been found in breeding animals.
It is reported that CoV is an ARCoV.2 (Appalachian Ridge CoV) detected in three North American colors shows close relationship with HCoV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E genetically associated with other island CoV, named Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, detected in Ghana, is also considered to be the border border point with Camelidae.
For more information, please see the current information on the origin of HCOV known in Figures 1 and Table 2.
Phylogenetic analysis has shown that HCoV inter-species have been transmitted in history.
In about 1890, when HCOV-OC43 introduced species of mammals to humans for infection, there were signs of respiratory infection.
History of HCoV-229E transmission is not too clear.
Alpha-CoV lighthouse associated with HCoV-229E has been found.
Between them, there's alpha-CoV alpha.
Some evidence supports the transmission of viruses directly from the lungs to humans.
First of all, humans, not alpines, are likely to be in contact with bats in the ecological circle together.
On the other hand, humans have close contact with alpines.
Second, alpha-CoV collavar associated with HCoV-229E has various types of non-pathogenicity at school, while alpha-CoV alpaca causes respiratory disease in infected animals.
Finally, alpha-CoV alpacas were not found in feral animals.
Therefore, the possibility of getting alpha-CoV from HCoV-229E from humans cannot be approached.
In fact, malaria is a direct source of human pathogens, which include rabies, Ebola virus, Nipah virus, and Hendra virus.
Therefore, it is not too surprising that the patient may immediately transmit HCoV-229E to humans.
Another possibility is that while alpha-CoV may function as the HCOV-229E gene longline, alpacas and Arabs may function as an intermediate mother that transmits viruses to humans, just like the case of MERS-CoV.
MERS-COV is a very good example of the transmission of species from bats to Arab cities and from Arab cities to humans.
The original MERS-CoV evolutioner from college is known for the initial identification of the virus and is also strengthened by the following findings.
Clearly, bats are rich strains of virus species for interspecies genetic fragments and interspecies transmission.
Long-term age, close-to-date colonies, strict social interaction, and strong flight skills are all the conditions that support the islanders to become an ideal 'vironial'.
On the other hand, MERS-COV has been in the Arab army for decades.
This virus has been adapted to vessels that have changed from interconnected rings to stable and natural reserves.
MERS-COV causes very rare diseases and protects relatively low mutatis mutatis mutandis in this animal.
Its sporadic transmission to humans happens in vain and humans remain the final seal for MERS-CoV because its transmission can't continue.
It's not like that part of the cell in the MERS-CoV transmission, the part of the tension, if any, in the SARS-CoV-2 transmission.
In particular, beta-CoV constipation is very pathogenic in constipation.
Interglinging may be the final step for the SARS-COV-2 friendship, similar to the shock in the SARS-COV case.
In the coming studies, some possible transmissions of SARS-CoV-2 species from animals to humans should be calculated or approximated.
First, students can only be booked for Sars-CoV-2 friends who are almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.
Humans are able to share their long - term ecological heritage with others by means of a flood or a hailstorm.
Second, stressing can only be one of the most common intermittent amplifications for newly entered Sars-CoV-2 friends.
Humans have infected themselves with the virus by preventing and consuming body meat.
Probably, lots of materials, which include conservation animals, order against SARS-CoV-2.
Antibodies and wild animals need to be tested.
Thirdly, as mentioned above, the combination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 may occur in third species that are well contacting both bats and trangling.
The original search for SARS-CoV-2 animals is still underway.
Apart from all kinds of animal mammals, three main factors on the virus side are also important to make it easier for CoV to pass through species limitations.
First, the relatively high mutatis mutatis mutandis in the RNA replication.
Compared to the RNA virus alone, the idea of mutatis mutatis mutandis CoV can be considered to be "standing" to "high" with a higher rate substitution of ~10-4 per year per drop, depending on the CV adaptation phase for the new male.
CoV has exoribonnuclease anorexorcisation, which results in very high mutability, attenuation, or even invasability.
Interestingly, the nucleotide analogue Remdesivir is known to pressure the coV replication through this exoburnuclease inhibition and RNA polymerase-dependent RNA.
Remdesivir is one of the most promising anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents that will be tested in clinical trials.
Yet, the mutatis mutandis of CoV is about one million times higher than the mutatis mutandis of its mother.
Also, mutatis mutatis mutandis often high when CoV does not adapt to mother.
Compared to the SARS-CoV that has high mutatis mutatis mutandis, the SARS-CoV-2 mutatis mutatis mutandis is actually lower, establishing a higher level of adaptation than human.
Maybe, Sars-CoV-2 has adapted to other mothers who are closely associated with humans.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, this is also true of MERS-CoV that has adapted to the Arab army.
In theory, small probability that genetic stress will soon make vaccines and antiviral agents in the SARS-CoV-2 ineffective.
Second, the large RNA gene in CoV gives extra flexibility in the modification of the gene, for mutation and recombination, to increase the probability of co-evolution among species, which helps to produce new CoV when conditions are met.
This is supported by many unique open readings and protein functions that are applied to the end of 3′ genome.
Thirdly, CoV needs to change the template eventually during RNA replication through the unique "choice-salin" mechanism.
In the sea that works as a bridge bridge, the bridge shift took place during RNA CoV transcription.
A full and subgenome of very homologous RNA can experience recombination to form a new CoV.
Natural recombination phylogenetic evidence has been found on HCOV-HKU1 and HCOV-OC43, as well as on CoV animals such as SL-CoV battalion and CoV-HKU9 battalions.
A virus interaction in its connection to transmission
In addition to the three virus factors mentioned above, the interaction of the virus with the breast receptor is another major factor that affects the transmission of antarspecies.
Here, the SARS-CoV recombination is regarded as a special example, which also shows positive selections during interspecies transmission.
Based on a comparative analysis between the human isolates SARS-CoV and musculoskeletal, SARS-CoV is expected to experience rapid adaptations in different mothers, especially with mutations on RBD protein S.
In general, RBD protein S CoV interacts with cell receptors and intensively becomes the target of maternal antibodies.
At SARS-CoV, RBD is an amino acid of 318 to 510 on S1 fragments, which is connected to ACE2 humans and its receptors as the path to the virus.
RBD SARS-CoV has the ability to detect the different ACE2 receptors, which include
In fact, only 6 amino acid residues that are administered differently between human isolates and present in RBD and 4 of which are located on the basis of receptor binding for interaction with ACE2 receptors.
SARRS-COV stimulates K479N and S487T mutations in its RBD, which may increase protein interaction with human ACE2 receptors.
In other words, these two amino acid substitutions may be very important in adapting the virus to humans.
It must be noted that SARS-CoV-2 has a cell receptor similar to SARS-CoV.
The difference of 30% between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in S1 protein S unit involves affinity of protein S binding with ACE2 may have changed.
In fact, a cryo-EM study showed human ACE2 concentrations and S SARS-CoV-2 protein 10 to 20 times higher than human ACE2 and S SARS-CoV protein.
What's also important to know is if there's any other co-receptor that might be needed to transmit SARS-CoV-2.
Interestingly, HCoV-NL63 is also related to ACE2, but with different parts of S.
There are many other HCOV receptors, such as aminoeptidase N for HCov-229E and 9-O-terasetylase acid for HCOV-OC43.
These receptors may also play a role in the effectiveness of this CoV adaptation in humans after the transmission of antarspecies from its animal breast.
In addition to cell receptors, the end result of HCOV interspecies transmission is also regulated by other factors such as decomposition and decomposition.
The differences between humans and natural reserve mothers, such as bats, Arabs, and mammals, can be a barrier to the transmission of interspecies.
HCOV must take the factor of mother-in-law and pump the mother-in-law factor in order to be effective in transmission of inter-species.
In this case, molecular scores in the field of virus interaction need to be identified and identified.
The whole range is unusual to see the underlying factor and the parent interface of SARS-CoV-2 using advanced CRISPR technology may be useful.
New HCOV output: return to top
Cov's suspicion of failure gave him a great opportunity to show up new HCoV.
In this respect, the coV has been operating as a HCOV gene.
In addition, rapid mutations and genetic recombination also stimulate HCOV evolution and function as two important steps in this process.
For example, the ability or loss of new proteins to modify the phenotypes of the virus has been severely altered.
Among SARS-COV accessory protein, ORF8 is expected to play an important role in human adaptation because of the virus of SARS-CoV, which is isolated from the ORF8 protein chain.
SARS-CoV with 29 nucleotide endpoints found on the strain isolated at the beginning of the human epidemic.
This effect divides ORF8a into ORF8a and ORF8b and is expected to be an adaptive mutation that supports breast replacement.
In addition, SARS-CoV may have a history of recombinant with alpha-CoV and gamma-CoV sequences, with a large number of smaller recombinant areas identified in RNA polymerase based on RNA.
Recombination sites are also identified in nsp9, most nsp10, and some nsp14.
In the same way, the combination events of various generations are shown on the MERS-CoV epidemic, which occurs in the Arab province of Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the reconnaissance events have also been observed in other HCOV places where HCOV has experienced recombination with other coV animals in its non-structural gene.
It should also be noted that the selection of action can be divided into unhindered changes in the viral gene, which is likely to be affected by the release of the virus from the selective pressure caused, such as by the immune system.
An example of this effect is the loss of ORF4 full of HCOV-229E prototype strains resulting from the end of two nucleotides.
While ORF4 alone can be administered on the spread virus and cells associated with HCOV-229E, alpha-CoV alpha shows a single nucleotide poisoning that results in seizures.
Finally, HCOV's new evolution was also driven by the selective pressure on the back of its reserve.
Small or non-circuit layers are detected during the CV infection spread, which shows the adaptations between CV and LV.
Looks like anatomy and physiology adaptable to CV.
For example, failure to respond to the vaccine would result in an effective release of the pathology recommended by CoV.
In addition, the natural killer cell activity in the classroom is forced by the regulation of the NKG2/CD94 receptor receptor and the degree of molecular complex histocompatibilities of low class I.
In addition, high levels of reactive oxygen (ROS) species of high-fat fungal metabolic activity can push the COV replication and affect the gorecsification of exoribonuc acid to give selective pressure for the development of highly pathogenic strains when entering the new vein.
The more pathogenic strain CoV may also develop through recombination, which can lead to protein or new protein formulas for breast adaptation.
So it's not a coincidence that three new HCOVs have appeared in the last two stages.
CoV is non-patogenic or causes a slight swelling in the mouth of its reserve, such as nausea and vomiting.
CoV is applied with force without stirring up a strong mother's immune response.
There's a secret here there's a free carrier and a serious case of human infection.
The stress is particularly due to the increased immune response rate, as well as the presence of systokinitis, with increased renal impairment if the immune response is stronger.
On the other hand, on the bare shoulder, immune response has been released from the CoV replication.
The same strategy to resolve immune responses may be useful in anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapy.
Interferon response is particularly strong at school.
So, type I interferon delivery, at least in the initial phase of SARS-COV-2 infection on humans, should be useful.
In addition, NLRP3 inflammation levels are defective.
For this reason, inflammation of NLRP3 with MCC950 may benefit from COVID-19.
The SARS-CoV-2 operation follows other general events SARS-COV and MERS-CoV.
While beta-CoV nucleic acids that share 95% of the nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV have been found, there are 96% of the coV that divides nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV-2.
Although insects and other animals on the market were found to carry an identical virus with SARS-CoV, the direct range for SARS-CoV-2 has not yet been found.
Beta-CoV trengling that is very homologous with SARS-CoV-2 has been found, which shows that trengling may vary as one of the inter-range or beta-CoV trengling may contribute gene fragments to the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
Although still questioned, there is no evidence that SARS-COV-2 was done by good people in whole or in part.
CoV has become the focus of the recent SARRS-CoV-2 press.
The study of CoV in bats and other animals has greatly changed our perception of the importance of zoonotic origin and animal reserves for HCOV on human transmission.
There's so much evidence that SARS-COV, MERS-COV, and SARS-COV-2 are from the wilderness and are transmitted to humans through the waves of war.
Keep in mind that SARS-CoV infection comes from contact between humans and exposure to the language market, perhaps the end of the language market and all killings in it that effectively end the SARS epidemic.
For the same reason, trangling should be transferred from the language market to prevent zoonotic transmission, remembering that there are some lines of beta-CoV trengling that are closely related to SARS-CoV-2.
However, the truth and the SARS-CoV-2 mechanism are transmitted to humans by means of noise and other materials still need to be classified in future research.
On the other hand, MERS-COV has been in the Arab army for a long time.
This plant serves as an important transport tool and as a primary source of meat, milk, skin, and wool for local society.
The Arabians are widely known throughout the Middle East and Africa.
So, we can't kill all the machines to control MERS, as did in the rural animal market in Tingkok to prevent SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
In order to stop the MERS version, a comprehensive approach must be made to develop vaccines for an effective cell for MERS-CoV and combined with other infection control measures.
Before we get rid of this virus, new genotypes can appear and cause the paper.
A variety of coV zoonoses thrived in the wild.
In particular, the coV's potential zoonotic bats are very complex.
There are many possibilities for this zoonotic CoV to evolve and experience recombination, which results in a new COV that is easier to transmit and/or more deadly to humans in the future.
The culture of eating wild animals in some places in Tingkok has to be abandoned to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
With the experience of SARS, MERS, and COVID-19, better preparation and planning should be applied.
In fact, many viruses have been present on this planet since then.
These viruses are in the reserve of nature until there is an opportunity to preach.
Despite the many features that promote the spread of virus, humans have the opportunity to communicate with natives and other species of wild animals when trained to protect themselves from wild animals.
Continued surveillance of matter needs to be done to understand the environment of the CoV and its natural mother, which will prove useful in preventing the transmission of animals and the coming news.
In conclusion, the most effective way to prevent zoonoses of the virus is for humans to protect the distance from the back of the reserve of natural zoonotic viruses.
Some of the original zoonoses of SARS-CoV-2 have not been found.
First of all, if the patient transmits the advanced SARS-CoV-2 virus to the nervous system, the condition when the patient and the nervous system divides the ecosphere is important to be known.
Second, if there is a much more direct role to play in human transmission, how humans deal with it must be defined.
Third, if there's a third matrix that's actually cross-border, the way it interacts with other species, which includes humans, bats, and vertebrates should be explained.
Finally, because of the abundance of materials, including possible protective animals that may be contracted against SARS-CoV-2, good testing and surveillance should be carried out.
Not known to humans, torso, or other matter, it is expected that SARS-COV-2 or its native virus that is almost identical can be identified in its natural mother at the time of its arrival.
Further research in this field will provide the path of SARS-COV-2 evolutionists in animals, with important implications for the prevention and control of COVID-19 on humans.
The implementation of the "expected case" and "confirmed case" COVID-19 should be carried out
On February 6, 2020, our team published quick advice for the diagnosis and treatment of new Coronavirus infection 2019 (2019-nCoV) based on our experience and became a good reference against pandemics around the world.
Nevertheless, COVID-19 (COVID-19) is a new disease, our understanding and knowledge are growing based on ongoing research and clinical practice; therefore, the diagnosis and nutrition strategy is also being developed.
In this letter, we responded to one of our comments and provided the latest diagnostic criteria for "expected cases" and "confirmed cases" based on the Diagnosis and COVID-19 (seventh version) published by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China.
In December 2019, the new Coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV) has produced a publication, which is now officially called Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) and the virus is called Coronavirus acute radiation syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
On March 11, 2020, WHO explained COVID-19 as a pandemic.
In order to combat SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team has developed quick advice and its guidance has been widely published in Military Medical Research on February 6, 2020.
That captivity lasted a long time since it was foretold.
It should be noted, however, that COVID-19 is a new disease, our understanding and knowledge are growing on the basis of ongoing research and clinical practice; as a result, the diagnosis and nutrition strategy is still being developed.
As an example of the Diagnosis and COVID-19 Diagnosis and Addiction for COVID-19 issued by the National Health Commission of the Republic of Tingkok (http://www.hc.gov.cn/), between 16 January 2020 and 3 March 2020, the Commission has published a total of seven editions with some contexts that have been quite changed.
Our friends received comments from Zhou et al., they introduced the offer of simple scores based on their clinical experience.
Their work has brought new evidence of our Christian neutrality and has proved to be a valuable asset in this expansion all over the world.
We support the work of those brothers and sisters and express our appreciation for them.
However, the results of their work also require a diagnosis based on the latest COVID-19 Diagnosis and Diagnosis (verses of seven test trials) and the latest study.
Based on the seventh edition (3 March 2020), in order to confirm the case, a combination of one of the epidemiological pathways with two clinical manifestations is considered necessary for a comprehensive analysis, or three clinical manifestations are required if there are no clear epidemiological pathways:
Epidemiology: (1) travel or stay in Wuhan City and its surrounding area, or other communities of COVID-19 cases have been reported in the last 14 days before the accident; (2) travel contact with SARS-CoV-2 (with positive nuclear tests); (3) travel with patients suffering from storms or hurricanes in Wuhan City and its surrounding area, or other communities of COVID-19 cases have been reported within the last 14 days before the accident; (4) travel with the confirmed case cluster (≥ 2 cases with lightning and/or air raids occurred in 2 weeks in the small area, such as house, office, school, etc.).
Clinical manifesto: (1) fever and/or inflammation; (2) COVID-19 infection cirrhosis; (3) total white blood cell count shows normal lymphocyte count, decreases, or decreases in baseline levels.
The confirmed case diagnosis should be based on one of the suspected pathogenic or serological evidence as follows: (1) the PCR real-time positive for SARS-CoV-2; (2) the whole sequence of the virus shows high homogenitivity for new known coronavirus; (3) positive for specific IgM and IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in serum testing; or negative IgG-SARS-CoV-2-changes, or titer increases ≥4 lipids at the above stage of recovery in acute phase.
We can see that the real-time PCR test of nuclear assays in the model of an attack or blood stream was added to the second edition (18 January 2020) and third (22 January 2020).
The pathogenic detection of blood samples was added to the fourth and fifth editions (27 January 2020) and (8 February 2020); then, serological evidence was added to the seventh edition.
This modification is based on a further research by researchers to search for optimal nuclear assay detection kits for rapid diagnosis, as well as examples of respiratory fluids including nine blood vessels, which enhance the availability of various species, and support the understanding of certain positive results of antibiotics into the confirmed criteria.
In addition, there is much more evidence that we are alert to the patient’s need for care if we are not alert.
Therefore, Zhou et al. should be promoted because they classify people without clinical experience as "low risk".
The score system also needs to be validated in practice and clinical studies in the future.
As a result, we hope to see more clearly the evidence and ask for more comments.
For diagnosis of "expected cases" and "confirmed cases", we suggest that we follow and follow the latest guidelines in each country.
Our team will also be quick to adjust our direction.
Bangladesh reported five new deaths due to COVID-19, the highest number of deaths
Yesterday, Bangladesh signed five new deaths of COVID-19 that day.
This is the highest number of deaths in one day the result of the virus.
Until yesterday, the Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) Bangladesh reported on the number of cases of infectious diseases reported involving 114 active cases and 33 home - health cases.
Totally 17 deaths.
In a headline, IEDCR director, Dr. Meerjady Sabrina Flora, said that death surrounded four men and a woman.
According to Dr. Meerjady, two cases are over 60 years old, two cases between 51 and 60 years old, and one case between 41 and 50 years old.
He also said two victims came from Dhaka.
On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said COVID-19 as a pandemic.
A hospital officer told Anadolu Agency, a local news agency, that one of the dead was Saifur Raiman Street, director of the Bengal Anti-Corruption Commission, which was treated at the Kuwait Maitree Hospital.
On Saturday, in a video release, the Minister of Road and Coastal Transport, Oaidul Quader, said that public transport would be stopped longer than planned, until Saturday came.
This public transport policy has begun since 26 March and is scheduled to end on Saturday, April 4.
The transport of timber needs -- medicine, fuel, and food -- is still allowed.
The first COVID-19 infection incident recorded in Bangladesh was on March 8, on two newly returned from Italy and also on the wife of one of them.
On March 19, those three people were healed.
SARS-CoV-2 infection exceeds one million worldwide
On Thursday, the total number of cases of Sars-CoV-2 corn virus infection exceeds one million worldwide, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.
At least 52 thousand deaths are associated with COVID-19, a disease caused by cornon virus.
It happened the same day when Malawi confirmed the infection of its first crown virus and Zambia suffered its first death related to the crown virus.
North Korea claims, on Thursday, that the country is one of the few countries that remain free of cornon virus infection.
Until yesterday, the World Health Organization (WHO) reported 1,051,635 confirmed cases, including 79,332 cases in twenty-four hours from 10 a.m. in Central European Time (0800 UTC) on 4 April.
In the United States (AS), more than 244 thousand cases of coronary virus have been reported, resulting in at least 5,900 deaths.
The CBS news agency reported that, according to Johns Hopkins University, more than 1,000 deaths in the United States were caused by cornon virus infection.
Around the world, countries have announced stronger measures to halt the spread of disease.
On Kamsday, Sergei Sobianin, Moscow’s capital, extended his circuit career until May 1.
Nationally, President Vladimir Putin said that Russia's citizens would remain paid without having to go to work until 30 April.

Toco-toco in Australia lowers the purchase threshold of toilet fabric per transaction
On Sunday and Saturday evening, the Australian Woolworth and Coles trading network each lowers the purchase threshold of toilet title to two and one pass per transaction at all stores at national level.
ALDI also applies the limit of one owner, on Sunday.
This link was posted as a message in the accompanying box and on the Facebook page.
The buyer is reported to be preparing for the consequences of the COVID-19 fear when society has to make its own isolation.
On the Rapu day, Woolworths also limited the purchase of toilet titles to send home to one post per message.
This change follows the closure of four gentlemen per transaction that was previously applied to Woolworths and Coles each on 4 and 5 March.
In his press statement on 8 March, Coles reported that with the four gentlemen' removals, "many shops are still out in one hour since the shipment", and called this request "before it ever happened", while ALDI, in a Facebook post on Saturday, called it "unexpected".
The sale "increase in darkness" last week, according to one of the Woolworths talkers.
Toko Costco in Canberra also limits the number allowed up to two weeks ago.
To avoid failure, Coles put more emphasis on the mask and increased the frequency of sending, Woolworths arranged additional preparations, while ALDI prepared for the special Rabu promotion activities that were previously planned.
Russell Zimmerman, executive director of the Peritel Association of Australia, said that peritel tried to improve preparations, but the local government's limits for the time of delivery of the truck made it difficult.
He predicted the cost of production, as the miners tried to meet their demands, and less special promotions.
On Saturday, ALDI announced that since preparation had been released earlier, some shops were not able to hold special rabbis.
In a News.com.au report, Dr. Gary Mortimer, a ritualist at the Queensland University of Technology, said that the store was full of preparations every night.
He stressed that the toilet title was a large volume of goods so low that the number of preparations was low and, when sold, made many empty rooms in the racks so that the looseness of the goods became more and more sensitive.
Coles and Woolworths found [that] if there was a lot of stuff in the rack, if the product like the toilet title and the facility could be bought and there was a large amount, the contract could be reimbursed, Dr. Russell Zimmerman through the ABC News Agency.
The producer of the toilet title from who Gives a Crap said on the last Wednesday that they were out of preparation.
Kimberly-Clark, who made Tsu toilet Kleenex, and Solaris Paper, who made Sorbent, forced them to work 24/7 to care for the crew, according to News.com.au report.
Domain.com, a real estate site, reports that some property sellers offer free toilet titles to the first tenant in Melbourne, while less wool is available because the buyer takes jeans for a long weekend vacation.
The edition of Kamas NT News, a day printed in Darwin, describes eight pages of poetry that are meant to be cut and used as a toilet title.
Toko-toko actually refuses to apply the limit, according to ABC Australia's report on 3 March, they say they are not planning to apply the purchase limit.
Russell Zimmerman added that other products are also in high demand, including masks, maintenance, solid food, hand soap, and soap.
In addition, outside Australia, on Sunday evenings a supermarket in England, Ocado was set up to limit the purchase of the Andres toilet to two dozen barrels.
World Health Organization (WHO) says COVID-19 as a pandemic
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced a COVID-19 report that is happening—a disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2—as a pandemic.
Although the word "pandemi" has only affected the extent to which the disease has spread, not how dangerous the case is, WHO notes the need to motivate the government to act:
All countries can still change this pandemic.
If the country detects, tests, handles, isolates, and mobilizes its people as a response, then Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director General WHO.
We were well aware of the extent to which the preaching work was being carried out and the extent to which it was being carried out.
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, director of the U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention, this pandemic "has never happened before."
He says, in a report published by CNN in February, "other than influenza, there is no virus that has ever been traced from its occurrence to its subsequent global preaching."
Ghebreyesus expressed a similar view, saying, "We've never seen the pandemic that the koronavirus inflicted."
He goes on, "and we've never seen a pandemic that can be controlled at the same time."
The new status quo followed WHO’s decision in January as a global health concern.
The director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease in the United States, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said about this paper, "I mean, this paper will get worse."
Up to Kamas, Associated Press reported at least 126,000 cases of COVID-19 worldwide, which resulted in more than 4,600 deaths.
Koronavirus pandemic 2019-2020 is a cancer virus pandemic 2019 (COVID-19) that is continuing and is caused by a serious respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The publication was identified in Wuhan, Tingkok, in December 2019, as a World Health Organization (WHO) publication on January 30, 2020, and as a pandemic on March 11, 2020.
By 10 April 2020, some 1,61 million cases of COVID-19 have been reported in 210 countries and territories, resulting in some 97,000 deaths.
Some 364,000 people have recovered.
The number of fatalities in the case is estimated to be 4% in Tiongkok, while the whole world is affected from 13.04% to 0.08% in New Zealand.
A general sense of humor, a sense of humor, and a sense of humor.
The complications can include pneumonia and acute respiratory syndrome.
From the time it was spread to the spring of about five days, it could begin from two to four and a half days.
There is no known vaccine or specific antiviral therapy.
The main treatment is symptomatic and supportive therapy. The recommended preventive action involves washing hands, closing your mouth when you are under stress, keeping your distance from others, and ensuring isolation for those who are expected to be infected.
Authorities around the world have responded by making restrictions on travel, quarantine, at night, at work, and at the end of the facility.
This trend has led to serious global economic, social, social, or cultural, political, economic, social, and social unrest, and the widespread lack of food and drink.
Schools and universities have been well closed at national and local levels in 193 countries, affecting about 99.4 percent of the population of students worldwide.
Information on this virus has spread widely and there are xenophobic incidents and discrimination against the people of Tionghoa, people with the birth and appearance of East and South Asia, and people from the region with significant virus cases.
As a result of road cuts and heavy industrial closures, air pollution and carbon emissions declined.
The health authority in Wuhan, Tingkok (Hubei Prefecture Co.), reported the pneumonia cluster on December 31, 2019 and a study was conducted early in January 2020.
Most of these cases are related to the Great Sea Food Market and therefore the virus is thought to have a zoonotic origin.
This virus is called SARS-CoV-2, a new virus that has been found and is associated with the spread of hormonal coronavirus, and SARS-CoV. The first people with cancer were then diagnosed with disease on 1 December 2019, and the latter had no clear relationship with the language class later mentioned.
Among the initial cases reported in December 2019, two thirds of them were related to the market.
On 13 March 2020, an unverified report from South China Morning Post suggests that a case that can be reviewed on 17 November 2019, at a 55-year-old age from the province of Hubei, is likely to be the first. On 26 February 2020, WHO reported that, with a new case reported down in Tingkok, but suddenly increased in Italy, Iran, and South Korea, the number of new cases outside Tingkok has exceeded the number of new cases for the first time in Tingkok.
There may be large numbers of cases that have not been reported, especially among those with minor cases.
Up to 26 February, relatively few cases reported among young people, with 19-year-olds under 19-year-olds forming 2.4% of cases worldwide. The head of British scientist Patrick Vallance believes that 60% of the population of England needs infection before group freedom can be achieved.
The case is based on the number of people who have been tested by COVID-19 and who have been tested by a positive protocol.
By March 23, no country had tested more than 3% of its population, and many countries had done their official duty not to test people with smallpox, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, and Switzerland.
A study published on 16 March found that in Tiongkok, up to 23 January, 86% of COVID-19 infection was not detected, and that undocumented infection was a source of infection for 79% of the documented cases.
A statistical analysis published on 30 March suggested that the number of infections in Italy was higher than the reported cases.
The initial view of the basic reproduction number (R0) for COVID-19 is 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention concluded that this figure could be 5.7.
Most COVID-19 sufferers are healthy.
For those who do not get sick, the time between the ages of 6 and 41 seems to be almost 14 days.
Since April 10, 2020, about 97,000 deaths have been linked to COVID-19.
In Tingkok, up to 5 February, about 80% of deaths occurred in people over 60 years of age and 75% of those who had previously had a history of cardiovascular disease and diabetes. The official deaths resulting from COVID-19 pandemics are generally attributed to deaths that resulted in positive test results for COVID according to the official protocol.
The number of fatalities actually affected by COVID-19 may be much higher, remembering the official number of possible deaths without testing, for example, at home, at the hospital, etc.
Partly data from Italy found that the number of deaths during the pandemic exceeded the official death rate COVID by 4-5 times.
A female spokesman for the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) U.S. admits, "We know that [the number of deaths announced] is lower than the actual number", a statement reinforced by an U.S. study report that is too low. The lowest incidence occurs in pandemics, such as the H1N1 flu epidemic in 2009. The first confirmed death was in Wuhan on 9 January 2020.
The first one to die outside Tiankok was on February 1, in the Philippines, and the first one to die outside Asia was in France on February 14.
Until 28 February, outside Tingkok country, more than each death sentence was recorded in Iran, South Korea, and Italy.
By March 13, more than 40 countries and territories had reported deaths in each country, except Antarctica.
This number varies according to the area and frequency of time, as well as influenced by the number of tests, quality of the health care system, nutrition options, time from the first issue, and the character of the population such as age, type of science, and overall health. The reason for death in the case is the number of deaths divided by the number of ter diagnoses at a given time interval.
According to statistics from Johns Hopkins University, the global mortality rate is 6.0% (97.039/1/617.204) for 10 April 2020.
This number varies according to the region.
In Tingkok, the mortality ratio for the case has declined from 17.3% (for people with 1-10 January 2020) to 0.7% (for people with the injury after 1 February 2020). Other regulations cover the number of fatalities (CFRs), representing the percentage of people who have died from certain diseases, and the number of fatalities of the infection (IFRs), which represents the percentage of people who have died from terdiagnosis and non-terragnoses.
This statistics are not time-consuming and follow a certain population from infection to case resolution.
A number of academics have tried to count these numbers for certain populations.
Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine University of Oxford estimates the number of fatalities of pandemic infection overall between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The pressure on this estimate range runs with the results of the first test for COVID-19 in Germany and a statistical survey that analyzes the test on CFR estimates.
WHO insisted that this pandemic could be controlled.
The points and endings of this publication are unclear and may vary according to location.
Maciej Boni from Penn State University says, "Not even controlled, the paper is usually leaking and then starts falling when it's ready to disappear.
But it's almost impossible to make a project that makes sense right now about when that happens."
Senior Minister of Tingkok physician Zhong Nanshan believes that "this paper may end in June" if the entire country can be mobilized to follow WHO's advice on steps to halt the spread of the virus.
On March 17, Adam Kucharski from London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine said that SRS-CoV-2 "will continue to travel, possibly up to one or two years."
According to a study conducted by Neil Ferguson's Imperial College, physical limitations and other steps will be required "until the vaccine is available (maybe 18 months or more).
William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University says, "I think it's a small possibility that this coronavirus, because it's very easy to transmit, can disappear all of it" and this disease "may change into seasonal disease, which comes back every year."
The virus will depend on the frequency of groups and mutation levels.
The COVID-19 cycle can be relatively non-specific and the infected person can be unaccompanied.
Two most common cases are breast cancer (88%) and breast cancer (68%).
A lack of common symptoms include fatigue, the production of inflammation, loss of breathing, breathing problems, stomach and brain pain, headaches, headaches, nausea, vomiting, haemotypes, diarrhoea, or synoses. WHO says that about one in six people become sick and experience breathing difficulties.
The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) provides a range of symptoms ranging from respiratory problems to blood pressure or breast-feeding, convulsions, swelling of the face and lips, and swelling; medical attention is immediately recommended if these events occur. Further development of disease can be severe pneumonia, acute respiratory syndrome, sepsis, sepsis, septic disease, and death.
Some people who are infected may be asymmetrically, i.e. without clinical examinations, but with the results of tests that confirm infection, it is suggested that those who are close to the infected should be severely tested and tested to ensure that they are not infected.
The Tiononghoa think the asymmetrical ratios are affected from a few to 44%.
Incubation period (time between infection and pregnancy) usually affects between 1 to 14 days, most often 5 days. For example, the number of COVID-19 sufferers who lost 30% of their initial smoking and then fell to 15%.
The information covered in this brochure may not apply fully to your situation because of tax laws or other laws in your country.
The COVID-19 communication is believed to occur mainly in close contact and through a small droplet produced during the rock, swimming, or talking; the contact is contact within a distance of 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
The study found that uncooked stones could cause dropped droplets to be raised 4.5 metres (15 feet) to 8.2 meters (27 feet).
Some researchers suggest that the virus may also be released by a smaller droplet that lasts longer in the air and is produced when talking. The droplets can also be produced when breathing, including when talking, although this virus is not widely released by air.
The droplet can fall in the mouth or closet of a man who's near it or maybe live in the bushes.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and cardiac resuscitation (RJP), can turn the oxygen secret into aerosol and spread over the air.
The preaching work can also be accomplished if a person reaches out to someone who has been infected with contagious diseases, including skin disease, sight, kidneys, and mouth problems.
While there is concern that the virus can spread through the phase, this risk is believed to be low.
The Tingkok government denied the possibility of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in fecal-oral terms.The virus most spreads within the first three days of the outbreak, although the preaching may take place before the outbreak of vision and at the next level of disease.
The results are positive until three days before the arrival of the bridegroom, which may lead to the arrival of the Bridegroom’s arrival.
Only a few reports of asymmetrical cases confirmed by the laboratory, but asymmetrical findings have been identified by some countries during the study of contact surveys.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) states that although it is not fully clear how easily this disease spreads, one person in general is infected by two to three others.
In particular, it was found that the virus can be detected up to three days on plastics (polypropylene) and on a 304-cartilage plate, one day on the cardboard, and more than four hours on the shoulder.
However, this variation depends on temperature and temperature, and the conservation and other animals have been tested positive COVID-19.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit viruses to humans, although the British authorities suggest that they wash their hands after contact with animals, such as after contact with surfaces that may have been infected by infected people.
Coronavirus acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new virus, first isolated from three persons with pneumonia related to the acute respiratory disease cluster in Wuhan.
All new SARS-CoV-2 viruses are related to coronavirus in nature. Outside the human body, this virus can be destroyed if it is exposed to the surrounding area, which extends its protection amplifier. SARS-CoV-2 is closely associated with the original SARS-CoV.
The virus is thought to have a zoonotic origin.
Genetic analysis reveals that coronavirus is genetically classified with Betacoronavirus gene, in subgenus Sarbecovirus (bger of B) along with two cervical glands.
This virus has 96% equal to the total level of genome by example of other hormonal viruses (BatCov RatG13).
In February 2020, a Tionghoa researcher found that there was only one amino acid difference in certain parts of a sequence of genotypes between infectious viruses and human viruses.
To date, the comparison of the whole gene finds the largest of 92% of the genetic material between coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2, is not enough to prove that the coagulation is the limit of the SARS-CoV-2.
The virus infection can be diagnosed temporarily on the basis of pregnancy, but confirmation was finally done through the response of the reverse polymerase transcription (rRT-PCR) chain to the infected secret or through CT titration.
A study comparing PCR with CT in Wuhan showed that CT is significantly more sensitive than PCR, but less specific, with many
In March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommended "CT cannot be used as a first line test in the diagnosis of COVID-19."
WHO has issued some RNA test protocols for SARS-CoV-2, which were first released on January 17.
Test using the polymerase transcription response line back real-time (rRT-PCR).
Tests can be applied in such cases as smoking or blood.
The results were generalized in hours and days.
In general, this test is carried out on a nasopharyngic procedure, but it can also be used by a number of laboratories and companies that are developing serologic tests that detect antibodies.
On April 6, 2020, not one of these serology tests proved to be sufficiently accurate to be widely accepted.
In the U.S., the serological test developed by Cellex has been approved for use only by a certified laboratory.
The characteristics of radiographic and tomography are computerized (CT) in humans who automatically include the basic glass peripheral asymmetric opiates and have no pulmonary effusion.
The Italian Radiological Society is drawing up an international database for the detection of the confirmed case.
Because of the spread of other infections such as adenuvirus, non-confirmation of PCR has limited specificities in identifying COVID-19.
A major study in Tingkok compared the results of breast CT with PCR and showed that despite a lack of specific infection, titration is faster and more sensitive so that it is recommended to be considered as an epidemiological healing tool.
The neuronal network of convulsions based on intelligence has been developed to detect viral arthropods with radiographic and CT.
The strategy to prevent this disease involves keeping your personal hygiene clearly clean, washing your hands, avoiding eye contact, lips, or mouth before washing your hands, and wearing shoes when you lie down or wash your hands and immediately wash your hands towels.
People who may already be infected are advised to wear masks in public places.
The government in various regions has restricted or threatened to stop all non-expendable travel to and from the country and area where the press is located.
However, the virus has reached its peak in most parts of the world.
This means that the virus has spread into society, and some members of society do not know where or how they are infected. Health care that may be infected is advised to do standard prevention, contact prevention, and eye protection.
The use of local data from the phone by the government for this purpose has aroused a private problem, with a statement from Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations that undermine this kind of surveillance.
Several applications have been implemented or recommended for voluntary use, and on April 7, 2020, more than a group of experts working on private reception solutions, such as using Bluetooth to record user distance approaches to other phones.
Next, the user will receive a message if they are close to someone who is positive for COVID-19.
There is no COVID-19 vaccine, although many organizations are working to develop it.
Washing our hands after touching a dead body.
CDC recommends that people wash their hands often with soap and water for at least two decades, especially after toilet or when their hands are exposed to dirt; before eating; and after washing their teeth, stones, or pools.
This is because, outside of the human body, the virus is killed by the domestic fire that destroys its protective layer.
In addition, CDC recommends the use of alcohol-based handicrafts with less than 60% alcohol based on volume when soap and water are not available.
WHO encourages people not to touch eyes, lips, or mouth before they wash their hands.
The surface can be decontaminated using a number of pathways (in one minute of infection for the surface area), including ethanol 62–71%, isopropanol 50–100%, hypochlorite 0.1%, peroxide hydrogen 0.5%, and povidone-iodine 0.2–7.5%.
Other pathways, such as benzalconium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate, are less effective.
CDC recommends that if there are suspected or confirmed COVID cases in the public facility, such as office or child detention facilities, all areas such as offices, bathrooms, public areas, electronic devices such as tablets, touch screens, keyboards, remote control, and ATM machines used by the sufferer, should be disinfected.
Health organizations recommend that people close their mouth and lips to one another or use their fingers when it is hot or dry and that they immediately wash their lips.
The mask is recommended for those who may have been infected because of the use of masks that limit the volume and length of time that the sprays are exposed to when they speak, smell, and smell.
WHO has issued instructions on the time and style of wear masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, "the use of masks can reduce people's tendency to touch their faces with insufficient clean hands, which is the main source of cure."The mask is also recommended for use by those who care for others who may suffer from this disease.
WHO recommends the use of masks by healthy people only if they are at high risk, such as those who treat COVID-19 sufferers, although WHO also admits that wearing masks can help prevent people from touching their faces.
Some countries have begun to promote the use of masks to members of society.
In the U.S., CDC recommends the use of unmedicine facial masks made of cake. In particular, use of medical masks is recommended once used for healthy societies, especially when approaching (1 meter (3 feet) or less) with others.
Hong Kong recommends wearing masks when using public transportation or living in many places.
The Thai health agency encouraged people to make tea at home and to clean it every day.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia have prohibited their society from going out to public places without wearing masks or covering their teeth and mouth.
On March 16, Vietnam asked all its citizens to wear masks when going to public places to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government ordered that everyone who entered the prison to wear a mask.
Israel demanded that all its citizens wear a mask when they were in public.
Taiwan, which has produced ten million masks per day since the mid - March period, has been obliged by train and bus to wear a mask on April 1.
Panama is obliged to use facial masks every time it comes out of the house, and it recommends making facial masks for those who cannot afford to buy facial masks.
Face masks are also widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, and Singapore.
Social exclusion (also called physical exclusion) is an infection control that is meant to slow down the spread of disease by making contact between individuals.
Social networking includes carantine; travel services; and school finishings, workplaces, stadiums, theaters, or shopping centers.
People can use social networking techniques to stay at home, limit their travel, avoid many areas, use greetings without contact, and take care of other people’s physical needs.
At present, many governments have imposed restrictions on or bans on social media.
The majority of people gathered, recommended by the United States authorities and health organizations, started from 250 people (unless there are COVID-19 messages in one area) to 50 people, and then 10 people.
On March 22, 2020, Germany banned meetings in public areas involving more than two people. Lancia and people with medical conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, hypertension, and the immune system are at risk of serious disease and higher complications recommended by the CDC for possible use in homes in areas with public health. At the end of March 2020, WHO and other health bodies began to replace the use of the term "social exclusion" as "physical exclusion", to explain that its objective is to reduce physical contact by maintaining social relations, either virtually or from a distance.
The use of the term "social exclusion" has the effect that people must completely isolate themselves from society and not force people to remain in contact with others by alternative means.
This recommendation includes the conclusion to having sex only with people who live with you and have no virus or virus cure.
Insulation alone at home is recommended for those who are diagnosed with COVID-19 and those who are expected to be infected.
Many governments are responsible for or recommending health care for the entire population living in the area where they live.
Carantina's instructions stand out for those involved in high risk groups.
People who may have been suffering from COVID-19 and those who have recently moved to the country or region with COVID-19 preaching are widely advised to do quarantine for 14 days since the possibility of the last battle.
The strategy in paper control is protection or suppression, as well as migrating.
Protection is carried out at the initial stage of publication and aimed at tracking and isolation of infected people and taking other steps to control infections and vaccinations aimed at halting the spread of disease to the entire population.
When it is no longer possible to include the disease, try to change to the medicament level: these steps are taken to slow down the preaching work and reduce its visibility on the health and social care system.
The combination of protective and mitigating actions can be done at the same time.
Supresi needs more extreme steps to reverse pandemics by reducing the number of primary reproductions to less than 1st part of the disease prevention is trying to lower the epidemic peaks, known as epidemic curves.
This lowers the risk of exposure to health services and provides more time for the development of vaccines and treatments.
Non-farming interventions to deal with publications include prevention actions for individuals, such as hand cleaning, wearing facial masks, and standing quarantines; steps at the level of society aimed at physical exclusion, such as closure of schools and canceling mass meetings; social protection to promote reception and participation in such interventions; and steps at the level of the environment, such as cleaning of the surface. Other drastic actions aimed at keeping the paper made in Tingkok when the public is in real trouble, such as closing the school and canceling the meeting; measures to encourage reception and participation in such interventions; and steps at the level of the environment, such as cleaning of the surface.
Other countries also take various steps to limit the spread of virus.
South Korea has identified local media and cartoons, as well as warnings about the movement of infected people.
The ransom makes possible the financial support of the injured person who makes his quarantine possible and who puts on a large weight of money for those who have failed to do so.
Taiwan has increased the production of facial masks and has condemned drug dealers. Simulating for Britain and the United States shows that metigization (the delay, but does not stop the preaching of the epidemic) and suspension (the turning of the epidemic growth) has a major challenge.
The optimal mitigating effect can reduce the demand for health care to 2/3 and death to half of it, but it still results in hundreds of thousands of deaths and serious health systems.
Suspension may be selected, but it should be maintained during the virus continues to spread in the human population (or until the vaccine is available, if this first vaccine is available), because if it is not, the resuscitation will return quickly when the stages of recovery are postponed.
Long - term intervention to pressure the pandemic into a social and economic way of life.
There is no specific antiviral medicine approved for COVID-19, but development efforts are under way, including existing drug tests.
Taking in free fluids, drinking sufficient water, and restful rest can help alleviate anxiety.
Depending on the degree of inflammation, oxygen therapy, intravenous flow, and breathing support may be required.
The use of steroids can improve the patient’s condition.
Some animals previously approved for other virus treatment are intended to be used in the treatment of COVID-19.
WHO also says that some "traditional and domestic treatments" can alleviate the pain caused by SARS-CoV-19.
WHO says that improving capacity and adapting health services to the needs of COVID-19 patients is a key step in responding to the press.
ECDC and WHO regional European offices have issued grants for primary hospitals and health services to reduce resources in various regions, including focusing on laboratory services for COVID-19 tests, if it allows for the abolition of electoral procedures, sharing and isolation of COVID-19 positive patients, and improving the capacity of intensive care by training staff and increasing the number of ventilators and sleeping sites.
There are various theories about the origin of the first case (called nol patient).
The first known new Coronavirus case can be traced back to December 1, 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei, Tingkok.
Within a month, the number of cases of coronary disease in Hubei increased rapidly.
Most of these cases are related to the Grossir Food Market, which also sells live animals, and one theory says that virus comes from one of these animals; or, in other words, virus has a zoonotic origin. A pneumonia cluster is not known for any reason on December 26, and is handled by Dr. Zhang Jixian at the Hubei Province Hospital, who informed CDD Jianghan Wuhan on December 27th.
On December 30, a group of doctors at the Wuhan Center of Diseases told their colleagues about "coronavirus like SARS".
Eight of this doctor, including Li Wenliang, was warned by the police because they spread lies, and the other, Ai Fen, was condemned by his superiors because of the warning he issued.
The City of Wuhan Health Commission then issued a public announcement on December 31 and informed WHO.
Many cases of pneumonia are reported to the health authorities in Wuhan, who then initiated research in early January, and at the beginning of the press, the number of cases increased twice five times every seven and a half days.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus spread to other Tiankok provinces, supported by migration during the New Imlek Year and because Wuhan was the main vehicle transport centre and transit site.
On January 20, Tiongkok reported nearly 140 new cases each day, including two in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
The official data below shows that 6,174 people have experienced an accident on 20 January 2020.On 26 March, the United States passed Tingkok and Italy with the highest confirmed number of cases in the world. By 9 April 2020, more than 1.61 million cases have been reported worldwide; more than 97,000 people have died worldwide and more than 364,000 are cured.
About 200 countries and territories have at least one case.
Because of the European pandemic, many countries in the Schengen area limit freedom of movement and make border controls.

At first, the UK response to this virus was one of the most common among the most vulnerable countries, and until March 18, 2020, the British government did not take any social exclusion measures or mass quarantine measures against its citizens.
As a result, the government received criticism because it was considered to be less sensitive and less intense in dealing with public concerns.

On the other hand, Tingkok’s assistance was well received in some parts of Latin America and Africa. On April 2nd, the World Bank destroyed emergency support operations for developing countries.
WHO commends Tingkok’s efforts to overcome and contain epidemics.
WHO noted the difference between SARS 2002-2004 when Tingkok's authority was accused of closing up so that it was time to try to prevent and protect and crisis with the central government "providing regular advertising to prevent the New Imrek Year's holiday."
On 23 January, in response to the central government's decision to apply the transport ban in Wuhan, WHO representative Gauden Galea said that although it was "explainly not WHO's recommendation", it was also "a very important indication for the commissioning of epidemics at the most concentrated site" and he referred to it as "before it occurred in public health history". On 30 January, after confirming human recovery to people outside Tingkok and the increase in the number of cases in other countries, WHO reported this as the World Health Administration (PHEC) as the sixth step since the 2009 epidemic.
Director General WHO Tedros Adhanom said that PHEIC was said because there is "a global risk of preaching, especially in countries with low and middle rates that have not yet had a poor health system.
In the face of travel cuts, Tedros says that "there is no reason to take steps that hinder international travel and trade unnecessaryly" and "WHO does not recommend trade and movement cuts."
On February 5, WHO urged global society to contribute $675 million that would be used to penalize the preparation of low-income strategies in low-income countries, rather than call it an emergency to support countries that "have no system to detect people who are infected by the epidemic."
Further, Tedros made a statement that "the limit of our strength is on the weakest range" and forced international society to "investment today or pay more prices later."In a press conference on 11 February, WHO set COVID-19 as a disease name for this virus.
On the same day, Tedros said that Secretary General PBB Antonio Guterres agreed to give "the whole power of the PBB system".
Then, the PBB activates the Crisis Management Team to allow for coordination of the entire PBB response, which, according to WHO, will allow them to "focus on health response, while others can use their skills to deal with the media in the social, economic, and wider development."
On 14 February, a team of Gabungun Missions with Tingkok, led by WHO, was activated; this team was aimed at providing international staff and WHO in Tingkok in a range to help domestic management and assessing "the level of hunger and disease" by hosting workshops and meetings with the national level and to make field visits to assess "the prevention of pollution at the provincial and coastal levels, including pollution and pollution." On 25 February, WHO said that "the world must do more to prepare itself to face the potential of the koronavirus" and that, although there is still too much to call it a pandemic, countries must still be "in the stage ready".
Faced with a growing press in Iran, WHO sent the Group of Missions there to evaluate the situation. On 28 February, WHO officials said that the global risk assessment of koronavirus would be raised from "high" to "high-risk", which is the highest level of alertness and risk assessment.
In a statement, Mike Ryan, executive director of WHO's health care program, warns that, "This is the time every government on this planet is facing the reality: Be careful.
This virus may come to your place and you must be prepared," and insist that the right steps can help the world avoid "the worst".
Further, Ryan says that the current data does not allow public health offices to say global pandemics, and says that such a statement means "on the basis of which we accept that every person on this planet will be exposed to the virus."
On March 11, WHO announced that the koronavirus was a pandemic.
Director General WHO said that WHO "care will be concerned about the level of public health and alarm, as well as the level of activity that is alarming." WHO receives iron criticism because it is not appropriate to deal with pandemics, which includes delays in declaring public health levels and classifying viruses as pandemics.
One of the most serious reactions included the death of 733,000 people on April 6, which was directed to the Director General of WHO Tedros Adhanom in order to support himself.
On March 26, 2020, ten HAM PBBB insisted on respecting the rights of each individual during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The group of experts said that each person has the right to intervene in life-saving and government is responsible for this.
This group emphasizes that at least the source of energy or health insurance cannot be used as a fact to discriminate against certain groups.
Experts argue that each individual has the right to health, including the poor, minority groups, lancia, internal refugees, tourism, people living in very poor conditions, people in prison, refugees, and other groups in need of government support.
The international government is trying to address the social and economic impact of the COVID-19 crisis.
The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Construction has destroyed the programme to provide timely and comprehensive information on the response to reality in countries around the world, along with advice and advice.
From the reality of strengthening the health and economic system of the world to overcome the vision of the region and travel bans, the digital centre includes National Public Prosecutors, and aims to help countries learn from one another and to facilitate the coordinated global approach in the face of koronavirus.
The Tingkok government received criticism from the United States, Prime Minister of the British Office Raya Michael Gove, and the son of President Brasil Jair Bolsonaro, Eduardo Bolsonaro, on the first presidential ceremony in the province of Hubei, Tingkok.
A number of provincial administrators of the Tiankok Communist Party (CPC) have been halted by a ban on their campaign in Central Tiankok, which is a sign of a lack of political response to the press in the area.
Some commentators believe that this step is intended to protect the Secretary-General of the Xi Jing Communist Party from public anger related to the koronavirus.
Some Tingkok officials, such as Zhao Lijian, refused prior recognition of the original coronavirus paper in Wuhan, and supported the conspiracy theory on COVID-19 from the US or Italy.
The U.S. government Donald Trump called koronavirus "Tingkok virus" or "Wuhan virus" and said that "the closing action of Tingkok gave power to the virus that is now changing into a global pandemic." This statement was finally criticized by a number of critics as racism and "rejecting the attention of its government failure in dealing with the korona virus."
The Daily Beast receives an US government message that provides a communication strategy and clearly from the National Security Hall, with a strategy that is defined as "All about Tingkok.
We were told to try and deliver this message in any way possible, including press and television conferences." Media such as Politico, Foreign Policy, and Bloomberg complained that Tingkok's efforts to send help to the most vulnerable countries are part of the propaganda campaign to affect the world.
U.S. Foreign President Joseph Borrell warns that there are "geo-political components, which include wars to influence through the reverse of the facts and 'freedom policy'."
Borrell also says that "Aggressively pushes the message that, unlike the U.S., they are responsible and can be relied upon."
Tingkok also urged the United States to withdraw the sanctions of Syria, Venezuela, and Iran, as well as to send aid to the two last countries.
Jack Ma's contribution was 100,000 masks for Cuba blocked by US sanctions on April 3.
The U.S. authorities were also charged with extrajudicial treatment of foreign nationals in their own countries.
There are also masked links reported between other countries, such as Germany, Austria, and Switzerland, as well as the Czech Republic and Italy.
In addition, Turkey took hundreds of fans for Spain.
At the beginning of Maret, the Italian government criticised at least the European Union solidarity with the most vulnerable Coronavirus in Italy.
Maurizio Massari, the great Italian leader for the European Union, says that "There is Tingkok who responds bilaterally.
Of course, this is not a good sign of European solidarity."
On Tuesday, 22 March, after receiving a call from the Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, Russian President Vladimir Putin forced the Russian army to send military forces, special vehicles, and other medical equipment to Italy.
The Italian newspaper La Stampa quotes "high-level policy source" as saying that 80 percent of Russia's aid "is of no use or little benefit to Italy."
The source accused Russia of having a geopolitical and diplomatic mission attack.
President Lombardy, Attlio Fontana, and Minister of Foreign Affairs of Italy Luigi in Mayo left the press report and expressed their appreciation.
Russia also sent medical aid to the United States.
According to the Kremlin Dmitry Peskov speech, "when offering assistance to the US partners, [Putin] assumes that if the US producers of equipment and medical materials get an opportunity, they will also be able to repay if necessary."
NATO military training "Defender 2020" planned in Germany, Poland, and the Baltic countries, the largest NATO war training since the end of the Cold War, will be on a smaller scale.
The Secretary-General of the Nuclear Weapons Campaign Kate Hudson criticised the training of Defender 2020: "In the current public health crisis, this training not only endangers the lives of U.S. troops and many participating European countries, but also the people of their place of operation." The Iranian government was very concerned about this virus, with about two dozen members of parliament being infected with five political prisoners at this time or earlier.
On March 14, 2020, President Iran Hassan Rouhani wrote an open letter to world leaders to ask for help and said that his country was struggling to fight corruption because of its lack of access to the international market as a result of the United States sanctions against Iran. This paper has prompted the United States to adopt public social affairs in other countries as well as others, including universal health care, child care, family payroll, and higher levels of education for public health.
Political analysts estimate that this could lead to a negative turn of opportunities for Donald Trump to be reelected in the 2020 presidential election. The diplomatic relationship between Japan and South Korea has deteriorated because of this pandemic.
South Korea criticises "the Japanese's ambitious and passive campaign" after Japan announces that every person who comes from South Korea will be placed in the country's two-week charity at a place shown by the government.
At first, the view of South Korea's society was partly linked to President Moon Jae's response to the crisis.
Many Koreans have signed a petition, which is good for the Moon, based on their complaints about the government's failure to deal with the press, or to commend their attitude.
Some commentators expressed concern that this could allow the government to strengthen its power.
In Hungary, its parliament has chosen to allow Prime Minister Viktor Orbán to rule by decree without time, to suspend parliaments and elections, and to punish those who are supposed to spread false information about the virus and the crisis.
The coronavirus version is based on cases of military shortage, which stem from an increase in global use of equipment to counter the paper, buying due to panic, and disrupting industry and logistics operations.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration warned about drug shortages and medical devices as they increased consumer demand and stress.
Some areas also experience purchases due to panic causing the abundance of wood demand, such as food, toilet smoke, and bottled water, which reduces the shortage of fuel.
In particular, the technology industry has warned of the spread of e - mail.
According to WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom, the demand for self - defense equipment increased 100 times.
This request resulted in a price increase of up to 12 times the normal price and an increase of between four and six months.
This also causes a lack of self-defense equipment worldwide, and WHO warns that it will endanger health.
In Australia, our employer offered us a new opportunity to sell our products in Tingkok.
This activity has led to the failure of milk formula in some supermarkets and was finally banned by the Australian government. The high prevalence of COVID-19 cases in northern Italy and the Wuhan region, as well as the high demand for food products, were avoided from food shortages.
Tingkok and Italy's steps in combating the collection and illicit trade of products are so important that there will be a sharp shortage of food that can be eliminated in Europe and North America.
North Italy, with its large agricultural production, has not yet experienced significant fertility, but prices can rise according to industry.
Only temporary food supplies were available, even in the city of Wuhan, when the Tiankok government offered animal sacrifices to ensure the safety of the community’s citizens.
Similar approaches are also found in Italy, which is responsible for food producers to keep advice on such a situation.
The global economic crisis has been felt in Tingkok: according to a media report on 16 March, the economy in Tingkok has been seriously affected in the first two months of 2020 by the steps taken by the government to stop the virus preaching, and by 20.5% of the sales of bicycles.
Since Tingkok is a major economic centre and factor, the virus is considered to pose a major threat to the global economy.
Agathe Demarais from Economist Intelligence Unit believes that the market will continue to decline until there is a clearer picture of the potential of final results.
In January 2020, some analysts concluded that the impact of the epidemic on global growth could go beyond the 2002-2004 SARS press.
An estimate from the University of Washington in St. Louis, U.S.A., points to more than $300 billion on the world’s military front, which can last for two years.
The National Oil Exporting Organization (OPEC) is reported to be "fashioned" after the price of land oil has been reduced by a drought resulting from a lack of demands from Tingkok.
On February 24th, the global market fell because of the significance of the number of COVID-19 cases outside Tingkok country.
On 27 February, due to increased concern about the Coronavirus version, various U.S. branch indexes, including NASDAQ-100, S&P 500 Index, and Dow Jones Industrial Average, registered births since 2008, with Dow fallen 1.191 points, the birth of one day since the financial crisis 2007-2008.
The three indexes cover the week with more than 10% births.
On February 28, Scope Ratings GmbH authorized Tingkok government credit reductions but maintained a negative Outlook.
And yet again, because of the concern about the koronavirus, the biggest birth took place on March 16.
Many people think that economic woes can happen.
The economist Mohammed El-Erian praised the steps of central bank and part-time banks.
The central bank reacted faster than they did during the 2008 monetary crisis.
Paris is one of the most vulnerable sectors because of the ban on travel, the closure of public places, and government actions that limit travel around the world.
As a result, many creations canceled flights because they had little demand, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines, and Qantas, while regional British Flybe created.
It looks like the road industry is on a level that has never been seen before.
Some railway stations and railway stations have also been closed.
The epidemic coincides with Chunyun, a major travel period associated with the New Imrek Year’s holiday.
A number of events involving many people have been canceled by central and regional governments, including the New Year's Imrek festival, and the swastika companies have also closed their shops and offices, such as Hong Kong Disneyland and Shanghai Disneyland.
Many New Year’s events and places of worship were closed to prevent mass meetings, including the banned city of Beijing and traditional temple decorations.
In the 24 of the 31 provinces, towns, and districts of Tingkok, the authorities extended the New Year’s holiday until February 10 and ordered that most jobs not be opened until that date.
These areas represent 80% of the country's GDP and 90% of exports.
Hong Kong has increased the spread of infectious diseases to the highest level and has announced the state of affairs, closed school to Maret, and canceled the New Year's celebration. The railway sector is globally exposed because of reduced working hours or temporary closures.
Visits to European and Latin America have dropped by 40%.
North American and Middle East experienced 50–60 percent of births.
This also results in 33-43% generation and the slow pace of walking to the mall in March compared to February.
The World Trade Center operator has taken additional steps, such as increased sanitation, thermal exchangers to check the buyer's temperature, and the launch of the event. According to the Commission of the PBB for Latin America, the recession caused by the pandemic can cause people in extreme poverty in Latin America to increase between 14 and 22 million people compared with the situation without pandemics.
In January and February 2020, about five million people in Tingkok lost their jobs during the outbreak of the Wuhan epidemic.
In March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and applied for government assistance.
According to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, the coronavirus paper could cost 47 million jobs in the United States and the rate of unemployment could reach 32%. The regional quarantine in India has caused tens of millions of Indian migrant workers (paid via the daily salary) to suffer. Surveys from Angus Reid Institute found that 44% of Canadian households had lost their jobs. Almost 900,000 workers lost their jobs in Spain since it was carried out in the middle of March 2020.
During the second half of March, 4 million French workers visited the terminal, and 1 million British workers signed a universal credit scheme. Nearly half a million companies in Germany signed a short-term work plan for their employees, called Kurzwarf.
The short work schedule for Germany was set up in France and England.
Around the world, the art industry and cultural heritage have been greatly influenced by pandemics, which have affected the functioning of organizations and individuals, both working and working.
The arts and culture sector has tried to achieve their high mission (which is often publicized) to give cultural heritage to society, to protect the safety of society and society, and to support science if possible.
In March 2020, worldwide and at various levels, museums, museums, exhibitions, exhibitions, and other cultures were closed without time, with celebrations, events, and exhibitions canceled or banned.
In view of this, intensive efforts are being made to provide alternative services through the digital platform. It appears that this new and rapidly growing disease is a combination of security services, large sports events, and other social events, such as music festivals and concerts, technological conferences and free-of-charges.
The film industry has also been disturbed by the announcement that the Holy Mass in Rome, which fell in the last week of the Christian Passover, was canceled.
Many efforts to encourage Christian women to stay at home and not attend Mass on Sunday; some churches provide church services via radio, direct TV or television, while others offer drive-in or laundry worship.
With the closure of the church and the chapel of the Roman Catholic Church and the arrest of the Holy Peter from Christian overseers, other councils also canceled services and restricted public meetings in the church, Massages, churches, temples, and cathedrals.
Iran's Health Report announced the celebration of the Temple in the open area and the places of worship, while Saudi Arabia forbade foreigners and its inhabitants to enter the Holy Mosques in Mecca and Medina.
This trend is compounded by a marked increase in the number of deaths reported during World War II.
Most major sports events are canceled or cancelled, including the UEFA 2019-2020 League, the 2019-2020 Premier League, the UEFA Euro 2020, the 2019-2020 NBA and the NHL 2019-2020.
This post is part of the 2020 Summer Olympics, which was originally scheduled to begin at the end of July; the International Olympics Committee announced on 24 March that the event would "be renovated until after 2020, but will not be more than the 2021 hot season." In the world, casinos and other games were closed and immediate poker tournaments were signed or canceled.
As a result, many gamblers have become addicted to gambling and have become addicted to it.
Many large theaters, such as Broadway, also feature exhibitions.
Scientists explore various ways to continue to produce and share work on the Internet as an alternative to traditional direct exhibitions, such as live concerts or create a web-based "festival" for artists to discover, disseminate, and publish their work.
Many of the Internet users are bombarded with images of how many people change for the better and how much attention they get from the media.
Since its publication COVID-19, there has been an increase in discrimination, xenophobia, and racism against the people of Tionghoa and East Asia, as well as against people from the most vulnerable regions in Europe, the United States, and other countries.
Fear, doubt, and hostility are common in many countries, especially in Europe, East Asia, North America, and the Pacific.
A February report (when most cases are still limited in Tiankok) records racial feelings expressed in various groups around the world that Tianonghoa people deserve to receive or accept what they claim as a simple reward.
Some African countries have also experienced an increase in anti-Tiongkok feelings.
Many Wuhan and Hubei reported discrimination on their origins.
There's support for the Tiononghoa people, good smells and circles, and for people in the most vulnerable areas of the virus.
Sending news to new hotspot countries, people from Italy, the first countries in Europe who experience serious COVID-19, can also be a source of uncertainty and xenophobia. Cities in countries include Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore, and South Korea originally signed a visa to prevent people from entering their country in an effort to stop disease.
In Japan, take #ChineseDontComeToJapan as a train on Twitter.
Tinghoa and other Asians in the United Kingdom and the United States reported an increase in racial and ethnic differences.
US President Donald Trump is criticised for calling koronavirus "Virus Tingkok", says critics consider racism and anti-Tiongkok to be racist.
In Ukraine, officials felt that they were attacking buses that took Ukrainians and foreigners who were forced from Wuhan to Novi Sanzhari.
Students from East India, bordering with Tingkok, and learning in major cities of India are reported to have been affected by the cornonavirus media.
The President of the Bharathiya Janata Party of the United States of West Dip Ghosh says Tingkok has destroyed the world and "that's why God punished them."
The statement was later attacked by the Consulate of Tingkok in Kolkata, calling it "crazy". In Tingkok, xenophobia and racism against non-Tionghoa people were spread out because of pandemics, with foreigners being described as "foreign goods" and intended for "dwelling".
Many letters of recommendation have been passed on to members of the Governing Body or to members of the Governing Body of Jehovah’s Witnesses.
Many scientists now believe that it is the product of an intelligent mind that can make it possible for us to do what is right in God’s eyes.
Some scientists have chosen to share their results quickly on the printing server, such as bioRxiv.

The laboratory tests for koronavirus gastric disease 2019 (COVID-19) and SARS-CoV-2 include a method that detects virus resistance and detects antibodies produced in response to infection.
The incidence of viruses in the sample is confirmed by RT-PCR, which detects CNA coronavirus.
This test is specific and is designed to detect the RNA virus SARS-CoV-2 immediately.
This test is used to verify new or active infections.
Antibodies (serology) detection can be used for diagnosis and population surveillance.
An antibodies test shows the number of people who are infected, including those who are too weak to be reported or who are not infected.
The number of patients with acute disease mortality and population prevalence levels can be determined from this test.
Because of limited testing, until March 2020, no country has reliable data on the prevalence of the virus in its population.
Until March 23, no country has tested more than 3% of its population, and there are major variations in the number of trials that have been carried out in the countries.
This variation may also have a significant impact on the number of fatalities reported, which are likely to be too high in some countries.
Using the reaction range of real-time transcription polymerase (rRT-PCR), this test can be performed in a variety of approaches, including nasopharyngal or sputum samples.
In general, results were obtained within a few hours until two days.
The RT-PCR test performed on a pregnant woman can only be based on the first week of the disease.
In time, the virus can disappear in the throat as long as it continues to apply in the lungs.
As an alternative, for those who are infected during the second week, the sample material can be taken from the respiratory tract using a catheter or a sputum.
One of the early PCR tests was developed in Charité, Berlin, in January 2020 using a real-time polymerase transcription response range (rRT-PCR), and formed at least 250,000 testing tools to be distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
The British Raya also developed a test on 23 January 2020. South Korea's Kogenbiotech developed a SARS-CoV-2-based PCR (PowerCheck Coronavirus) detection tool, which was classified on 28 January 2020.
This device searches for the gene "E" of all coronavirus betas, and the RdRp gene specific to SARS-CoV-2. In Tingkok, BGI Group is one of the first companies that has agreed to use a series of Tingkok National Media Administration tools to detect SARS-CoV-2 based PCR. In the United States, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) distributes RT-PCR Real-Time Coronavirus New 2019 (2019-nCoV) to public health laboratories via the International Reagent Resource.
One of the three genetic tests in the old version test tool gave uncertain results because of the reagent error, and the limited number of CDC tests in Atlanta; this results in fewer than 100 samples per day in February 2020.
The two components were considered not to be relied on until February 28, 2020, and later the national laboratory and the local laboratory were allowed to carry out the tests.
This test was approved by the U.S. Medical and Food Authority based on the US Commercial Laboratory at the beginning of March 2020.
On 5 March 2020, LabCorp announced the presence of COVID-19 test based RT-PCR on national scale.
Similarly, Quest Diagnostics conducted COVID-19 tests on 9 March 2020.
No quantitative limit has been announced; special collection and freezing must be done according to CDC conditions.
In Russia, the COVID-19 test was developed and produced by the Country Research Centre for Virology and Biotechnology in VECTOR.
On 11 February 2020, this test was listed by the Federal Health Supervisory Service. On 12 March 2020, Mayo Clinic was reported developing a test to detect COVID-19 infection. On 13 March 2020, Roche Diagnostics received FDA's approval for tests that can be performed within 3.5 hours with a high volume so that one machine can perform approximately 4.128 tests during 24 hours.
On March 19, 2020, the FDA issued the U.S.A. authorisation for the use of the term to Abbott Laboratories for testing on the m2000 Abbott system; the FDA previously issued the same authorisation as the Hologic, LabCorp, and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On March 21, 2020, Cepheit also received a US FDA test that lasted about 45 minutes.
The FDA has approved tests using the technology of amplification of non-PCR isothermal nuclear gas.
Since there is no need to define the heat cycle, this method can only produce positive results within five minutes and negative results within 13 minutes.
Currently there are about 18,000 machines in the United States and Abbott precipitate to increase production to 50,000 trials per day. A test using monoclonal antibodies specifically linked to new nucleicapside (N protein) coronavirus is developing in Taiwan, hoping to produce results within 15 to 20 minutes such as rapid influenza tests.
A poster survey published in March 2020 concludes that "toraks photo has a small diagnostic value at an initial level, while CT [computed tomography] may already exist before it reaches its peak."
Special features on CT include ground-glass multilobar opiates with peripheral, asymmetric, and lateral distribution.
Subpleura domains, flooding crashs, and consolidations are often the result of disease development.
In Wuhan, a study comparing PCR with CT at the starting point of the pandemic shows that CT is significantly more sensitive than PCR, although less specific, with many
In March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommended "CT cannot be used as a first line test in the diagnosis of COVID-19." In March 2020, CDC recommended PCR for initial detection.
Part of the immune response to infection is antibodies that include IgM and IgG.
This can be used to detect infections in individuals from about 7 days after pregnancy, to determine immunity to disease, and in population surveillance.
The system automatically with high performance in many clinical laboratories will be able to do this testing, but its readiness will depend on the level of production for each system.
For CLT, generally one peripheral blood species is used, although the specificity can be used to follow immune responses.
For PoCTs, it usually uses one peripheral blood species found through red blood cells.
Unlike the PCR method, extraction steps are not needed prior to the investigation. On March 26, 2020, the FDA mentioned 29 channels that provide information to the agency as needed and that can now distribute their antibodies.
On 7 April 2020, only one test was agreed by the FDA based on the authorisation of the use of the needle. At the end of March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics received European consent for their testing tools to detect IgG and IgA antibodies against viruses in the blood sample.
Its ability to test up to a few hundred samples within a few hours, so it's much faster than conventional PCR tests for RNA.
Antibodi was usually detected 14 days after the introduction of infection. In early April, England found that not one of the antibodies it bought was good enough to use.
Hong Kong has established a scheme to allow patients to stay at home, "the department of care will provide the patient with a special connection," they went into it, sent it back, and obtained the results of tests several hours later. NHS England announced that NHS is pioneering a case trial scheme suspected at home to remove the risk of the patient from the hospital if they come to the hospital or need to disinfect the ambulance if used. In a random test case COVID-19, a professional health force will take example of appropriate preventive measures.
On 2 March, the National Association of Statistics Health Insurance Physicals German stated that Germany had a capacity of about 12,000 tests per day in the streets and 10,700 tests were conducted in the previous week.
The cost is borne by health insurance if the test is performed by a doctor.
According to President Robert Koch Institute, Germany has a total capacity of 160,000 tests per week.
On March 19, a series of tests were performed in several major cities.
On March 26, 2020, the number of tests carried out in Germany was unknown because only positive results were reported.
A first laboratory survey revealed that, in total, at least 483.295 samples have been tested up to and including weeks 12/2020 and 33.491 samples (6.9%) positive studies for SARS-CoV-2. In Israel, researchers at the Technion and Rambam Hospital developed and tested methods to test samples of 64 patients jointly, by combining samples and only further testing if samples were found positive. In Wuhan, the laboratory detecting samples of more than 2,000 metres below the name "Huo-Yan" (Mandarin language: eye fire, or "Api mass" in Indonesian language) was opened on 5 February 2020 by BGI, which can process more than 10,000 samples a day.
With its construction being guarded by BGI Wang Jian's standing and eating for 5 days, the model showed that the case in Hubei could be 47% higher and the cost related to quarantine can be doubled if this test capacity does not exist.
Wuhan's lab was immediately followed by Huo-Yan's lab in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing, and Shanghai, in 12 cities throughout Tingkok.
On 4 March 2020, the total daily capacity of 50,000 trials per day. Open-source multiplex design by Origami Assays can test many 1.222 examples of patients for COVID-19 using only 93 tests. This balance can be performed in small laboratories without the need for robotic research.
By March, an inadequate number of reactors had become the target of major tests in the European Union, the United Kingdom, and the United States.
Because of this, a number of researchers have tried to explore the sample storage protocol involving sampling at 98 °C (208 °F) for 5 minutes to release the RNA gene for further testing. On 31 March, the United Arab Emirates was reported to do more coronavirus tests for population capital than any other country, and was prepared to increase the test scale to reach a large proportion of the population.
This is achieved through a combination of the launch tests and the purchase of the laboratory resulting mass scaled populations from Group 42 and BGI (based on the Hubo-Yan detection laboratory in Tingkok).
Built in 14 days, this laboratory is capable of doing tens of thousands of RT-PCR tests per day and is the first laboratory to have this scale outside Tiankok.
Various trials that highlight various genetic profiles of koronavirus have been developed in Tingkok, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, and the United States.
The World Health Organization has adopted German recipes for the production of test equipment sent to countries with low violence without the resources to develop themselves.
The German Recipe was published on January 17, 2020; the protocol developed by the U.S. Disease Control Centre was not available until 28 January to delay the tests in the United States. At the beginning of the paper, Tingkok and the United States had problems with testing equipment; these two countries and Australia were unable to provide sufficient testing tools to meet the requirements and recommendations of health professionals.
On the contrary, experts say that the wide range of trials in South Korea helps to reduce the spread of new koronavirus.
The testing capacity, most of which in the west sector laboratory, was built in a few years by the South Korean government.
On 16 March, the World Health Organization announced the development of the test programme as the best way to delay the COVID-19 pandemic. High requirements for testing because of the widespread virus preaching resulting in hundreds of thousands of tests waiting for work in the U.S. coastal laboratory, and the preparation of tools and chemical reagents became very important.
In March 2020, Tingkok reported on their test equipment.
In the United States, a test tool developed by the CDC has "departure"; the government then removed the bureaucracy ban that prevented the test by the swasta. Spain bought a test tool from Tingkok Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but found that the results were not accurate.
The company explained that the wrong result could have resulted in failure in the collection of samples or in the proper use of test equipment.
The Spanish Kementian said that they would attract devices that produced wrong results, and replace them with other test tools provided by Shenzhen Bioeasy. 80% of the test equipment bought by the Czech Republic from Tingkok gave bad results. Slovakia bought 1.2 million test tools from Tingkok that appeared to be not accurate.
The Major Matovic suggested that this test tool should be removed into the Danube River. The Kara Fire from the Turkish Health Kementary said that the test equipment bought by Turkey from Tiankok had "high error levels" and they did not "use it". Inggris Raya bought 3.5 million test tools from Tiankok, but at the beginning of April 2020, they announced that this test tool could not be used.
The test, followed by the cartoonization of positive ones and the tracking of positive ones with SARS-COV-2, results in positive results.
Researchers working in the city of Vó Italy, the first death site of COVID-19 in Italy, conducted two trials on the entire population of 3,400, with a duration of about 10 days.
About half of the positive suspects don't have any trouble, and all the cases found are quarantined.
With travel restrictions to this community, the infection was once again eliminated.
With aggressive contact monitoring, entry bans, testing, and quarantines, the 2020 koronavirus pandemic in Singapore is growing much slower than other developed countries, although without extreme restrictions, such as the closure of restaurants and cartel companies.
Many events were canceled, and Singapore suggested that residents stay home on 28 March, but schools were reopened shortly after the holiday on 23 March.
Some other countries have also dealt with pandemics by means of reports of aggressive contacts, stopovers, tests, and quarantines, but by less aggressive circuits, such as Iceland and South Korea.
A statistical study found that countries that tested more, relative to the number of deaths, had a lower number of fatalities, perhaps because these countries were more able to detect those who had minor or no injuries.
WHO recommends that countries with no test capacity, and national laboratory with limited COVID-19 experience, send five positive COVID-19 samples and ten negative samples to one of the 16 WHO reference laboratories for confirmation tests.
Of the 16 reference laboratories, 7 are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America, and 1 in Australia.
In the following paragraphs, the column "The Positive Test" is affected by the country's test performance.
A country that has only been tested in hospitals will have a higher rate of positive results than a country that has tested all its inhabitants, whether they show jealousy or not, with other factors alike.
Washing hands, which is also mentioned by washing hands, is an act that cleans the hands of someone who is intent on eliminating pollution, oil, microorganisms, or other undesirable substances.
Washing hands with soap consistently at certain "critical times" during the day prevents the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhoea and cholera, released through the phecal-oral route.
People can also be infected with inflammation, such as influenza or seisma, if they do not wash their hands before touching their eyes, lips, or mouth (that is, mucosa membrane).
Five hours of criticism throughout the day are important to wash your hands with soap: before and after great water, after cleaning your child’s skin or changing your clothes, before feeding your child, before eating and after preparing food or washing your flesh, fish, or eggs.
If water and soap are not available, hands can be washed with soap. The World Health Organization recommends washing hands:
Before, when, and after preparing a meal.
Before and after treating patients.
After replacing or cleaning a new child with a toilet.
After cleaning up your hips, legs, or ankles.
After touching an animal, an animal’s food supply, or an animal’s excrement.
Medical hygiene violates the principle of hygiene associated with medical procedures.
Washing hands before taking medication or treating them can prevent or reduce the risk of disease.
The main purpose of handwashing is to clean hands from pathogens (bacterium, viruses, or other microorganisms that can cause disease) and chemicals that can cause danger or disease.
This is especially important for those who are caring for food or who are working in the field of medicine, but it is also a matter of public policy.
Washing hands has many health benefits, including preventing influenza, coronary virus and other infectious diseases; preventing diarrhoea causes; reducing respiratory infections;
and reduce the number of infant mortalitys at home.
A study conducted in 2013 showed that increased practice of washing hands slightly increases the growth of children in news.
In developing countries, the number of deaths resulting from exposure to radiation and diarrhea may be increased by acknowledging changes in behavior, such as washing hands with soap.
This simple step may reduce the mortality rate of the disease to almost 50%.
This can be done by providing clean water in a low - risk area.
48% reduction in diarrhoea cases can be associated with soap. Washing hands with soap is the only effective and generous way to prevent diarrhoea and acute respiratory infection (ISPA), as a low-sensitivity behavior carried out at home, school, and society all over the world.
Pneumonia, which is the main ISPA, is caused by the number one death in the news; this disease causes about 1.8 million deaths per year.
Diare and pneumonia cause almost 3.5 million deaths each year.
According to UNICEF, to clean hands with soap before and after using toilets as a grown habit can save more lives from any vaccine or medical action, as well as reduce the effects of diarrhea to almost half and death from acute respiratory infection to half.
Washing hands is usually associated with other sanitation activities as part of the water, sanitation, and sanitation (WAH).
Washing your hands also protects yourself from the impetigo that is released through direct physical contact.
The effect of small hand washing is often done by hand cleaning that can cause skin damage to the skin.
A study conducted in 2012 in Denmark found that excessive hand washing can result in loss of skin and drying, known as hand excise or hand dermatitis, which is particularly common among health officials.
Washing hands too often is also seen as one of the most obsessive-compulsive disorders (OCD).
There are five critical times a whole day when washing hands with soap is important to reduce the spread of fecal-oral disease: before and after use of toilets (low water waste, large water waste), after cleaning the child’s breast (change the throat), before feeding the child, before eating and/or after preparing or swallowing meat, fish, or manganese.
Another important time to use clean - up techniques that are effective in preventing disease spread is before and after treatment; after washing, stones, or brushing; after touching the animal or handling the animal; and after touching the wound.
In many lands, the average person is still undernourished.
A study on hand washing in 54 countries in 2015 found that 38.7% of married couples practice soap. A 2014 study showed that Arab Saudi has a highest rate of 97 per cent; the United States is almost 77 per cent; and Tiankok is at a low level of 23 per cent. Now there are some methods of behavioural changes to improve the habit of brush washing during the crisis.
The Department of Education in the Philippines has set the right example in supporting child health and training.
The drug supply twice a year, added by washing hands every day with soap and brushing teeth every day with fluoride, is the object of this national program.
This program was also implemented in Indonesia.
Skin micro-organisms are strengthened by the addition of soap or detergen to water.
The main work of sowing and reaping is to reduce barriers to farming and to increase productivity.
Only water is an inefficiency-free skin cleaner because of fat and protein, which is an organic waste component, not easily absorbed in water.
As a result, sufficient water and oxygen are required to sustain the body’s oxygen supply.
Hot soap, because it can be used again, may contain bacteria obtained from previous use.
A small number of studies that study bacterial contamination from the contaminated stomach concluded that the infection could not occur because of the sophisticated bacteria.
Nevertheless, CDC continues to say, "The smoke that comes out of the water without touched hands is more popular."
Antibacterial soap is widely encouraged to healthy societies.
To date, there has been no evidence that antiseptic use or infection is better recommended for antibiotics in the world.
However, antibacterial soap contains such common antibacterial agents as triclosan, which have a long list of strands of organisms.
So while the strain of antibiotics has not been detected by antibacterial soap, it may not have an effect based on it.
In addition to surfactants and skin protection, altered formulations can contain salts (asythatase, ascorbat acid, lactate salts) as pH regulators, benzoate as active antimicrobial acids, and further skin conditioners (fouling, vitamins, minerals, extra plant extract). A comprehensive analysis of the University of Oregon University of Health has shown that the salt is normally the same as the level of human antibiotics that contain tricloses in preventing disease and cleansing bacteria from hand.
Hot water to wash your hands isn't hot enough to kill bacteria.
The bacteria grow faster on body temperature (37 °C).
Hot water is more effective than cold water by removing natural oils from the soil and bacteria.
However, with the confidence of many, scientific studies have shown that the use of hot water has no effect on reducing the number of microbes in the hands.
Hand-operated or antiseptic is a non-water-based cleaning agent.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, hand hygiene agents were non-water-based alcohol users (also known as alcohol-based users, antiseptic hand-driving agents, or hand-hand-instations).
Most of this cleaning agent is based on isopropyl alcohol or ethanol, which is formulated together with such substances as carbomer (acrylate as polymer) becomes gel or together with spices such as glycerin in order to be easily used and to reduce the effects of alcohol withdrawal.
The addition of hydrogen peroxide enzymes increases antimicrobial activity further. Handicrafts containing at least 60-95% alcohol are effective killers.
Alcohol abuse kills bacteria, multi-drug resistant bacteria (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis bacteria, a number of viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, Rhinovirus, vaccine, influenza, and hepatitis), and tuberculosis.
Alcohol abuse involving 70% alcohol killed 99.97% (log 3,5 decreases, similar to 35 decibel decreases) of bacteria in the hands of 30 seconds after feeding and 99.99% to 99,999% (log reduction 4 to 5) bacteria in the hands of 1 minute after feeding.
The alcohol-based operations are almost ineffective against the virus type norovirus (or Norwalk), the most common cause of gastroenteritis. The anticipatory or alcohol consumption in the number should be used to treat or cover both hands as a whole.
The front and back of the two hands and in the back and the end of all the hands are pushed about 30 seconds to dry, soak, or cold gel.
The end of the finger should also be washed properly by touching it on both sides. The U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that the fingertips wash their hands regularly, especially when their hands are turned upside down.
It increases the use of the anti-nutrition agent as a result of the ease of use and rapid killing activities against micro-organisms; however, the anti-insulting agent should not be used as a real replacement of the right hand, except for soap and water not prepared.
The use of alcohol-based handicrafts can often cause severe skin problems, unless emolien and/or skin rashes are added to the formula.
The effect on alcohol can be eliminated or eliminated by adding glycerin and/or other emolien to the formula.
In clinical trials, an alcohol - based unit containing emolien causes irritability and redness far lower than soap and antimicrobial detergen.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact urticaria syndrome, or hypersensitivity to alcohol or to additives in alcohol use rarely occur.
Low concentration causes contact dermatitis that interferes with the attractiveness of this product compared to washing hands with water and soap.
Although effective, non-air agents do not wash their hands from organic material, they only infect it.
For this reason, handwashing is not effective in preventing many pathogens from preaching because the pathogens are still in their hands.
The success of the free - alcohol industry depends greatly on its materials and formulations, and according to history, this product is significantly worse than alcohol and alcohol abuse.
Recently, formulations using benzalconium chloride have proved to have sustained and cumulative antimicrobial activity after treatment, unlike alcohol, which has proved to be less effective after repeated use, possibly due to progressive side effects.
Many in the community have been unable to afford a certain amount of grain and use it as a reward.
Water may be more effective than water, but less effective is soap.
One of the concerns is that if contaminated with microorganisms, soil or dust may improve the spread of diseases, it may decrease.
Like soap, soap is also an agent of disinfection because, if contact with water, it will form an alkaline stream.
WHO recommends aboriginal and salty as an alternative to soap when soap is not prepared.
The clean-up technique is based on the recommendations of the U.S. Disease Control Centre for prevention of diseases including the following steps:
Wash your hands with hot water or cool water.
It is recommended that water be kept in good condition, but it does not appear to affect the water temperature.
Wash your hands with plenty of soap, including the back of your hands, in your hands, and under my neck.
Saunas rise skin cancers, and studies show that people tend to wash their hands more closely when using soap than when using water.
At least for 20 seconds.
Smells create fun, which helps to remove skin scars, and longer bites eliminate more
The pool together under the running water.
Swimming in the trunk can make your hands contaminant.
Wash with soap or let go of the air.
The most common areas of the region are impregnable, handrails, spaces between hands and feet, and under my neck.
I'm doing my best and my most forgotten cat can keep microorganisms.
Loneliness is often recommended to protect your hands from dehydration; the skin can cause skin damage that can increase the risk of infection.
Various low-risk options can be made to facilitate the washing of hands when running water and/or soaps are not available, for example, draining water from the iron or bottled and covered and/or using soap, if necessary, in developing countries. In situations where water forces are limited (such as a school or a place of refuge in a developing country), there is a waterproof solution, such as "typpy-tap", and other low-risk choices.
The tippy core is simple technology that uses water-based bottles of water, which are operated by feet to drop a bit of water into their hands, and some soap.
An effective hand mill is an important part of the hand cleaning process, but there is a debate on the most effective hand tools in the public toilet.
More and more research shows that paper sheets are much cleaner than electrical energy found in many toilets.
In 2008, a study was conducted by the University of Westminster, London, and was conducted by the European Tissue Symposium paper industry to compare the level of paper cleaning, hot air pressure, and more modern jet power.
After washing and holding hands with hot air currents, the total number of bacteria was found to increase by 194% in manuals and 254% in manuals.
Stirred by jet air currents cause the total number of bacterium-rates to 42% in manuals and 15% in handcuffs.
After cleaning and holding hands with paper blades, the total number of bacteria decreases by 76% in manuals and 77% in manuals.Immunan also performs tests to determine the potential of contaminants on other toilet users and the toilet environment as a result of each type of heating method.
The jet air conditioner, which absorbs air from the unit at 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), is capable of absorbing micro-organisms from hand and unit and capable of attracting other toilet users and the toilet environment up to 2 metres away.
The use of hot air energy spreads microorganisms up to 125 metres from energy.
In 2005, TÜV Protein und Umwelt, a study conducted by TÜV, was conducted in various ways.
After handburn, the following changes in the number of bacteria were observed:
There are many hand - wielding factors, and hand - wielding energy has been compared to cutting through paper.
Washing your hands using the hand conditioner tip is an alternative while away if there are no soap and water.
The alcohol-based manual unit must contain at least 60% of alcohol.
Medical hand-cleaning was required long after Hungarian physicist Ignaz Semmelweis found its effectiveness (in 1846) in preventing disease in the hospital environment.
There are electronic devices that make it possible to remember hospital staff to wash their hands when they forget.
One study found that the level of infection declined with the use of that device.
Medical hand washing is done for at least 15 minutes, using soap and water in large amounts or gels to wash and wash each part of the hand.
The hands should be rubbed together with one another's fingers.
If there's dirt under my neck, dust can be used to remove it.
Since copper can withstand in water that is in their hands, it is necessary to wash hands together and be washed with clean soap.
After drying, leaves of paper were used to wipe out the water supply (and open the door out if necessary).
This action prevents the recontamination of the hands of the upper arm.
The purpose of washing hands in health care is to eliminate pathogen microorganisms and to avoid them.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that at least one hand is still at an unacceptable level in most medical environments, with a large number of doctors and nurses who continue to wash their hands before touching patients to release microorganisms.
One study showed that washing your hands properly and that other simple procedures can lower your blood pressure related to catheter-related infections to 66 percent. The World Health Organization has published a standard manual cleanup and wash your hands in the health sector.

The important appeal made by Whitby et al.
Commercial equipment can be used to correct and validate hand hygiene if evidence of necessity is needed.
The World Health Organization has "Five Hours" to wash your hands:
after being thrown into the blood/body.
before the aseptic task, and
After the patient's treatment, the addition of antiseptic chemicals to the soap (a drug or an antimicrobial) works to kill handwashing.
Killing this function may be desired before it is done or in situations where an antibiotic-containing organism is very suitable. To 'goose' hands before surgery before it is done, it is necessary to repair and die without touching, chlorohexidine or yodium cleansing, sterile lap to wash hands after cleaning, and sterilize to touch and other sterile instruments to clean my mouth.
All the jewelry must be released.
This procedure focuses on washing hands and hands down to my neck, usually for two or six minutes.
The duration of the operation is less than 10 minutes.
When washed, the water under the arm should be restrained so that it does not return to the hand.
After washing their hands, the hands were tied with a metal hook and a knife were used.
To reduce anxiety, it is better to wash your hands before handling health problems or to wash your hands after touching a dead body.
In order to control staphylococcal infection at the hospital, it was found that the greatest benefit was to clean hands from the first 20% cleanup, and that the additional benefits obtained were very low when the hand cleaning frequency was increased by more than 35%.
Washing with regular soap affects more than three times the spread of infectious diseases to food compared to cleaning with antibacterial soap. The comparison between washing hands with alcohol-based rations and washing hands with antibacterial soap every 30 seconds shows that alcohol-based users reduce bacterial contamination by 26% more than antibacterial soap.
However, soap and water are more effective than alcohol-based gloves to reduce influenza A H1N1 and Clostridium spora difficulty by hand. Intervention to improve the hygiene of hands in health care can involve staff education about hand washing, increased availability of alcohol-based gloves, and written reminders and letters to staff.
More research is needed to identify the most effective interventions in various health - care facilities.
In developing countries, washing hands with soap is recognized as a basic way to achieve good health and even good nutrition.
However, at least some of these types of waterproofings, such as soap, soap, or toilet facilities, make it a challenge to reach people at their homes, at their schools, and at their places of employment.
For example, in most parts of Africa, handwashing near private toilets or public toilets is rarely available, although there are options for making hand washing.
However, the low level of cleanliness can also occur because of habits that have been cultivated and not because of lack of soap or water.
Hand washing and washing hands with soap can affect a good decision, raise awareness of the benefits of hand washing, and result in long - term changes in population behavior.
Effective management and evaluation are needed.
Systematic support for 70 studies found that the basic community-based approach to improving the cleanliness of the hands in LMIC, while the social welfare campaign is not effective. One example of school-based motivation is "Three Star Association" by UNICEF which encourages schools to take simple steps and volunteers to ensure that the school cleans hands with soap, among other conditions of hygiene.
When the minimum standard is reached, the school can move from one star to the last three stars.
Building a washroom can be part of a handshake campaign that has been used to reduce the disease and death of children.
The World's Hand Pollution Day is another example of an increase in mood that seeks to achieve the purpose of behavioral changes. As a result of the pandemic of the 2019-2020 crown virus, UNICEF encouraged handwashing.
Some studies have examined the cost-effectiveness of washing hands globally in developing countries in relation to disability-adjusted Life Year (DALY) prevention or age-lossed disease.
One survey shows that encouraging the clean hands with soap means more efficient costs of several water interventions and other sanitation.
It is important to wash hands for human health, especially for people in rare circumstances, such as a new mother born or a soldier injured in a hospital, for the first time in the mid-19th century by two hand-cleaning reports: Hungarian doctor Ignaz Semmelweis who works in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, "standing up for modern treatment" in England.
At that time, many still believed that infection was caused by the so - called dome or bad air.
In the 1980 ’ s, the journals published through food and infection related to health care made the U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention more active in promoting hand hygiene as an important way to prevent infection.
The 2009 flood and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 increase the incidence in many countries will be important to wash your hands with soap to protect you from the spread of this disease.
For example, "the right hand washing technique" posters are based on the side of the handwashing valve on the public toilet and on the office building and airport toilet in Germany.
The expression "cleanse your hands from" means a person's willingness to take responsibility for something or to be involved in something.
That statement comes from the Bible book of Matthew when Pontius Pilate unrolled the decision to imprison Jesus Christ, but it has become widely used in the English community.
In Shakespeare's case, Macbeth, Lady Macbeth began to wash her hands constantly to clean up her imagination; an act that showed her guilty of the crime she committed and because she had forced her husband to do it.
It has also been noted that, after remembering or thinking of actions that are not ethical, people tend to wash their hands more often and to place more value on washing their hands.
Moreover, those who are allowed to wash their hands after such a thought have less likely involved in a "cleaning" compensation act, as if they were willing to do.
Religion directs the cleansing of hands for the purpose of cleansing and symbols.
Hindus, Jews, and Muslims alike had to wash their hands after using the toilet.
In addition, Hindus, Buddhists, Sikhs, Jews, and Muslims had to wash their hands before and after meals.
Workplace hazard control for COVID-19
Work risk management for COVID-19 is a safety methodology approach and work health for risk control for the use of COVID-19 (COVID-19).
The proper management of risks at work depends on workplaces and jobs, based on risk assessment of sources of income, the level of disease in society, and the risk factors for each of the workers that may be listed as COVID-19.
According to the U.S. Health and Health Administration (OSHA), low-risk workers have minimal employment contacts with the public and other employees; for this work, basic prevention measures, which include cleaning hands, encouraging workers to stay at home if they are sick, treat them well, and regularly clean up and infect the working environment.
The risk of gambling is involving work that requires close or frequent contact with people who are not known or expected to suffer from COVID-19, but may be contaminated because of the prevalence in developing societies or international travel.
This group includes workers who have contact with public societies such as schools, working environments with high-density populations, and high-Volume rate limit.
The risk management of this group, in addition to the basic prevention steps, includes ventilation using high-efficiency air networks, protection against noise, and self-defense devices when meeting with COVID-19 sufferers.
OSHA considers the health and body strength of those who are known or expected to suffer from COVID-19 to be at high risk of battle, which increases the risk of battle very high if workers carry out aerosol delivery procedures on, or take or deal with a specimen from, those who are known or are expected to suffer COVID-19.
The appropriate risk control for this worker includes technical control, such as negative ventilation rooms, and self - protective equipment that is suitable for the task.
The COVID-19 version can have some sights at work.
A worker may not come to work because of illness, the need to care for others, or because he is afraid of possible weddings.
The trade pool can change, good in the type of goods required or how to obtain these goods (such as out-of-time sales, via delivery, or auction).
Finally, the delivery of goods from the most sensitive geographical area of COVID-19 can be interrupted.
The article considers the level of risk associated with different jobs and jobs, including wage sources, risk factors arising from housing and society, as well as individual employment risk factors, such as age or chronic medical conditions.
The article also provided insight into what is needed in order to deal with these and other situations.
The diagnosis and diagnosis of infectious diseases may be based on national or subnational recommendations.
The media's aim is to reduce the gap between staff, protect people at higher risk for poor health complications, protect business operations, and mitigate the negative effects on other entities in the military line.
The spread of disease in the business community has affected many who have been affected by it.
Risk control is a very limited task that many people use for health and health care to reduce the risk of their health.
When the COVID-19 danger cannot be eliminated, the most effective control is technical control, followed by administrative investigation, and the last protective device.
Technology controls include the isolation of jobs from work-related risks without relying on work practices and can be the most cost-effective solution to be applied.
Administrative supervision is a change in the performance or procedures of a worker or employer.
Self - defense (APD) is considered to be less effective than technical and administrative control, but it can help to prevent certain conflicts.
All types of APD must be selected on the basis of risks at work, properly installed as they are (e.g., respiratory), consistently used and true, tested, treated, and replaced, if necessary, and released, cleaned, and stored properly or disposed of to avoid contamination.
According to the U.S. Department of Health and Health (OSHA), low - risk workers have minimal employment contacts with the public and other employees.
The basic prevention steps recommended for all workplaces include often cleaning hands together, encouraging workers to stay at home if they are sick, including covering stones and paints, preparing nets and soaps, preparing work from far away or around work with time to arrive, if necessary, giving workers knowledge not to use equipment and equipment for others, and to make regular cleaning and disinfection of the working environment.
The quick and insulating identification of individuals who are able to communicate is an important step in protecting employees, employees, employees, and others at work.
The U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that workers who have acute respiratory disease should stay at home until they are free from fever, symptoms of fever, and other diseases for at least 24 hours without use of antimalarial drugs or other antipsychotic drugs, and that the treatment of infectious diseases should allow them to stay at home to care for the sick family members, and that they should know about this.
According to OSHA, the risk of war is involving work that requires close or often in six feet (1.8 m) with people who are not known or expected to suffer COVID-19, but who may be infected with SARS-COV-2 because of a failure in business communities around the place, or because someone has recently made an international trip to a place with a wide range of COVID-19.
This group includes workers who have contact with public communities such as schools, working environments with high population, and high volume barriers. Technical monitoring for this group and high risk groups includes the development of high-efficiency air filters, the promotion of ventilation, the installation of physical barriers such as paint protection plates, and the setting up of windows for the service of offenders. Administrative controls for this group and high-risk groups include workers who are sick to stay at home, rather than meeting with virtual communications, preventing non-sensitivity to areas that are experiencing CVID-related,
Workers in this risk group don't need respiratory support.
If a person falls sick on a plane, proper controls to protect his employees and other passengers include separating sick people from others by six feet [6 m], showing a cabin to take care of the sick, and offering a mask of faces to the sick or asking him to close his mouth and lips when he falls or falls.
The cabin crew should wear the medical gloves once in the care of a sick passenger or touch a potentially contaminated body or upper body and possibly other protective equipment if the sick carrier is suffering from nausea, continuous stones, or respiratory problems.
For commercial navigation, including ships and other aircraft, the risk analysis should include travel on disease, isolation, and information to the medical center on the ship as soon as a person is injured or injured while on board.
Ideally, medical advances have been made in the cabin of people who have been isolated from the public ministry, for schools and childcare facilities, CDC recommends short-term closures to clean or disinfect if the infected have been in school buildings.
If there is social exclusion at the minimum level until now, the social exclusion strategy can be applied, including: canceling visits to the field, meetings, and other large groups, such as physical education, sound classes, or eating in the cafeteria, increasing distance between tables, time of arrival and attendance, limiting non-exsensential end-of-life, and using a separate health office location for children with flu-like experience.
If there are high levels of exposure in local society, next to the social exclusion strategy, extending school completion can be considered. For law enforcement officials who perform routine activities, health risks are directly considered to be low by CDC.
The law enforcement officer who has to contact the confirmed or suspected COVID-19 is recommended to follow the same standard of medical technology, including the appropriate use of self-defence equipment.
If close contact occurs during the arrest, the worker must clean up and disinfect the stove and the task equipment before re-use by using the household toilet or washing cloth and follow the standard operation procedure to control and wipe off the APD and to control and clean the dirty clothes.
SPACE believes that certain health forces and body parts are at risk of high or high risk of death.
High-risk work includes health care, support, laboratory, and medical transport forces that are carried out with a patient known or supposed to be COVID-19.
This work has become a very high risk of gambling if aerosol production procedures are carried out on, or takes or handle, a patient known or supposed to be COVID-19.
Aerosol production procedures include intubation, bone induction procedures, bronchoscopic procedures and dental examinations, or invasive specialisation.
The work of the body at risk of high risk involves work involved in preparing the body of a person known or supposed to be COVID-19 at the time of death; this work becomes a very high risk of injury if the worker performs an autopsy. Additional technical monitoring for this risk group includes isolates for patients known or suspected COVID-19, including when the aerosol performance procedure is carried out.
The ventilation of negative pressure may be particularly appropriate in some health - care facilities and in the body.
The specificity must be addressed by action to prevent the level of biological safety 3.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that patients who come into the waiting room be separated on a different basis if they are expected to be COVID-19 cases. In addition to APD, OSHA recommends respiratory for those who work at 6 feet of patients known or expected to be infected with SARS-COV-2, and those who conduct aerosol delivery procedures.
In the United States, N95 facial respirators approved by NISH or better should be used in the context of written and understandable breathing protection programs that include appropriate testing, training, and medical examinations.
Another type of respiratory can provide greater protection and enhance working sleep. WHO does not recommend complete clothing or coverall because COVID-19 is a respiratory disease and is not released through body spasms.
WHO's just recommending a meat mask for a screen officer at the entrance point.
For those who take radiation, treatment, or follow COVID-19 patients without aerosol production procedure, WHO recommends masks, protective needles, or facial fittings, teeth, and hand gloves.
If the aerosol production procedure is performed, the mask is replaced by N95 or FFP2.
Remembering that APD teams are not adequate worldwide, WHO recommends that the needs of APD through remote medical services, physical barriers such as a window of sight, with only those involved in immediate care can enter the patient's COVID-19 room, use only the APD needed for certain tasks, continue using the same respiratory system without the same time to treat many patients with the same diagnosis, maintain and coordinate the APD team's chain, and do not induce the use of masks for people without notice.

[Covit-19] Mounting cargo and preparing for the future
MEMORIAL ATTENDANCE: 14 March 2020, 00:24 UTC
Licence: CC0: No rights protected
We found ourselves in a very unusual situation this month.
The COVID-19 epidemic is something that makes it clear how people are global and responsible that we have each other.
We have never had the challenge, but we know that our best response depends on the form of empathy, cooperation, and the development of a global community, which is the heart of this organization.
The friendships and concerns that we have witnessed among all our employees by email, phone, and chat are uniquely personalized people, and we are quite happy to work with them.
I am so grateful and proud that I can call you a workmate.
Last week someone shared with me their appreciation for our work.
They remind me of what it means to the world at this time to access Wikipedia and how this is a powerful image of this important resource to keep ready for everyone.
Your job allows this to happen, whether you make sure this site is still running, help pay off our friends, or help keep our community safe.
The world needs the information provided by Wikipedia, especially now.
This is a time when we not only do what we do but also do what we do, making the world a more noticeable place.
Because it's important this mission and your role in it, we'll make some important adjustments to how we work together, which will start next week.
Adapting to our work and schedule
As Robyn mentioned earlier, team-c met last night to discuss our approach and schedule for a few days and months to come.
In that talk, we considered what we considered to be the right response to the challenges we faced and the best way to keep us in step with the organization during this time.
We were eager to eliminate the pressure and support our assignment for a long time.
If you need to reduce your work schedule, it's okay.
For all staff, contractors and contractors:
Our day - to - day work is about four hours a day, or 20 hours a week, until further notice.
We don't set a day off, if you can work more at normal hours, this mission needs you.
However, the world cannot be predicted at this time, and whether you need to care for loved ones, to buy wood, or to go to a doctor, your health is our priority.
We're not wasting your work time.
If you're sick, don't work.
This should not be said, but we did.
There is no need for sickness or PTO, sufficient information about your manager and your team to review the calendar and schedule to ensure that the main areas of work can be resolved.
(If you're diagnosed positively suffering from COVID-19, please let Bryan know in T&C Ops so that T&C can help with support and ensure that your situation gets the right attention from management).
The partners whose payrolls are based on hours will be paid in full.
We've said it, and we've said it again, to respect our committee to the contractor's staff and the time-based staff.
People will be paid back in full - time service when circumstances in life permit them to do more than they can.
This includes if you are sick and cannot work.
If you want to work, we support you.
Many people use their jobs to make the world a better place.
The work we do can be very satisfying, especially in times like this.
Once again, the most important thing is to take care of yourself.
Our request is that you communicate with your manager so that we know what needs to be corrected and can take appropriate action.
Some jobs are considered essential.
There's some work to go on.
SRE, SDM Operations, Trust & Security, and Data Protection Teams, among other things, do important work that may require additional support.
We're going to start the process with all departments to evaluate our current goals and turn our focus on supporting what's essential to our mission.
There's a lot to do for all of us, we're just going to focus on the most important project.
Delaying now will be nothing for the future.
We're not planning on "loose work" after this pandemic is over.
You will not be expected to work secularly to fill out time that is not realistic right now.
We realize that the situation is changing and will try to set a new target and line if necessary.
What about APP?
In line with the new reality and the expected working hours of the day, we intend to adjust the time line for the implementation of the 2020-2021 Report.
Our aim is to recommend the duration of the 2019-2020 articles that allow more time to make the number so that employees can give priority to important work, self-care and care of loved ones while harmonizing those who need or want to work with the schedule for a few weeks ahead.
The length of the current line has greatly reduced the number of hours we worked out and the intensity of the plans currently under way throughout the organization.
We'll give our proposal to the House next week and we'll change the delegation and team in the next step soon after we get confirmation.
Thanks to the APP team for your leadership in this.
Status, repair, and office cleaning
Last week, we were informed that one of our company based on SF may have been infected with COVID-19.
However, because of our concern, we worked for antiviral treatment to disinfect all surfaces at San Francisco office.
They use antiviral sprays to disinfect every surface of our lungs, lungs, and elevators that access our floor.
The construction site uses its own safety insurance protocol by using a product that supports the safety of its occupants.
We're glad that the office will be ready when we decide to go back.
Our DC office is located in WeWork, which has shared the COVID-19 protocol with us and all staff members based on the DC.
Starting last week, our DC office has moved to the far - off labor camp, following the direction shared with San Francisco.
As some of our NYC-based friends know, we are also discussing the location in Brooklyn.
This discussion will continue, but it may take time.
Some of our friends work from far away for the first time.
Our longtime workmates have long realized that it may need adjustments and they want to give you advice:
At least one or two hours.
If a session requires more than one session, consider how you might divide it by several days.
Define meeting places, schedule schedules, and forwarding previously published material.
Make video as default, with tools like Google Docs and Zoom to facilitate direct collaboration and connection.
Show the director how to make each visit easier, someone to order a question - and - write a list of the conversations, and someone to help him make a brief note (or make a cooperative note).
Send email to technical support if you need a secure header.
Use your welfare compensation to buy a little food.
Join the #remoties in Slack to talk to the partners about the shared work
The SDM Operation team is looking for web-based ergonomics to support the expansion of the work that has been distributed throughout Yayasan.
Last week we asked all community officials to cancel a public event called Wikimedia, such as Edit-a-thon, until WHO said the pandemic was over.
We let them know that we understand our request for removal and other removals can make them unable to complete the approved surgery and that no one will be created because they have to sign or modify that sentence.
This week we will follow further guidance on Wikimania and the regional community conferences and other topics.
In general, feelings from all over the global community seem to be the sad consequences of this confusion, but once lie about the clarity and ability to focus on its own communities, good Wikimedia and others.
Next, CRT is trying to prepare a paper in Meta-Wiki to provide room for the community to see and follow our communication with them.
Maintained connected during COVID-19 situations
We'll send an invitation to your calendar for Kamis coming, at 14:00 UTC/07:00 PT for a special staff meeting.
We'll use this time to share additional distributions, answer your questions, and spend time together.
We're together in this situation and we want to help.
Meanwhile, you can continue to get information from this email and all the other important information related to COVID-19 in the Wiki Office.
The CRT will continue to update this page and ensure that all information is in one place.
We are also trying to maintain regular communications with staff living in countries that are now significantly lighter.
If you have questions about travel, events, work schedules, or travel problems or other circumstances that might require help, do not hesitate to give up and work together with CRT.
We're here to help provide support and become the connector as needed.
If you have a secret or sensitive problem, please send an email to Bryan Juden, Director of Global SDM Operations International.
None of these changes are viewed as a personal burden on our service to God.
Rather, this change is an admission that, at present, our work and our responsibilities may need to be adjusted in a way that we have never done before.
This change is the steps we are confident that we will support each other in this situation so that we can continue to work, provide the support we need to move, and provide the world of service they trust.
The work we plan ahead will be there waiting for us when the time comes.
For now, this is the time to support one another and create a room for important work that will come in a few weeks and perhaps months in the future.
We need you all to create it, for that, we want you to take care of yourself and your family so that you can do the best you need.
Finally, please wash your hands and don't touch your face!
Katherine, CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M, and Tony S) and other members of the Governing Body (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janeen U, Lisa S, Robyn A, Ryan M, and Toby N).
b' Angiotensin 2 (ACE2) is an enzyme based on the outer cell (cell membrane) surface of the mouth, artery, heart, knee, and mouth.
ACE2 has anti-angiotensin converting enzymes (ACE), reducing the number of angiotensin-II and increasing Angiotensin (1-7), thus making it a promising target for cardiovascular disease. ACE2 also works as a point of entry into the cell for some koronavirus.
ACE2 human version is often referred to as hACE2.
Angiotensin 2 enzymes are metaloenzymes containing bindings placed on the surface of endotel cells and other cells.
Protein ACE2 has the M2 terminal peptidase domain and the transporter domain as well as the renal collectrin terminal-C.
ACE2 is a single type I membrane protein, with active domains enzymely placed on the surface of the cell in the lungs and other networks.
The extra domain ACE2 is separated from the transmembran domain by another enzyme, known as sheddase, and the most advanced protein produced is released into the blood vessels and finally dextres into the urine.
ACE2 is in large parts of the body: ACE2 is placed on the membrane of the cell in particular the male alveolary cell type II, enteroside small use, endotel endotel and vein, and endotel cells are in large parts of the body.
MRNA ACE2 expressions are also found in cerebral cortex, striatum, hypothalamus, and brain tumors.
The main function of ACE2 is as an ACE developer.
ACE embodys angiotensin I hormone becomes angiotensin II vasosconstrictive.
Finally, ACE2 reduces the amino phenylalanine terminal carboxylamine from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolyses it into angiotensin (1-7) vasodilator (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ACE2 can also eliminate a number of other peptides including [des-Arg9]-bradidine, aplin, neurotensin, dinorfin A, and grelin.
ACE2 also arranges then the lynth brake of the transporter sodium neutral amino SLC6A19 and is involved in Hartnup disease.
As transmembran protein, ACE2 functions as the primary entry point in the cell for some koronavirus, which includes HCOV-NL63; SARS-CoV (SARS virus); and SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19).
More specific, S1 protein binding on the spike or SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 with an enzyme domain ACE2 on the surface of the cell results in endositosis and virus transfer and enzyme into the entoms placed in the cell.
This virus entry process also requires primary protein S by the TMPRSS2 mother protease series, which is currently being isolated as a potential therapy. This fact makes people hypothesis that a high number of ACE2 in the cell may help fight infection.
However, many professional societies and regulatory bodies have recommended that standards of ACE and ARB continue to be followed.
A systematic and metaanalysis survey, published on July 11, 2012, found that "the use of ACE inhibitors causes a 34% increase in the risk of pneumonia compared to control."
Further, "the use of ACE inhibitors also lowers the risk of pneumonia in patients who have a higher risk for pneumonia, especially stroke patients and heart failure.
The use of ACE inhibitors is also related to the spread of pneumonia-related mortality, although the result is less powerful than the risk of total pneumonia."
ACE2 human recombinant (rhACE2) is expected to be a new therapy for acute lung injury, and it seems to increase the hemodynamics and oxygen saturation of the baby with acute respiratory syndrome induced by lipoplascaride.
When rhACE2 is applied to humans about 10 hours with 30 minutes of work plus 24 hours of effect.
Some findings show that rhACE2 may be a drug that promises patients with intolerance to the conventional renin-angiotensin inhibitor (RAS inhibitor) or to patients with angiotensin II in blood circulation. Infus rhACE2 has been evaluated in a clinical trial for acute respiratory syndrome.
b'COVID-19's application is a single language device designed to help contact tracking to inhibit the koronavirus pandemic 2019-2020, i.e. the process of identifying people ("contact") who may have contacted infected people.
Many applications are developed or recommended, which receive official government support in some areas and jurisdictions.
Some tools have been developed to help build contacts.
Private issues are raised, especially in relation to systems based on the location of the application.
A low-priced alternative includes using Bluetooth signals to record user presences with other mobile phones.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple jointly announced that they would integrate functionality to support this Bluetooth-based application directly into the Android and iOS operating system.
In Tingkok, the Tingkok government, together with Ajala, has announced applications that allow citizens to check whether they have contacted COVID-19 sufferers.
This application is used in more than 200 Tingkok cities. In Singapore, this application is used as TraceTogether.
This application was developed by the local IT community, written as an open source and will be given to the government. Northern Macedonia destroyed "StopKorona!", a Bluetooth-based application to track down infected people and respond quickly to health authorities.
This application was developed by Communications, Technology, and Health.
Until April 14, 2020, the application is still awaiting agreement between Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
On April 12, the government said that the contact tracking application was in the development stage and would be ready for publication within a few weeks. The application was similar in Ireland and France ("StopCovid").
Australia and New Zealand are considering applications based on TraceTogether Singapore and the BlueTrace protocol. Russia means identifying geofencing applications for COVID-19 patients living in Moscow; this application is designed to ensure that they do not leave home.
Ross Anderson, professor of security at Cambridge University, mentions a number of practical problems that may occur on the application-based system, which include false positives and possibly lack effectiveness if data taken from limited applications are limited to only a small part of the population.
To deal with concerns about the spread of wrong or dangerous "kronavirus" applications, Apple sets limits on the type of organisation that can add the associated applications to the App Store, i.e. limit only to "resmi" organisations or have good reputations.
Google and Amazon apply a similar approach.
Private supporters have called for their attention to the impact of mass surveillance on the use of koronavirus applications, in particular on whether the monitoring infrastructure made to deal with the koronavirus pandemic will be stopped after the threat has passed.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations have published statements that limit this type of surveillance.
The organization states eight conditions on the government project:
monitoring must "in accordance with the law, necessary, and proportionate";
The need for human protection and surveillance must have the coldest solar class;
the use of data must be limited to the purpose of COVID-19;
the security and anonymity of data must be protected and proven to be protected on the basis of evidence;
digital surveillance must avoid the increased risk of discrimination and marginalisation;
Each division of data with a third party shall be defined in the laws;
protection against abuse and the right of citizens to respond to abuse;
Participation means all "relevant importance" required, including social health experts and marginalization groups. Chaos Computer Club (CCC) Germany and Reporters Without Borders (RSF) also issued a list of inspections.
The Google/Apple article recommended to address the monitoring problem continues by removing the tracking mechanism from the device operating system after it is no longer necessary.
Some countries use networking sites, not applications, to eliminate corruption and to prevent it from happening.
In Israel, network tracking was accepted.
A network-based solution that has access to local data has a potential for significant private problems.
However, not all systems with the central server need to access the private location data; a number of privacy systems have been created and use the central server only for communication (see section below).
In South Korea, non-application systems are used to perform contact tracking.
As a reward for using special applications, the system collects tracking information from various sources, includes tracking data on remote devices and card transaction data, and combines these information to produce information through text messages to people with a potential for infection.
In addition to using this information to warn potential contacts, the government also makes this local information available to the public, which is allowed by a broad change in the privacy of information laws after it has passed the MERS in that country.
This information is available to the public through a number of applications and websites. Countries such as Germany are considering using a system based on a system that protects privacy.
Until April 6, 2020, details have not yet been written.
The privacy-protection communication is a concept that has been developed, with a large number of research literature starting at least in 2013. On April 7, 2020, more than a group of experts working on private-sector solutions, such as using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), to record user presence with other phones.
However, PEPP-PT is an effort to coordinate between centralised and decentralised approaches, and not only protocols. The decentralised protocol includes the Protection of Non-centralised Privacy Statements (DP-PPT/DP-3T), the Interim Contact Number (TCN, previously called Contact Event Number, CEN), the Protocol and Sensitive Sensitive Mechanism for Single Contact Statements (PACT), and others.
In this protocol, personal data that can be identified has never been left out of the device, and any adjustments are made on the device.
The Private Group at MIT Media Lab develops SafePaths, a platform to use technology that protects privacy when collecting and using local or interactive data to track COVID-19 messages.
This is based on a study from the Whiteboard "Apps Gone Rogue: Mantaining Personal Privacy in An Epidemic" published on Maret 2020.Other similar features are the SafeTrace platform by Enigma MPC, a company that develops private technology and was originally built at MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrace uses secure hardware technology to allow users to share local and sensitive health data with other users and officials without sacrificing their privacy.
On 5 April 2020, the Global TCN Coalition was established by groups that have a similar relationship on the same basis and are a highly flexible protocol, with a view to reducing fragmentation and enabling global interoperability for monitoring and warning applications, which is the main aspect of achieving broad reception.
On April 9, 2020, the Singapore government announced that they had made the BlueTrace protocol used by its official government application a source open.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, companies that control Android and iOS platforms, announced initiatives to monitor contacts, which they claim will protect privacy, based on Bluetooth Low Energy technology combinations and privacy-protected cryptography.
They also publicize the engineering specifications used in this system.
According to Apple and Google, this system is meant to be destroyed in three stages:
Launching tools to allow the government to make official applications of coronavirus tracking that protect privacy
integration of this function directly into IOS and Android Google and Apple are planning to deal with the problem of data generation and surveillance and continue with the initial distribution of the system through the transmission of the operating system, and then eliminate it in the same way after the threat has passed.
b'Repository of medicines (also called a new purpose, new profile, or new task of medicine or change of therapy) is the use of medicines which has been agreed upon for new treatment purposes, i.e. for diseases or medical conditions that differ from the original purpose of developing drugs.
This route is a scientific research path currently being undertaken to develop safe and effective COVID-19 treatments.
Other research methods include the development of COVID-19 vaccines and convalescent plasma transfusions. SARS-CoV-2 has about 66 proteins that can be drug targets, each protein has several link sites.

WHO included lopinavir/ritonavir in an international solidarity test.
Remdesivir was developed and developed by Gilead Sciences as a treatment for Ebola virus and Marburg virus infection. Later, Gilead Sciences found that Remdesivir has an in vitro antiviral activity for some philo-, pneumo-, paramics- and koronavirus.
One of the problems with antiviral therapy is the occurrence of resistance through mutations that can cause worse disease and transmission.
Some initial studies show that remdecivir may have high genetic resources for resistance. There are some ongoing clinical trials, including two clinical trials performed by Cleveland University Hospital, one for people with chronic illness and one for those with chronic illness.
There are three clinical trials running for intravenous vitamin C for those treated with adequate COVID-19 disease, i.e. two controlled placebos (Tiongkok, Canada) and one without control (Italy).

A global press release in 2020, which involved investment and research activities to promote vaccines.
Many organizations use the genome published to develop vaccines that may be resistant to SARS-CoV-2.
The CEPI initiative made a statement in April that the thing to be noticed in the development of vaccines is speed, production capacity, preaching on the required scale, and global access.
In April, CEPI researchers reported that 10 different technology platforms were in research and development during early 2020 to produce effective vaccines for COVID-19.
The main platform target advanced to Phase I security studies, including:
nuclear assay (DNA and RNA) (phase I and vaccine candidate: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
virus vector (phase phase I measurement and vaccine candidate: CanSino Biologics, adenovirus type 5) vector
As reported by CEPI scientists in April, the total 115 vaccine candidates are in the early stages of development, with 78 confirmed as an active project (79, according to the Milken Institute), and 37 others have been published, but with little public information available (though they are being planned or being planned).
Try Phase I-II to perform initial safety and immunogenicity tests, usually performed in follow-up, placebo-controlled, and in some places, to determine more effective doses.
Try Phase III usually involves more patients, including control groups, and test the effectiveness of vaccines to prevent disease, as soon as possible at optimal doses.
Of the 79 active vaccine candidates (confirmed at the beginning of April 2020), 74 of them have not yet been in human assessment (still in the "praclinis" research).

That means that these vaccines can benefit from external diseases that it prevents.
A further attempt in Australia to track 4,170 health workers.
There is a possibility that vaccines in development will not be safe or effective.
A preliminary study to evaluate the validity of vaccines using specific COVID-19 animal models, such as ace2-transgenic strains, other laboratory animals, and non-human primates, showed the need for protective measures to achieve the level of biological safety 3 by dealing with life-threatening viruses, and international coordination to ensure standard safety procedures.
The vaccine against SARS and MERS has been tested on the non-human animal model.
By 2020, there has been no drug or vaccine for SARS that proved to be safe and effective for humans.
According to research published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of new vaccines and medicines to treat SARS is a priority for governments and public health worldwide.
When MERS become prevalence, confidence-building SARS research can be a useful template to develop vaccines and therapy for MERS-CoV infection.
In March 2020, there is one MERS vaccine (based on DNA) that completes phase I clinical trials in humans, and three other vaccines are in the process, all of which are virus vector vaccines, two adenuvirus vectors (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac), and one MVA vector (MVA-MERS-S).
Social media posts support the conspiracy theory that claims the virus back of COVID-19 has been previously known and that vaccines have been prepared.
The patents listed by various social media posts refer to patents available for genetic sequences and vaccines for other koronavirus glaring, such as SARS koronavirus.
b'Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) is a communicable disease caused by coronavirus acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
A general sense of humor, a sense of humor, and a sense of humor.
Other stories may include fatigue, headaches, diarrhoea, constipation, loss of appetite, and kidney disease.
From the time it was spread to the spring of about five days, it could begin from two to four and a half days.
Although most cases lead to smallpox, some develop into neumomonia, which is a disease of the brain.
By April 17, 2020, more than 2.24 million cases have been reported in 210 countries and territories, resulting in more than 153,000 deaths.
More than 568,000 people have recovered from this virus, especially when it comes to contacting closets, often by hand or by a small droplets produced by stones, pigs, or talking.
Although it is produced when breathing, the droplets usually fall to the ground or to the surface and do not run to the farthest point.
People can also be infected by contact with contaminated surfaces, such as eyes, lips, or mouth.
On the surface, this virus can last for 72 hours.
This virus is very rare for the first three days after pregnancy, although the preaching may take place before pregnancy occurs and after the next stage of the disease. The standard diagnosis method is with a reaction of the polymerase reverse real-time transcription range (rRT-PCR) in the nasopharyngal process.
The use of masks has been encouraged by those who are suspected of being infected and those who take care of them.
Recommendations on the use of masks by different public societies; some authorities recommend not using masks, others recommend their use, and others maintain their use.
Currently, there is no vaccine or antiviral treatment specific to COVID-19.
Local disease transmissions have been reported in almost all countries in six WHO regions.
People who are infected with the virus may experience flulike symptoms, such as nausea, stones, fatigue, and breath loss.
Respiratory and thoracic disorders include breathing problems, pain or swelling in the teeth that persist, dizziness, difficulty getting up, and face problems or headaches; medical treatment is advised immediately if these events occur.
The effects of exposure to air, such as fevers, vomiting, or stomach problems, can be seen in a few cases.
Gastrointestinal disorders, such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhoea, are treated in an increased percentage.
Some of the cases in Tingkok were originally only in clinical cases of tooth decay and palpitation.
In some cases, disease can develop into pneumonia, strokes, and death.
This time is called the time of the immunization.
Incubation time for COVID-19 is usually five to six days, but it can affect from two to 14 days.
97.5 percent of people who have been infected will experience an illness in 11.5 days, and reports show that not all people who have been infected have experienced it.
The role of the carrier without this defect in the cure is not yet fully known; however, initial evidence shows that they may contribute to the spread of disease.
Currently, the proportion of unaccustomed infected people is unknown and are being addressed, with the Korean Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reporting that 20% of all cases of non-emergency are confirmed during hospital treatment.
The Tingkok National Health Commission began to report the case without a complaint in its case on April 1st; of the 166 infections on that day, 130 (78%) did not show a complaint during the trial.
Sputum and liquid water can carry viruses on a large scale.
Speaking with ease can be more straightforward or more effective than normal speaking.
A study in Singapore found that uncovered stones could cause droplets to reach up to 4.5 meters (15 feet).
Although this virus is usually not released via the air, the United States National Sciences Academy shows that bioaerosol transmission may occur and that the air collected outside the room produces a positive example for RNA virus.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and cardiac resuscitation (RJP), can make the secret of breathing changes into aerosol and spread through the air.
Although there is concern that viruses can spread through the feces, this risk is believed to be low. The virus is most likely to spread during pregnancy; although the preaching may take place before pregnancy occurs, the risk is low.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) says that although it is not fully clear how easily this disease spreads, one person in general is infected by two to three others.
In particular, it was found that the virus can be detected for one day on cardboard/cardiograms, up to three days on plastics (polypropylene) and cardboard (AISI 304), and up to four hours on a 99% scale.
However, this change was based on greed and greed.
The soap and detergen are also effective if used properly; the soap produces a layer of virus protection, deactivation of the virus, and release it from skin and other surfaces.
Other routes, such as benzalconium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate, are less effective.
In five of the six patients, the first example showed the highest viral infection rate, and the sixth patient showed the highest virus rate on the second day of test.
Coronavirus acute inflammation syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new acute inflammation syndrome, which was first isolated from three people with pneumonia related to the acute respiratory disease cluster in Wuhan.
All the new SARS-CoV-2 virus is on the coronavirus that's interfering in the world.
Out of the human body, this virus is killed by domestic fever, which damages its protection. SARS-COV-2 is close to the first SARS-COV.
Paru is the most vulnerable organ of COVID-19 because the virus accesses breast cells through angiotensin 2 enzymes (ACE2), which is most prevalent in type II paru alveolar cells.
This virus uses a special surface glycoprotein called "peplomer" to connect to ACE2 and enter the breast cell.
Acute heart damage was found in 12% of patients treated properly in Wuhan, Tingkok, and more frequently in severe diseases.
High cardiovascular risk due to systemic influenza response and immune disturbances during the development of disease, but acute myocardial infarction may also be associated with ACE2 receptors in the heart.
ACE2 receptor is expressed very high in the heart and involved in the function of the heart.
Insiden thrombosis (31%) and vena thromboembolism (25%) are high in patients with COVID-19 infection in ICU and may be associated with poor predictation. Otopsia in people who die because of COVID-19 has found
Although SARS-COV-2 has a thrombosis for respiratory epithelial cells that express ACE2, patients with COVID-19 are seriously experiencing systemic hyperinflammation.
In particular, T cells that correlate GM-CSF pathogenic are shown to be correlated with monosites that suppress IL-6 inflammators and poor lung pathology in patients with COVID-19.
Limphosytic infiltrate has also been reported on the otopesia.
WHO has published some test protocols for this disease.
The standard test method is a reaction of the polymerase reverse real-time transcription range (rRT-PCR).
This test is usually carried out in the form of an abstinence; however, it can also be applied to abstinence or abstinence.
In general, results were obtained within a few hours until two days.
Blood tests can be used, but two blood samples taken for two weeks are needed to produce a small amount of time.
Tingkok scientists are able to isolate this coronavirus gene sequence and publicize its genetic sequence so that laboratories around the world can develop an independent polymerase response test (PCR) to detect infection by this virus.
On April 4, 2020, an antibiotic test (which can detect active infections and if someone has previously been infected) was under development, but it has not been widely used.
Tingkok’s experience with this trial shows that there are only 60 to 70 percent of them.
The U.S. FDA supports the first point-of-care test on 21 March 2020 to be used at the end of that month. A diagnosis report by the zhongnan University of Wuhan Hospital suggests a method for detecting infection based on clinical images and risk of epidemiology.
The ground-glass multilobar multilobar opiates with peripheral distribution, asymmetrics, and posteriors were many found at the beginning of infection.
Subpleural domains, crash paving (septum balance with variable alveolar filling), and consolidation can occur frequently.
A little data is available on microscopic leukaemia and COVID-19 pathophysiology.
The discovery of major pathology on the otopsia is:
Macroscopic: pulmonary, pericarditis, parus consolidation, and oedema lung
Four types of virus pneumonia infection can be treated:
Small pneumonia: pulmonary oedema, pulmonary hyperplasia, large apex pneumositis, interstitial inflammation with lymphosytic infiltration, and acute cell determination of many
severe pneumonia: damage to difus alveolary (DAD) with difus alveolary exudation.
DAD is the cause of acute respiratory syndrome (ARDS) and severe hypoglycaemia.
pneumonia in treatment level: exudation in alveolar and interstitial lung fibrosis
Blood: intravascular coagulation (DIC); glucocytoplastic reaction
Steps to reduce infection may include staying at home, avoiding many places, often washing hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, practicing good hygiene, and avoiding touching eyes, lips, or mouth with unwashed hands.
CDC recommends shutting your mouth and lips with needles when you're in or out and recommend using parts in one if you're not ready.
Hygiene’s appropriate hand after a stone or a stone was lifted up.
The CDC recommends the use of facial expressions in public places, part of which is to limit public opinion. The social exclusion strategy aims to reduce contact between people who are infected with many people, by closing schools and places of work, restricting travel, and canceling large-scale meetings in public places.
It also includes people who care for at least six feet [6 m] or eight feet [1.8 m] in length.
There is no known drug to effectively prevent COVID-19. Because the diagnostic vaccine has not yet been established until early 2021, the main part of COVID-19 treatment is to try to reduce the epidemic peaks, known as "curva ratio".
CDC also recommends that people wash their hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after toilets or when hands are seen dirty, before eating, and after washing their teeth, stones, or pools.
In addition, CDC recommends the use of alcohol-based units that contain at least 60% of alcohol, but only when soap and water are not available. In areas where commercial hands are not available, WHO provides two formulations for local production.
In this formulation, antimicrobial activity comes from ethanol or isopropanol.
Peroxide hydrogen is used to help eliminate bacterium trace in alcohol; this is "not an active object for hand-sepsis".
Glycerol has been added as an inducement.
People are treated with support, which can include urinary therapy, oxygen support, and other light - vital organs.
CDC recommends people who think they're carrying viruses to wear simple facial masks.
Oxygenase membran extracorporeum (ECMO) has been used to deal with fire failure, but its benefits are still being considered.
Cleaning oneself and your lifestyle and eating disorders are recommended to enhance your immune system.
Supportal care may be useful for those with limited infection levels. WHO and the Tiankok National Health Commission have issued recommendations to deal with COVID-19 diseases treated properly.
Intensified caregivers and plumbers in the United States have applied the recommendations of care from different rivers as a source of free spirit, i.e. IBCC.
Until April 2020, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19.
For pregnancy, some medications recommend more parasetamol (asthemainofen) than ibuprofen for the use of the first line.
Prevention measures should be taken to mitigate the risk of virus exposure, particularly in health-care restrictions when conducting procedures that can produce aerosol, such as intubate or hand ventilation.
For the health care of COVID-19 sufferers, CDC recommends placing them in the Tular Insulation Insulation Room (IIR) in addition to using standard preventive measures, contact prevention actions, and customs prevention actions. CDC provides protection devices (APD) for use during pregnancy.
The recommended device is: APD, respiratory or facial mask, eye protection, and medical manual. If it is available, the respiratory (not facial mask) is better.
The N95 respiratory system has been approved for industrial restrictions, but the FDA has authorized this mask to be used on the basis of the Authority for the Use of Darurat (USA).
The N95 respiratory system is designed to protect from airborne particles such as dust, but the effectiveness of certain biological agents is not guaranteed for use not mentioned on the label.
If the mask is not ready, the CDC recommends using a mask or, as a last resort, a mask.
Most of the COVID-19 cases are not too serious to require mechanical ventilation or alternative, but some are really serious.
The type of respiratory support for those who have failed to breathe related to COVID-19 is actively being actively addressed to those who are treated properly, and there is evidence that intubation can be avoided by high blood pressure or a positive air pressure.
It is not yet known which one of these two methods brings similar benefits to those who are suffering from a terminal illness.
Some doctors prefer to continue using invasive ventilation, when available, because this technique restricts partial aerosol preaching compared to high nasal channel. More serious cases occur in lancia (those over 60 years of age, and especially those over 80 years of age).
Many developed countries do not have a place to sleep for the same capital, which limits the capacity of the health system to deal with an emergency number of COVID-19 cases that are so bad that they need adequate care.
A study in Tingkok found that 5% of the intensive care units, 2.3% needed mechanical ventilation support, and 1.4% died.
In Tingkok, about 30% of COVID-19 patients who were treated finally entered ICU.
The mechanical ventilation becomes more complex with acute respiratory syndrome (ARDS) occurring at COVID-19 and oxygen becomes more difficult.
Ventilator capable of performing pressure control mode and PEEP high is required to maximize oxygen transmission once the risk of lung injury and related pneumotoraks is minimised.
The high PEEP may not be available on the old fan.
The study on treatment potential began in January 2020 and some antiviral drugs are being tested in the clinical trial.
Remdesivir seems to be the most promising one.
Although the development of new drugs may take time up to 2021, some of the drugs that are being tested have been approved for other uses or have already been tested at a higher level.
Antiviral drugs can be tried in people with severe diseases.
The recommended WHO volunteers are involved in an effective and potential treatment safety test. The FDA has granted temporary authorisation for convalescent plasma as an experimental treatment in the life of a very or dangerous person.
Convalescent plasma has not yet studied the clinical studies needed to prove its safety and efficacy for this disease.
In February 2020, Tingkok destroyed its own applications to deal with this disease.
Users are required to enter their name and ID.
This application is capable of detecting 'near contact' using surveillance data so that it can detect the risk of infection.
Each user can also check the status of three other users.
If the risk potential is detected, the application not only recommends single quarantines but also gives information to local health officials. Analysis of phone data, facial technology, telephone tracking, and practice skills are used to track infected people and those who are in contact with them in South Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli government authorized security forces to monitor the phone numbers of those who were suspected of being coronation.
It was taken to conduct a quarantine and to protect those who might be in contact with infected people.
In addition, in March 2020, Deutsche Telekom distributed data on the telephone to the German federal government’s Robert Koch Institute in order to investigate and prevent the spread of virus.
Russia uses face-to-face technology to detect carantine offenders.
Regional Health Commissioner for Italy, Giulia Gallera, said he was informed by telephone operators that "40% of the citizens still move elsewhere".
The German government had a 48-hour strike at the end of more than 42,000 people.
In addition, President Estonia, Kersti Kaljulaid, has made a global consultation on creative solutions to counter the spread of koronavirus.
People may experience stress from their quarantine, travel restrictions, side effects, or fear of infection themselves.
The BBC quotes Rory O'Connor as saying, "Progressing social isolation, loneliness, health disadvantages, stress, and economic instability is a perfect barrier to mental health and social well-being."
This disease can develop slowly or with little or no appetite, which is like breathing problems on other people’s bodies, such as seizures.
Cases of smallpox usually recover within two weeks, while those who suffer from a serious illness or crisis may need three or six weeks to recover.
A pregnant woman may have a higher risk of COVID-19 infection based on data from similar viruses, such as SARS and MERS, but data for COVID-19 are still low. For some people, COVID-19 may affect the lungs to cause pneumonia.
For the most vulnerable, COVID-19 can rapidly develop into acute respiratory syndrome (ARDS) which causes respiratory failure, septic infection, or brain failure.
The complications associated with COVID-19 include sepsis, abnormal blood transfusions, and heart damage, kidney, and heart.
The incidence of blood clotting, especially growth in prothrombin, was observed in 6% of patients treated with COVID-19 treated properly, while the difference in renal function was seen in 4% of this group.
About 20-30% of people with COVID-19 image shows an increase in blood enzymes (transaminase).
According to the same report, the time between the birth and death was ten days, with five days spent in sleep.
However, patients who were transferred to the ICU had to spend seven days between sleep and death.
In a study that studied early cases, the period from the beginning to the end of death was 14 days, full of six to 41 days.
In a study by the National Health Commission (NHC) Tingkok, men had 2.8% deaths, while women had 1.7% deaths.
A study of postmortem paroma histopathology shows that alveolar damage caused by fibromyxoid exudation is common in both pairs.
Changes in cytopathic virus therapy on pneumositis.
The picture of the butterfly is similar to that of the acute respiratory syndrome (ARDS).
In 11.8% of the death reported by the Tingkok National Health Commission, heart damage, with elevated levels of troponin or heart disease.
According to the March data from the United States, 89% of those treated properly have a living conditions, and the availability of medical and social resources can also affect mortality.
The notion of mortality from the environment varies because of the diversity of these areas, but also because of the difficulties of methodology.
The lack of adequate medical care can lead to a high level of mortality.
However, the fact that death is the consequence of a recent case can mean the number of deaths currently being counted too low.
Perokok has a greater risk of 1.4 times more severe COVID-19 and approximately 2.4 times more likely to require intensive care or die compared to non-smoking.
The Hong Kong Hospital Authority has found 20 percent to 30% of the ageing capacity of some people who recover from the disease, and breastfeeding shows organ damage.
This may also lead to the development of postpartum depression syndrome.
Until March 2020, it is not known whether infection has previously given effective and long - term immunity to people who are cured of this disease.
Immunities may be seen, if you see other coronavirus behaviors, but there have been reported cases of COVID-19 healing followed by positive coronavirus tests a few days later.
This case is believed to be a serious remnant infection, not a rebirth infection.
This virus is thought to be natural and derived from animals, through widespread infection.
It is not known exactly what happened, but in December 2019, nearly all of us were moved by the outbreak of the first world war.
A study of 41 cases confirmed COVID-19 first, published in The Lancet in January 2020, revealed the date of the first emergency report on December 1, 2019.
The official WHO publication reported on December 8, 2019.
In general, some estimates are used to calculate mortality.
This number varies according to the region and frequency of time, as well as influenced by the number of tests, the quality of the health care system, the choice of treatment options, the time from the first issue, and the nature of the population such as age, type of science, and overall health.
At the end of 2019, WHO established an ICD-10 code of U07.1 for the death of SARS-CoV-2 confirmed laboratory infections and U07.2 for the death of COVID-19 diagnosed clinically or epidemiologically without the confirmation of the laboratory for SARS-CoV-2 infection. The cause of death in the case represents the number of cases of terdiagnoses in a given time interval.
According to statistics from the University of Johns Hopkins, the global mortality rate is 6.9% (153.822/2.240.191) for 17 April 2020.
Hundreds of variations are based on the region: other regulations include the number of fatalities (CFRs), which represent the percentage of people who have died from certain diseases, and the number of fatalities who have been infected (IFRs), which represents the percentage of people who are infected (terdiagnoses and non-terragnoses) who have died from certain diseases.
This statistics are not time-consuming and follow a certain population from infection to case resolution.
Although not everyone who is infected is immune to it, the immune system can provide information about the number of people who have been infected.
At the Italian news station, Castiglione d'Adda, a small town of 4600 people, 80 (1.7%) died.
In Gangelt, this disease was spread through the Karnival festival, which spread to young people, caused relatively low mortality, and probably not all deaths COVID-19 were classified as death COVID-19.
Furthermore, the German health system has not yet been established.
In the Netherlands, about 3% of the population may have antibodies, as studied by blood donors.
69 people (0,004% of the population) were raped died from COVID-19.
Looks like pandemics and mortality levels are different for men and women.
Mortality is higher than men in studies conducted in Tingkok and Italy.
The highest risk for men is 50 years old, with a list of risks between new men and women not visible at 90 years of age.
In Tingkok, the number of deaths for adults is 2.8 per cent and 1.7 per cent for women.
The reason for such diversity is unknown, but genetic factors and behavior may be factors.
The diversity of immunology is based on the type of disease, lower prevalence of smoking in women, and men with comorbid conditions, such as hypertension, younger than women, can contribute to higher mortality in men.
In Europe, 57% of the infected are men and 72% die because COVID-19 is men.
Until April 2020, the U.S. government did not track down the type of security associated with COVID-19 infection.
Studies show that virus diseases, such as Ebola, HIV, influenza, and SARS, affect men and women differently.
Hundreds of health - care professionals have high levels of women’s health, especially those who care for them, and they have a higher chance of spreading the virus.
The World Health Organization announced on February 11, 2020 that the official name of this disease is "COVID-19".
WHO leader Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explained that CO is a sign for crown, VI for virus, D for disease, and 19 for the first time identified: December 31, 2019.
This name is chosen to avoid reference to certain geographic locations (e.g. Tiongkok), animal species, or group of people, along with international recommendations for prevention of stigmatization. The virus that causes COVID-19 is called koronavirus syndrome 2 (SARS-COV-2).
WHO also uses "COVID-19" and "COVID-19" virus responsible for public communication.
Well, both disease and lesion virus are called kronavirus.
At the beginning of the newspaper in Wuhan, Tingkok, this virus and this disease must be called kronavirus and Wuhan kronavirus.
In January 2020, WHO recommended 2019-nCoV and acute respiratory disease 2019-nCov as a temporary name for virus and disease in accordance with the 2015 deadline for not using the name of the place in the name of the disease and virus.
Official names COVID-19 and SARS-COV-2 were issued on 11 February 2020.
Because of limited capacity in the standard range, some digital producers print health care materials such as nasal needles and ventilator components.
In one example, when an Italian hospital desperately needs a ventilator lock, and the customer can't give in the necessary time scale, a local company will turn around and print 100 needed locks in the night.
Following the beginning of the COVID-19 issue, conspiracy theory, misinformation, and information on origin, scale, prevention, treatment, and other aspects of disease, which are rapidly spreading.
It seems that humans have the ability to spread viruses to a few other animals.
The study failed to find evidence of viral replication on babies, babies, and dogs.
No medicine or vaccine has been agreed upon to treat this disease.
International research on COVID-19 vaccines and drugs is being conducted by government organizations, academic groups, and industrial research.
In March, the World Health Organization investigated "SOLIDARITY Trial" to investigate the effect of treatment of four antiviral souls that already have the most promising truth.
The vaccine has not yet been prepared, but various vaccines are active in developing the vaccine.
Previous studies on SARS-CoV were used by SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 together using ACE2 receptors to enter human cells.
There are three vaccination strategies under way.
First, research is intended to make viral vaccines.
The use of this virus, good non-active or dead virus, is intended to rapidly induce human immune response to new COVID-19 infection.
The second strategy, subunit vaccine, is aimed at creating vaccines that make the immune system sensitive to certain subunits.
In the SARS-CoV-2 case, this study focuses on S-spike proteins that help the virus cope with ACE2 enzyme receptors.
The third strategy is nuclear-associated vaccines (DNA or RNA vaccines, new vaccine techniques).
The experimental vaccine produced by these strategies must be tested for safety and success. On March 16, 2020, the first clinical trial began with four volunteers in Seattle.
Vaccine contains non-hazardous genetic code derived from the virus that causes disease. An antidepressants have been recommended as a potential challenge for the development of SARS-COV-2 vaccines, but this method is still controversial.
More than 300 active clinical trials are ongoing in April 2020.
Seven trials were to evaluate the treatment agreed upon for malaria, including four studies on hydroxyroquin or chloroculin.
The newly-designed antiviral drug forms a major part of Tingkok's research, with nine phase III tests tested in some countries at the end of April.
In April 2020, a dynamic approach on clinical development for COVID-19 vaccines and medicines has been established. Some antiviral medicines are being evaluated for treatment with COVID-19, which includes remdecivir, chloroquin and hydroxycloquin, lopinavir/ritonavir, and lopinavir/ritonavir are combined with beta interferons.
In March 2020, there was temporary evidence for the rescissor.
The clinical improvement was observed in patients treated with remdecivir in postpartum therapy.
Phase III clinical trials are being conducted in the US, Tiankok, and Italy. Chlorokuin, previously used to treat malaria, is being conducted in Tiankok in February 2020, with initial results.
However, there is a need for caution.
The Korean and Tingkok Health Authority recommends the use of chlorokin.
However, the Wuhan Institute of Virology, although recommending daily doses of one gram, notes that twice the dose is very dangerous and can be fatal.
On 28 March 2020, the FDA issued authorisations for the use of hydroxyroquin and chloroquin on the medical basis of COVID-19. The seventh edition of Tingkok also mentions interferon, ribavirin, or imifenovir to be used against COVID-19.
Initial data show that high doses of ribavirin are needed to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 by in vitro.
Nitazoxinide has been recommended for further study in vivo after showing SARS-CoV-2 in low concentrations.The study shows that initial protein binding by transmembran 2 protease series (TMPRSS2) is essential to enter SARS-CoV-2 through interaction with ACE2 receptor.
The study on chlorocquin and hydroxycloquin with or without azitromycin has a large limit that has prevented the medical community from using this therapy without further research. Oseltamivir did not inhibit SARS-COV-2 by in vitro and did not play a known role in COVID-19 therapy.
The complexity of the seat belt can occur at COVID-19 times more.
Tocilizumab has been included in the Tingkok National Health Commission’s treatment manual after a small study has completed.
This drug is undergoing phase 2 tests at the national level in Italy after showing positive results for people with severe diseases.
In combination with serum fertilization tests to identify systokinitis, this drug is intended to fight systokinitis, which is thought to be the cause of death for some of the most vulnerable.
In 2017, interleukin-6 receptor antagonist antagonists were approved by the FDA based on a retrospective case study for treatment of steroid refractor release syndrome induced by different causes, namely CAR T cell therapy.
To date, there has been no follow-up and controlled evidence showing that tocilizumab is a successful treatment for CRS.
Transfering cleansed and accelerated antibodies produced by the COVID-19 healer's system to those who need it is defined as a non-vaccin passport immunization method.
This strategy has been tried for SARS with non-conclusive results.
The virus neutralisation is a working mechanism for passive antibodies therapy that can mediate protection against SARS-CoV-2.
However, other mechanisms, such as single cytotoxicity that depends on antibodies and/or phagososis, may also be.
Other passive antibodies, such as monoclonal antibodies produced, are developing.
Convalescent serum production, which is part of the blood of patients who have been healed and contains specific antibodies to this virus, can be raised for faster use.
Coronavius disease, a closely associated group of syndromes
Li Wenliang, a doctor at the Wuhan Center for Diseases, who then woke up and died from COVID-19 after an outbreak of infection.
