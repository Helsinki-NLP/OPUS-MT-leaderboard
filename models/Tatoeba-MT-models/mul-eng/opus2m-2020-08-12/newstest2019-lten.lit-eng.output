"MG Baltic" case: new Gustavio lawyer says he has not yet been able to get to know the subject of the case
At the meeting of the MG Baltic Court of First Instance on Monday, all the accused were gathered: Charún Gustavis, Gintaras Steponavicius, Vytautatas Gabšys, Eligius Massius and Raimondas Kurlianskis.
The hearing began with the evidence of the accused.
At the previous court meeting, the state appointed by Mr. Gustavio lawyer Aleksandra Doroshevas told the Chamber of Justice that it was not yet possible to know the substance of the case.
At that time, MG Baltic lawyer Linas Belevićius said that in order to ensure the full defence of a person, the court must allow a new lawyer to know the substance of the case and request that the court be terminated.
"In order to ensure a person's defence, he must be aware of the subject of a criminal case.
This is not just a formal meeting," said L. Belevićius.
The new lawyer, A. Doroshevas, was not able to get to know either the defendant or the whole case.
Before that, the suspect Mr. Gustavinis told his lawyer's refusal because he did not want to pay him.
Sound records were also heard at the meeting.
Debt lawyers argue that the records submitted to the court are of low quality.
The lawyer suspects that the policy has supported or initiated positive decisions in the Seime and other public authorities by removing public procurement winners from the MG Baltic.
In the pre-trial investigation, more than 150 people, more than 50 of whom were members of the Seimas, were interviewed by several former ministers, members of the European Parliament.
More than 200 interviews were conducted and more than 30 times.
It is estimated that S. Gustavis has received more than 8 000 euros, Mr. Steponavicius - 15 thousand euros, V. Gapšys - more than 27 thousand E. Massius is suspected to have taken more than 106 thousand euros.
The Labour Party is accused of fraud and trade effects, the Liberal Union - fraud, trade and exploitation, and the MG Baltic is accused of buying and selling these parties.
It is estimated that the policy on the subject of fraud is in consultation with the vice-president of the MG Baltic Group, R. Kurlianski, and then the Seime or other institutions have proposed or supported the group's favourable initiatives.
Ethics lawyer: Liberal Court of Justice on the right to vote in Vilnius
"The decisions taken by the Management Board are in accordance with the laws" - after the meeting of the Commission, its Head, Vytauta Tamoshiun, was informed by BNS.
"Our decision was not something new.
We had already made an explanation as the Commission in July when there was a question about Easter and Utuna.
Then we said that under the laws it was a matter of board competence.
And if the Board decides that a section may act as it wishes - to go with the Committee and the Board agrees with it, then the section may go, but if the Board decides that there will be all the lists of the management and the decisions it has taken, then it is the decision that all the sections form the lists of the parties.
And if there is no agreement with the board, then it is possible to stop membership and go with the committee," he added.
According to V. Tamoshin, the Party Board will now decide on further action.
On 17 October, the Board of the Liberal Union of the Party rejected the decision of the City of Vilnius Division to participate in municipal councils, not with the party, but with the newly elected committee.
In the opinion of the Board of the Party, the decision of the main Liberals to participate in the elections in the form of a Committee on Social Elections violated the laws of the Party, decisions of the Board.
By 31 October, Vilnius had to withdraw its intention to participate in the municipal elections with the Committee's list.
But the chapter didn't.
The former Head of the Section, Mr Armonaitė, has already resigned from the Liberal Union.
Mr. Vilniaus, former President of the Liberal Union, Remigius Šimašius, who was hoping to reach another presidential term, has already presented the team and the idea of the Social Elections Committee "Ok Wilnias to be raised!".
He also left the party.
The elections of municipal councils and mayors will take place next year.
The inhabitants of the village in northern India, who had previously met a man by tractor, reported to the officials on Monday.
The forest management officer Mahaviras Kaujlag (Mahaviras Kaujlagis) said that the next day after seeing a man working in the fields, the village saw a star and, at the same time, tried to break her down, she was dragged by a tractor.
The residents say that this tiger also collapsed and raped a young man about ten days ago.
The village is located in the village of Dudhvos tigers in the district of Lakhympur Kherio, about 250 km west of the capital of the state of the Uttar Pradesh.
It shall be prohibited to operate in safe areas.
Director Rameshas Pandey (Rames Pandjus) said that the case would be notified to the police under the Rural Nature Protection Act.
In April the Uttar Pradesh region of Nighasan was hit by another tiger, which suffered serious damage.
It is India’s national animal; under the Rural Nature Protection Act, tigers are considered to be present species.
Last year’s government data show that at least one third of the people were killed each day during meetings with rural tigers or dragons.
People's conflicts with tigers are increasing gradually from the 8th century when India launched a tiger protection programme, which established bans in national parks and the end of large cats started to be considered a crime.
Although the calculation methods of tigers have changed, the descriptions would show that the annual population of approximately 1,800 tigers increased to 2,226 individuals in 2014.
Suggested cats and dogs to be marked with microschemes
The President of the Environmental Protection Committee of the Seed Kęstutis Mäžekka, together with other members of the Seed, has recorded the provisions of the Animal Welfare and Protection Act, which offer cats and dogs compulsory identification of subcutaneous microschemes.
"We propose that cats and dogs should be marked with subcutaneous microschemes and that their registration and labelling be organised by local municipalities, the Ministry of Agriculture and the State Food and Veterinary Service.
In the year 2019, public funds will be free of charge for all dogs, and in the year 2020 - also for cats, so there will be no need for public funding for residents and no cost," said Kästutis Mäjeka, president of the Environmental Protection Committee of the Sea.
The provisions of the Law aim to address the systemic need for labelling of domestic animals.
It is expected that this will help to avoid problems caused by irresponsible animal growers, illegal breeders or sellers.
It is provisionally estimated that, at the expected average cost of the provision of microschemes and services of around EUR 5, compensation will be paid to all animal family members during the transitional period.
The total price of labelling for all animals may reach up to EUR 6 million.
It is planned that the need for these funds will be allocated within three years and will reach EUR 2 million each year.
It is envisaged that funds will be allocated to labelling programmes through a special programme to support municipal environmental protection, which will significantly increase income this year due to the increase in the distribution of natural resources and funds.
These funds will be used by municipalities not only to mark cats and dogs but also to castrations and other programmes.
According to K. Mazekis, the mandatory labelling practice has spread almost throughout the European Union, allowing for the protection of the animals themselves (except for which it is easy to return to their owners), and has saved the time of the farmers of the animals themselves when there is a lot of time and money to be devoted to the pursuit of farming.
Furthermore, EU legislation provides that travel can only be made with marked growth.
At the same time, the marking is obliged to take care of the animal for the rest of its life.
The previous proposals were mandatory to mark the opposition as the programmes concerned were proposed to finance the population's funds.
"The model now being given should avoid this criticism because animal protection is proposed to be financed by increased income in the environmental protection support programme and the right to mark not only for veterinary physicians but also for the public, i.e. for persons of animal deep institutions who have heard special courses in the Veterinary Academy," the project authors say.
The draft law was registered by a group of Seima members representing the Seimas groups - Kęstutis Mäžek, Algimantas Dumbrava, Eugenijus Gentvilas, Edmundas Pupinis, Rimas Andrikis, Antana Vinkus and others.

"Rytas" was a real help to the Ukrainian club
On the third day, the FIBA will be held in the area of Vilnius "Ryto" and will meet with the Kosovo and Ukraine Club.
Dvikova will be prepared in the capital for political reasons.
A warm relationship with the Ukrainian Krepney will follow the command of the Czechs "Cherkaski Mavpy" and the Estonian "KB Prishtina" on 7 November.
"For the political reasons between Kosovo and Ukraine, we were unable to organize this game at home, so we are very happy that our friends from Vilnius agreed to accept us, - "The East" thanked Ukrainian teamman Maxim Michelson.
- We have a lot of friends in Vilnius, and our countries always agree well.
Lithuania is one of the best countries in the world with the tradition of kark, so it will be a real honor to play here.
Let's hope we'll get out of the van.
The Kosovo team was unable to reach Ukraine because these countries do not have any diplomatic relations.
At present, the Ukrainian team takes the third place after the first round of three meetings, and the Kosovo team is in second position and has more than one.
This will be very important because only two teams will reach the next stage.
In the past, the elections of Ukraine and Kosovo also took place in Vilnius at the 2017 European Summer Championship.
Then 100:61 victory was celebrated by the Ukrainian team.
On the third day, you will be free of charge, and you will start on Tuesday - 19 o'clock.
"Women love better" star actor B. Arsobyte pursues melags
This is almost a coincidence, but the great red player Brigita Arsobaitė has been playing with melancholy for a time.
From the beginning the series "Motherys love better", then the show "Melage" and finally the comedy "Melages".
In this film, Brigita is playing a prominent character of Daniel Kazlausko's hero.
"I liked to film "Melagasles," because I'm more an actor and others I've shown very rarely.
A great team of colleagues has been gathered since the beginning of the search engine.
This experience is very important and valuable to me.
But the most interesting thing happened in the camp was the dog Sunny!
For the rest of my life, I thought if I had a dog, it would be really big and serious.
I've never had those small, decorative "fifu" fours.
But during the film, Sunny became so attached to me that sympathy became mutual and finally I even tried to buy it from the family but failed," exclaimed the actor.
A new Lithuanian comedy "Melagai", which has been produced by Lithuanian Chinese Chinese cinemas "Netary" and "Tarp our boys and boys..." by Paulus Virbick and the producers Stasys Baltakis and Vladimir Razarionovas.
Your lover just told me she's waiting.
You'd be great to know, just... your love is your brother's wife!
But that's not all.
I can't tell everyone "good news," the parents suddenly say - they're different!
After 50 years together...
And all of this takes place even before the most beautiful year - St. Christmas!
But the end will be even more surprising because none of these atoms have ever been found.
All the heroes are not what they look like from the first glance...
In addition to B. Arsobaitė's comedy "Melagai" is a good reference to the viewers' four-time movie stars: Giedrius Savick, Danius Kazlauskas, Edita Užaitė, Giedrē Giedraitytė, Liubomiras Laucevicius, Larisa Kalpokaitė and Gediminas Girdvinis.
Comedy "Melagai" in China since 9 November.
Decision on the registration of EUR 100 million of unpaid taxes on immigrants
The Seimas agreed on Tuesday to consider the amendment of the law of the residence of the leader of Ramón Karbauski, "States".
56 Members of the Seima voted against -9 and stayed 25.
The Seimas will continue to consider the amendments on 6 December or later, pending the Government's conclusions.
According to Mr Karbauski, these benefits are calculated for people who have not declared their departure from Lithuania.
According to the Parliamentary, one person does not spend about EUR 1 thousand in three years, and now there are about 100 thousand such persons.
Social Democrat Algirdas Syss stressed that this way, the Seimas is part of people's "no obligation" - to declare departure and then no taxes would be counted.
The Conservatory of the Health Committee, Mr Matulas, noted that Lithuanians living abroad are using a small health insurance tax to treat them in Lithuania - they are provided with the same services as those who pay this tax to the residents.
Corrections are provided for in Lithuania to be regarded as persons whose social insurance benefits are payable in the European Union, the European Economic Area States or the Swiss Confederation and which will be exempt from the payment of health insurance benefits in Lithuania by Sodra.
Head of "Sodros" Mindaguas Sinkevicius has previously said that such a step will facilitate the lives of immigrants and the activities of Sodros.
A video entry about a listening mouse reveals a serious problem on the Internet
Nufilated as the mother swabs her breast with a still snowy milk, and the baby is still a lip, drys down, and repeats a copy.
The video entry received many reviews and comments.
People were laughing at a small waiter's retreat - not once when it landed on the ground, he fell to his mother again.
It does not occur from the first time, but the little one does not try to give up and eventually achieves his goal.
The image’s record really depends on attention, but it also reveals the danger that humans pose to animals.
Scientists argue that it is also necessary to talk about the need to know the natural world at times to be harmful.
"I can see that the late drone has escaped very well.
From their movements, they see that they are worried.
If the drones were not spread around the environment, they would probably choose a safer path or if it were more slow or cautious.
This is an excellent example of how drones should not be used," Ecologist Mark Ditmer said to The Verge.
Before long, Mr. Ditmer, together with his colleagues, examined how the drones work.
Animal heart muscles were adjusted.
When the drones were finally released, others did not flee, but their hearts began to cry more often from the rescue.
Scientists advise dragons to use their animals for responsible use, not to cross through the earth, not to cause confusion, and not to walk where they are forbidden.
You asked the President to run through the paper.
On Tuesday, when President Viktor Janukovyc arrived in Russia, after his resignation, the Kiev court called on President Janukovy to come to the proceedings in an unusual way because of his alleged state issue, he announced an appeal in the State's official press.
At the Court’s appeal, published in the Government’s Knowledge paper, the former leader is invited to attend a trial hearing held on 19 November, during which his final arguments may be heard.
The document indicates that Mr. Janukovivić is entitled to participate in the video.
On 30 October, the Kievo Court issued a final debate on the Janukovivić case.
A lawyer working in Russia, Aleksandr Gorošinski, was given the opportunity to register a foreign lawyer register before 19 November so that he could attend a meeting where V. Janukovyči is expected to communicate with his last voice.
Kremlious supported by V. Janukovychius was deported and fled to Russia during the 2014 Spring of Madana, which was forced to sign an association with the European Union Treaty.
Russian President Vladimir Putin later revealed that the former Ukrainian leader was deported to Russia through a special operation organised by Moscow.
That year, Russia renewed its war on the part of Ukraine, which belonged to the Middle East, and as soon as war broke out in the eastern part of the country, it fought between the Soviet-based separatists.
Since then some 10,000 lives have been lost, despite numerous attempts by the international community to ensure long-term survival.
List of conservators to the City Council of Vilnius by Valdas Benkunskas
The Conservatives' candidate has already been approved by the former Minister of Economy, Mr Danius Kreivys.
On the week following the first elections of the conservators, the party members submitted a list of candidates to the municipal council of the city of Vilnius.
As reported by the party, President Benkunskas of the TS-LKD Vilniaus Section of the Conservative List became the leader of the Conservatives.
In the first ten candidates, members of the municipal council of the city of Vilnius met Paulė Kuzmickienė, Adams Buzinska, Gediminas Švilpa, Audrios Skistis, Rasa Baskienė, former Seima Member, Laura Kazlavick, President of the Youth Conservative Level Mantas Benkunskas, Arón Valinskas and Goda Karaziatė.
The direct elections of the Mehr and municipal councils in Lithuania will take place on 3 March next year.
Restrictions on cogenerational forces against the Constitutional Court
As was the case with the applicant, the Constitutional Court (CT) has challenged the decision of the administering Powers to adopt a law on the possibility of preventing the construction of the power of fire.
On Tuesday, the opposition group of the Christian Democrats (TS-LKD) of the Seima Union of Parents-Lithuania reported that a group of Seima members had been invited to the CT by requesting an examination of the amendments to the Law on the Management of Wastes adopted by the Governing Council.
"Parliamentarians emphasize that the provisions of the law aim to diversify existing waste-fired projects by allowing the Government to establish new restrictions (20 km away from the residential area) until the entry into force of the law in Vilnius and Kaune to build waste-fire forces," says the report.
"The Parliament notes that in view of the fact that the ban on the construction of State-wide waste management objects (i.e. the definition of distance and the definition of "living territory"), it is concluded that this insurance is not disproportionately restricted or even denied the right to carry out the same economic activity related to the production of waste fuel, essentially because it is based on the criteria to form such an assessment of the density and distribution of residents of Lithuania in the country as it is practically impossible to build such objects throughout the country," it adds.
The appeal claims that the legislation adopted is contrary to the constitutional principle of the state of law.
"The CT has not yet been indicated that the legislation does not apply to the legal facts and facts which have occurred before the new act has been adopted.
In this case, the Government shall be empowered to apply the law again in accordance with non-defined criteria.
When such a legal regulation is laid down to violate constitutional principles of legal certainty, legal certainty, legal certainty, legal expectations protection and thus constitutional rule of law," says the petition.
It also notes that large financial investments have already been made in the projects of Vilnius and Kauna cogenerational forces.
With the lack of projects currently being carried out, the State would not only experience hundreds of millions of financial losses, major losses and Lithuanians - increase the heat prices, resulting in an increase in environmental pollution due to rising waste disposal.
The invitation to the CT was signed by members of the Seima TS-LKD, the Liberal Union, the Social Democrats Group and the former vice-president of the ruling Social Democrats Working Group, Algirdas Butkevičius.
A few weeks ago, the Seimas managed to raise 71 votes in favour in order to reject the amendments to the Waste Management Act adopted by the President of Part Grybauskaitė veto to ban the Government's right to build cogenerational power buildings, and also set 20 km from the site 'carantino' to build such power.
Since 1 January 2019, the Court of Justice, which has been re-adjusted by the Seimas, has already proposed the rejection of a 20 km limit.
This proposal is planned to be considered again at the Seima Greens session.
However, the Government's right to ban already started projects is not planned.
The CT will consider this case in the course of the series - not before one year.
LeBron James's statistics on issues were published at Lakers Club
LeBron James's career begins at the Los Angeles Lakers club is not the same as he believed himself, the organization and the teammen.
The "Lakers" season began with four victories and six losses, and such a weak start helped bring to the masses the possible release of coach Luke Waltton.
All these words were addressed by President Magica Johnson, who said that the trainer will not leave but will need to play better.
The greatest command of the star L. James should turn back to himself.
Although half-life statistics are usually impressive - 26.8 points, 7.6 returns and 7.7 results.
But she didn't tell the whole truth.
During the first ten season, there were also other numbers showing that "Lakers" is playing better when there is no L. James in the field.
The party is not pleased with the +/- statistics showing how many points the team has entered or missed when there are certain players in the field.
Here, when L. James is in the field, "Lakers" missed 30 points this season more than the bears.
When he was sitting on the lake, he received 19 points more than the robbers.
"Lakers" is currently only in 13 places at the Western Conference, but a number of transitions can turn everything into high feet.
Spain will continue to contribute to the protection of Lithuania's airspace
The meeting noted that Spain would contribute to the protection of the airspace of Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia in 2019 and 2020.
"Lithuania appreciates Spain's cooperation with NATO and its contribution to the security of our country and region," Minister L. Linkević said.

V. Thank you for Mr Ačo's detention: I believe in man's innocence and the rule of law
"I was the most incredible thing I could never think of.
On the other hand, the service is likely to carry out the work it has to do.
We're all working on it.
I hope the lawyer, I hope my husband is fair and honest, that no unjust action should be taken by him," said Mr Achienė, BNS.
R. The Special Investigations Service (STT) held on Monday - the lawyer suspects that, as director of the administration of the municipality of Rasei, he took a high-value interest and, in exchange, was able to create exceptional conditions for the private company by signing a contract with the municipality's managed Rasei bus park.
The representatives of private companies are directly suspected of buying R. Ača or participating in the masking of the various financial operations.
In April of this year, the Council of the Municipalities of the Region R. Aqá was dismissed from the Administrative Director's duties after the third test following the statement of non-conformity.
The former "regulatory" this year became a member of the Party of Social Democrats of Lithuania, headed by Gedimino Kirkilo, who was newly established this year, and he stopped membership in this party on the first day.
R. A few years ago he failed to apply for a representative of your Races Committee in the Mero elections.
V. Aqienė said that the man did not intend to hold his candidate in the Rasei Mere elections next year, but he had not yet decided whether he had not participated in the municipal councils.
V. Thanks to the Seimas, which is listed by the Lithuanian States and the Green Union, she is a member of the Seima Anti-Corruption Commission.
The policy is calling for further legislative action - depending on whether it will be removed from the Commission's work.
"I really don't make wise decisions today, this week, I think, I'll decide.
I will see, if there is a need for the charges to be made, clearly, I will make one or more decisions.
I may need to leave all the things that are investigated in the Anti-Corruption Commission, but later - all the time will be spent in its place," she said.
The opposition conservative representative of Seime Radvilė Morkūnė-Miculínienė invited Seima President Victor France and Head of State Ramón Karbauska to remove from the Group's Group's statement and withdraw it from the Seima Anti-Corruption Commission by moving to another Seed Committee or commission.
It says that the work of Mr Achienja in the Seima Anti-Corruption Commission "would lead to a public-based mistrust and a derecognised work of the important parliamentary oversight commission".

Grybauskaitä calls on China to create a better investment environment for EU business
President Dalia Grybauskaitė invites China to create a better investment environment for investment by the European Union (EU) countries to facilitate foreign import conditions.
In opening the Trade and Investment Forum on Chinese Imports in Shanghai, Grybauskaitė stressed that the overall objective of economic developments should be "to combine efforts to prevent the spread of protectionism in the world", based on the main causes of the outbreaks of trade wars, "production surpluses and unfair competition".
"The European Union is very important to China's commitment to create a more attractive, open environment for investment - it is important to negotiate a trade agreement with China.
It is important to conclude this trade contract as soon as possible by ensuring that foreign businesses are safe and secure here, as well as by strengthening the protection of intellectual property," said Dr. Grybauskaitė.
According to them, China's withdrawal is important not only for Europe but also for this country as well as for global economic growth.
The head of Lithuania stressed that the transparency of investments must be "more than any business group's interests".
"Planity, superiority of laws, strict compliance with international agreements - this must be an essential part of the new investment environment," stressed Dr. Grybauskaitė.
"The corrupt capital flows should not be expected in any state of the world - not just here or in our countries," she added.
China's imports show an attempt to undermine criticism that it avoids opening its market and only protects its companies.
The sales involve the leaders of several states, with more than 2800 companies from 130 countries and regions of the world, including Lithuania.
According to data from the Lithuanian Statistics Department, China is currently operating 25 seats between exporting partners.
Over the past two years, Lithuania's exports to China have grown by 50% - reaching EUR 180 million.
At the same time, imports from China amounted to over EUR 820 million.
Some officials are not concerned that China's investment in Lithuania can have an undesirable political impact, while Beijing's exclusive focus is on Eastern Europe's unity.

The reason for the "Lion Air" disaster was revealed: the death toll
The data from the Leon Air liner of the Indonesian Air Company concerned show that during at least four recent flights, there was a rapid matriculation disorder, which was reported by the researchers on the first day.
The president of the National Transport Security Committee (NTSK) said that the same route occurred during the last four flights, including the decisive time when the carrier landed at the Java Sea on 29 October immediately after departure from Jakarta.
During this disaster, 189 people died on the plane.
A number of media media reports on unsolicited incidents in the past flew Boeing 737 MAX 8 flights from Denpasaro to Indonesia.
"When we opened the black box - yes, indeed the technical problem was a fast hour, in other words, a fast flight," said Mr. Tjahjono at the press conference.
"The black box data showed that during two flights before the trip, Denpasaras-Jakarta was also the same problem," he added.
"In social networks, there are many gangs.
Now we want to explain that in the black box (data came out) there were four flights that had problems with speedy noise," the Head of NTSK said.
During a meeting with members of killed families, S. Tjahjon said that the information of the flight data-recording device was consistent with the reports that the flight's speed and the altitude of the last flight had changed irremediatedly.
The search command has not yet been found in the second black box listing the conversations in the pilot's cabin.
"Lion Air" indicated that it was adjusted according to the manufacturer's recommendations after it was established during a flight from Bali to Jakarta.
One of the company’s creators, Rusdi Kirana, was not invited to order the liaison minister Budi Karyos Sumadi, who moderated the meeting of family members with officials who supervised the flight and the search for victims and the investigation of disasters.
However, he stood up and broke his head when members of the families who were in trouble and wished that R. Kirana, together with his brother Kusnanu, would be built "Lion Air" in 1999.
"Lion Air was wrong," said one man, assisted by a passenger named Shandy Johanno Ramadhan, who worked on the prosecutor's island where the plane was flying.
"I want Mr. Rusdi Kirana and his team to draw attention to it," he said.
Since the beginning of the crisis, Lion Air has never met me.
We didn't beat our child, but Lion Air didn't show us any feelings.
After this meeting, R. Kirana left with complaints, avoiding journalists' questions.
Many families expect long-term results from the process of identifying the dead.
Police medical experts were transferred to nearly 140 lavender bags loaded with human spare parts.
So far only 14 victims have been identified.
The family asked why it was allowed to fly during the 28th flight from Bali to Jjakarta, two months ago, when passengers escaped from the escape route to Jjakarta.
"Lion Air" said this move was removed.
Is it true that the problem was solved?
- If not, the relevant techniques should be withdrawn from liability.
The law was very clear, they did not claim that the plane was allowed to be reopened.
These bad techniques must be answered under the law so that aircraft disasters in Indonesia will not be repeated.
Mr. Tjahjono said that the large amount of small catches and the fact that there was a drop in very small areas shows that the carrier was the most active climber in the water by flying very fast.
"The plane was unique when it turned to the sea.
He didn't blow his ear, and he flew off the engine when he dropped the water, he acted with great shocks - it shows all the broken turbulence minds," the officer explained.
The lions Air line is the largest plane crash in Indonesia since 1997, when 234 people were killed by Medana by the company Guarda.
After the disaster, rescuers were led by disasters: injured and underage
On Monday evening on the road Väžäiči - Płunė, Tilvikais met cars "BMW" and "Mercedes-Benz".
The cars were hit by a catholic report of three injured people.
It is reported that the BMW driver, born in 1999, drove to the opposite side of the road and hit Mercedes-Benz, whose father was born in 1967 and daughter, born in 2005.
The "BMW" driver survived the fires - rescuers.
The Mercedes-Benz bastards are gonna break their teeth through the accident.
All the people who have been in trouble getting out of the hospital.
Presidency: no working facilities are required for referendum
Following the adoption of a proposal by the Governors to reduce the referendum card to the first section of the Constitution which currently has greater protection, the president of the amendment to the veto said its adviser, Mr. Mindaguas Ling.
"The Constitution has already voted for more than half of the population - this is the requirement.
This and its change , in particular the articles contained in its first section , should indeed be at least a majority .
I do not find it difficult to warn that the President would be really old," said the next day on the news radio of the National Council of Grybauskaitė.
He stressed that the first section of the Constitution defines basic matters of state - language, delay, territory, capital, sovereignity, thus reducing the number of votes necessary for these articles, according to Mr Ling, would create "an unacceptable precedent" and "an unmanaged risk".
"In the President's view, there is no need for any job facilitation, more preparation for the same referendum, more dialogue is needed with people," he said.
The Seimas plans to vote on Tuesday on the adoption of the amendment to the Reference Act.
It provides for the adoption of a decision on amendments to the first and fourth sections of the Constitution with a higher protection if, during the referendum, at least two fifths of citizens have the right to vote.
At the present time, more than half of all citizens entitled to vote may be replaced by the referendum referred to in the first and fourth sections of the Constitution.
The right to vote in Lithuania has about 2.5 million citizens: half will be 1.25 million voters, two fifths - one million voters.
This proposal was born after Seimas adopted the Presidential Act in September on amendments adopted by Parliament on the number of votes for the amendment of Article 12 of the first section of the Constitution.
The draft referendum is proposed to reduce the preparation of a referendum on dual citizenship, which should take place on 12 May and 26 May next year when the presidential elections are scheduled for the first and second round.
Emigrating migrants after the recovery of independence on 11 March 1990 cannot have double citizenship except for some exceptions.
The dual citizenship seeks the world’s Lithuanian community, but it is afraid that, under the conditions of the referendum, there will not be enough people to vote.
R. Massoulis: Lithuanian airport "braška", so they need to be updated
Lithuania's airport and road infrastructure are beginning to collapse, so it needs to be updated, said Minister of Communications Rokas Masius.
According to him, the renewal of Vilnius airport is a minimum task for the State.
"The air transport infrastructure is already fragile because it has been planned for smaller passenger flows.
We have to update Vilnius Airport - this is not even enough for further planning, this is a minimum we have to do," said Mr. Massius on Tuesday at the meeting of the State Development Fund and the newspaper.
According to the Minister, the next decade will be very important because important projects will have to be carried out - the "Via Baltica", "Rail Baltica", built in Klaipėda's external port, the renewal of Vilnius and Kauna Airports, and perhaps the new airport.
"The next decade will be very important - we need to complete road integration, the construction of the external port in Klaipėda, the construction of airports, perhaps deciding on the construction of a new airport.
We must not sleep, now start projects that will cost our potential after 10, 20 or 30 years," said the Minister of Contact.
Mr. Masoulis said that over the past few years there has been too little money for car maintenance.
"There are a number of things that are not going well because money is not given enough.
We are able to build new roads, but even the most necessary maintenance, such as on the main roads, is lacking funds.
We have to figure out how much care should be given if we want to improve their situation," said Mr. Massoulis.
He stressed that the export of services in the Lithuanian transport sector this year increased by 18.6% and the largest export market became Germany's area of Russia.
Mr Masoulis once again criticised the European Commission's proposal that EU carriers be obliged to return stamps periodically to the country of registration.
"We must strive to make our exporters in Western Europe feel at home.
In my opinion, the proposal for a permanent return to the village is absurd because there would be empty shipments in Europe that would burn up fuel that would increase emissions.
Most of this is the success of railways because some will grow as much as part of the transport to the railways.
We're looking for ways to cover our positions," said Mr. Masoulis.
According to the Ministry of Communication, 12.2% of the transport sector is created.
Total domestic product of Lithuania (BVP).
It employs more than 118,000 employees and operates more than 7,500 companies.
Fighting with heirs
Last week, Mr Masoulis told the Seima Economic Committee that the negotiations on the cultural purpose of the cultural change of Vilnius airport building would allow for an old terminal and a new building.
However, the interim director of the Department of Cultural Heritage (KPD) named Algimantas Degutis P. Massoulio's discussions on political pressure.
According to him, the building built in the past six decades is a value, recorded in 1993 and not a policy, and specialists must decide on its withdrawal.
Mr. Massius then commented that modern arrival terminals would contribute to improving Lithuania's image.
"The removal of that old terminal would be a politically important step towards turning it back and building a new terminal of modern arrival so that we can feel back to Vilnius in a modern country, rather than that we can imagine that we are really not representing our country as innovative," said Seime last week.
Mr. Massius also announced that Kaune is planning to build a completely new passenger terminal and airport to connect to the Rail Baltica cancer, building a underground station.
This transport should take place in 2026 after the direct "Rail Baltica".
Pernai Vilnia Airport served about 3.7 million people, an estimated 4.8 million passengers this year, and another year 5 million.
Kauna Airport served 1.2 million passengers throughout the world.

Ballyy Burachas.
Lithuanian working traditions and concepts
It was not until 120 years after the birth of a prominent Lithuanian photographer and cultural metrothic, ethnographer and patriotist Balio Burač (1897-1972) in Sidari, the state of Šiaulián, in that year in the Government of Šiaulių.
With reference to the 100-year anniversary of the Republic of Lithuania, we have good reason to remember how life-saving national heritage has attracted many of the Lithuanian people, including their brothers Buraçu - Bala, Jona, Broní - from the village itself, to the creative power to join our cultural traditions.
Ballys Burachas, who traveled for more than 50 years after the country was born with the camera in his hands, presented a wide and real picture of our country's simplicity, traditions, people's art and material culture.
He sought to preserve the rapidly deteriorating national cultural logos and had a rare ability to grasp the continuing value of his work.
In Bali Burač photos Lithuania's landscape, urban landscapes, everyday life and the holy environment of our people have decorated the pages of Lithuanian newspapers and magazines.
This publication provides a small part of the description of the Bali Burach's legacy for national work and related traditions and, most importantly, their attractive iconography.
The material published shows not only the peculiarity and beauty of these traditions but also the progress of our civilization over the past century, despite two world wars and difficult occupations.
The book has received a great deal of information from the medieval landscapes, especially the purchasers, archaeologists, temples, temples and other traditions, as well as descriptions of the works of the people of Austria and Dzukia.
Some 10,000 negative remains of museums and archives have been selected for this publication over 400 times, mostly unpublished, photos collected in accordance with selected texts.
They reflect unique aspects of ethnic culture, such as buyers, pigs, other regions of Austria and the Netherlands.
The suspect escaped from the police car in Geneva for 4 hours.
As a young man (c. 1994) was able to get out of an official car, officials were not able to disclose anything.
He was taken to prison for questioning by the guards.
At about 16 hours, the police distributed a photo of the flight and called on the public to ask for help: "From the official car exit door, the suspect is Judge Dalius Malakuskas (born 1994).
The person ran away with the afternoons.
If you notice this person, please contact us by tel. 112 or 8700 60,000.

The Police Department reported: "The suspect has been detained in Panama, and he goes another case for the trial to run.
Thank you all for your help.
Tragic stay: killed only after several hours of marriage
In the southern part of the state of Texas, U.S.A., only a couple of young people were killed in the accident just a few hours ago.
24-year-old William Troy's Byleris and his wife, Bailey Raye Ackerman Byler, died on Sunday shortly after midnight after entering a speech 16 km north of Juvaldje and 129 km west of San Antonijas, local peace judge Steven Kennedy said.
It turns out that the accident took place after some 25 miles [24 km], at the same time as many young people were in years.
The 76-year-old Air Force pilot Gerald Douglas Lawrence also died.
Young people studied at the State University of Sam Houston, which is located in the city of Huntsville, Texas.
They met on Saturday evening at the home of the Biller family near Juvaldi and after the wedding ceremony, a family - in - law fire fighting broke out.
An accident occurred after an explosion of about 24 miles [24 km].
The young people flew to Sant Antonija’s international airport, where they were about to fly into the airport and fly for a month, said S. Kennedy, not referring to the destination of the final pair.
"It's a very remote, poor releif place, and that language is about 120-150 meters high," said S. Kennedy.
Mr. Lawrence had been piloting those family aircraft for years.
According to S. Kennedy, he was piloting the explosives and using Vietnam.
After the bus, it should be clear what the physical condition of the pilot was and whether he could not become a cause of disaster.
The windscreen was loaded about 5-10 minutes after the lifting.
Its impact was widely reflected on the mouth of the street, and the corpus remained "dangerous" during the press conference, said researcher Craig Hatchas of the National Transport Safety Board (NTSB).
The explorers were intent on eliminating the frustrations and then making it difficult to look at them, but it will not be easy to reach that place, he said.
The cause of disaster is not yet established and the preliminary NTSB report should be published in two weeks.
Israel's Prime Minister calls the entry into force of new sanctions on Iran "historic day"
"Today is a historic day," said Mr. Netanyahu to members of his party "Likud", his office reported.
"This is the day when, under the leadership of the President (Donald) Trump (Donald Trappui), the United States imposes a particularly severe sanctions on Iran, the most severe sanctions on Iran all the time it began its aggression," the head of the Israeli government said.
Earlier this morning, Israel's Defence Minister Avigdor Lieberman (Avigdor Lyberman) said that the new sanctions would put an "equivalent" burden on Israel's actions in the region.
The measures adopted by Washington, D.C., on the basis of a decision adopted by Mr Trumpo in May to withdraw from the World Powers Agreement with Tehran on its nuclear programme, began after the end of the month of May.
The sanctions aim to significantly reduce Iran's oil exports, which have already suffered some one million barrels a day since May and to reverse Tehran from international funding.
Israel has previously disagreed with the above-mentioned agreement with Iran and says that its scope and deadlines are too limited.
The Jewish State also says that the abolition of sanctions has made it possible for Iran to finance combatants' groups and their own military activities.
Israel is particularly concerned about Iran’s actions in neighboring Syria and promises not to allow it to adopt a military attitude there.
Another agreement with Iran - Great Britain, France, Germany, China and Russia - does not support the U.S. decision and says that the agreement has so far prevented Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons.
The Court re-examines the circumstances of the killing of a young motorcyclinian
The death of a young motorcyclist in Vilnius, Northern City, after an accident, will be heard by the court of the witness.
On Tuesday, the Court of Auditors decided that in order to clarify all significant circumstances of the case, one of the witnesses of the case would be interviewed at the next meeting on 26 November.
In this case, a judicial decision has already been published, but the prosecutor does not agree with it.
On 22 June, the city’s district court of Vilnius ruled that the car driver of a motorcycling accident had been killed, after 79 years of having told Edward Osipov that the driver was driving too fast in the city and had committed serious damage.
The Vilnia District Court has asked the District Court to annul the decision of the District Court and claims that because of the accident, the greatest debt is borne by E. Osipovu and the findings of the District Court are unfounded.
Cancel a judicial decision by a family attorney of the family of the applicant and the motorcyclist who has died.
The accident took place on 11 August 2015, about 15 hours after E. Osipovo drove the car "Skoda Fabia" from the Lakunė street into Zirmūn's street and met with the main road.
The prosecutor accused him of violating road traffic rules and causing a traffic event - a man driving the main road "Piaggo" by fishing.
The first police reports indicate that the driver of the motor vehicle was killed but later after investigations, it was found that the vehicle is comparable to the engine as possible.
Judge Roland Buzinska BNS of the City District Court of Vilnius has said that experts have found that the driver drove 89.2 kilometres per hour, although the speed at that location is 50 km per hour.
"The driver of the car could not predict that the motorcycle would run so fast," said the lawyer.
At the time, the old car driver stood only five to six miles per hour.
The driver tried to stop and drive out of the vehicle before meeting with "Skoda Fabia".
The prosecutor believed that E. Osipovas had to give a ride from the main road to the motorcyclist.

The former king of Belgium will have to carry out a parental test
This Decision is part of the victory of the artist Delphine Boel.
Since 2013, she has been seeking recognition of the former monarchy.
A 50-year-old woman claims that her mother, Baroness Sybile de Selys Longchamps and Albert's II, had a romantic romance decades ago.

In response to this investigation, Delphine asked for the recognition of Albert's daughter's "true" father.
Money will be distributed to VRK parties, but there will be nothing for social workers
This week, the Chief Electoral Commission (CEC) intends to allocate almost EUR 3 million of the budget to the largest political parties.
This summer, the ruling Lithuanian Social Democrats Labour Party (LSDP), led by Vice-President Gedimino Kirkil of Parliament, has been established until the budget has been allocated.
However, they may be addressed by a separate decision of the CSD in the near future if the legal environment changes which regulates the allocation of grants to parties.
Laura Matjošaityte, VRK President, informed the U.S. that "the Commission's meeting on this Thursday is scheduled to take a decision on the allocation of the budget for the Parties".
According to them, the decision on this matter should be taken by the CRA by 15 November.
The distribution of EUR 2,751 million is intended for seven parties, six of whom are parliamentary parties.
The opposition-Lithuania Christian Democrats should receive more than EUR 0.66 million, heads of State and Green Unions - about EUR 0.55 million, opposition social Democrats parties - about EUR 0.5 million, opposition to the Liberal Union - almost EUR 0.4 million, Seime non-working parties - about EUR 0.23 million, recently associated with Tvarka and justice parties - almost EUR 0.22 million, represented in Parliament, but neither the ruling or the opposition non-governmental association of the Polish elections-Christian families - about EUR 0.18 million.
In accordance with the current law, which has been passed by the Governing Council on budgetary allocations, grants shall be allocated to parties which comply with the requirements laid down in the Law and have received at least 3% of the votes in the recent Seimas, municipal councils and elections of the European Parliament.
Therefore, the current legal regulation does not allow this summer's LSDDP to expect money from the budget.
However, this party has not yet participated in any single collections.
The fact is that the ruling coalition is trying to amend the law so that social workers will receive at least one hundred thousand euros in coming to the next three elections - the municipality, the President and the European Parliament.
The relevant amendment to the laws of the political parties and of the budget of Seima was adopted by President Dalia Grybauskaitė.
The Seimas have not yet been decided on this issue, but the ruling representatives, Mr. Kirkal and Head of State-Green, Ramón Karbauskis, believe that Parliament will succeed in rejecting the presidential opposition.
However, it will not be possible to do so until this Thursday's JRC meeting, so, according to Mr Matjoshaityt, "donations will be distributed in accordance with the existing legal procedure and so far".
In fact, the Director of the CRIC did not point out that if the Seimas withdrew the presidential veto this or another week and the new amendments to the budget allocation parties could be considered by the Commission on the allocation of additional grants to individual political forces, including LSDDP.
"We will take the decision into account the current legal environment as we are the implementing authority to implement the laws adopted," she said.
If the Seimas were able to withdraw the veto and new laws, the Government would grant additional amounts to the parties under which they were granted additional money.
Grants already allocated to the seven parties would not be affected by such a decision.

Report: Activist Handzzuk's execution warrants must be punished
"I want to say that there is no one version - and they will not be rejected today more than 20 -.
Each will be thoroughly checked in accordance with the investigation procedures.
As President, I do not have the opportunity and I do not have to get information that could harm the investigation.
However, the government must ensure transparency and the law enforcement authorities must work efficiently.
Only so will it be possible to know the truth and punish evil," said Mr. Poroschenka at a meeting with a young Tuesday in Kiev.
He stressed that he was most interested in explaining the murder of Mr. Handzzuk and that the Jews, the criminal organizers and the "take the necessary responsibility".
"After this case has been requalified to murder (the case), they are fully fair and reasonable enough to go into prison until the death penalty," said the President of Ukraine.
He rightly called the public's demand open and impartial investigation of this case.
Mr. Proroschenka stressed that the statements of representatives of law enforcement authorities in Parliament should show that "the government has committed a serious violation of the responsibility of the criminals and the Jews for what they were not.
He also said that political speculations will not explain the situation, but will be even more disturbing.
"I call upon all the authorities and the powers of the opposition not to give rise to unjustified arguments and, in the war of God, not to use this killing for public relations," said the President.
- On the contrary, we now need to unite and ensure that the study is effective, fair and clear, fast - so that the public is confident.
We just don't have another way."
"No one will be allowed to use this situation for destabilization in the country," he said.
Before corruption was fought by Mr. Handzzuk in July, he was burned and burned by the acid in the city of Cherson.
She was the councillor of this southern Ukrainian city.
After the funeral, the woman was hospitalized, but the next day she died in the hospital.
In the absence of an explanation to the police and prosecutors of this case, the Ukrainian Attorney General, Jurius Lucenka, made a statement on the second day of the trial.
After her death, officials received public activists' claims that they were unable to carry out the investigation properly.
Actively, the Minister for Prosecutors and Home Affairs was also required.
"I have today submitted my statement of resignation," said Mr Lucenka to the Members of Parliament, reading my study report.
Parliament must still support the prosecution.
J. Lucenka accused activists of putting pressure on the investigation and identifying important information, so it was difficult to identify K. Handzuk's murder prosecutors.
Bill Gates offered a toilet without water
By providing a futuristic toilet, Bill Gates moved from traditional facilities to a waterless level with the revolution of the previous eight-year-old computer revolution.
In Pekine's exhibition of the "Micropolis" creator Bill Gates presented a high-tech toilet that does not need water in the waterways, reported "Reuters".
The toilet works without water in accordance with the principle of separation of solid and liquid waste.
Both types of waste types are processed into chemicals.
"Technology that you see here is the greatest achievement in the area of sanitation over the past 200 years," Bill Gates quoted "Bloomberg".
The technological toilet was created by the charity fund set up by Bill Gates and his wife Melinda.
During the seven years of working on a facility that could convert human waste into wastewater or water, the fund spent 200 million dollars.
In general, Bill Gates’ words were created about 20 toilet models.
The device is now finished and can be sold.
However, in order for such toilets to be made massively, the Gates Fund is ready to release 200 million more.
According to the White Paper, 500 thousand children die each year from poor sanitation conditions in the world.
The fight against poor sanitation issues, such as cholera and others, increases health protection funds that already amount to 233 billion.
In order to better illustrate the situation of sanitation that needs to be improved, Bill Gates in the presentation of toilet glass with fecals.
According to him, this is a good reminder that "in a small case there can be 200 trillion rotavirus cells, 200 thousand bacteria causing infection, 100 thousand cervical parasites".

Anxiety in France: Concerns About People’s Death
The French Health Officers announced on Monday that the ban on widely used pesticides has caused concern over the past few decades in the western part of the country.
The Health Protection Agency ANSES announced that the decision to prohibit all products with pesticide metama was adopted following a new safety check launched earlier this year before the start of at least three weeks before the start of the vaccination camp in Meno and Luar.
In these cases, the government has already stopped the use of pesticides.
This soil disinfection chemical should not be contacted by plant or farm workers.
In order to be effective, the product must be used in large quantities.
In France it was used annually for some 700 tonnes.
At least 70 people, including many farm workers, are experiencing respiratory problems in the Anja region, where many sunflowers are grown, the eyes and the throat are affected.
"These episodes confirm the justice of our decision, but they didn't confuse it," said the Deputy Director of ANSES, French Weber, on the first day of August France.
The year - one of the most frequently used pesticides in the United States and Europe - the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) considers "probably human cancer".
This pesticide, sold under the names "Vapam" and "Sectagon", is authorised in Europe by 2022 when a new security check must be carried out.
"There was no other choice but to remove it from the market, regardless of whether it had alternatives," said F. Weber.
"We are wondering what problems are going on for sunflower growers, farmers together, but public health is more important," she said.
Farmers have already failed to stop the use of methamphetamine in the region, which is largely dependent on intensive agriculture.
In this region, Nanto is growing more than half of the 35,000 tonnes of sunflowers used in Europe each year.
The next season will be "very few sunflowers, growers and couples" last month, after the government has stopped using the methammer, AFP told Nanta's Federation leader Philippe's Retire's (Philippas Retjeras).

President Paul Biya of Cameroon after the seventh term of office of the Controversial Elections
During the 85-year-old P. Biya, President of Parliament, Cavaye Yeguie Gibril, promised to maintain the "unity and unity" of the West African state.
The oldest President of Africa, who has ruled his country for 35 years, has been published at the meetings held on 7 October, with 71% vote.
However, small voters' activity, violence and suspected fraud have affected the elections.
P. Bioos Inaugurals, 79 students and three school staff, including directors, were raped in one Presbyterian school in the North West region, where English-speaking separatists carried out an armed campaign for independence.
The majority of the 22 million inhabitants of Cameroon are French and the fifth is English.
In 2016 in the province of the North-West and Near-West regions of the North and South-West countries, a rise in alleged discrimination in education, justice and economic areas began to require autonomy.
In 2017, P. Biya withdrew his release radically and declared the independent state "Republic of the Amazon" and placed the weapons.
According to data from non-governmental organizations, during the separatist attacks and the government-in-command operations this year killed at least 400 civilians and more than 175 security personnel.
More than 300,000 people have fled violence: some - across the border to Nigeria, but many are forced to live in semi-arid forests.
In the North-West region, only 5% of the voters were voted during the elections in October and 15% were elected in the province of South-West.
In both parts of the country, P. Biya gathered two thirds of the votes.
Pre-conservative selections: error source failure
"When there is a lack of space - understand that the party in its resources has organized everything.
Some municipalities allowed them to use their rooms, but not all were voting cabinets because we cannot buy them ourselves.
"Thanks to those who borrow," policy said.
In his view, complaints have been filed, but their content remains unchanged, and the damage itself is not of a pictorial nature.
"The charges were.
Not all the people in the churches were experienced - they were also new.
Thus, not all of our actions were in line with that.
It was therefore necessary to warn the CR in order to comply with our described principles.
These complaints do not always form the basis for questionable results," said A. Anusauskas.
According to the president of the CRC, there were cases where the ballot papers were not printed - after knowing that they were found in the ballots without the stamp.
Some cities lack space, but according to A. Anusausko, complaints and violations related to several ten ballots.
"Well, since there are several thousand differences, this is certainly not the result of a major difference in the results of the elections," A. Anusauskas explained.
It is claimed that the party's activity in the elections was 55%, while the non-participated voters were 69%.
Both candidates had 400 observers, and 600 people worked in the commissions.
The results published on Sunday also do not change - 79% of the voters voted for the successful Ingrid Simonyta, while 21% (4441 votes) for Vygaud Uschack.
On 17 November, the TS-LKD Council officially supported the candidate I. Šimonyt at the elections of the President of the country which took place next year.
The trumpeter says he's probably not gonna meet Putin in Paris.
The National Security Council of the White Rooms, John Boltons, previously said that Dr. Trumpas would meet with V. Putin in Paris this week, where the events of the 100th anniversary of the end of World War I would take place.
However, during the last meeting before the US Congress' mid-citizen elections, Dr. Trumpas asked journalists not to know if this would be a good opportunity to meet with the Russian President.
"I'm not sure if we'll meet in Paris.
Probably not," said the president of the United States.
However, the head of the White House was added to it during the G-20 summit and "probably many times" after that.
D. Trumpas continues to "recarve" relations with Moscow despite the suspicion that Russia is joining the US presidential elections in 2016.
Injury Strupus asks for a annulment of the VTEK decision
The former Director General of Santar's Clinic of the University of Vilnius, Kęstutis Strupas, asked for a annulment of the decision of the Chief Service Ethics Commission (VTEK) - he acknowledged that there were no declared transactions and thus a violation of the law.

Ukrainian Prosecutor General Jurijus Lucenka, speaking on Tuesday in the country's parliament, published statements on the rationale that caused the death of a drug-filled fight against corruption by Katerino Gandziuk, announced by the Ukrainian news agency Unionan.net.
Under Ukrainian law, the Prosecutor-General must submit a remand request to the President of the country, and this is a request for the Supreme Council to adopt a majority of the votes.
On the second day, the Attorney General, J. Lucenko, presented a legal investigation into the conduct and results of the order for the murder of K. Gandzuk in the Supreme Council.
In his speech to parliamentarians, he described the study as effective, but expressed confidence that Mr Gandzuk's death is being used for public policy relations.
Mr. Gandzuk was Ukraine's anti-corruption activist, speaking publicly about police corruption in the southern Ukrainian city of Cherson.
On 31 July, an unknown suspect, K. Gandzuk, appeared in the face of the skirmish.
She died in the hospital on 4 November due to injuries.
The protestors to the Ministry of the Interior of Ukraine require a response which killed K. Gandzuk, AFP/Scanpix since.
According to J. Lucenko, the law-enforcement investigation describes 12 persons as likely to be related to Mr. Gandzuk's murder warrant.
However, one of the most reliable research versions was published in the media, which poses a threat to the success of the study.
According to the Prosecutor-General, as a result of the disclosure of information, the suspects received essential information.
Mr. Lucenko added to Mr. Gandzuk's personal knowledge and was convinced that some politicians were using her blood for public communication.
"In order that no one should be justified in saying that someone who has acquired holds the authorities, I would like to state that I have to make a statement.
Today I will present it to the President of Ukraine and you in Parliament will have to consider this matter," says J. Lucenko, quoted in the newspaper "Obozrevatel".
It is written that J. Lucenko added that "it is impossible to allow dual-governments in the country when the legal protection system is destroyed without any evidence, even for crimes revealed".
J. Lucenko is considered a close friend of the country's President, Peter Poroshenko.
On 12 May 2016, he was appointed as Prosecutor General to remove his predecessor, Victor Sokina, who is suspected of improving the corruption of senior officials and politicians.
Minister of Energy Mr Vačiván meets with representatives of Orlen Lithuania
As the Energy Minister of Elta informed the Council of Aurelija Vernickaitė, the meeting will discuss the achievement of renewable energy targets in the transport sector by 2020 and after 2020.
According to data from the European Commission (EC) transport, the only sector currently in progress at EU level is 6% of renewable energy from renewable energy sources provided for in the national renewable energy action plans.
The EC's assessment of progress towards a 10 % target transport sector is very slow due to various difficulties, including very high greenhouse gas reduction costs and unclear regulation.
Renewable energy in this sector is mainly derived from biofuels (88%) and electricity is less important at this stage.
The Seymas took the issue of a proposal for an investigation into corruption to complement the request of conservators to the CT
On the second day following the submission, Seima agreed to a proposal registered in the study by Agnė Sirinskienė on the illegal impact of the political processes.
There were already 58 Seimas members, nine parliamentarians left before -27.
The next project will be considered by the Seima Committees, primarily appointed by the Committee on Law and Rules of Procedure, A. Shirinskien.
Following its conclusion, the decision will be voted on.
At present, the new political corruption investigation conducted by the Seima Interim Research Commission has been identified as an explanation of the possible illegal impact of the 2008-2016 investigation.
A. Sri Lanka proposed extending this term by indicating that "a significant information on possible illegal effects and effects on political processes and public authorities has been provided in the public area".
A. The project includes "proposing the interests of pension funds in the legislative process or calling on the Constitutional Court or testing to influence decision-making processes of such important independent bodies as the Chief Executive Ethics Commission".
Calling on the Constitutional Court on pensions began by opposition conservators.
The Heads of State explained that the conservatives supported a large part of their calls for private pension fund lawyers' arguments.
The influence of the Heads of State Ethics Commission (VTEK) is due by the leaders of the "States" to the former Community of Paul Urbš.
According to them, the former Chairman of the Committee of State Management and Municipalities of the Seimas was able to indicate to the members of the VTEK that the former head of the Commission's Prevention Section was Mr Mindaugas South.
By the end of September, the Seimas had made the Commission explain the possible illegal impact of stakeholders or their groups, the effects of elections, the formation of coalitions, the work of parliamentarian groups, the work of individual policies, the activities and financing of parties and public movements, the legislative processes, public-run companies, heads of public bodies, management or supervisory bodies.
It is also proposed to consider the information provided by law enforcement and surveillance authorities to the competent authorities as they have responded to it.
Its conclusion should be submitted to the researchers by 1 May of the following year.
At that time, the presidential campaign of the European Parliament will be held.
Seven of the 12 members of the Commission are representatives of "States".
They are also appointed by two social workers, after one "regular", liberal and representative of the Lithuanian Polish-Christian family union.
Conservatives and social Democrats refused to participate in the work of the Commission.
The new study was initiated by Ramón Karbauski, President of the ruling Lithuanian states and the Green Union.
In his view, the study carried out by the National Security and Defence Committee (NSC) last session has shown that the investigation needs to continue.
Head of the German Internal Oversight Board did not take place
The 55th-century H.G. Maassen also raised the controversy that because of his suffering, he was accused of "racial left-wing power" by A. Merkel's coalition.
As a result, he was not moved to another post, as was promised earlier, but was forced to go to the reserve.
In addition, last week it was made clear that a few weeks ago we held a meeting of representatives of European internal surveillance organisations in Warsaw, H.G. Maassenas criticized "new" immigration policy by A. Merkel.
A long time ago, German Interior Minister Horstas Seehoferis, at the press conference on the first day of the press, said that H.G. Maasseno's recent comments were unacceptable and "lossed personally".
H. Seahofer, himself under pressure because of this dispute, and because of his poor show of his party in the Bavarian local government elections, asked President Franko-Waltere Steinmeier to release H.G. Maassen in custody.

Skinny girl green stereotypes about dress dress
A girl with a white suit in a suit - mission (not possible)?
Could the white covering of the altar be greater than the size of S or M and still appear attractive?
In addition to the reality of the "Evolution of the Earth" show today, there is already evidence that the beauty and elegance of things do not really depend on women's kilograms.
But it's not all - one of the girls in the project tonight will be a lucky dog - her kid will show up in the film field.
"There are those who think that older girls don't get the attention of the children or the viewers.
It's just a myth - my child is a sportsman myself, but I like what I am, and he doesn't demand from me ideas that are consistent with some standards," Aurika said before she showed up with a dress dress.
Clothing is not easy, in all sense, clothing - it is a complex structure, it has many materials, it has a heavy, unsatisfied movement.
Some women also believe that a more stable girl in a white dress will look even more stable and therefore less confident of herself.
I can bet that a properly chosen fashion model really solves this "problem"," explained one of the members of this committee, designer Robert Kalinkinas.
The remains of girls in the project R. Kalinkinas, together with the entire Commission - opened more large houses of houses by Erika Vitulskiene, photographer and social networks at the star Nagliu Bierancu and TV producer Laura Pauktä.
"In deciding who the girl has to deal with the show, there is a lot of uncertainty between the members of the Commission - and we all represent different spheres, and we have different portrayals of this winner.
The issue of the demonstration of dress dressers has become even more difficult, and I can now explain - that there have been two new ones that were certainly not worse than the old ones.
It was a very special evening," said Mr. Kalinkin.
In New York - 23 years of scandalous behavior I will be one of the summer reality that Ieva and Dovila, the single mother of two beautiful children in 31 years, participated in the "Evolution" election and joined the best twentieth.
Unfortunately, after the first very open photosession of girls in the city of Vilnius, they had to meet with the project.
In this case, the girl returned to the LNK audience for her favorite vote at the television portal.
The international recognition of the reality of body beauty in Lithuania has already taken place in the second week - here is the name of the star of the more large number of girls in the first country.
As long as they're only eight - and they're all perfectly aware that the winner can be just one.
The really disturbing and unexpected "Evolution" show is already starting this morning at 20.30 p.m. during the LNK.
Actor I. Elba chosen for the sexiest man in the world
The U.S. "People" magazine published this year's sexiest man in the world.
He became the 46th-year-old British actor Idris Elba.
Although the husband claims that this information was not believed in the new title, he did not lose his sense of humor.
I thought, "It can't be!
Are you serious?"
Then I looked at myself in the mirror and thought -- yes, I look sexy today -- by playing the actor.
Speaking openly, Idris mentioned that this title was a very pleasant feeling that touched his ego.
The British star is expected to have often waited for bitter words and phrases that made his childhood difficult, because, as he himself is called, he was "very tall and unmatched".
The young actor did not believe in and became an object of ridicule, and because of his rare and unusual name and African origin.
"They're just raising their breasts and muscles and I'm going to face the boy of my city," Idriss sighs.
When men fail to be big on Ose screens, I. Elba works discotheques in evenings, in preparation in Spain, and especially in the Ibis.
In time, a man likes the Thai box and has a sharp eye that he realizes by creating his own dress line.
The British actor thinks he's the most important family in the world, so he's planning a wedding with the promised Sabrina Dhowre.
I. Elba became the most sexual man in the world at the 33rd "People" magazine.
In 2017 the title was adopted by Blake Shelton.

The controllers do not need 20 km distance by building the fire forces of waste
The state of Vilnius cogenerational power, near the Garion market.
The authorities do not intend to maintain a 20-kilometre distance from the population when building the fire forces of waste.
The Director of the Environmental Protection Committee, Kęstutis Mäžekka, on Monday, Seime registered an amendment to the Waste Management Act which rejected such a claim.
According to Mr Masjekis, the "States" group, which had previously rejected the provision for a distance of 20 km, the amendment for its refusal was intended to remain.
Mr. Mazekis's recommendation is that since January 2019 the electrical combustion of waste could be the environmental and public health requirements laid down by the laws of the State.
He recognises that the amendment raised the president's doubts about such a threat.
"In the light of the definition of the residential area, it is obvious that it is almost impossible to find places where the above-mentioned objects can be constructed," said the Chairman of the Committee.
The majority of the board opposed the presidential veto's corrections which disturbed the building of the fire-powered waste.
In addition to the power to build more than 20 km from the population, the amendment provided for an authorisation for the Government to take decisions on the future of the two states in the light of public health interests.
Mr Mažeka has not proposed any corrections.
In Vilnius, the creation of an electric state energy group "Lietuvos Energia" and Kaune - together with the Finnish Energy Group "Fortum" Fortum Heat Lithuania.
The last one is already burning waste in Klaipėda.
Talk about possible compromise in Brexit negotiations
The leaders of Great Britain and Ireland discussed a possible compromise on the first day of the Northern Ireland complex question of the Brexit negotiations, said Dublin.
Speaking on the phone, British Prime Minister Theresa May proposed a review of the so-called mechanism for the settlement of the measures to be taken, which would leave an open border between the United Kingdom of Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland belonging to the European Union.
Ireland's Prime Minister Leo Varadkar asked for this proposal to be considered, but he refused any opportunity for Britain to withdraw unilaterally from this agreement, as stated in a report published by the Irish Government.
In his speech, Th. May "sends the opportunity to review the mechanism for the measures to be taken," she says.
"The Governor has agreed to understand that there is open scope for the review of new proposals, provided that the outcome of such a review is not related to a unilateral decision to end the application of the measures under consideration," says a government report.
The "Brexit" negotiators do not find a decision on how to avoid checks on the United Kingdom and Ireland's dry walls when Britain withdraws from the common market and the customs union next year.
The two parties agree on "suspension measures" to maintain a border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland until a higher-level trade agreement is signed to ensure that additional customs border checks are not carried out.
The EU wants Northern Ireland to continue to comply with EU customs rules, but London wants it to apply temporarily to the United Kingdom.
The Daily Telegraph reported on Monday that the Secretary of Brexit, Dominica Raabas, is seeking to remove Britain from the pending agreements unilaterally after three months.

Nobel Prize laureates call for access to reliable information
A group of leading thinkers, including Nobel Prize laureates, announced a statement on Monday, calling for the right to reliable information in the Internet era.
Among the 25 people who have signed the International Declaration on Information and Democracy are economists Amartya Stenas and Joseph Stiglitzas (Jozefas Stiglias), the Nobel Peace Prize won by Iranian lawyer and human rights activist Shirin Ebadi (Shirin Ebadi), as well as Nobel Prize winner Mario Vargas Llosa (Marijus Vargas Liosa).
"We encourage good-will leaders in all lands to take action to strengthen democratic models and open public debates through which citizens can make their decisions on the basis of facts," says the Group's report.
They argue that "the global area of information and communication" is a common source which "must be preserved in order to strengthen freedom of expression and opinion".
"People have the fundamental right to access information that is freely collected, processed and distributed on the basis of commitment truth, the principles of pluralism and methods of determining rational facts," the authors of the declaration added.
The document asks for assistance from world leaders, including US President Donald Trump (Donald Tramp), who often criticises "false news", but who is constantly accused of breaking the facts.
The world leaders should express their position on this issue when they will meet with the Signatories of the "Tais Forum" in Paris on 11-13 November.
This declaration was prepared within two months under the direction of Mr. Ebadi and Christophe Deloire (Christofi Delaire), head of the Press Freedom and Journalist Rights Organisation (RSF) in Paris.
Among the other signatories were former Senegalese President Abdou Diofas (Abdu Diafas), Chinese lawyer and human rights activist Teng Bio and politician Francis Fukuyama (France Fukujama).
The company approved higher penalties for harmful products
The Seima approved the amendments to the Product Safety Act which provided for an increase in the penalties for product safety violations.
Corrections to meetings held in the Chamber shall be submitted unanimously.
As a member of the Committee on the Health of the Sea said, Mr Vinkus welcomes the opening of targets for the better protection of consumers of products.
Its provisions shall also comply with the requirements of the Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council.
"My head, the proposed draft legislation is more and more specifically distributed to all operators involved in the supply and distribution process: producers, service providers, importers, distributors and others.
As the practice shows, the current system of penalties has not always been blocked by further violations, since the parties who have paid the penalty continue to commit repeated violations," said A. Vinkus.
The project was prepared by the Ministry of Economic Affairs, following the Government's approval of the Seima Economic Committee, which complemented it with its proposals.
The provisions of the Law aim at raising penalties for infringements, enhancing consumer rights protection, providing more competent market surveillance authorities and establishing a clear system of monitoring for the safety of products.
As stated by the Ministry of Economic Affairs, producers are currently not obliged to properly mark the product and thus to ensure its traceability.
In addition, the Ministry of Market surveillance authorities have not granted State product safety control the right to enter the territory of producers and suppliers, buildings, premises, inspection facilities, and this undermines the work of the institutions.
The ministry's assessment of the six-month period for the award of penalties and warnings shall include a summary of the infringement, the conduct of the investigation and the award of the penalty.
Also, according to the Ministry, the penalties imposed are not sufficiently effective.
Business often violates legislation again and again - 14 companies did so only during 2017.
The Ministry of Agriculture has proposed to establish an obligation for producers to properly mark the product and thereby ensure its traceability so that market surveillance authorities can better explain the supply of non-compliant products.
It is also proposed to grant market surveillance authorities the right to access the market, territory, buildings, premises and to carry out checks by operators producing products.
The aim is to increase penalties for violations of the law.
The manufacturer, importer or authorised representative of the placing on the market of dangerous products and their distributors, their placing on the market, would be liable to EUR 150 to 2,500 (now from 144 to 1.448) for the dangerous service provider or service provider.
If a decision is made to prohibit the placing on the market and supply of dangerous products or services by a public consumer protection service (VVTAT) or other market surveillance authority, the penalty shall be EUR 1000 to 5,000 (now between 868 and 4344).
Without the requirement to remove dangerous products from the market, recover them from consumers and destroy them, the penalty for EUR 2500 to 6,500 (now EUR 1,448 to 5,792) would be granted.
If hazardous products were harmful to the health of the consumer, the penalty would be EUR 2,500 to 15 000 (now between 1 448 and 11584).
If hazardous products caused the consumer's death, between 6 500 and 25,000 EUR (now between 5 792 and 23 169) would be awarded.
According to the Ministry's data, in Poland and Austria, up to EUR 25 000 (minimum amount of fine not established), in Belgium - from EUR 26 to EUR 600 000, in Romania - from EUR 155 to EUR 6,666, in Bulgaria - from EUR 125 to EUR 7,500.

Norway's armed battalion was involved in the most remote and north-east NATO enlargements
Soldiers from Norway participated in a series of complex exercises in the mountains north of the capital of Oslo.

Most of the troops from the second Norwegian military force spent a lot of time away from home in such places as Afghanistan - it is in hot countries.
But most of all, they are able to fight the Arctic conditions, and these skills are very useful now that NATO is changing its focus.
In the last days, in the eastern mountains of Tinset, often in the western and western regions, wars have taken part in our scenes against certain British wars.

According to the military, this exercise, which as no other has a great memory of real warfare, will teach them to be ready if a serious threat arises.

The Eastern European Centre for Studies, in cooperation with the two major "smegen centres" of the United States
On the other side of the Atlantic, Resc, a three-year operation in Vilnius, led by RESC, led by Lino Kojalo, agreed to implement the projects and will make Lithuania's voice more heard.
"This is where we work closely for several months.
I am pleased that the two great institutions are serving us as partners and are looking for opportunities for joint activities.
I am convinced that the activities of the Roma will also be a priority for the development of NATO, security, disinformation and Eastern Partnerships in the face of our analysis," Kojala said.
The agreements indicate that the RESC and the US institutions will work together in preparing applications for international projects, exchange of experience and knowledge with expert visits.
This should be particularly useful for Lithuanian analysts, with both partners having a great international reputation.
FPRI has been active since 1955 and one of nearly one hundred senior analysts.
At the latest of the University of Pennsylvania, FPRI's global analytical centre rating took place in its seven-place category.

"This will give us more opportunities for Lithuanian analysts working in the various institutions to enter the U.S. information space and encourage us to raise a quality card," Kojala added.
One of the first practical steps should be to assist partners in the distribution of the newly-showd RESC analytical publication "Lithuanian Foreign Policy Review" among US decision makers and in the public area.
The Centre for Eastern European Studies operates on the basis of projects implemented and does not maintain targeted grants.
Among the RESC partners implementing joint initiatives are the European Commission, NATO, USAID, various international funds, etc.
