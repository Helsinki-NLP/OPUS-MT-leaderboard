Two men finished their life with suicide in Kineshme and the region
One of the prisoners has already tried suicide.
On 30 October, about 1-00, in the village of Lugowo, where a man was born in 1947, he committed suicide by committing suicide.
Of course he's already been trying suicide.
What moved a man to take such a step is unknown.
On 31 October, 11-50, in the place of residence, he ended up living with a 41-year-old man, who lived in Kineshma.
The signs of violent death have not been discovered, the IMO press service "Kinezemski" reports.
You got a black bag in your car?
While U.S. road designers are trying to find money to repair the six-way repair system, many start to see a solution in a small black box that is accurately fitted to your car’s equipment.
These devices, which follow every passing mile car driver and transmit this information to the officials, are at the centre of the dispute attempt to modernise the old American Car Masters' financing system of Washington and the state.
Typically, the narrow range of automasters' planning has suddenly created intense debates and colorful alliances.
Liberals joined environmental groups in lobbying the Government ' s right to use smallpox to track the number of miles you've been through, and perhaps even where you've been through, and then to use this information in tax accounts.
Chapity movement in shock.
The American Union of Civil Liberties is also deeply concerned and raises a number of questions about private life.
And although the convention is not yet possible, whether it continues or not, a number of states are not expected to meet.
They are thinking about how to get to a system where drivers pay for every mile of the road they travel.
Thousands of motorists have already taken the test of these black holes, part of which have a satellite track.
This is really necessary for our country.
“This is not the issue for us to have the right to choose,” said Hassan Ihrat, Executive Director of the Association of the Governments of South California, who is preparing plans to start monitoring by the authorities of the country of miles passed by each California car until 2025.
There will be changes in how we pay these taxes.
There's technology for this.
The need for this is compounded by the lack of funds from the Government Fund for the Construction of Sex Roads, financed by taxes paid by Americans on car repairs.
Americans don't buy as much gasoline as they used to.
Cars travel more than a mile to one gallon.
The federal tax, 18.4 cents per gallon, has not increased for 20 years.
Politicians do not want to raise taxes even to one cent at high gas prices.
“Benzy is simply impossible to maintain,” said Li Mannić, a transport policy expert at the University of Minnesota.
It had recently installed 500 tracking devices to test the wrong payment system.
“This will be the best alternative in the long term,” he said.
The damages call it a misappropriate pay.
It is no wonder that this idea attracts urban liberals, as tax will change the nature of travel to reduce the load of road and greenhouse gas emissions, for example.
The plan bodies in California are looking at this system in developing strategies to achieve targets set by the ambitious laws of this state to combat global warming.
However, a member of the House of Representatives of Bill Schuster (Republic, Pennsylvania), Chairman of the Transport Committee of the House, said that he was also considering this system as the most viable long-term alternative.
Free market commitments in the Reason Fund are also second to the fact that leaders are expected to pay every mile.
“It is not just a tax that will go into the black hole,” said Adrian Mur, Vice-President on Political Affairs Reason.
People pay directly for what they get.
This movement is also supported by two former U.S. transport ministers who in 2011 called for the Congress to move towards the wrong pay.
The United States Senate approved a pilot project of $90 million last year, which would involve about 10,000 cars.
However, the members of the House of Representatives rejected this proposal because of the fears of rural legislators representing voters who often have to spend a lot of time in everyday life in order to get to work or in the city.
A number of states and cities, however, are on their own.
The greatest enthusiasm is demonstrated in the state of Oregon, where 5,000 leaders are attracted to the country ' s largest experiment.
These leaders will soon pay the state for miles of escape instead of gas taxes.
In Nevada, the pilot project has been completed.
He's in New York.
Illinois is testing it on a limited basis with the participation of freight cars.
Coalition I-95, which includes the transport departments of 17 Eastern coastal states (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida), explores how these changes can be made.
This concept has not been fully recognized.
In Nevada, where about 50 automobiles of volunteers were recently equipped with these devices, drivers were concerned that the Government could follow their steps.
“The concern about the “great brother” and such things is a major problem,” said Alauddin Han, who was responsible for the strategy and management of the Department of Transport of Nevada.
That wasn't what people wanted.
When the tests were complete, the U.S. Civil Liberties Office in Nevada warned on its website: “It will be very difficult to turn these devices into a full-scale follow-up. ”
There is no need to create a large, prosperous technological infrastructure that will undoubtedly be expanded to keep records of the daily movements of individual citizens.
Nevada is one of several states where difficult demand for low-cost technology is being made, which would allow state authorities to report on the traffic by mile, but without information on the location and time.
If you can do this, Han said, society will feel more comfortable.
The search for this technology has led some state agencies to a small youth company in California called True Mileage.
In particular, the company did not cooperate in the collection of State taxes.
It sought to enter the developing market for the type of car insurance that drivers pay on the basis of the escape.
But the devices it test attract road designers because they do not use GPS and provide a limited amount of information that is periodically charged with modem.
"People will be more inclined to do this if you don't track their speed and not track their positions," said Ryan Morrison, executive director True Mileage.
There were several major errors in some of these pilot programmes in the state.
There are much less expensive and less binding ways to do so.
In Oregon, projectors are experimenting with different options for managers.
They can choose device with or without GPS.
Or they may give up the device entirely by deciding to pay for a fixed collection based on the average number of miles that all citizens of the state have spent.
In other places, it is hoped to sell an idea of the public being warned by letting devices do more than less.
In New York, transport officials are trying to develop a taxable device that will also be charged on parking bills, provide “payments as you travel” insurance and collect data about the speed in real-time mode from other drivers who could use cars to avoid a sample.
“Automobiles will be attracted to the benefits offered to them,” says the urban design document.
Some transport system designers, however, wonder whether not all the wrong-payment talks are simply a huge drawback.
In the City Transport Commission on the San Francisco River, it is said that the Congress could simply exceed the Banking of the Trust Fund for the Construction of Sex Roads by raising taxes on gasoline.
An additional one-time or annual charge could be taken with drivers of hybrid cars and other persons whose vehicles do not use much petrol to pay their fair share.
“There is no need for radical surgical intervention when everything you need to do is take aspirin,” said Randy Rentseller, director of the Commission on Law and Public Relations.
If we do, hundreds of millions of leaders will worry about their own personal life and many other things.
EU is preparing support measures for Ukraine in the event of the economic pressure of Russia
The European Union has a reserve plan for ensuring Ukraine's gas supply, as well as for reaching an agreement with the IMF on external credit, if Russia takes any measures in response to the possible signature of the EU-Ukraine Association Treaty at the Vilnius Summit.
The IMF is negotiating standby loans, and another EU official who is directly involved in the negotiations has added that their objective is to conclude an agreement in the near future.
In addition to the potential loan from the IMF, Ukraine can receive EUR 610 million from the EU itself.
The analysts interviewed by Reuters are of the opinion that Ukraine and the IMF are able to overcome long-term differences in funding conditions.
It does not believe in the possibility of reform necessary for assistance, and the international rating agency S&P, which was reduced on Friday by Ukraine's sovereign rating at one level until "V-" with "V".
However, EU representatives say that IMF can show flexibility in credit terms, taking into account Ukraine's circumstances.
In addition to the country ' s financial support plan, the EU has a reserve option to provide Ukraine with gas that is now part of the supply from Russia.
Maybe it'll be gas from the North Stream or a reverse from Slovakia.
The latter, according to officials, is the most possible and acceptable way if Russia "is isolates" Ukraine.
Analytics believe that such a reverse delivery method can only be used in Ukraine within a few weeks and may lead to a reduction in supply in other regions.
"The EU and Ukrainian countries are negotiating how to create favourable conditions for Ukraine to be able to import gas from other sources, not from Russia or from the same source, but from other routes," added the source Reuters.
Russia is struggling to clean up cities by car
Efforts to address the transport problems of major cities have been observed in most megapolises of the world since the second half of the twentieth century.
Usually, it was either about their refurbishment and expansion or about attempts to reduce demand for car trips, the number of cars and the time of their use.
Singapore is a well-known example where there has been a severe increase in the number of private cars and the right to purchase them is purchased on auctions.
His price may exceed the price of the car itself twice.
European cities, including London, have paid for entry into the city centre.
In Germany, for example, in Hamburg and Stuttgart, there are so-called green areas where only cars with certain ecoclasses are allowed to use high-quality fuels (including biofuels or electric vehicles).
The Beijing Environmental Protection Agency, for example, approved a five-year clean air plan in 2012 at a total value of approximately 250 billion Yuan ($40 billion).
As stated by the Director of the Division for Transport Pollution Control of the Municipal Environmental Protection Office of Beijing Li Künshing, the main goal of the five-year reduction of air pollutants by 20-35 per cent by 2017 is to increase the number of private vehicles up to a level of 6 million (now 5.2 million), and to increase by no more than 5 per cent of the fuel consumption in one vehicle.
According to the agency, the transport in Beijing is now responsible for 22.5 per cent of total air pollution.
The main measures of the programme include limiting the use of car transport and introducing additional taxes for car owners.
In addition, urban "green five-year " measures include a rapid transition to European standards, the introduction of local eco-standard systems and the labelling of cars and fuels, restrictions on the entry of cars into the central part of the city, prohibitions on the use of older vehicles (in addition, the creation of incentive financial programmes for replacement of old cars on hybrid or electric vehicles), the development of electricity (including public and public transport), public transport (including high-speed).
Beijing's car innovations also include a ban on all private cars moving within the fifth transport ticket (all six of them in the KNR) one day a week (the relevant information is contained in the vehicle number) and the issue of registration marks for vehicles based on lottery numbers (e.g. in 2011, for the first year of the lottery, the total number of licenses for private vehicles in Beijing was only three of the amount of 2010).
According to the existing Environment Protection Programme 2012-2020, the number of cities with high and very high air pollution needs to be reduced to 128 (in 2012 there were 138).
According to the Mines, 41 per cent of all pollutants in the city's atmosphere were “promoted sources” in 2011.
In Moscow, for example, emissions from cars are 10 times higher than industrial ones and in St. Petersburg nine times.
In the RF, it is still time to think about the possibility of bordering traffic regulation on the streets of cities.
The Director of the U.S. Institute for Transport and Transport Policy, Michael Blinkin, believes that administrative and fiscal measures aimed at imposing demand for motor vehicles - the case is not popular - can only be adopted by society in terms of their full university.
In the case of Moscow, there is a unique problem related to the structure of its car park, where there are two classes of vulnerable to any regulatory impact - public and personal vehicles, as well as "priced" vehicles of users with a total of at least 200 thousand (about 5% of the total number of Moscow car park).
In the days of the citizens of the ECOM Centre in St. Petersburg, a study was prepared to analyse the balance of urban areas between housing, road coverage and transport.
The main findings of the researchers: the city centre is twice as low as required, and most car owners living in the center do not use cars every day, leaving them on long-term parking lots or just on the streets.
As a result, it is proposed not to build parks, not to expand the parking lot, but to reduce the passage (in order to make the streets more friendly for walking), and to limit the use and location of personal transport within the territory of the historical centre's conservation area (general territory around 3212 ha, covering a number of central areas of the city).
Penalties for unauthorized street trade in Vologde
In the view of the city authorities, raising taxes would help to regulate Vologda and to clear the streets of natural courts and camps.
Most street vendors do not pay taxes, the product they carry out is often not under adequate health control.
And that means that health is at risk.
Thus, the lower fine for citizens for unauthorized trade from November to November is six times six times - from 500 rubles to 3,000 rubles, reports the Vlogda Press Service.
Goldman Sachs warned about risks for the Russian economy
Goldman Sachs warned of growing risks for the main economic growth driver in Russia - consumption.
This is mainly the crisis of non-payments on unsustainable consumer credit and the mass reduction of workers.
Our main concern now is not that growth has slowed down, but rather the structure of this growth.
It has recently been entirely dependent on consumption that is almost non-suspending on trade," said Russian economist Goldman Sachs Clemens Graphe, presenting a quarterly report on the Russian economy yesterday.
Now there is a nominal increase in wages in Russia, about 10 per cent.
With inflation at 6 per cent, it will be able to provide a future consumer demand at about the current level, expected at Goldman Sachs.
However, the profitability of Russian companies has fallen, so they are in the process of optimising staff costs.
Today we see a significant increase in GDP wage: if wages increase by 10 per cent, GDP is only 2 per cent, Mr. Graphe explained.
The companies faced a reduction in profitability.
If she does not grow up, this may lead to unemployment and unemployment.
The Russian business cannot pay, comments chief economist Barclays Capital on Russia and SNG Vladimir Pantushin.
Unemployment near historical minimums, high-level competition for workers.
In order to change or maintain existing staff, employers have to pay.
The demand for support in Russia is also very fast growing in demand.
In his view, Mr. Graphe did not provide this type of credit because of the extremely high rates of consumer loan for the multiplicity effect of the country ' s economy.
"No one has seen the benefits of the growth of credit, money is not spent on the economy, and banks are returned to the same rate of payment," said the economist.
But the problem is -- in Goldman Sachs, there's a growing trend in unsecured loans.
They are mainly taken by poor people who are provided with something.
The interest on such loans is high.
As a result, they don't return more often," said Mr. Graphe.
The second threat to economic growth in Russia is therefore a possible non-payment crisis.
The Director of the U.S. Bank Institute of Vasili Solodkov is now seeing signs of the growing bank crisis.
Small credit organizations, with no access to scarce resources available to households, were forced to attract people under high percentages.
In response, the banks went to the war troupe and reduced credit rates, the economist continues.
Small credit organizations are not able to borrow under the same percentages, or they will have a negative interest rate.
If the banks do not give up the demining, Russia is threatening a full bank crisis, Vasili Solodkov is in the position.
The lack of bank licences in recent weeks is considered by the economist to be a predictor of mass destruction.
"The situation is not handled by the House itself: the system of investment insurance has not been specifically addressed to the system crisis," the head of the Institute warned.
But consumption growth is slow and without the crisis of non-payments, however, is put in the bank because of the decline in the indexation of salaries of officials and military personnel in the current version of the draft budget.
Part of the impact on consumption will be mitigated by freezing rates of natural monopolies (and as a result, inflation reduction).
But in part: If investments do not grow (and the advance to this is not yet seen), consumption growth will still slow down, as Goldman Sachs believes.
Vladimir Pantushin from Barclays Capital has not yet seen a precedent for the implementation of pessimistic scenarios.
"The main risk is still falling prices for oil," he says.
According to him, the Russian economy will start to decline at a price of less than $90/barr.
Goldman Sachs also noted that the CB has not yet been able to reduce interest rates in the economy.
The paradoxical picture is seen: inflation has declined, and banks have been raising rates.
This may mean that they did not believe in the CB that announced the transfer to the target of inflation," Clemens Graffe said.
The central bank ' s interest rate policy does not affect market rates, only on rates of interbank credit.
"It's the end of all hope for the CB," said Clemens Graphe.
CB auctions are used by banks not to credit the economy but to manage its liquidity
As soon as the rate is reduced, the exchange rate is changed, which means that the funds are trying to go to speculation against the rubella.
"In the morning or later, the CB will understand that this strategy is not working," said Mr. Graphe and recalled that the State is planning to leave the ship in "free shipping" by the end of 2015.
But either it should be done earlier or raise the key rate of CB (5.5 per cent), he believes.
According to him, the rubella rate is now artificially higher than 10%.
It's only one way to get worse, the expert concludes.
But if the CB is to blame for financialists even if there is a doubt that the elimination of the currency corridor is not part of the policy to weaken the ruble, it can damage the ruble much more.
In Chelabinsk, a second tour of the peoples of the South Ural took place.
The Forum is dedicated to the People's Day, the 400th anniversary of the restoration of the Russian State and the 20th anniversary of the adoption of the Russian Constitution.
The meeting was attended by delegations from all cities and regions, representatives of national and cultural associations, religious confessions, legislative and executive bodies, in total about 350 people.
The Forum ' s course is aimed at strengthening international agreement.
We can show examples here not only in other regions but also in other countries.
We don't have any differences or differences.
We live in full understanding," says Feofan, the Mithropolith of Chelabinski and Zlatustoski.
A number of issues were considered during the meeting, including patriotism education, cultural cooperation.
As a result, the Committee adopted a resolution.
The informal part of the forum continued in the opera and ballet theater.
Here the exhibition of the national-cultural associations of the Chelyabinian area was opened.
Ready to “co-operation” with Germany on the issue of U.S. intelligence
Edward Snouden, US intelligence publisher, said he was willing to go to Berlin to give a statement to the German Parliament if the National Security Agency of the United States and its Director, Kit Alexander, were unable to answer questions about his activities.
German MP Hans-Christian Streebelle met with Mr. Snoudden in Russia on Thursday, where he was given asylum to discuss his testimony in Germany.
In his letter to Mr. Snoudden, who presented the press to Berlin on Friday, he said: “As a result of my efforts, my Government continues to treat the inconsistencies as a change and seeks to criminalize the political statements of criminal charges without any protection”.
Speaking the truth, however, is not a crime.
In his letter, Mr. Snouden said he believed that the support of the international community could convince the Government of the United States to refrain from criminal charges against him.
The charges made by the Department of Justice of the United States include spying and theft of public property.
Hans-Peter Fridrich, Minister of the Interior of Germany, told Zeit Online: "If Mr. Snoudden is ready to speak to German officials, we will find ways to do so."
The relationship between the United States and Germany became strained after the claim that ABB had listened to Angel Merkel's phone.
Thomas Opperman, a member of the parliamentary group headed by the intelligence commission, said that if there was any opportunity to listen to Mr. Snoudden as a witness, “without endangering his or her relationship with the United States,” she should be used.
Mr. Streebelle, a member of the Parliament of the Green Party of Germany, published his photo with Mr. Snoudden on his Twitter.
Two German journalists accompanied him during the visit to Russia.
Mr. Streebelle said that Mr. Snouden would not have returned to Russia if he had gone.
If Mr. Snouden had given evidence in Germany, he would have needed assurances that he would be there “in security”, said the MP.
Mr. Snouden said in his letter that he had faced a “hard and constant” persecution campaign that forced him to leave his home.
However, he said that he was inspired by a global response to his “political statements”.
Citizens around the world, as well as senior officials, including in the United States, have considered the disbursement of an uncontrollable system of comprehensive follow-up to society.
The letter contains a proposal to cooperate with the German authorities “when this humanitarian situation is faced with difficulties”.
Frontier Airlines will be paid by hand
Frontier Airlines plans to take passengers up to $100 because they carry a handbag on their journey.
Frontier Airlines plans to start taking up to $100 per hand and $2 per cup of coffee or gas, although their announcement in the middle announced that passengers would be able to leave their entire bank.
The new hand pallet is distributed to bags in the upper bulk compartments, so small bags placed under the seat remain free.
Frontier said it would take $25 if the collection was paid early, and $100 if the passengers would pay only after they got out on the farm.
The representative of Frontier Kate O'Melly said that a $100 payment should be made for passengers to take care of the advance payment.
"We don't want to get paid for this," she said.
Air carriers began to charge for the first and second bag in 2008.
Passengers trying to avoid these gatherings are getting as much as they can into a handbag position as possible, which is why they often do not have seats in those sections.
The churches are one way to force passengers to take less on board.
O'Melly said this new collection wasn't actually about making money.
The fact is that the most loyal customers in Frontier say that finding a place in the top bulkheads is becoming increasingly difficult.
Passengers who buy tickets on the airline website will not pay.
This means that one passenger on the road towards the exit of the Frontier can get a free bag while the next passenger on the road can pay $100 for the same bag.
O'Melly said that changing procedures on the website and on the Frontier registration site was called for to ensure that passengers would know about the collection before they came to their destination.
The new Frontier collection will not start until summer, although the date has not yet been set.
Passengers often complain about luggage and other collections, but airlines love them.
They claim that the processing of the baggage is money, and passengers who need this service must pay for it.
Many on Wall Street consider adding baggage collections as a sign that airlines are taking enough money to cover the costs of aircraft after several years of loss.
However, most of them did not fit into the meetings by hand.
Spirit Airlines Inc. introduced the first collection of manuals three years ago, and another Allegiant Air later followed her example.
The only other airline with such a collection is Hungarian Wizz Air, said air carrier consultant Jay Sorensen, who closely monitors additional flights.
According to his assessment in the December 2011 report, the collection of Spirit $50 million per year.
Sorensen, former top manager of Midwest Airlines, recently flew by Spirit, and he was interested in finding out when passengers met an unusual collection of Spirit by hand.
"The landing process was the most hungry of what I've seen behind my career in airlines," he said.
I was expecting to see a ring of teeth and a dragon coming out on the floor.
The plane was a cop, he said, "and the farm went through a lot."
Frontier is also responsible for Spirit in respect of payments to $2 for coffee, tea, gas or juice.
Frontier stated that passengers receiving gas or juice could leave their entire bank and that a cup of coffee would be provided free of charge.
It will still be free to distribute water.
US Airways recently tried to pay for drinks in 2008, but refused to do so seven months after passengers began to complain and no other major airline followed her example.
Frontier’s initiative to take payments by hand when passengers do not buy tickets directly from the airline is her last measure of attracting customers to their website.
The airlines pay online ticket sellers, such as Orbitz, from $10 to $25 per ticket sold.
This has encouraged all airlines to encourage passengers to buy tickets directly to them instead of to visit the tourist online agency.
However, Frontier went further in this area.
In September it began to give twice as much bonus mile to air passengers who bought tickets through an online tourist agency.
In the middle it cuts the minimum number of miles up to 25 per cent from one mile of journey.
Yes, a 1000-mile trip from Frontier, acquired by an online tourist agency, would provide 250-mile access.
In addition, passengers can choose a place earlier only if they buy tickets directly on Frontier’s website.
Frontier has a base of loyal clients in her hometown of Denver, but her business is declining and is becoming a loser.
The grant was reduced by 9 per cent and flight opportunities were reduced by almost 13 per cent in the first quarter, according to the financial results published in the middle of the parent company Republic Airways Holdings Inc.
The Republic is trying to fix Frontier's finances in the course of the sale of the airline.
ABB blame for an internal error, not hackers at the end of the site
The Secret Security Agency announced on Friday evening that the termination of their site for several hours had caused technical damage, not hackers, as it was claimed on the network.
“NSA.gov was not available for several hours this evening because of an internal error that occurred during the planning update”, the intelligence agency reported in an official e-mail.
The problem will be solved tonight.
The claim that the breach of employment has been caused by a distributed attack on the type of “restraint” [DDoS] is false.
Earlier this evening, online server monitoring systems have recorded that the ABB site has not worked for at least six hours, and the site is still unavailable for some users.
The former ABB representative informed ABC News that the internal secret network of the agency “no” had been broken.
No classified information is in danger, the representative reported.
At least one online group of hackers claimed that it was responsible for the conclusion of the ABB site with the help of DDoS attack.
DDoS attacks are designed to lure the target site into traffic until the servers are overloaded and the site is not out of the building.
The hackers tactic is relatively simple and the attacks are not intended to penetrate the internal target system.
The former ABB, when it received the “No Such Agency” call, has been at the centre of public attention and critically criticised in recent months after the series of openings on its extensive programmes abroad and within the country, all of which is the response to the ABB secret files stolen from the agency and published by former ABB staff Edward Snoudden.
The growing phenomenon around the agency only led to the fact that today's incident was the result of targeted hackers' actions.
Bombardier's income is reduced by delivery and the number of orders on aircraft
Bombardier, a Canadian aircraft manufacturer and travel producer, reported on a 15 per cent reduction in net income by less than 15 per cent, affecting the number of orders and delivery of aircraft in the third quarter and the problems with contracts in its railway unit.
Bombardier, located in Montreal, also did not publish any data on its new CSeries aircraft's flight tests, nor did it provide any new information on whether ambitious plans for the introduction of the aircraft into commercial operation would be implemented by September.
After the first flight of an experienced aircraft sample of about half a month ago, he flew only three more times, which raised questions as to whether the schedule was running.
The results did not justify the projections and resulted in a decrease of more than 8 per cent in the Toronto Fund.
Cameron Doerxen, an analyst at the National Bank Financial, reduced his assessment on Thursday from “high-end” to “medium” because of the belief that stock growth is limited to the nearest quarter or two.
“In the absence of a reduction in the number of aircraft supplies, we were, of course, disappointed by the indicators of the transport department,” Doerksen said in a review of the fund market.
We believe that Bombardier will receive new orders for CSeries as the annual pilot programme continues.
However, if new orders are not announced in the coming months, we expect the market to become more sensitive to the programme.
The company Bombardier hopes that the CSeries aircraft will allow it to be placed in a low market price segment where Boeing and Airbus are now dominated.
The first aircraft experience was presented in March and the first flight took place in September a few months later.
However, the firm orders for CSeries are not too much, 177, as potential buyers are waiting for the results of summer tests to verify the company's approval of the new liner's fuel efficiency and potential economy.
There are still 403 orders and agreements with 15 clients and operators.
Chief Executive Director Pierre Boduan was convinced that Bombardier would achieve its goal at 300 fixed orders until the first aircraft was launched into commercial operation.
Four leaders also assured the analysts and the media that the programme was moving forward.
“The aircraft test model was no longer on the ground than expected,” said Boduan during the telephone conference, adding that ground trials and software updates were planned in time.
All manufacturers are planning different tests.
We decided to take the first flight and stop the upgrade, so we got there.
This will take place during the entire summer trial programme.
The second of the five test models must fly in the next week and all the others will soon follow him, as reported by the company.
However, the analysis is skeptically related to the statement that the first customer would be able to start operating CSeries within 12 months of its first flight.
Bombardier stated that it would assess the date of entry into operation and provide new information within the next few months.
“This slow pace of summer trials – although apparently in line with Bombardier’s internal schedule – supports our view that the entry into operation will be transferred to the first quarter of 2015,” Doerksen said.
In the third quarter of September 30, Bombardier's net income fell to $147 million, or 8 cents per share, with $172 million or 9 cents per share last year.
The adjusted income remained at 9 cents.
Valuation income decreased slightly from $4.2 to $4.1 billion.
Analysts expected 10 cents of share and gross income of $4.56 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The fourth world aircraft manufacturer reported that he had placed 45 aircraft in a quarter less than the previous year — 57.
The total number of orders fell from 83 to 26 aircraft.
The portfolio of the Aerospace Division's orders amounted to $32.9 billion on 30 September, with no change since 31 December.
“In the aviation field, the results were consistent with our objectives, but a small number of orders were received and the general market conditions were unacceptable,” said Boduan.
Aerospace income fell by 13 per cent — up to $2 billion.
Bombardier, the world’s largest passenger producer, reported that gross income in this sector increased by almost 11 per cent to $2.1 billion.
The portfolio of orders in the transport unit amounted to $32.6 billion on 30 September, which was slightly higher than that of 31 December.
The income of the transport unit had been adversely affected by the implementation of several major contracts.
The Guide stated that a new development plan would be presented in the fourth quarter.
Bombardier's shares, which also announced that the chief financial director of Google Patrick Pichett's company would enter the Board of Directors, amounted to 8.5 per cent, up to US$4.83 on the average on Thursday.
The Brazilian company Embraer SA, the world's third largest commercial aircraft producer and the closest competitors Bombardier, reported on a 10 per cent reduction in quarter income on Thursday.
Sony is counting on a lower annual income
The Japanese electronic manufacturer, Sony's company, completed the past quarter with a net loss of 19.3 billion yen, or $197 million, reduced the forecast of income in the current financial year.
Sony's results for the period from July to September 2013 were more disturbing than expected in connection with the demand for television, video cameras and personal computers of the Japanese corporation.
Sony's television business, in the second quarter of the company's first operating income of 5.2 billion yen for the first three years, fell to 9.3 billion yen for the reporting period.
The Japanese consumer electronics market is experiencing a difficult time, especially due to a reduction in television demand.
While competitors are trying to find a way out of the difficult situation, Sony continues to focus on the consumer segment.
For example, one of Sony's main competitors, Panasonic's company, has recently focused on industrial complexes: sales of companies are growing at high rates, especially through car systems and environmentally clean technologies.
As a result of the end of the financial year ending in March 2014, Sony is expected to receive 179 billion yen of operating income against expected previous 230 billion yen.
However, according to the Thomson Reuters agency, the analysis suggested that this figure would be significantly higher and would amount to 221 billion yen.
As soon as we get out of the crisis, Sony expands the production line.
In the middle of this month, it was announced that the sale of “intellectual” hours from the Japanese corporation, assigned by a number of fashion functions, would be possible to escape 100 times a day from the need to deliver a smartphone.
After Sony reduced the annual income and disposal forecast, the company's shares in Tokyo lost more than 11 per cent in the morning of opening the markets in Tokyo, reducing to the level of 1668 yen by one share.
Gen spoke as a synapses education stimulant
Scientists from the University of John Hopkins and the University of Mount Sinai have discovered the whites through which Foxp2 plays its role by stimulating new connections between neurons.
The study was published in Science, and its summary can be read on the magazine’s website.
Gen Foxp2 is the first known gene, which is directly related to the matter.
His role was to be established in 2001 through the discovery of a number of people who could not properly speak and sometimes even understand each other.
Scientists have found that the work of the Foxp2 gene has been corrupted by family members, but how it performs its function remains unknown.
A new study of biology showed that at least part of its functions Foxp2 is acting as a booster for the education of new brain synapses related to the formation of words.
He's doing this because of another gene, SRPX2.
The latter has been discovered as a result of the search for factors that stimulate synapses education.
SRPX2 was one of 10 such genes found by authors, with only Foxp2 being active.
The fact that SRPX2 actually affects vaccination confirmed by scientists in the mouse experiment.
When the animal activity of the gene was artificially reduced, they cried less when they were separated from the mother.
If the gene activity was restored, the frequency of sound outputs would also be restored.
Previously on mice had also been associated with the cacalineization of Foxp2 itself.
Animals that introduced a human copy of the gene ate more active and less frequent than normal mice.
At the same time, however, scientists do not know whether Foxp2 is related to work and, as appropriate, SRPX2 is managed by the pure "mechanical" sound education properties or more thinner processes.
A cocaine-dependence lawyer who warned the Chief of the Criminal Investigations Unit of the Police Prison
The 42nd-year-old Bararate Child transmitted information to the criminal authority of Nile Scarboro
A lawyer was afraid that his secret drug addiction would be exposed
He was sentenced to three years ' imprisonment by the Royal Court of Liverpool.
A prestigious lawyer who told a drug addict about a major police investigation because he was afraid of his secret drug addiction had been imprisoned for three years.
The 42-year-old Bararate Dieta transmitted confidential information to the criminal authority of Nile Scarboro on his investigation into illicit drug trafficking after he was threatened by his cocaine addiction.
Lawyer who received the Bas and who was called a "serious lawyer" of criminals was arrested at home in 2011 after the police operation following the Scarboro, which he had previously presented to the drug court.
Officials noted how 32-year-old Scarboro left three packs of cocaine at the home of a lawyer in the city of Blackburn, Lancashire, while it was in association with colleagues' lawyers.
The result was that Dieta “has regularly used” class A drugs after tests showed cocaine traces in his hair, his notebook and credit cards.
For eight months from January to August 2011, he sought illegal information on the arrests of two persons under the order of Scarboro, as well as one of his communiqués.
All four suspects were at this time under police surveillance in the context of a comprehensive investigation into the activities of the criminal organization for heroin and cocaine delivery in Lancashire, Cambridge, Merciide, Berkeshir and West Yorkshire.
They and 32 others were later imprisoned after the police reported during the series of heroin and cocaine raids of £1.5 million and more than £200 thousand.
The 42th-year-old Child has provided information to criminals because of the fear that its cocaine dependence will be exposed.
Today, forbes Solicitors, in Blackburn, in the Liverpool Royal Court of Dieta, who works at Forbes Solicitors legal company, was covered by a review following recognition of his guilt in two cases of an intention to prevent the execution of justice by a three-week trial in the Liverpool Court of the Crown.
He recognized the storage of cocaine at one of the previous judicial meetings.
The release of the lawyer occurred after the police investigating Scarboro's activities explained that he had been talking to the Diet regularly on the telephone since February 2011.
Two detectives followed the suspect and discovered how he came to Diet's home in Blackburn and placed 60 per cent of the drugs in a black hole for golf under the lawn mowers.
Shortly after his transfer, Scarboro repeatedly contacted Dieta, who was at the football stadium of the Blackburn Rovers team.
The lawyer returned home for drugs; among them were nine talks.
The court learned that Dieta had “normally used” cocaine after tests of Class A drugs were found in his hair, shirt and credit cards.
The child was later arrested, but refused to use cocaine, said that he spoke to a suspected dealer because he was his client, and insisted that their community was a “drug secret”.
During her detention, Dieta took her wallet and tried to draw out several credit cards, but they were all confiscated, and he also had a hair sample.
At a police interview, he said that he had a domestic office, and his clients had come home on legal matters.
However, it was known that after major arrests, he called on the largest parties to drug trafficking, some of whom he had previously represented in court to tell him that they were known by detectives.
In his charge Ann White said: "If anyone knows that there should be no violation of the law, he is a criminal lawyer."
Mr. Dieta was accused of abusing his position by a criminal lawyer because he was too close to certain clients.
The contact we are talking about is not just a drug dealer but a drug dealer who provides his own lawyer.
Some of his talks, of course, are legal because he was their lawyer.
However, this has significantly exceeded the limits of normal relations between the lawyer and the client.
He prevented the police investigation as much as possible in order to allow these people to continue their criminal activity.
Mr. Dieta didn't read his profession, but he looked at her.
He was too close to certain clients, especially Scarboro, and allowed himself to be confused about his lack of interest.
The child refused to admit his guilt and said: “If I were a corrupt lawyer I am not a lawyer and I would like to give information to Mr. Scarboro, I would not wait 15 hours, I would do so immediately.”
But after the meeting of senior officer Lee Holsted of the Lancashire Police, he said: "Mr. Dieta has become a criminal lawyer in criminal matters as soon as he began to obtain drugs from organized crime representatives."
His commitment to cocaine made him hopelessly compromised and vulnerable to the objectives of the major criminal groups that had commissioned him to obtain valuable information on police investigations.
Lawyers should follow the highest standards of professional ethics and promote trust and confidence in society.
Mr. Dieta gave this confidence and tried to cover up his profession.
The investigation of Mr. Dieta ' s case was conducted by Lancasir ' s unit for a particularly dangerous organized crime, which had already been sentenced to three cases of cocaine storage, and now also for the prevention of the administration of justice, demonstrating our desire to obtain a fair punishment for criminals.
Let this case serve as a warning to criminals that no one is beyond the scope of the law.
We'll find you and bring you to court.
Sam Scarboro was convicted for 14 years after he admitted his guilt in a contract for the delivery of heroin, cocaine and marijuana.
35 other persons involved in the machine were sentenced to 153 years for drug-related crimes.
On his website, Dieta organized a speech in the form of questions and answers that he says his dream is a lawyer representing clients with a death sentence in America, an ideal company for him, Mohammed Ali, and the motivation for his work is inequality.
The station in Yaroslavla was not ready to host 22,000 spectators, the police officers who were present at the meetings of the CDC RFS.
The billing programme, they believe, has been expanded about twice.
At the time of the 1/16 match, the Russian Cup with Spartacus was only a thousand guilders under the rule of nine thousand.
Spartacus patients were expected to have 2200 seats, which is 10 per cent of the stadium's capacity, but they were sold 5,000 tickets according to the Moscow Club.
These data were announced by the head of the CDC Arthur Grigorianz.
The Americans were listening to Japanese high-level officials
On Friday, 1 November, one of the representatives of the American Special Services, who preferred not to reveal his name, said that the States had heard telephone calls from senior officials in Japan.
The person confirmed that there were several listening points in the country of origin.
He noted, however, that the United States, Great Britain, Australia, Canada, New Zealand were not engaged in intelligence activities against each other.
He said that this was the case during World War II when these countries were allies.
In Japan, as in Germany, despite the Union relations with the Americans in the past period, there were facilities for intelligence activities, NHK reported.
Not one of the parties has officially commented on this information.
Remember, news of the follow-up to the U.S. post office by the FRG Chancellor appeared last week.
According to German journalists, ABB had been able to listen to Merkel’s phone for the last ten years.
The chancellor himself, according to some data, took note of his hearing very seriously.
She stated that such observation by the head of the Government was not acceptable for the Union, which she considered to be the FRG and the United States for decades.
Meanwhile, Edward Snouden stated that he was ready to share details on the hearing of Angel Merkel's phone calls with the German prosecutor's staff.
Germany is a special visitor to Moscow to meet with an ex-CRU staff member.
Others may be exposed to cheese on the market not earlier than the beginning of 2014
The Ministry of Agriculture of the Republic of Nicolai Kovalenko is of the opinion that Austria may be exposed to the market in public procurement interventions not earlier than in the beginning of 2014.
Today, market prices are such that they do not encourage sales in the intervention fund.
Until the market price is above, and there's a demand.
"Maybe it will be presented on the market after New Year," he said at the press conference yesterday.
The Minister recalled that in the spring of 2013, agricultural crops were 3.1 million hectares, including grain crops - 1.7 million hectares, more than 3.3 per cent more than last year.
During the spring of 2014, there were 550,000 ha (105,000 ha more than in 2012).
The area under the winter pool and tricycles has been enlarged, and the rose has remained at the previous level.
There are no "British Circle" groupings in the MDBs that were listed in the U.S.
The Russian forces database of the "British Circle" group, to which Washington listed the song Grigory Leps, does not matter.
As Interfax noted in the RF law enforcement authorities, after reports of the submission by the Ministry of Finance of the United States of America by Gregory Lepsa to the list of suspects belonging to the Eurasian criminal syndicate "British circle", all databases were checked, but no such group was found.
The dissemination of this information contributes to the support of the myth of the so-called "Russian Mafia", which both operate abroad, is considered to be violent structures.
"Even in the very name of 'British circle', there's some element of secrecy, there's a cover on a secret lie.
"It's all very much like a peer action," said the agency's associate.
On 31 October, the United States Ministry of Finance announced that it had included in its control lists of suspects belonging to the Eurasian “Brade Circle” Artura Badalan, Grigoria Lepsveride, Vadima Ljelina, Sergey Moskalenko, Jacob Ribalski and Igorja Schlikov.
The persons listed in this list are suspected of having contact with some of the rulings of Leonte and Gafuur Rahim, who are considered influential members of the criminal groups and are listed in the United States Sanctions Lists since February 2012.
According to the U.S. authorities, Grigory Lemps "is a courier for money delivery on behalf of Vladislav Leonteeva".
At the shopping center, Gregory Lepsa refused to comment on the United States charges to the singer, calling them "the flag".
In 2011, U.S. President Barak Obama referred to the "British Circle" union as "Main transnational organized criminal groups" and ordered the mini-finance "to stop and stop their global criminal operations".
Human involvement in the black list of the American Mining would lead to the blockage of its assets in the United States and the prohibition on business contacts with its people living in the States.
The scandalous video fell into the police
The head of Toronto Rob Ford, known as his scandalous and open-ended exits, fell into the smoke of the crack.
The Canadian City Police stated that they had the appropriate video and were ready to launch an investigation against the mayor.
It stated that its post would not be left, reports CNN.
The information that authorities have evidence of the use of drugs by Rob Ford has appeared on the Toronto Police website.

The sheriff said he was not authorized to share public data with the public, but he was committed to their existence.
According to Blair, the compromiser Roba Forda video was discovered during an anti-drug raid conducted by guards during 2013.
The Canadian press had previously written about the existence of this video, but there had been no confirmations recently.
I don't have any comments on this.
He's just saying they don't blame anything and they don't get away with it.
The video is one of the evidence of 35-year-old Ford Alexander Lissi, who is accused of trafficking in drugs, solicitation, receipt of illegal income, and criminal talk.
Poirot Lisie performed the role of Chief Rob Ford.
The inhabitants of the city have long demanded the resignation of their mayor.
This has often been associated with journalists, appeared in a drinking way, and allowed themselves to be racist and sexist.

Turkey's policy proclaimed hunger against the wall on the Syrian border
In mid-October, the authorities began building a separation wall in the town of Nusaibin in the south-eastern part of Turkey.
Local residents and representatives of the PMD party reacted strongly to the construction.
A mayor on the Syrian border with the Turkish city of Nusaybin Iishe Hekhan announced famine, protesting the construction of a separate wall on the Turkish-Syrian border, reported RIA News to the press service of the Peace and Democracy Party (PMD) on Friday.
Several times the police broke down protest demonstrations.
The head of the MID of Turkey Muammer Guller began to challenge the construction fact and then said that the wall was trying to secure the border.
"Mer Nusaybin Ayche Hekhan, a member of the PMD, proclaimed the famine and thus turned his protest against the construction of the wall into a death fight," the party press said.
The mayor of the city believes that the construction of the wall is intended to isolate the Kurdish population of two countries from one another, and the Kurds have crossed the border freely during the half.
"This is an inhuman situation where whores will never agree," the party's representatives quoted Iishe Hekhan.
According to press service data, on 7 November, a bridge against the construction of a separation wall is planned in Nusabin.
Venezuela will establish a tourist exchange rate
Venezuela will introduce a special exchange rate of its national currency for the dollar for tourists.
On 1 November, the Bloomberg agency reported reference to the Government decree.
Foreign travelers are allowed to exchange annual amounts equivalent to tens of thousands of United States dollars.
Venezuela will also allow tourists to sell up to 25 per cent of the injured in the country at the time of departure.
The specific course of the patient in relation to the dollar will be set later.
In February, Caracas had to invest up to $6.3 in local currency.
However, in the black market, one dollar is estimated at 57 patients.
Since the beginning of the year, the disease has lost almost 70 per cent of its value.
In September, inflation in Venezuela accounted for nearly 50 per cent.
On 18 October, Minister of Oil Industry and Vice-President Raphael Ramirez stated that Venezuela had no plans to develop the epidemic.
According to the informal information provided by the agency, Caracas may still decide to reduce the national currency rate after the municipal elections in December.
The policy of keeping prices on products and goods widely consumed, as well as the high degree of regulation of the Venezuelan economy, has led to a lack of a number of goods and the functioning of a black currency market.
This summer the media wrote that there was no toilet book available in Venezuela.
Director of the South, Andrey Belmach, noted that it was difficult to say how much time it would take to find a new main coach.
This post became vacant after Sergey Sheppelev was released.
The delay happened a few hours ago, so to say how much time it takes to find a new trainer, I'm not ready, says the ITARA-TASS word Belmacha.
Maybe, day.
Maybe a month.
We're studying all possible options.
The priority will be given to the Russian specialist.
It's not just about finding a coach, but about a man who's been working in our club for several years and gets some results.
The Chinese press has been provoked by a provocational law on media
“This is a terrible place, and there is reason for the question that Parliament may not allow the independence of the judicial system in the future to be destroyed,” reported the newspaper, calling the law non-institutional.
“This is a very serious and penal law, and we reject it,” said Cyrus Camau, managing director of the Capital Group, the capitalFM parent company, which includes one of Kenya's most respected independent radio stations and news site.
He said that the new judicial body on mass media would “always be sensitive as it is the continuation of the Government” and that restrictions on content and advertising would affect Kenya ' s global economy.
“I hope that the President will listen to us, and we are asking him to reject this bill and return it to his Members,” he said.
According to The Star, a new law would in effect allow the Government to "take the media to the death trap", and The Standard reported that democracy and freedom of speech in Kenya "had a serious impact" and criticized the bill as "dragonistic".
The adoption of the bill is part of the measures taken to strengthen national security following the September attack of Muslim terrorists at the Westgate Trade Centre.
The Chinese media provoked the wrath of the authorities by transmitting records of surveillance cameras where the army that were sent to the scene of the attack was expected to capture the expensive trading center.
The response of Chief of Police to David Kimio became a challenge for two journalists and a media officer, although the challenge was rejected after mass media protests.
Under the new law, publishing may be outlawed to up to 20 million Kenyan shillings, and individual journalists, up to one million at an additional risk of being “out of lists”, are prohibited from obtaining official logistic accreditation.
The Court also has the right to confiscate the property of the offender if the penalty is not paid.
According to Daily Nation, “even one fine is sufficient to parallel the work of most FM stations”.
She also reported that these measures could have a devastating effect on Kenya's so-called “living blogosphere”.
Politicians understand that by keeping the media silent, they will be able to do everything they think they think they can do without punishment.
“No one ever knows, ” wrote journalist Nation Mutuma Matthew, characterized by Kenyan media as a key source of restraint and equivalent forces in public life.
“The policies that we have left ourselves will divide the country and bring us back to shelter and assembly,” he wrote.
The Chinese legislators have been a mixture of public anger and in the past.
In May they voted for the abolition of the reductions imposed by the national pay commission and for the recovery of their gross salary of about 532,000 shillings per month, which were not taxed, one of the highest in the world.
A new cost line will appear in the municipal payments of tenants, which will cover the house's capital repairs.
Nearly 100 to 400 rubles per month have to be paid for the standard two-room apartment since the new year.
The Government of the region will determine the exact rules.
So when you clean up your trip, bring in your wooden cells, or even replace the elevator, it will be your own home.
This law has been approved by the MEPs in the field of thought.
Vladimir Keynikov, president of the Voronez region, said: "In this case, there must also be a procedure for establishing the order of houses, accumulating funds that are not in management companies - which are often registered in Moscow, then in Orenburg, somewhere, it will be the establishment of public control over the spending of funds that collect residents to rebuild multi-square homes."
Under State control now and under construction.
The law protecting the musculoskeletal population is approved by the final reading.
The document was not born in an empty space.
In our region, 4.5 thousand people were injured by the unrighteous.
Most problems have been solved.
In fact, the new law provides for the rights and responsibilities of all participants in the construction of the wall.
Vladimir Klučnik, President of the Voronez region, said: "It is not a secret that abuses in this area also began in the 98th year of the same flood and in the 2000s are the same. "
People started working to cover the lasagna, including those two laws.
Under Voronezi, it was decided to build a temporary residence centre for foreign nationals eligible for deportation.
The regional Parliament has adopted such a law not only under the auspices of the Federation.
The problem with illegal migrants in the region is still to be tackled.
In the past year, more than 100,000 foreigners have been heard on the migration account.
But only every fifth had a formal leave for work.
Where the rest work and whether they pay taxes is a big issue.
Vladimir Klučnik, president of the Voronez region, said: "They have violated the law, but they are not criminals."
The court doesn't have to deport them. They have to contain something.
Such a decision was taken by the Federation to equip such facilities through regional funds.
In the Voronej area, such a place is defined as the Old Atlantic of the Semill area.
Well, the regional parliament later gave new benefits to parents of multi-days.
First of all, families where 5 and more children are born are completely exempt from the transport tax.
In this case, the budget is lost 3.5 million, but the same is true of many parents.
Secondly, and this is the main one, who will take 3x and smaller ones, from the new year will issue housing subsidies.
Each family member has a new law of 18 square metres, at a price of 30 thousand square metres.
The family, for example, of 6 people -- dad, mom, cousin, and 3rd -- are kidnapped.
For them, according to regulations, the State acquires a housing area of 108 square metres of 3 million rubles of 300 thousand rubles.
For the left bank or the South-West micro-area - a completely acceptable option.
Well, at the center for this amount, you can buy the whole case.
Baumgertner appointed by the Directors of Uralkalia

U.S. Secretary of State: "They went too far" on data collection
The Secretary of State of the United States, John Kerry, acknowledged that when data and hearings were collected, the US specialized agencies “went too far”, but the policy noted that the information contained in the media about the hearing of 70 million people did not fit the facts.
I assure you that innocent people have not suffered during this process, but the attempt to collect information has been made.
Yes, in some cases it was too far away and was wrong.
I recognize this as the President and we'll follow it so it won't happen in the future," quoted AFP Secretary.
Italian workers with degrees enter the road for young people
Italy's unemployment is recordless.
The average data revealed that 12.5 per cent of the country ' s population were unemployed.
Such evils have not existed since World War II.
Among young people, this figure is more than once.
40.4% of the population aged 15 to 24 are unemployed.
In the view of the Italian authorities, one of the solutions to this problem is temporary retirement for older workers.
Such an experiment is already being carried out by the largest energy company in the country, and the laws adopted allow regional authorities to provide part of a temporary pension for the staff of the trainee.
On the other hand, Italy looks forward to Europe as a whole to the problem of the old population.
And economists are not convinced that preterm rotation is justified.
What will lead to the construction of TPU in Moscow?
Every year, the capital authorities promise to build up more transport-transmitters (TRUs).
Up to 2020, 255 TPUs are planned to be introduced.
As the project is under way, our correspondence is clear.
A couple of months ago, the Smolenska Archipelago-Pakrovian Line opened a building building.
The signature stated that there was a means of transport-transmitting equipment.
All of this was very strange, since no land transport with Smolenski is left unstoppable and therefore there is no pressure on it.
In order to reach the nearest trolley bus stop on the Saddock, it is necessary to cross some 130 metres, including the land passage through the Karmanic crossing.
It's almost over now with Smolenski.
Out of the colourless lamp, the station for the newspaper was dismounted, and the asphalt before the entrance was turned into a brush.
There's all the transport.
The transport-transmission valves are flat and capital, explained in the press service of the main department of transport.
There are no capital TUs yet.
The plan is to build parks, to build trade facilities for passengers' movement, to create small architecture and well-being.
Of course, the PSTs are not even concerned with transporters, but professionals from the capital repair department of the city of Moscow.
The transport user is not necessarily a complex construction, explains the Director of the Institute of Transport Economy and Transport Policy of the University of Michigan Blinkin.
Sometimes it's a enough hole over the head and table to tell about the time of the arrival of the transport.
For example, a fully-assessed surface transfer vessel has recently been opened in the "Iasivo" metro.
Let go without any shoes, but with the caps and a table indicating when the bus arrives.
But in spite of the number of officials, we're recording everything we like.
In 2011, Mary planned to build a total of 151 vessels, 59 of them with capital.
Currently, there are up to 255 TPUs in the plans by 2020.
Of these, half-year-olds promise to give up this year.
Although there is no quality criteria for the development of the TPO in the city, Alexander Morozov, co-chair of the public organization "Gorod and Transport", observes.
It is reported on the number of objects, but the quality of transfer on each of them is often impaired.
In the opinion of the expert, there should be two criteria: first - reducing time travel, second - ease.
First of all, it's possible to change the type of transport without rain.
In Moscow, however, when the TRU is fitted, there is a level of resistance.
A bright example of the "VDNH" metro.
The former railway buses from the Yaroslav Six came in front of the main entrance to the VVC.
Now their arrests have been transferred to the opposite side of Yaroslavka on the Kosmonaut Street.
Far from the metro, far from the Montreal, so it's closer to the homes.
Because the inhabitants did not want the car keys under the windows and complained at any time.
With capital TRUs in Moscow, it hasn't been done in a while.
The first one started building five years ago at the "Plannerna" subway.
The project was designed to become an example.
And it actually became an example of how the transfer transferable asset paid for the redemption of investors is turned into a retail mall.
No, there's a bus perv for the bus, so you can't get off the subway under the rain, and you're gonna have three rounds of car stops.
True, the chemical trolleybuses No.202 and No.203 in the Moscow TPU did not give priority.
I mean, I've been taking them away from the subway.
That's why there's more trading places left.
There are only one 32 stores, and there are almost all of them from zoos to the autosalon.
Well, in fact, who else from the bus passenger would have to pick up a new car on the road?
We've always got a trading center when they build a capital TV.
The situation has recently reached its logical conclusion when part of the parking lot has decided to be placed on the market.
Now, in the third phase of the "Plannerna" TTU, between those marked on the parking lot, there is a war trade.
Eggs, specialties, Chinese genes, neural word and defenders who look at our photograph badly.
The mover finally turned into the market.
The thing is, before the "Plannerna" metro was a market, but they got it.
And in the prefecture of traders, they complained and left them on a floating park.
All due to high prices there's always empty.
The most funny thing is that the market has been able to build on it... a new flat-screen TV.
That's how it's done.
In the "Caluja" metro, the distance from the metro to the bus was 50 metres, says Alexander Morozov.
After the construction of a trade centre, such as the TPU, the distance increased to 170 metres.
To get to the bus, you have to go through the entire shopping center.
After 22 hours, when it is closed, it has to be opened in the open sky.
Rather, the constructions on the "Plannerna" and "Caluje" will soon be shown with flowers.
In mid-September, the MRI approved planning decisions for the first eight capital TRUs.
Four of them will be 25 years old without two or three underground roses.
The main pattern will grow in the Tusino metro, which will be 418.7 billion square metres.
Representatives of the Directorate of Railways of RIDs responsible for the construction of the TRU by metro have already told journalists that in future numerous trials there are shops, hotels and apartments.
At the same time, officials believe that multi-storey parks have to go from third to half of the area.
Take, for example, "people" garages.
It is said that a garage for 258 cars, which have recently been built on the International Street, has a area of 8015 square metres.
So for a parking lot of 2.6 thousand cars in Petrovsky-Rasum will take about 80,000 square meters.
It's less than a third of the machine that's going to be built there.
Let's take one or two steps to get to every bus stop.
There remain at least 150 thousand square metres of commercial mobility.
And that's, for a minute, almost two GUMAs.
If the capital TRUs in stations and stations build railways, the remaining surfaces will be equipped with metropolitans.
They also promised that there would be many "functional appointment facilities", including hotels, offices and even sports facilities.
In Moscow's Department of Property, it has recently been reported to journalists that they are preparing a draft regulation that allows investors to contact the DPRK directly to officials.
No competitions.
Therefore, I pray that transport issues for the city are a priority.
The perfect TP is, for example, Harvard Stations in Boston or Spadian in Toronto, convinced by Alexander Morozov.
There trolleybuses and trawls are dropped underground at the level of the meter and the distance from the metro train to the trawl is 50 metres away from the street.
There's no other trade around.
But Moscow officials are finally breaking up.
We're either not going to build anything or we're down 25 floors with offices and apartments.
Eser proposes to compare patriotism with extremism
For the legal protection of patriotism of citizens against Russia ' s provocations and abuses, " Just Russia " offers to bring about a reconciliation of patriotism to extremist activities and to punish them for five years in prison.
As reported in the Emissions newspaper, such amendments to the legislation prepared by the thought-making committee on the energy of the Oleg-Michaeev are already aimed at obtaining an opinion in the Supreme Court and the Government.
Under the patriotism of citizens, the author of the amendment proposes to understand the emotional relationship between man and the country in which he is a citizen, who is loving to that country, responsible for its destiny, respect for its history and culture.
According to Micah, domestic law imposes sanctions on abuse of official signs of public authority by flag and herb.
However, in the opinion of the Parliament, the protection of Russians, who may be subject to and subject to public symbols, and other manifestations of disrespect for our country, is insufficient in Russian legislation.
As an example, it provides an example of the annual Law on the Day of the Victory of the Discussion, when some media persons are allowing themselves to question the heroic movement of the people of SSR in combating fascists.
The launch of the main national festival - Friday 9 May - is being held annually.
Excited by the desert and by the “alternative view” of history, some publications come up with arguments that, unfortunately, the Germans have not invaded the Soviet Union!
I think it is absolutely unacceptable in a country where pride in history remains the main “spiritual strength” of the nation, Oleg Micheev.
Moreover, according to Micheeva, the patriotized people in Russia are much more than religious, but the law condemns the abuse of the feelings of believers, and it can be virtually without punishment.
In the view of the electorate, there is a need to compare patriotism with extremism and to describe the appropriate punishment in article 282 of the Criminal Code.
The draft law provides for the punishment of invalidation of patriotism: from 100 thousand to 5 years of imprisonment.
The magnitude 6.6 earthquake occurred on Thursday, 31 October, in the city of Cokimbo, in central Chile, by the Reuters agency.
The landfill was located in the ocean at 10.7 km and 54 km south-west of the city, located on the U.S. Geological Service website (USGS).
The towers were fixed at 20:03 on local time (3:03 1 November in Moscow).
There are no reports of the victims or of the earthquake caused.
Remember, Chile is one of the most seismic areas of the Earth, so it is not rare to land the various forces there.
One of the most serious events took place in 2010.
The magnitude 8.8 earthquake and tsunami caused more than 550 deaths in Chile and the destruction of 220 thousand buildings.
In addition, the most powerful earthquake in Chile occurred in the new history: 9.5 magnitude increased there in 1960.
As a result of this natural disaster, more than 5,000 people were killed.
Dmitri Medvedev: Greenpeace will be considered in a fair manner
The Prime Minister of RF Dmitry Medvedev announced on Friday that the case of Greenpeace activists would be dealt with strictly in accordance with Russian law.
France may have no doubt that the case will be considered by law, and we are all concerned.
"We can guarantee law enforcement," said Dmitry Medvedev at a meeting with French Prime Minister Jean-Marco Ero.
Among the detained activists Greenpeace is a French citizen.
Peru Pisyan, like the rest of the activists, has been charged with fraud.
"I asked if we could expect humanitarian violence against a detained citizen," Mr. Ero quoted RIA News.
"Our country cannot support activities that can harm the environment, no one can violate the laws," Dmitri Medvedev said in his turn.
According to him, the activities of any structures that are trying to influence technologically complex and unsafe processes, including the acquisition of energy, are dangerous.
He stressed that these objects were "like a garbage dump" and recalled what happened in the Gulf of Mexico, passed on "RIA News".
The United Nations has announced new poverty eradication goals
The United Nations should immediately begin its work on a new set of goals for the Millennium Development Goals, which were formulated 12 years ago to address poverty all over the world.
Australia's diplomats played a key role in the promotion of “Sustainable Development Goals” in the exchange of CRTs, which took place in 2015, until the UN Sustainable Development Summit in Rio de Janeiro was held last night.
They were included in the outcome version of the document signed by world leaders, including Ms. Gillard, at the time of the summit.
UN Secretary-General Pan-Gi-Mun told participants at the summit that the time had now come for “to rise above national interests”.
“I am pleased that UN member countries have agreed to launch and take control of the process of setting up universal sustainable development goals – CUR”, he said.
These will depend on our progress towards the Millennium Development Goals and will become an integral part of the post-2015 development concept.
I will make every effort to use the powers I have been given by Member States to fill our vision of sustainable development, which is based on the successful implementation of the CDM.
Security concerns in Mozambique are growing as a result of the conflict of influential people
Under the status of Samor Mahela, the founding President of Mozambique, thousands of people gathered in the center of Maputo to scan for peace havens on one of the rare demonstrations here.
“We want peace back; we want stability,” said Vanessa de Susa, executive director of the investment company.
Fearing the future of her country, she changed her business suit to a football that had been decorated with the title “We Need Security” in Portuguese and joined the capital of the Independent Chamber on Thursday.
Within two weeks, almost daily communications were made between government forces and Renamo — one of the most violent incidents since the period of peace over 20 years ago.
Renamo was once a known rebel movement supported by the white authorities of Rhodesia and then by the Government of South Africa of the apartheid era in efforts to destabilize the independent Government.
After the rest of 1992, it became an opposition party.
Analysts believe that the country is likely to reassess the full conflict, but recent developments have left foreign investors and local residents frustrated.
High rates for the fast-paced economy as the opening of large greenhouse gas and coal stocks in the North-West can attract more than $50 billion as investments in the next few years from companies such as Rio Tinto, Vale from Brazil, Eni from Italy and Anadarko from the United States.
The ruling party Frelimo, the leading political force since 1975, and the party Renamo accused each other of the tension that had been created.
The Renamo party claims that the Government has become the closing of the last rounds by attacking its members in the province of Sofala, the traditional reward of Renamo, on 17 October.
The attacks on former rebels were then intensified when the government forces attacked the bases of Renamo and attempted to kill Afonso Dhlakam, the leader of the group, reported the Financial Times Fernando Mazanga, the representative of Renamo.
The Government of Renamo has initiated clashes by accusing the party of an attack on the military.
President Armandu Gebuz tried to raise concerns about instability.
He said to the French intelligence agency that Mr. Dhlakama felt that he was “not successful” who wanted to use “all that remained of his strength to try to prove that he could impose his own decisions on the Government”.
Both Frelimo and Renamo insist that they want to avoid war.
However, the fears increased after the announcement that Mazanga had declared the rejection of Renamo of the 1992 Peace Agreement.
He reported that he was not in compliance with the Frélimo Agreement.
“Our goal is to return to negotiations, but seriously,” said Mazanga.
Previous negotiations between the parties have been made little to reduce the tension that has intensified the series of interviews this year.
“These are two influential people (Gebuza and Dhlakama) facing lips,” said Joseph Hanlon, a lecturer from the Open University and an expert in Mozambique.
Not one of them is a good negotiator and not one of them is willing to take the necessary steps.
The Renamo Party, which is trying to achieve electoral reforms, has already stated that it will block the municipal elections scheduled for November.
The presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for the following year.
Some commentators interpreted this pressure as an attempt by the weaker movement to obtain a discount and financial bonus from the Government.
The proportion of votes for Renamo has declined since 1992, while the new Democratic Movement of Mozambique (MDM), based on former member Renamo, is expected to improve its indicators in these elections.
Mr. Mazanga said that Mr. Gebuz, who had to leave post next year when his second deadline was over, wanted to destroy democracy in the country.
"He doesn't want a multi-party democracy, he doesn't want transparent elections, he doesn't want peace because he doesn't want to leave the president's post," Masang said.
It is not clear what opportunities Renamo has had, but she has already carried out devastating and intense attacks on police stations and on key car cars leading north to south.
Most of the links were located in the province of Sofala, hundreds of miles north of Maputo, but it includes the port of Beiru, which mining companies, including Rio Tinto and Vale, use to export coal.
In June Rio stopped the use of railways for about a week after Renamo threatened to attack the railway.
Masanga was shocked when he was asked if Renamo would repeat this threat.
The Renamo party wanted to “warn the international community that things in Mozambique were not going very well”, Masanga said.
The instability has intensified the Government's dissatisfaction, and many people are also concerned about the slow pace of development and recent kidnappings, says Fernando Lima, head of the independent media company Mediacoop.
“People think that responsibility for future countries is a government and a president who must find a solution to these problems,” he says.
Omar Sultan, a demonstration participant, said that people just want stability.
“No one cares about Renamo or Frelimo; they just want peace, they want free access to the streets,” he said.
The "Art Mainstream" series will take place in Moscow.
The Art Mainstream Film series, where viewers can see one Russian and four foreign films within a few days before their release into the proca, will be on Rolan from 1 to 5 November, reports RIA "News" with reference to project organizers.
Opens the Art Mainstream programme of the French Comedy of Director and Actress Reim Kerichi, Paris at any price.
This is the story of the French capital of the Maye (Kerichi alone) model, which is deported to Morocco because of visa problems.
In addition to Kerichi's film, viewers will also show a new picture of South Korean director Kim Ki Duka "Mebius", melodramatic biologist Oliver Hirsbergel "Diana: The History of Love" (Diana) with Naomi Watts in the main role and the main film of the Canary Film Festival "Lijn Adele" by Abdulatif Keshish.
The only Russian "Art Mainstrima" will be the winner of the "Kinotavre" film by Alexander Veldin's Geography Globe Propile" on the grounds of the so-called novel Aleksey Ivanova.
The main role of Victor Service's promising failed teacher was the film by Constantine Habenski, whose work was also noted by the "Kinetavra" Prize.
Children must study myth and legends as “the model of life”, says the author.
The words of Tore could show that “the power of the grave cannot defeat the stillness, ” while the legends about King Arthur show how important it is to have a dream.
Speaking of the fact that many myths are “too thick, too scandalous and in some cases too inappropriate to teach in schools,” Crosley Holland speaks of “a parental team” suitable for the age of texts.
“I think it’s amazing that in America muffins and follicles are already part of education,” he said.
I said I would introduce them to the 20-year course.
He added that “overhauling morality” of authors and teachers “takes an interest” in children, while the main ideas are “subliminated” in exciting history.
Crossley Holland, who translated "Beovulf" from English-Saxon, and also wrote "The Collection of Norwegian Miffs" for Penguin and "British People's Stories", said, "Of course, you may have intentions, but you better keep them with you."
It may be that the great difference between the adult author written for adults and the adult author written for children needs to be felt.
Not that everything should be simplified or brought to a happy conclusion, but that there should be an intimate understanding of good and evil.
And this must be sublimated; revealed through history, not clearly formulated.
Old principle: Show, not tell.
In the Voronez area, a football fan was held breaking the window into the waiting room
At nine o'clock in the evening of 29 October, two football fans from Moscow's train station were fired by the police.
On the way to a favorite team, the boys set up a drinking hole in the driveway.
Young people were transferred to a daily part of the police line office at the police station in Graz to prepare a protocol on administrative offences.
The fans were upset by their anti-public behavior.
The police provided them with administrative material and released them.
Young people bought tickets for the next trip and were waiting for his arrival at the station.
On the first half of the first night, the fans left the building of a railway station, but one of them, a 22-year-old boy, suddenly came back and knocked the door into the waiting room.
On the call of the glass broke, the transport police officer and the CHOP “RJD” security guard were fired.
They were able to arrest a criminal who tried to hide from the scene.
A check is being carried out by the South-East LWWM members of Russia.
The issue of the establishment of a criminal case was addressed by the senior information channel and public communications from the South-East LWWM to the Russian transport of Sergei Olhovik.
Vitaly Mutko: Water?
I think we've been back for 15 years.
Minister of Sport Vitaly Mutko expressed his opinion on the riots at the time of the attack by Kubka Xinnik, Russia - Spartak.
I am a party to the responsibility of sports events organizers: clubs, leagues, RFS.
But we can see that they took a firm position.
They're waiting for someone from the side and ordering.
It's a very good position, but it's not quite right.
Patients should be organized, clubs should be invited to their home and not leave the case alone.
We have now developed a special Government regulation on the rules of conduct at the stadiums.
After it has been adopted, we will take this issue seriously.
But I am still obliged to invite all the organizers of the football process.
I read Leonida Fedun's interview.
State, please, give me the law.
It feels like these "Babaria" patients came to Yaroslavl and all of them made it.
And we're side monitors.
And at the same time, it's terrible to see how the tribunal gets out of the brandspoit.
And it's in a country that's preparing for a world championship.
"I feel like we've been back 10-15 years," Mutco said.
Squidden can be questioned in Russia
U.S. Specialty Officer Edward Snouden will soon not be outside Russia to give evidence of hearing of the telephone negotiations by the German Chancellor Angel Merkel.
As Interfax stated on Friday, a well-known source of the situation, an American may answer questions of the representatives of the German Genocide in writing or in the Russian language.
Edward Snoudden's exit outside Russia is practically off.
"In this case it loses refugee status and may be issued to Washington by the United States Union countries," said the agency ' s associate.
“However, in principle, the FRG Genocute could send its representatives to the RFF or transmit written questions to Snoudden,” the source added, adding that this matter should be prepared at the intergovernmental level.
Former German Bundestian Hans-Christian Strebelle reported that Edward Snouden was ready to give evidence of the case for hearing by the US negotiating services of the German Chancellor.
It was decided to provide evidence to the German law enforcement authorities either in Moscow or in Germany.
The ex-CRU staff revealed that he knew a lot.
Despite the fact that the U.S.A. had blocked all its movements, Snouden was ready to come to Germany.
However, there is a clear need for a clear definition of all the conditions for his arrival," Stribell told Euronews.
Snoudden Anatoly Kucheren, commenting on the statement of the source of Interfax, said that his client could cooperate with German investigators, but when and how it would be resolved.
U.S. citizen Edward Snouden, who worked at the National Security Agency (NAP) and the CIA, fled to Hong Kong in May 2013, after publishing information on the United States Internet-based secret operations.
A hit plane through the Moscow transit, but could not leave the airport because its passport had canceled the US authorities that had previously given him serious charges, and had remained in the Sheremetev airport transit area by the beginning of August.
On August 1, Snouden received a document providing him with a temporary asylum in the territory of Russia for a period of one year and on the same day he left Sheremetev.
U.S. lawyer Anatoly Kucheren said yesterday his client was working in a "big Russian company".
German media reported on the follow-up of the ABB to Angelo Merkel last week.
According to journalists, the U.S. Chancellor’s telephone negotiations began in 2002.
The track station was in the United States Mission in Berlin.
Following the publication of these information, the German authorities stated that the follow-up to Merkel violates the laws and sovereignty of Germany.
I've got a note left of "Just Russia"
A member of her office in Novosibirsk Ilia Ponomarev, a member of the State Duma of the Russian Party, made a statement on the withdrawal of the political organization.
As the parliamentarian said, the statement was made in the new regional office of the party.
According to her theory, this automatically means that Ponomarev has left a number of "good-byes".
We're sitting down, drinking tea...
“Why do many want to see the picture ‘Eli Ponomarev puts on a battalion table’, but there is nothing like this,” the MP commented his decision.
He noted that good relations with the regional district office were maintained.
In the meantime, the mandate of Mr. Ilya Ponomarev's MP was rejected.
He explained that, despite his departure from the party, he remained a member of the group and could not get out of it under law.
Statements of Eli Ponomareva's intention to leave the "Justice of Russia" party appeared on 30 October.
It was reported that Dmitri Gudkov and Valerie Zubov were coming out of the R.R. with him, but the latest was soon to examine this information.
Japan will discuss with Russia the conclusion of a peace treaty
The head of the Japanese MID Fumoio Kisida met with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavov to discuss issues related to the conclusion of a peace treaty between the two countries.
"We would like to exchange views on the further development of the political dialogue with openness on issues related to the conclusion of a peace treaty," Kizida said at the meeting.
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of Japan recalled that after Prime Minister Sinzo Abbie visited Russia, relations between countries became more warm and bilateral.
The Russian Minister, in turn, noted that the IMF would meet Japan to address complex political issues, writes RIA News.
The conclusion of a peace treaty between Japan and Russia is the issue of the disputed North Territories.
In this regard, protests in Tokyo are now under way to demand the return of the country lost after World War II.
At Japan's capital, cars are eating from which the speaker says, "The faithful northern territories!"
The police don't stop the protesters, they're watching to keep the noise level out.
Ben Greenman: Tenth anniversary of the New York Comedian Festival: New York
It can be argued with courage that New York is the birthplace of a stand-up comedian in America: nearly a hundred years ago, trained artist Frank Faye, who was working at the Palace Theatre in Broadway, began to tell the jokes directly to the audience in the speech mode.
In time, Faya's renewal was welcomed by others, quite recently by the New York Comedian Festival.
The created and smoked Caroline Hersh, founder of the Carolinas Standing Club, celebrates this year's 10th anniversary with more than sixty shows in small clubs and large theaters.
“ Most of these hedlines started in Carolinas, and then they were more successful, reached the level when they were already too prominent to speak at the club,” said Hersh.
We created this festival as a way to continue working with them.
This year, the event includes the expressions Wendy Saix, Katie Griffin and Billa Mara, as well as the "Standap for the Heroes" — an annual musical comedy charity concert for military veterans in Medison Square Garden, where they appear among the others Bruce Springstein, John Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby.
As the festival grew, camedy's peace grew.
Several comedies who participated in this year's festival gained popularity in non-traditional ways, such as through a show on small comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Croll was known for his role in the comedian series on a small-known cable television (especially the FXX FXX football team) and now runs his own chess show at Comedy Central.
Jenny Sleet went into an actor's composition on Saturday evening in the immediate ephere, as well as in the Parks and Breathing Zones, although she is best known for the series of viral role models on Marsell cancers.
As well as other young comedys with self-style (Surreally Pessimistic Anthony Jeselnik, the evil one focused on the racial theme of Camau Bell), this is the result of the decentralized world of the American comedy.
One of the clearest moments of the festival will be David Steinberg's interview with Larry David.
Steinberg started as a standp comic, but then became a successful television and film director, as well as an informal comedy story.
From 2005 to 2007, he was the director of a TV show called Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg.
The meeting will be held in the Town Hall Hall in central Manhattan.
“ This city is undoubtedly a central element of Larry’s entire work, ” said Steinberg.
He told me that when he came here, he sometimes played between the two houses and said, "If I stay here without money, I'll probably live here."
Pakistani authorities have begun negotiations with local Taliban
The Pakistani authorities started negotiations with the Taliban.
This was reported by the country ' s Ambassador to Britain, where Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif is visiting.
The head of the Government of Pakistan made a statement on negotiations with Islamic extremists during a meeting with British Deputy Prime Minister Nick Kleg, which he discussed issues relating to Pakistan and India, the world energy market and economic reforms in Pakistan.
"The Prime Minister reported that a dialogue with the Taliban movement had begun," says a statement by the Pakistani mission in London.
He said he hoped and prayed that the dialogue would work in accordance with the Constitution of Pakistan," the diplomats added.
Pakistani Taliban (Tehrik and Taliban Pakistan) are allies of a single Afghan movement, but are acting independently in the north-west regions of the country bordering Afghanistan.
Pakistani Taliban are being created by the Islamic State.
The former Government of Islam had tried to start negotiations with local Taliban, but the movement had refused to engage in dialogue.
It stated that negotiations would only take place if the authorities took the place of the continued deployment of troops located in areas where Taliban operations were taking place and released from the prisons of the arrested Islamists.
Nawaz Sharif arrived in London at the World Islamic Economic Forum.
On Tuesday, 29 October, British Prime Minister David Cameron, head of the Pakistani Government and Afghan President Hamid Karzai held a three-way meeting in London, where the prospects for the peace process in Afghanistan were discussed.
The oil dropped at $96 per barrel.
The price of oil continued to fall on Friday, when concerns about the education of large stocks ended up with a statement indicating that China ' s energy-producing sector was taking power.
The Italian oil supply ranged to 14 cents in December, and its price was $96.24 for a later-in-day European morning barrier in electronic markets at the New York Stock Exchange.
The fourth contract reached 39 per cent, which resulted in a fall in prices by 5.8 per cent in October.
Rich oil stocks have affected its value in recent weeks.
The Ministry of Energy stated that the United States reserves increased to 4.1 million barrels in the last week.
Over 25 million barrels were filled in five weeks.
On Friday, however, there was an indication of a possible increase in demand by a judge on two reports of the Chinese industry showing its activity.
This indicates that the recovery of China ' s economy can continue to take effect after the growth rate in the third quarter rose to 7.8 per cent after the twenty-year minimum in the previous quarter.
Oil Brent, an Italian international oil variety, also used by U.S. oil-producing companies, weighed 26 cents to $108.58 per barrel at the Intercontinental Birate in London.
Major coach Patrick Rua, explaining his decision to release the Prime Minister Seed of Varlamova from the first minute of the fifth game with Dallas, expressed confidence that the recent night after the decision did not undermine his confidence in the Russians, Natalia Šmeleva, from Dallas.
And what are we waiting for?' said Rua after the morning break of Lavin.
Of course, all of us are worried, but we trust him and feel that it will be useful for him to go on ice today.
We want him to go on ice and show his usual level.
Are you absolutely convinced that the situation has never been described in the terms of the returning officer?
That's what I see today.
Our games will undoubtedly support Varley to help him keep his door shut, as it was in the previous matches of this season.
Most importantly, no one in the team is going to make any conclusions until the court is informed of the situation.
In Siberia there must be no vegan: the heat wave will not replace the shock.
Why vegetarianism is not suitable for living in Siberia, RIA News correspondent explained.
People who have completely rejected products of animal origin should not live in Siberia.
Here they are not given cold without health loss, and no heat waves are compensated for by the recent New York Times and Doctors.
Drink oil with litres
Strong vegetarianism when rejected not only by meat and fish but also by milk, milk, eggs, is becoming fashionable.
However, dentists are convinced that in Novosibirsk and other Siberian cities there are strict food standards, at least for health reasons.
The full rejection of animal products is worth it.
Animal protein contains unchanged amino acids that are very difficult to compensate for crops.
It must be mandatory to be included in the rationale whether milk or eggs are milk or eggs," convinced dithetologist Marina Godi.
It provides an example of fish containing Omega-3 unchanged fatty acid.
The richest of them will be oil, and will scald their faces.
"To need it in the quantities necessary for man, you need a litre of drink!" says a dietist.
Doctors are convinced that the people of Siberia need to pay particular attention to the reason for winter.
In this season vegetarianism is particularly questionable.
In our realities there are high requirements for food.
In order not to freeze, higher calorie is needed.
"If a person restricts himself to animal products, he does not deserve this calorie," said a specialist.
That's what Dr. Olga Poznach agreed with.
It adds that imported fruit and fruit are not out.
A person would be better able to eat mainly products grown in the region of residence or where he was born.
The genetic code focuses on the best use and prevention of these products.
And the people of the south wish not that the heat should come to them, but the heat of the sun or anything else."
According to her, there may be vegans, which are currently useful for various spices, big ones, boobs, local fruits, apples remaining in winter, frozen eggs.
But this is not enough for a full diet.
According to Dr. Clavdi Aripulin's Gastroenterology, there is only enough from mid-August to mid-September.
The complete transition to vegetarianity in our harsh natural conditions when the temperature can change by weight to 30 degrees and in May the snow is not targeted.
Life-threatening organisms need energy, which is, above all, fat," says medicine.
Doctors note that veganism is particularly valuable to children and pregnant women.
Children grow up need building materials, including amino acids.
And by maintaining vegetarianism, we give them less.
Obesity is also needed in the increased content of whites, vitamins and micro elements in the menu.
"The fugitives don't let them go," said God.
Arifulin says an adult is willing to choose everything that is appropriate, "to play in the toys he wants."
He has already formed an organ, skeleton, organs.
And children still need to eat fully.
If parents leave it behind some micro element or amino acid, choosing for it what it will be, it's just a violation of the child's rights.
“You will no longer be able to recover from a lack of or any other substance for the development of your brain, your vision, your bones tomorrow,” she says.
All the medical professionals interviewed are of the opinion that the low quality of the winters grown in tropical and imported fruits and fruits.
What brings us into and out of the heat contains less of the elements we need than (expressed) in the open ground.
"Product quality isn't that," says God.
Arifulin also notes that imported and hot fruits and fruits are far from ideal standards.
The slow desire of producers to collect more fruit results in quality damage.
"The apples don't become useful in cutting, fast-fashioned and flammable, tasteless and non-smokers," says the medical example, adding that they are almost consumed by excessive amounts of benefits.
And they become suppliers, not vitamins, but cells.
This is not in line with the Siberian Institute of Physical and Technical Institute for Agrarian Problems, a village professor of science Vera Petruk.
She said that, with the right approach and compliance with all the rules and requirements in the heaters, full-fledged crops could be developed.
If they try to get more out of the square meter, they'll end up getting more and more hotter, and they'll re-carried up with mineral improvements.
For example, when too much acidity is abundant, the weeds grow rapidly, they are big but they are watery and soft," she explains, adding that the issue of quality is primarily dependent on the manufacturer's conscience.
The Court suspended the implementation of the decision on the practice of “stop-and-search” in New York Police Department
The fourth appeal court of the Federal District has suspended the execution of a court order requiring amendments to the New York Police Department ' s programme "to stop and search " and remove the judge from the case.
The Court of Appeal of the Second District of the United States stated that the implementation of the decisions of Judge Shiri Shendlin would be suspended until the results of the appeal submitted by the city were obtained.
In August, the judge decided that the city had violated the Constitution by implementing the street arrest and interrogation programme.
The city appealed to its decision and its corrective measures, including the requirement to appoint the controller to assist the police department in modifying its work practices and related training programmes.
In the fourth instance, the Court of Appeal heard a panel discussion of the parties to the application for a suspension of the case.
The Court of Appeal stated the need to reject the judge because it violated the Code of Conduct of the U.S. judges and did not consider it necessary to avoid the demonstration of initiative, partly because of a series of interviews in the media and official statements containing a public response to the court's criticism.
The Court decided that police officers had violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people, without justifying contact with black and Latin Americans on the “stop” program.
It appointed external monitors for major changes, including policy, education and control reforms, and decided to launch a pilot test programme for video cameras in police stations where most detentions occur.
In August, New York decided to terminate the practice of keeping the names and addresses of persons whose cases were terminated after the police check.
The city's appeal debate shall take place after 14 March 2014.
The tactic of “stop and search” was criticised by many civil rights lawyers.
“Resistance” has been practiced for several decades in some way, but the number of documented stops has increased dramatically in the administration of independent mayor Michael Bloomberg, reaching an absolute record in 2011 of 684,330 people, most of whom are black and Latin Americans.
In 2004, four persons, all representatives of national minorities, filed a collective appeal against the Court.
The parties to the New York Police Department ' s programme of “stop and search” say that these changes are the end of unfavourable practice, form a more reliable and effective police service and can affect how other police departments implement this practice.
The opposition claimed that the changes would reduce the spirit of the police rather than the level of crime, lead to unnecessary money spending and do not solve a more global problem of the situation in the police due to a reduction in the number of officers over the past few thousand years.
The judge noted that it did not stop the practice of “stop-and-search” which was in accordance with the Constitution, but changed the way the New York police were doing people.
A walking zone was opened in the area of the triangular gallery
A new walk zone has emerged in Moscow.
It is located in the triangular area and takes part in two kilometres from the Metro station "Novokznezka" to the Bolot Square.
For all periods, street toasters, flowers, shirts, watches and toilets have been set up, and deaf people have been picked up and illegal advertising.
In addition to the Climate and Lavrousian crossings that were already on their way, the five-way Ordinsk Tupik, the Big and Small Tolmachev crossing, the Kadava District and the Bolot area were closed.
The movement of transport on the streets of Morocco and Petrovka is not limited.
At the 5th Street from the train station "Nuokaznezkya" to the Climate Change, conditions for walking were created without taking off the movement and cutting off the passage, newsmsk.com delivered.
Inside the walking area was the Trinity gallery, the temple of the priestly climate of the Roman pope, the museum, libraries, monuments, and other monuments.
Previously, they had become a religious journey, a triumphal procession and a Kuznezki Bridge street.
The greater Dmitrovk, where the walking area was opened early in September, was decided to close for exit and holiday cars.
Coulson fled to a cell phone to check the confidential communication
The former editor of News of the World Andy Coulson reportedly used the “telephone, track and resistance” in an attempt to confirm the false information about the novel Charles Clarke, who was currently serving as the Minister of Home Affairs.
The defendant, King's lawyer, Andrew Edis, told the court that in May 2005, the newspaper News of the World had been misinformed that Clark was meeting with his “Amazing Special Adviser” Hann Polby.
The newspaper ordered private detective Glenn Mulkeiro to break up Polby's voice mail and watch her at home for an interview, but Koulson also called her and left her voice message, the court heard.
“The charge is that Mr. Coulson, who is now editor NotW, is not the person who will stand up to someone's house hoping to stop someone from falling, the person who wants to offer people history to see what they're saying,” said Mr. Edison.
He said that the newspaper News of the World used three ways of researching history: telephone abuse, harassment and opposition.
The editor is personally involved in the third.
Obviously, he knows about the second, the next, he's just supposed to.
What about the first?
Does he know about the phone damage?
He says, "No." We say, "Yes."
Listens to Roman Clarka first drew attention to the editorial News of the World, when the source, sexually interested in Mrs. Polby, said: "Don't waste time, she and Charles."
The tape with the voter's messages received from her phone at least three times was taken from the home of Mulkeira in August 2006.
Follow-up records were also found on the computer of a private detective in which Ms. Polby and her sister described as “Projects”.
During the period during which she was in the follow-up, Mrs. Polby's grandmother and grandmother had received anonymous calls asking for information, Mr. Addis Ababa said.
At the time, former Chief Reporter Neville Türlbek and former reporter James Weserap were following Mrs. Polby's movement.
Having left her a vote on 18 June 2005, Coulson said: “I have a story we plan to publish tomorrow and I would like to discuss it with Charles.”
Mr. Edis said that Coulson's participation in this story was on the same stage as with other influential people, such as former Interior Minister David Blancett.
The jury heard on Thursday that Coulson had entered into a confrontation with Mr. Blanchett about the novel with a married woman while he himself met with Rebecca Brooks, who was married at the time.
Coulson and Brooks refused to enter into a conversation with other people with a view to breaking the phone between 3 October 2000 and 9 August 2006.
Malkeir, Türlbeck, and Uzerape were recognized as having broken phones.
Snoudden declared his willingness to communicate with the FRG authorities in the hearing case
CRU ex-Snouden is ready to come to Germany as soon as possible and to meet with the representatives of the FRG authorities, the RIA News transmits.
A letter from the former CIA staff to the FRG authorities at a meeting with journalists in Berlin on Friday was submitted by a member of the Bundestag Hans-Christian Strebelle, through which Snouden sent a message to the German authorities.
Snoudden met with Snoudden in Moscow.
Four people were injured by fire on the Road.
As a result of an incineration in a collector at the center of Moscow, on the Road of the Cross, four of us were injured.
As Interfax reports, referring to the source in external services, one of the victims has been hospitalized.
According to the source, the past of fires in the buried underground transition has been affected.
According to RIA News, referring to the capital of Paul Levinco's fuel and energy industry, electricity supply is now fully restored in all homes on the Road.
Fires in the warm collector's home on the Twarf Street occurred on evenings 31 October.
A strong smoke was sent out from the canals of the river, and an earthquake occurred during the underground transition to Armenia.
As a result of the fire, 11 houses were burned on the Road.
At 21:45, after the time of Moscow, fire was eliminated.
The United States dollar cuts food aid for the poor
Food allowance for families from four persons is reduced to $36 per month
From Friday in the United States, the financial security of the production talents known as "footsteps" is reduced as the action of the relevant public programme is completed.
The family of four will now be allocated $36 a month less than before.
This will affect 47 million of the poorest Americans.
According to the Reuters agency, in 2012 the average human contribution was $133 per month.
Food aid expenditure in the United States increased to $80 billion per year due to unemployment and food prices.
About 14 per cent of Americans are dependent on the free food aid provided by foot-and-mouth disease, which has been called from the past when they had the form of bookshops.
When the current economic crisis began, the programme was expanded to stimulate economic growth and help the poorest Americans.
However, the Republicans of the Congress are required to further reduce the resources allocated to the programme, stating that it should be targeted at helping those who need more.
Food stores throughout America are concerned that reductions will reduce consumer spending.
The United States Congressmen continue to argue about how much less Government funding can be reduced.
Blizzard released a 19-year-old platform free of charge
Blizzard's study released its 1994 Blackthorne platform free of charge.
This is what WoW Insider reports.
According to him, the game became available at Battle.net in the classic Blizzard game section.
However, some gamblers note that only users whose accounts are related to the U.S. service are currently able to jump.
The game is still not available for Russian users.
According to the media, the version that Bblizzard has now released on the PC is not different from the original version of the game.
Soundtrack to Blackthorne has also remained unchanged.
Blackthorne platform, which Blizzard released 19 years ago, went to SNES console.
His events were unfolded on the planet of Tuul, whose allies were divided into dark and bright kingdoms.
On one occasion, dark ruler Sarlak decided to kill the light King Vlaros and become the sole ruler of the planet.
The main hero of the game is the son of Vlarosa Kyle, who was rescued from death and sent to Earth.
Twenty years later he returned to Tuul to meet the Sarlacs and protect the planet ' s inhabitants from them.
The original Blackthorne became the first game to be released after its name was renamed Blizzard Entertainment.
She was also known as Silicon & Synapse.
The publisher Blackthorne was an Interplay company.
New cars appear in Moscow's metropolis.
But selling tickets to passengers will not be for money, but for meetings.
One trip in 30 rubles is for a potential passenger at 30 meetings.
The number of meetings will be taken into account through modern technologies, reports ITAAR TASS, referring to the press service of the Russian Olympic Committee.
The first equipment will be installed at the "External" station on 8 November 2013.
In the presentation of new ticket sports, the president of the Olympic Committee of Russia, Alexander Jukov, and the Olympic championships of Alexei Nemo and Elena Zamordchikov, will be hosted.
The Agency ' s recognition of national security strengthens the paradigm of corporations with regard to the state track
On a warm day at the end of August, a German police helicopter flew low over the U.S. consultancy in Frankfurt, Germany's financial capital.
On instructions from the Federal Constitutional Protection Service (BfV), the German Internal Intelligence Service, its task was to photograph the United States Mission ' s building area of less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
German media say BfV hoped to discover the antennas of listening devices, and these actions resulted in negotiations between the United States and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Berlin.
James Klapper, director of the U.S. National Intelligence, once again reaffirmed in September that the United States does not use the option of external intelligence “to lure foreign companies into business secrets for American companies to increase their international competitiveness or increase their profits”.
But since Edward Snouden, a contract servant who became a publisher, has begun to publish his secretary of the U.S. intelligence, the European governments and corporate leaders are no longer convinced of whether the director can be trusted.
Reports that the National Security Agency of the United States has been monitoring the Brazilian oil company Petrobras and has access to data stored by US air service providers, including Google and Yahoo, have raised the paranoia of the State ' s follow-up corporations to new heights.
The last chapel was informed that Angel Merkel's phone had been listening for about ten years.
If the most influential person in Europe can become a mouse, then, of course, potential mice are also business leaders.
Snoden has made clear intensive cooperation between U.S. intelligence services and companies.
I think it's quite likely that these data are used for mutual benefit.
“Germany should be asked,” says Oliver Green, president of the BITMI Association, who represents Germany’s small and medium-sized IT company.
German companies are convinced that the United States is now at almost the same risk as China, in industrial spying and data fraud, according to a study published by the EY Advisory Agency in July.
However, in all the documents published by Mr. Snoudden, there was still no evidence that the United States had transmitted commercial secrets of foreign companies to its own companies.
Politicians were concerned that the EU did not have certain information technologies and the Internet opportunities and felt that it should try to reduce its dependence on the United States.
Businessmen are skeptical about this.
Someone in the German Parliament says we have to create a German Google.
I can just close my eyes and slowly open them again...
"This is not an option," says Gaso Plattner, president of the German software company for SAP business.
If there is a need for a strong European IT industry, it should not be allowed to die more than 20 years ago.
Everything is subsidized in Germany: from coal to cars and farmers.
All except IT industries.
Nevertheless, the coverage and technical development of US spy agencies, known as Snoudden's openings, have been a shock to some companies who previously thought that China was the greatest risk of follow-up.
A great deal of confusion occurs in cloud technologies where leaders of European companies have found that data stored in the United States are in the same jurisdiction and therefore potentially vulnerable.
According to a study conducted by the Cloud Security Alliance Trade Association, about 10 per cent of its non-American participants refused to use the services of the U.S. air carrier after the publication of the American Data Analysis Programme for the Exploration of Prism.
Jim Sneeb, one of the Executive Directors of SAP, said: “We see that consumers are asking a new issue that didn’t happen last year, namely, where my data are stored and whether you can guarantee that they will remain physically in that jurisdiction.”
Many German leaders claim that the latest reports are merely a confirmation of what they already know: powerful States want to steal their most valuable secrets, and therefore these data must be kept at any price.
What's going on in economics is not surprising.
He always had a place.
“This has been the subject of discussion for many years and has not significantly changed in the current phenomenon,” says Kurt Bok, chief executive director of BASF.
The Americans are spying on us at the commercial and industrial level, and we are also spying on them because it is in our national interests to protect our businesses.
Corporate leaders usually do not like to be covered by the responsible measures they have taken, as this may lead to the advantage of the opponent.
In large companies, it has been a long time before the idea of taking a free flash at the exhibition or leaving a noteless note in the hotel’s number is, at least, unobservable.
Ulrich Hakenberg, a member of the Board of Directors of Audi, says that it has been a standard practice for many years — to collect mobile phones before government meetings so that they can not be used as listening devices.
The Federal Service for the Protection of the German Constitution recommends that corporate leaders consider using simple prepaid mobile phones during foreign travel due to the vulnerability of smartphones.
Prepaid mobile phones are subsequently deleted.
However, there is a risk that small and medium-sized enterprises will remain vulnerable to injuries and follow-up.
In Germany, many such companies are world leaders in their own specific minority.
“Small and medium-sized companies often lack experience, staff and financial resources to effectively protect corporate secrets from unauthorized access”, warns BfV report.
The United States dollars warn their own economic spy companies from other countries.
The National Disclosure of the United States in February replaced France with Russia and Israel in the second series of offenders who were hacking into economic intelligence after China, says The Washington Post.
A member of the Board of Directors of the prestigious German company confirmed that when it comes to economic spying, “France is more than everyone”.
Bernard Scarsini, former head of the French Internal Intelligence Agency of DCRI, reportedly said in an interview this month: “The services are well aware that all countries, even when they cooperate in the fight against terrorism, are spying on their allies.”
The parents of a youth from Georgia who died on a "best case" believe their son has been killed
The parents of a youth from Georgia, whose body was found inside a dedicated sports scene in his middle school gym, believe their son was killed, said family lawyer on Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson from the city of Waldo, Georgia, was found on 11 January in a vertical mother who was assigned back to the tribunals in his secondary school.
Follow-up to the district sheriff Loundes concluded that Johnson died in a tragic accident, but the family of 17-year-olds objected to it.
“They are absolutely convinced that their son was killed,” said FoxNews.com Benjamin Kramp, a lawyer representing Kenneth and Jaclin Johnson.
They never believed he died like the sheriff says.
“They think that this is contrary to logic, laws of physics, as well as to sound meaning,” Krampp said.
They think it's a cover for the protection of a person or a person responsible for the death of their son.
“They sent their son to school with a bag of school bags and brought him back to the body bag,” he said.
American lawyer Michael Moore stated on Thursday that he was conducting an official investigation into Johnson's death, noting that several key issues remained unanswered.
What happened to death?
Was his death a result of crime?
The Wall made a statement at the press conference on the fourth day.
I'll learn all the facts where they don't.
My goal is to learn the truth.
“I maintain that there are sufficient grounds for official investigation”, he said.
He told the reporters that the first discovery showed that Johnson died as a result of the “positional asphyxiation”.
However, the second resurrection, said Mura, showed another cause of death.
“There are several issues that should be allowed or clarified,” he said.
He added that if he found out enough role to require a criminal or civil investigation into Johnson's death, he would ask the FBI to conduct him.
The representative of the district sheriff Loundes was not available for the comment when he was visited on Thursday.
The Justice of South Georgia in the middle ordered the authorities to publish all video footage of the surveillance cameras that were monitored by the investigators.
The parents of the adolescent said that they hoped that videotapes contained the key to his death.
Spartacus: Information on persons who have taken the fascist symbol
The official website "Spartaca" revealed a statement by the Moscow Club on the appearance of a tribunal in Yaroslavla of the Fascist flag.
On October 30th, the "Spartacus" football team at the station in Yaroslavle demonstrated a fascist symbol.
We call on all those who have reliable information about persons who have committed this criminal offence to provide it
"Employment is guaranteed," said the statement.
Search of fans carrying the Fascist flag in Yaroslavle
Remember, in March 1/16, the Russian Cubca Shinnik, Spartacus, has been interrupted several times because of the riots on the tribunals.
A fascist symbol was also shown in the Spartacus hospital sector.
In the form of Spartacus punishment, there may be about three fighters without witnesses.
The meeting of the Committee will be held on Friday.

Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have issued recommendations for schools on child allergy
In the middle of the disease control and prevention centres, a list of food allergy control recommendations was published in schools.
This is the first list of such recommendations issued by the Government of the United States, while the number of school-age children suffering from food allergy is growing.
Now one of the 20 children in the United States has food allergy.
The disease control and prevention centres explained that food allergy among children increased by 18 per cent from 1997 to 2007.
The guidance provides information for the school on how to raise awareness of teachers and staff about child nutrition and how to provide assistance in the event of allergic reactions.
It also recommends that schools keep adrenaline storage — most often for injections with an automatic epiPen medical syringe — to help with potentially fatal anaphylaxis.
The laws of the States recently amended the regulation to allow schools to make savings of adrenaline with fewer difficulties.
The report also contains a list of typical symptoms described by children with allergic reactions.
Children can say, "It's like feeling something in my language," "It feels like I have hair in my tongue" or "it's a joke."
Intersexual children's parents may choose “undefined sex”
Germany became the first European country to recognize the third half of children born with abusive sex organs of the intermediate type.
No longer will it be mandatory to assign sex to men or women.
The new law does not require parents to call any half of such children, allowing parents to indicate the half as “undefined” or “unset” in their birth certificates.
The purpose of the law was to remove the pressure from parents who could take prompt decisions on sex-producing operations and to combat discrimination against persons of intersex.
According to BBC, one person said years ago: “I am neither a man nor a woman.”
I'm gonna be a doctor-in-the-art piece with shadows and scars.
About one of the 2,000 children born each year are neither a boy nor a girl.
They have an intersexuality, one of about 60 pathological conditions that falls under the diagnosis of “sexual development” — a collective term for people with atypical chromosomes, gonades (poisoners or seeders) or abnormally developed sex organs.
Wallis Simpson may have been an intersexual.
Gender identification has not yet been sufficiently studied, but most experts in the United States say that if sex cannot be identified, it is better to use all available information and adopt it than to expect and monitor the psychological and physical development of the child before the operation, if at all.
New York psychiatrist, Dr. Jack Drescher, who specializes in gender identification issues, said that the new German law “ sounds like a good idea”.
Intersexual children create ethical dilemmas.
“Some people have life-threatening violations that require operational intervention, but most children do not have them,” he said.
You can pick up a field without surgery and then see how a person develops.
The science of how a child develops any gender identity is not too precise.
No one can answer the questions why this is happening.
It's like a reminder of why people are gay.
The report sent to the European Commission in 2011 describes intersexual people as being different from transsexual or transgender because they are not related to gender, but to their biological structure, which is not exclusively to male or female sex, nor is it typical of either or not.
These may occur in secondary sex signs such as muscle mass, hair cover, chest and body; primary sex signs such as reproductive organs and genitalia, or in the structure of chromosomes and hormones.
The report also provides a general picture of discrimination faced by intersex and transgender persons in the field of employment, as well as the level of anxiety, violence and pre-trial crime.
Boys with gender-rejection now have a special camp.
Australia and Nepal have already allowed adults to place a male, female or “third sex” in their official documents.
In June 52, Australia's 52-year-old Norry May-Walby became the first person in the world to be recognized as a “free” person to remain in court for an “uncertain” sexual status for the rest of his life.
According to the Ministry of the Interior, a third sign in German passports will be used in addition to M and F to X is sexual.
In the neighbouring France, gender issues are still causing opposition, according to the news release to the French Channel 24.
In 2011, dozens of lawmakers from France, this clearly expressed Catholic country, signed an application for the removal of “general theory” from school textbooks.
The U.S. Catholic Online website also expressed disagreement with the German law, writing that “in a situation where the world is in a new state where gender is the subject of choice and sexual activity is not, we are reversing two more pillars of civilization”.
A mother of a newborn child from Maryland also reported on the Baby Zone website that she would prefer to set up a pool for children when they were born.
“Raising a child is hard enough and without additional restrictions, especially if you don’t know half of your child,” she said to the parents’ website.
Children need stability and confidence.
Historically, children born to male and female sex organs were called hemafrodites — in the name of a beautiful Greek god who had both sexes.
And yet ten years ago, the medical community recognized the gender as a letter that could be deleted and then re-drawn.
But now many are arguing about ethical grounds for surgery, knowing that gender identity is difficult and that doctors sometimes make an unwise choice, not knowing how a child will accept the sex he or she has acquired when he is growing up.
"In the mid- twentieth century it was called "an emergency psychiatric case," Drescher said.
When these children were born, you didn’t call a psychiatrist — you called a surgeon.
The dominant theory of dealing with children with inter-ethnic genitalia was proposed by Dr. John Mani of the University of Johns Hopkins, who believed that gender was easy to change.
He introduced the term “genuine identity” and claimed that environmental signals, including social — how parents grow children — interact with the genes and hormones of the child, determining whether a person will consider himself a man or a woman.
But in one case in 1966, known as John/John, his theories were under question.
He advised the boy’s parents that his penis was damaged during an emergency, that the child should be completely destroyed, that he should also remove his eggs, and that he should grow up as a girl.
“I have presented the case as a successful example of the transition, but that was not the case,” Dresher said.
When the boy was about 15 years old, he again became a boy and married a woman.
But in 38 years he committed suicide.
Drescher said that some doctors are still "applying this model".
But in the 1990s, with the Internet coming, people who survived these sex-change operations declared themselves “unsatisfied”.
This was the case with Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old writer from the state of Montana who was born with male XY chromosomes, but the genetics of an intermediate type.
The doctor could not determine whether he had a large clinic or a small pension, and he was convinced that he would never be able to live a “full life ” of men.
So soon after his birth in 1976, Bruce’s extramarital organs and eggs were surgically removed, and he recovered as a girl.
He was given female hormones at the age of 12.
"I knew I wasn't a girl," he told ABCNews.com.
I was unhappy, but it was very difficult to ask questions.
At 18 years of age, he was diagnosed with vaginal art.
But when he was depressed and realized that something was wrong, he needed medical documentation.
What he knew was terrible.
I was sterilized at birth, and no one ever told me about it.
Bruce was born in violation of sexual development, which did not allow his body to produce enough testosterone for normal genital development.
Once he learned the truth, he again became a man, got a testosterone class, and removed his chest.
The operation made him useless.
Today it is in the protection of others in an organization called the Interface Project, trying to bring people into regular sexual orientation.
But Ann Thamar-Mattis, Executive Director of the California Legal Association Advocates for Reported Choice, is concerned that the German law “incentives the development of barriers and arrivals”.
“Many activists are concerned that the German law will encourage parents to make a quick decision and give the child an “uncertain sex”, she said.
We are afraid that he will promote intervention.
We think it's better to adopt a male or female sex and then wait.
But we have not yet seen how this law works, so all we can do is build assumptions.
Tamar Mathis said that her organization supported the Australian law because “it allows adults to make choices for the benefit of the third sex”.
“ Adults must have the opportunity to make their own decisions on formal sex,” she says.
The German law meant its adoption at birth.
This is a war in which young children should not enter this stage.
When they grow up, they can make decisions about their own body.
However, Dr. Arlin Barac, a pimpologist from Pittsburgh, who has a daughter with a sexual development violation that helps hundreds of others in the support group, said that the German law “supports” both parents and children.
The daughter Barac, Katie, was born with male chromosomes, but she had a sexual development violation called “a syndrome of full non-sensitivity to Androgens”.
As her anthrogen receptors work wrong, Katie developed female signs.
She's got a place to live, but she doesn't have any mummies or eggs.
Now, at the age of 29, Katie is married and has a child psychologist at the University of Pennsylvania.
Despite her barrenness, she is expected to become a parent through adoption or management of surrogate motherhood.
“The law gives parents time to avoid making hasty decisions on their own,” Barac said.
He gives them time to do some analysis and to figure out the situation, as well as a period of time before they write "male" or "female".
In such a case, you will grow up to be an adult, and you will love your child.
You have a wonderful baby, and you're happy.
We don't have to do an operation that won't come back.
“This allows children to take part in the decision and eliminate the driving of parents because they do not feel that they are doing the right thing,” she said.
At the end of the child’s life, he or she will decide how much more comfortable he or she will have — and that is remarkable.
This allows children to make their own decisions.
Chicago's doorman Nikolai Habibulin stressed: he understands that he should play better.
According to 40-year-old Russians, he will continue to work hard on training.
At the last two "Yastrebov" meetings, Habibulin first missed six teams from Tampa Bay and then four from Otava, and in the second game he was replaced after the fourth lost team.
We must play well, and in the last two games I didn't succeed, CSNChicago says Habibulin.
- I need to find confidence in training, I'm sure it should be addressed as a game, and try to achieve a better outcome.
You have to study your past games and work on those shortcomings that were.
There are a few small components that I need to improve, but I feel quite comfortable in training.
But why, after a few heads, everything turns into some kind of snowball.
Maybe I need to get a little tired.
Returners - I don't think I'm such a one - they're always trying to play the perfect game.
If I miss four, five, six, I'm not in the third.
It doesn't matter what's going on in front of my doors.
I'm still working on myself so I don't miss that much.
Of course my roommates support it, but in principle it's just that I have to play better.
Two games are not all season, but I wanted to do them a lot better.
But it happened.
I have to take this side.
I'll just try to play the next match better.
The train has moved to Altae.
In the Rubcov region of the Altai region, the PAS train has been turned over.
As a result, 13 persons were injured by the TIR, according to the data, reported to the ITC regional administration.
The former law enforcement authorities in the region reported 10 injured.
According to the authorities, the accident occurred about 9 o'clock in the morning after a local time on the Novononikolaevka - Wišnevka road in 1 km from Novononikolaevki.
At the bus from Rubcovska, Wishnevka, there were 12 passengers and drivers, everyone had a different degree of burden and had been hospitalized.
Eleven injured were sent to the City Hospital No.1 Rubcovska, and two persons were hospitalized in the Rubcovska CRB.
Medvej estimates that the SSJ-100 aircraft will be deployed in Europe
Russia estimates that the Superjet 100 aircraft will also be delivered to Europe after the expansion of the markets in Latin America and Asia.
"We are counting on the overall complexity that we will receive such agreements more than 170 pilots of such a type," says Interfax, Russian Prime Minister Dmitria Medvedev, who told them at the press conference with French Prime Minister Jean-Marc Eiro.
The head of the Russian Government noted that there was serious cooperation with French colleagues as it was a joint project.
We have discussed some financial issues related to insurance today, but we hope that once this aircraft is strengthened on the markets of Latin America and the Asia-Pacific region, it will also be given to our partners in Europe.
"I hope he will ever be transferred to France," the Russian Prime Minister stressed.
SSJ-100 is an aircraft built by the Sohogo Civil Aviation Company in partnership with Alenia Aermacchi.
The liner is developed on the basis of modern technologies and offers high quality standards and comfort in 100 passenger seats.
The Dnepropetries started a unique rescue program...
In an old mansion to bring him to an ass door, the high chair was set up with a wheelchair, and the heavy nest was well kept on it.
Such special resistance has long been out of place, so the true love of the cable lines of the transmitter is based on the way the true home is built.
Grandma Anja, who lived in the village of Ivanovska Petríkov region for 20 years, noticed how the nest sits despite all the efforts of its inhabitants.
The birds are laying on new eggs, and the lower layer has already passed between the eggs, the egg will move.
Of course, it is sad that a family of Asians, who have been living in the countryside every year, have produced and trained three or four birds during the summer, but they do not want to remain without light.
As soon as birds flew into the warm end, Grandma Anya called at the Carycan Reese, which is responsible for the resistance.
And she didn't even expect them to respond so quickly.
When our specialists arrived in Ivanovka, they were surprised that the nest was still in hold, told the technical director of the DTEC "Dnepropellergo" Sergey Berezovski.
In fact, there has already been a corrosion on the inside of the nest of 150 to 200 pounds [150 - 200 kg].
At any point, birds could die from an electric plane.
Yes, the local people were at risk of being left out of light because of the damage to the premises.
So the linear assembly began the rescue operation, which is no longer the first time in our practice.
Scientists from the Dnepropetrov National University have helped develop a gene transfer scheme.
They also conducted training for regional network staff.
A well-known day-to-day ornithologist, Alexander Ponmarenko, has consulted energy in all stages of the construction of the nest.
For the first time, it was considered that there were more than 50 real "rooms" in the disaster situation.
Special metal platforms were built for their reconstruction.
They dug mostly with eggs and then carried the old nest there.
In the opinion of the bats, it is sufficient to place old bees as the basis for birds to find out the nest and return to it.
They'll be able to get their own apartment.
A month ago, the first nest was rebuilt in the village of Pescanka in the New Moscow area.
With an electric current, they set up a new railway station and placed a platform on it with old, already used nests.
All of the operations were powered by nine thousand crimes.
And on the same day, the same new village was located in the village of Ivanovka Petríkov region on the coast of Ani.
This is where the platform was built in the past, just hanging over the floors.
Ornithologists are convinced that cautious, conservative birds are not even aware that their habitat is under a capital repair.
By the end of the year, the same reconstruction awaits four more nests in the Pakrovsk and Carycan regions of Dnepropetries.
As long as some rescue rare birds are rescued, others kill them without mercy.
Every day, the whole area of the airport heard the news - in the village of Ust-Kamenka of the Apostolic Area, on the day of opening the pools, the marriageers fired the Lebedin family promised to be on the ground.
The blessed birds were not afraid of the people. The local inhabitants were not afraid of them.
When the farmer heard the shots, he ran to the well, and four beautiful lebede were already lying on the water dead.
The officers of the Apostles are now finding out who shot the birds in the Red Book.
The Russian March is becoming more popular
On 4 November, on the Day of People's Unity, Moscow will be hosted by the Russian March Mary.
According to the "Levada-centre" survey, support for the "Russian Roads" growth - 40 per cent of citizens have already accepted the idea of their actions in different ways.
According to the Levada Centre, 40 per cent of citizens have different approvals of the Russian Routes: 11 per cent of them are definitely positive and 29 per cent are more positive.
In 2006, only 14 per cent of Russians were welcomed by the Russians, while in December 2010, there were already two more citizens (28 per cent).
"Determiningly negative" to "Russian March" is only 7% Russians, "faster negative" is 19%.
35 per cent had not yet been able to shape their relationship with the action.
This year, Maria Moscow agreed to hold a Russian march of up to 15,000 people in Lublin, and today the head of the Department of Security of the capital, Alexey Mayorov.
This nationalist action is held every year on the People ' s Day since 2005.
On the question of sociologists "Did you hear that on 4 November Russian marches were held in Russia under Russian law? Three quarters (75 per cent) of citizens responded negatively.
Only five Russians (20 per cent) are aware of this action.
It is noteworthy that in December 2010 nearly a third of the citizens (31 per cent) heard of the Russian marches.
It is recalled that three years ago, on 11 December, a physical meeting of nationalists was held in the Manej area, which had grown into mass riots.
The Levada Centre also asked the Russians what holiday was celebrated on 4 November.
In two years, the number of those who knew the right answer (People's Day) has increased from 41 per cent to 49 per cent.
On the other hand, only 15 per cent of citizens are gathered to observe this holiday.
About the same (17 per cent) were planned to cancel the October 7th revolution.
Most citizens (62 per cent) are not expected to observe any of these holidays.
How Mary Moscow agreed to the Russian March in Lublin
On 28 October, the capital authorities agreed to hold the Russian March in Lublin on 4 November.
This was reported by the leader of the Russian Association, the organizer of the march Dmitri Demushkin.
In addition to six in Lublin on the People's Day, a meeting and rock concert of the group "Colovarat" will also be held with the authorities.
How the Russian March-2012 went
On the Day of People's Unity in 2012, nationalists passed the sixth from the Yemeni border to the Central Artist's House, where the meeting took place.
The organizers estimated the number of participants to be 20,000, and the MDGs called the number 6,000.
Communication: Obama's pre-election headquarters considered the exemption of Byden for Hillary Clinton
According to The New York Times, the next consultants of President Barak Obama addressed the possibility of the replacement of Vice-President Jo Byden, candidate Hillary Clinton, in the 2012 election list.
This opening is the clearest sense of all the expected books of Mark Galperin and John Hylemanna on the 2012 campaign "Dublining: The Game Has Changed 2012".
The Times had received an exemplar ready to issue the book and reported on Thursday evening that the next Vice-Presidents had conducted “large-scale studies in focus groups and public opinion surveys at the end of 2011” in order to assess whether Byden's exclusion could help raise disappointing hopes for Obama's re-election.
According to political examiner The Times Jonathan Martina, the book gives a detailed description of the attempt of senior pre-election officials and the White House, namely the former head of the administration of the White House, Bill Daily, to assess the impact of the vote by former vice-president, Mr. Clinton.
A possible replacement was a secret, carefully protected in the Chicago Premier Station and the Oval Cabinet.
Only six of the next presidential advisers, including Dale, former president of Obama Jim Messin, and former White House counsellors David Axelrod and David Pluff, knew what was being considered.
The book "Dublined" states that Dalia was the first to try to replace Byden, despite their "close personal relations", but eventually rejected this step when their data showed that Clinton's addition to the electoral list did not " significantly improve Obama's chances".
In an interview with Martin Daily, the administration had actually considered the possibility of replacing Byden Clinton.
"I have been active in considering a lot of things, and that was one of them," said the Daily newspaper.
You should remember that the president was in a terrible shape at the time, so we thought, "Oh, my God, what are we doing?"
Although Dale described the study as “required verification”, Martin told the representative of CNN Anderson Cooper that the pre-election table had put much effort into the study of whether this step would be taken by the dividends to vote.
“The pre-election headquarters will not spend such amounts of money on surveys and focus groups if they do not take into account anything,” Martin said in AK 360.
It is unclear, however, whether Obama knew that his team had studied the possibility of replacement.
Martin told CNN that he asked Dale if he knew his early boss about the possible transfer.
Although Daley said he did not think that the President had been in the course of a possible replacement, the former head of the administration recognized that Obama knew “probably”.
Martin added that "Dublins" did not give a clear answer to the question whether the results of the political reconciliation had come to Obama's table.
Cooper asked Martin if he seriously believed that Obama did not know about the possibility of removing Byden from the electoral list.
"Maybe," answered Martin.
You want a light in the dark of the ice?
The British entrepreneur created the first light in the world with the help of medicine.
Charlie Francis used the fluorescent properties of the marine animal to develop a light food.
He came to this idea by reading a science article on medusas and convinced scientists in China to chemically produce a bright white.
The frozen person reacts to the language of the person he is, increases the pH in the protein and makes it shine.
Chris says that since the ice starts to shine when it reacts to a warm mouth, it means that the more you lie, the more clearly it becomes.
Charlie, founder of the ice cream company "Lisney me, I'm delicious," says, "It's an incredible thing, but it's still at the very first stage, if it's about production, so you get about £200 for about 2 grams."
The protein we use in the frozen is in response to your language with neutral pH.
So when your mouth becomes white, it will increase your pH and the ice will begin to shine.
We tested him over the last few months, and it was said that he would be ideally introduced to Halloween because it created such a remarkable lighting effect.
It's probably the most expensive ice cream I've ever done because honey luminance is four times the gold road.
So I've got about £140 for every scarf.
That's why it's nice to taste.
Charlie's experimental company, located in Bristol, is famous for its unusual tastes, including beer, cheese, beef and soybean.
But his next creation must be even more ambitious.
He said, “I really want to develop an invisible ice cream.”
This cannot be determined because of the breakdown caused by ice crystals, which are frozen, but I think we'll find a way to do so.
The frozen uses the fluorescent properties of honey that are synthesised by Chinese scientists
Trainer Vladimir Chebatturkin, speaking of the preparation of his team for the KHL's regular campaign against Salvata, noted that targets had been carefully analysed by the Methyllurgar.
The Specialist stressed that Avangarda should give increased attention to the defence game.
We've seen a video of the match against the metallurgy machine, which brings up the official website "Avangarda" of Chebatturkina.
- They've missed a lot of shifts, not a very pleasant moment.
They've missed because of their mistakes, because of the lack of performance of the game.
We knew that the opponent had executioners.
According to statistics, they had five attacks from the walk, three of us were killed.
It's a good performance.
Were these errors taken into account when preparing for today's game?
We're talking to each match after the game and we're ready for a new match.
The main thing is for the installation to be completed.
They all saw the first period of fighting against Metallur.
The game was done, and the account was 2:0.
They missed the hole "in the basement" - and started to go wrong in the third period.
In view of the heavy composition of the game, he did not see any sense of belonging to the defenders.
I'll defend you all over the team.
Now there's a long home series in Avangarde, and there's going to be a fight in the day, and there's a lot of tension in the team?
All teams are in the same conditions.
The main purpose is to carry out its moments and to carry out its game.
Hockey is an emotional game if you run the installation, it's not that difficult.
The new rules introduced by the Russian Customs Code have already led to hundreds of forums on the border with Russia for nearly a week.
Today, the Danish officials promised to provide drivers with drinking water and set up biotwalets
Hundreds of forums were opened at border crossings when they entered Russia.
This situation has resulted from a change in customs regulations.
Ukrainian frontiers and customsmen confirm that there is a Russian party that has not previously warned of developments.
Since 28 October, the Russian customs authorities have applied additional measures to guarantee the delivery of goods, as reported by the Deputy Head of the East Customs of Vladimir Denisov.
The new model document applies to countries that have acceded to the Convention on International Transport.
The missed items work in strengthened mode.
The Facts Correspondent came to the border and reported to the inmates of the situation.
The prices in the travel coffee shop at the Novoazovsk pass point are increasing with each day, as is the case with the forum.
The loads are in several rows, growing about two miles [2 km].
The customs terminal of Novozovsk - Wesello-Vaznessenka provides one of the most important transport routes from South Ukraine to international automobiles.
The goods are shipped from here to Stavropol, Russia, Kazakhstan, Georgia, Armenia.
On Wednesday before midnight, they were released, and after these rules were introduced, Dr. Aleksey Golovanov (on the photo) complained that he was carrying a transit through Russia's freight from Kazakhstan and was already in his car for nearly a week.
Under new rules to cross the border, I need an additional package of documents and cargo insurance payments.
The amount depends on the value of the cargo and the distance on which it is carried.
Minimum insurance - 4.5 - 5,000 rubles (about 1100 - 1300 gloves).
Those who eat near (i.e. in Georgia, Armenia) with a value of up to $50,000 pay some 15,000 rubles (3800 grevs).
And the rest of them were shot because none of them had such great money!
Imagine that if the driver carries all four thousand dollars, but until Moscow he needs 90,000 rubles (about 23,000 gloves) to pay for a transit!
The conditions for survival at the border - no one - are set up by long-distancers who are up on their cars.
In border stores and coffee and so on, but the prices like here we didn't meet anywhere!
The sellers were oriented and quickly called out: 15 gloves are worth cotton, seven gloves are cupcakes, 25 gloves - terel soup.
And coffee one.
And there's no toilet.
I'm sleeping in the stairs. I'm going to the toilet.
We're not going to lie down or we're going to...
I can't get out of the car for a week. I've got a woman on my way.
A week later, another waitress, Victor Skotarenko, was relieved.
Will you just come to my car next week?
Why do you have a bottle of water?
It's 11 and 15.
What, a bottle of crude or water keeps on the beer?
We have coffee, not a store.
Take it while there's something else, the salesman's paring.
After the situation began to become publicized in the media, the attention of the regional authorities was drawn to the plight of the Ukrainian leaders.
The guidance of the Ambrose and Novaz Rígossad administrations was commissioned to ensure that all those who were on their way to the Ukrainian-Russian border, drinking water, were entrusted with the duties of the Danish President of the Ministry of Welfare Sergey Dergunov.
Now, in the passage points, there's a quick relief brigade.
Biotuals will also be established for the benefit of people.
According to the official, the issue of order will be resolved in the near future.
According to the press service of the Danish Ministry of Services, 32 and 68 cars were operated on 31 October at the international crossing points of the Suspenka and Novazovsk, respectively.
The " Facts" will monitor developments in the situation.
Vilnius suspects Moscow in an attempt to overthrow the Lithuanian President
Russia intends to conduct information provocations against high-level Lithuanians and Eastern Partnership countries, such a statement was made by the BNS agency in the Department of Security of the Republic (DGB).
Information on this is published on the DELFI portal.
According to the report, Moscow is planning, in particular, to “talk” to the President of Lithuania, Dalu Gribausskaite, and to publish falsified documents such as those found in the Russian Gosarhiv concerning facts from the biography of the Lithuanian leader.
The Department of Public Process Analysis of the Administration of the President of Russia on Interregional and Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries is responsible for the preparation of the information attack.
The structure is headed by Eugenia Umerenko, who visited Lithuania and participated in the Lithuanian People's Party.
He is also a member of the operation as well as a staff member of Department B. Simirov.
According to the Special Service, Simirov, under the cover of scientific work by the end of 2012, regularly visited Lithuania and contacted local policies, politicians and media representatives.
Simirno has now been banned from entering the country's territory.
The late President of Lithuania, Gribausskaite, said that he knew what was being prepared for her.
In her view, the main reason is that Lithuania's successful presidency in the Council of the European Union and the country ' s "fire of energy independence"
The Lithuanian leader had never before criticized the actions of the Russian authorities.
She thus stated that in Crete to Lithuania there were "undeserved".
In addition, Gribausskaite accused the head of RF Vladimir Putin of “one requirement” of moving to Lithuania.
Remember, in September, Rosporebnadzo stopped importing Lithuanian "milk" into Russia.
It was reported that the quality of the product was not in accordance with the health and epidemiological standards.
The leader of Lithuania then stated that, if Russia did not take a ban, the Government of the country should prepare treatment in WTO.
In the United States, the school director shot young people.
The director of one of the American high school youth schools was literally disappointed.
The man, he said, had to take the gun and start shooting.
An incident occurred in Tennessee.
According to the New York Post, the little hummingbirds destroyed a man's house with a toilet book.
As a result, the school director opened a shoot at adolescents, resulting in several injuries to the foot and arm of a 15-year-old boy.
As the Hulligans were not in the Director ' s property territory, he was charged with an attack in urgent circumstances.
The man was released from prison at $125,000.
It is noteworthy that the shooting of peacekeepers in the United States has become a terrible rule of law.
The man literally discovered a bullet in the center of Ridgecrest in California, U.S.A., right across the street.
After that, the criminal took two accidents into custody, stopped them in the car trunk and tried to hide.
Formerly in Newton's primary school, Connecticut, there was an open fire.
At school, Adam's mom worked, she was a teacher.
U.S. School shooting: 14-year-old girl injured
A sudden shooting incident occurred on 31 January at the U.S. school in Atlanta, Georgia.

When I was a kid, Halloween was adorable.
My sister and I were allowed to have a concert, and later we were not allowed to sleep and wear masks for our area.
Now I'm more like a cross.
In the last two years, I have not been able to distribute the concerts in my room, and I will not be able to do so this year.
However, statistics show that I am a white bear in the case of Halloween.
According to the National Trade Federation, most Americans — or 158 million — will celebrate Halloween this year and spend a total of $6.9 billion on clothing, clothing and clothing.
The only thing I'm waiting for every Halloween is trends.
The national trade union predicts that it will cost $1.2 billion from the lost $6.9 billion.
This year there are sexually stimulating subjects on the stage of fashion.
Women are no longer obliged to be representatives of sexual professions; they may also be sex addicts, such as pizzas, hamburgers or rabbits.
As far as men are concerned, I think we see a lot of zombies thanks to the "Wonderful Dead" and I'm sure that the spacecraft in the Daft Punk group will fall into our Instagram tapes this year.
According to Google, costumes that are mostly looking for anything are zombies, Batman, pirates and bears.
Please, there's nothing wrong with a traditional approach.
We made our dogs last year, and to my surprise, we weren't the only ones.
Moreover, according to the National Federation of Miscellaneous Trade, the United States will spend $330 million this year on pet costumes.
That means a lot of funny hot dogs.
When the case comes to the conference, we don't get angry.
The Americans will spend $1.9 billion this year on them, according to Nielsen.
It's about 600 million pounds of hershey chocolate, ice cream, milk duds concentrate, Twizzlers and Clark Bar buttocks.
According to the U.S. Ministry of Trade, these are excellent news for 41 million children who are willing to submit to our territory.
Moreover, we buy, and we don’t cheat — we eat 90 million pounds of chocolate in Halloween.
The only thing we don't want to use is the envelopes in the form of cornseeds; however, according to the National Conditers Association, almost 35 million pounds are sold under Halloween.
It's about nine billion individual cucurbits.
That's the order I'm still supposed to talk about.
There's nothing like Halloween, like a house with visions.
They have names, such as "The Wall Walls" (which is found in this prison), "Wow and Crick" and "Dock".
In addition, according to Americana Hauts, there are 1200 officially recognized homes with income-generating projections of about $500 million, as well as attractive photographs where you've almost described what your friend posted on Facebook and you can't pick up, and then the guy you like sees this photo and leaves comments of the kind of "class expression of person".
And we're finally talking about whales.
Charlie Brown introduced us to the Great Teacher when we were children, and Jack’s flashlight was like the beauty of a birthday tree, what we do when we were children.
Fortunately for us, the fashion for a kid in a movie started only last year with Pinterest, so most of us grew up with these tapes and not sitting in them.
According to the U.S. census office, this year Americans will spend about $106 million on tissues.
The lighthouse Jack, who slowly jumped on your wing, probably came from Illinois, which grew 542 million pounds this year.
If you want more complicated tasks, visit Tima and Susan Metisdon in Napa, California, and try to figure out one of their tweets by 2032 pounds.
The site of Monboron Estonia was restored after the Ukrainian hackers attacked
The work of the Ministry of Defence of Estonia website was restored after the morning cyberattack, reports the press service.
According to the Deputy Chancellor of Minoboron on Information and Administrative Questions, it was a primitive attack, and the site simply overloaded a large number of requests.
Our specialists quickly adjusted everything, so far the site's work has been restored.
"The Ministry of Damage is minimal," Peterkop said in the Postimes issue.
According to the apostle Peter, until early in the morning we talked about the one who organized the attacks.
“We are obliged to analyse the causes of the incident and to draw our conclusions on it, but it is impossible to prevent such incidents at all.”
Furthermore, on 1 November, the Anonymous Ukraine group deployed a network of treatment that confirmed the hacker attack on the website of Minoboron Estonia and spoke against the partnership between Ukraine and NATO.
We want NATO leadership to hear our voice, the voice of the Ukrainian people.
We mustn't be NATO's servants.
The Ukrainians do not want to die for NATO member interests.
Ukraine doesn't need NATO block.
Ukraine does not need to be in the European Union.
Ukraine doesn't need Russia.
Ukraine must be no slave.
We speak for an independent Ukraine.
"Hands other than Ukraine," says Anonymous.
Formerly, the Ukraine Minoboron reported that the foot of the Pacific Battalion of a certain Pacific Ocean battalion would take part in the command-building lessons of NATO Steadfast Jazz-2013 response force.
A number of schools and hospitals were closed because of the violence of the unclean force.
Four schools in Zimbabwe's South Matabeleland had to be closed because the students were attacked by... Goblins.
As the local elder said, the children were panicked, and it seemed impossible to continue.
The story of the goblin may sound like a child's opinion for a European, but in Africa it is a very serious argument to close the school.
Adults are also afraid of unclean forces.
In the summer, for example, a hospital was closed in Zimbabwe because there were also seizures on medical personnel.
Announced the launch of the Land Rover series
There are front seats and six-year safety belts, as well as the internal communications system.
In addition, modernized brakes, a service package providing access to Bowler Works machines, logistical support and maintenance of a car between activities can be obtained.
Dr. Bowler, managing director of Bowler Motorsport, said: “The participants in the rally in Bowler have changed.”
Some of them are not experienced runners, but people who are looking for relief, conclusions and access to the activities of the world class.
We are pleased to propose such a way in partnership with Land Rover and MSA, and we believe that this format offers a new way to try different rail disciplines in the United Kingdom and beyond, as well as to prepare participants for difficult conditions and real rail.
We were very pleased to develop a car for Defender Challenge — a truly exciting champion.
In addition, Defender Challenge provides one day in February for training and testing, as well as for participation in the field activities in North Africa and in the Middle East.
Russian forces are unaware of the "British Circle" group - New Reports
In this regard, INTERFAX.RU refers to a source of information in the law enforcement authorities of the RF.
“After reports were received from the Ministry of Finance of the United States Lépsa in the control list of suspects belonging to the Eurasian Criminal Syndicate 'British Circle ', we examined all the databases but did not find such a group," said the agency's associate.
In his view, the dissemination of this information contributes to the support of the myth of a so-called Russian mafia, which is both abroad.
As stated earlier, the U.S. Ministry of Finance published on its website a list of alleged members of the “British Circle” criminal group yesterday.
Among them was also the Russian singer Grigory Lemps.
He's on the list as "Greed," and he's been shocked.
They match the data of the popular Russian executive.
The exact name is Grigory Lepsevride, the birthplace and date of birth.
In addition to Leps, there are five other people mentioned.
Two Russians, Israeli citizen, Uzbekistanian citizen and one other out of the former SSR, whose nationality is not indicated.
In the United States, it is believed that Gregory Lemps, who lives on the island of Phuket, carried money for gang members on their orders.
The report is accompanied by a photo of the singer and shows all his data that are relevant to the reality.
In addition, Leps actually bought a house in Phuket.
The Bureau noted that they intended to impose sanctions on Leps.
The blacklisting of the American Minfina would lead to the blocking of its assets in the United States and the banning of business contacts with its people living in the United States.
Assistant Lépsa Maya Sericova said that no announcements had been made: "It was difficult to answer the question whether it was Grigory who is now speaking about the US scandal."
All Leps knows is media information.
He had no personal messages, though I do not know if they were in such cases.
"And, of course, that's all, on the one hand, funny, and on the other, amazing and unexpected," she said RIA News.
According to her, the Phuket Grigory Leps does not live, but, as Minfin U.S. says, he actually has a home on the Thai island.
She said that Leps is now on a long trip to the Far East and Siberia, and that the news left him during his flight to the city of Blagavoštensk.
Fleeing to the field in the "Shinnik" game.
There are some details about the identity of the fan who escaped in the field during the battle of 1/16 Cubca Russia's finals between the Raoslavic Shinnic and the Moscow Spartacus.
As KDK head of RFS Arthur Grigoryanz said, referring to the data on MVD, this patient is a Moscowian.
He's been detained right now.
"In spite of this, the Grigorians told of how the fantatus had managed to escape into the field: "It was clear that this, by his name, had come to the immediate assistance of two spectators, referring to the problems of the heart.
He's here to help us out quickly. He's been confirmed by a doctor soon.
Then he turned his back on his two companions and fled to the field.
He fled from the east and south coast to the corner of the east and north.
He ran through all the fields.
That's what the Stuarts answer.
Prior to the entry into force of the Sports Act, this area of conduct of the Stuarts is not allowed by the police to interfere with what is on the field.
He arrived at the tribunal, passing through the East Court.
At the same time, there have been irregularities in the Eastern Tribunal and in the escape routes," the head of the CDC said.
It is recalled that the decision of the Moscow Spartacus CD to conduct the 15th round of the Russian anti-Locmotiva and Zenita campaign and to pay the fine of 600 thousand rubles.
Fire forces have been launched to save the lost sand, which has been shot at 50 feet above the ground at a dangerous position in the career
Cocker-spanny Ruby escaped after she got into a small DTP.
Three days later, her career partner noticed a dog shooting.
The fires have fallen on the roof of a shelter to save the dog from the inevitable death
Rock managed to survive after the fire forces were fired to lift him up and deliver him into a safe place, after he somehow shot 50 feet high on a dangerous landing.
The nine-month Spanish cooker Ruby escaped after she got into a car accident on the day she was resurrected and spent three days alone before she was rescued from a career in the middle.
Her husband, 25-year-old Scott Alderson and his 20-year-old friend Becky Hall were at the Phillipet career in Denholm, West Yorkshire, to join Ruby and thank the West Yorkshire fire rescue service.
They looked for their stray dog and placed their addresses on social networks after she ran into a career after a minor accident.
About 14:15 in the middle of the starbird noticed Ruby, who stood up to 50 feet on her way into career.
The technical rescue team from the Clekchiton fire station rushed down to the scene, jumped down the stairs to rescue Ruby, and used the transport to lift her up onto the roof.
An officer of the rescue team, Andy Clayton, said: "She was in a dangerous situation."
It was right in the middle of a steep slope — 50 feet up to the top and down to the ground.
She didn't move too much muscle during the rescue, she gave up perfectly.
But now she's okay.
Then she came to the oven.
That was a very unusual challenge.
The fact that the dog was noticed is incredible.
Peter Lau, a rescue team officer, said: "The rubies are very close to saving her."
It was likely that she could get very serious injury or worse.
The rubies were brought to the hospital for inspection, and it was established that everything was in order, except for origin and loading.
Mrs. Hall of Galifax, West Yorkshire, said: "Watching for survival was terrible."
I couldn't believe she was there at all.
It was exciting when she was back in our arms.
The veterinarian said that if she was pregnant and lost consciousness, she would almost fall.
The fires were huge.
It was very courageous — what they did.
We are so grateful, and each of them was absolutely touching.
Mr. Alderson from the city of Kitley added: "We were afraid she might fall, but she remained there."
The fires were amazing.
I just can't believe she happened there.
Mike Jagger says he didn't play with Katie Perry when she was 18.
During an interview at the Australian radio this week, the pop star said she was a vocalist for the 2004 Jaguar song Old Habits die hard.
Perry said she had met a veteran rocker, and she said, "He played with me when I was 18. "
She added: "It was a very long time, and it was very good."
In a fourth statement, the representative of 70-year-old Jagger said that he “probably refused that he ever hit Katie Perry”.
The representative added: "It may well be that she is traveling with someone else."
Perry was among the performers who appeared as guests in the Rolling Stones tournament this year.
Her new Prism album was debuting at the first place this week.
George Kerewan: Breaking Europe gives Scottishs a choice
Another day, another fear of independence.
This time, we are warned that independent Scotland will have to join the common European freedom of movement as a condition for membership in the EU.
It takes place in the history of port control in Bervik and the border with a wheelchair near Adrian's village.
True, Strathclyde pointed out the possible economic benefits of the more free movement of the rest of Europe, although it is expected that this has not been reflected in the headlines.
No one has also indicated that EU Member States are spending a lot of time trying to reverse their formal rules as it is convenient for them.
Since Scotland is now not part of the Schengen area, the continuation of non-compliance with the requirements will be a real obstacle to Brussels rather than what it really wants from the Scottish people.
So it's not worth the attention of history.
And this is how it turned into a nightmare: for the first time, I heard the "independence means passport control" at least 40 years ago.
And there's still an interesting moment that's lost when we're talking about the old story.
Why should the independent Scotland comply with Europe's orders?
Why are London's brakes changed to Brussels's brakes, especially now?
This is the news of Europe: the great plan to unite Europe was finally blocked.
The European project is officially dead with a crisis.
Throughout the European Union, parties speaking against the EU or rejecting the euro as a single currency are gaining power.
Even in Germany, the "Alternative for Germany" party, which was only founded this year, has emerged from nowhere and has received nearly five million votes at the September federal elections, thereby putting the Free Democrats (as our Liberal Democrats) out of Budapest.
There has always been an internal opposition to the federal European establishment plan.
Nevertheless, the current economic crisis has become a turning point.
The harsh economic measures introduced by Berlin and the European Central Bank and the obstacles imposed on the national economies by the preservation of the single currency have led many to believe that the European project has gone too far.
The euro crisis had little to do with the fact that national governments were working at excessive budget deficits, which was only fair for Greece.
In fact, the Eurosystem has blocked its members from exchange courses that are useful for German exporters, which German policies and wishes to maintain.
Without the possibility of devaluation of national currency, South Europe is already ineffective in terms of productive opportunities compared with Germany.
The only means of saving is to cut payments and public costs, which are actively supported by Berlin.
The current budgetary and monetary problems are a deeper issue for Europe ' s productive capacities.
As a result of a set of green energy measures introduced by Brussels, a code which means the subsidies of French and German energy companies through the consumer, European industry pays twice as much for electricity and four times for gas as in the United States.
It's parallelizing adverse price conditions as we have seen in Greenland.
No freezes in the world will stop the devastating defeat of the US low-carbon gas over the European oil industry.
As a result, there is a rebellion, especially in France, at one time the largest EU party.
After the war, the French political elite considered the EU a way to control Germany and put Paris at one level with Washington.
But Berlin no longer needs political legitimacy in Paris, and has already committed its own economic policy to Europe, leaving France's economy in a state of poverty.
The result is the right to speak against the EU party Marin Le Pen National Front just won the decisive additional elections by throwing the ruling party of Socialists into third place.
Front is now the most popular party in France with 24 per cent votes — a timely warning to British legislators that it cannot be derived from the assumption that the origin of rights is automatically said for the benefit of the left.
What does Le Pen do with his newly converted popularity among the French white working class?
It would like to use the EU elections next year to create a blockade in the European Parliament against the EU and against the single currency.
If – and this is very likely – EU-led parties will receive support for these elections, such a block will be able to take the dominant position in the European Parliament first.
This is my opinion: rapidly growing attitudes against the EU and against the single currency in Europe are being united in order to destroy the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it will once again become some kind of "European (substantial) nation" that has liked General de Gollu.
Germany and a number of its economies can save the euro, but France and southern Europe will restore their own currency.
I suppose that Britain is distanced from this project, hoping to draw closer to the United States.
However, the growing interest in Washington to the Pacific suggests that Britain is likely to remain unattended in the Atlantic.
What situation does this leave Scotland?
We can choose to become a region (in fact) of England.
Or we can protect our own economic interests, which means, besides, sending Berlin and Brussels to the streets.
I suspect that Scotland will be able to succeed in a more free European agreement, provided we keep our currency.
Cooperation with other countries will be easier in the non-federal European countries.
Otherwise, we should consider the possibility of repeating Norway's experience and maintaining our economic independence.
The Government of Scotland's National Party in Scotland is, of course, the most successful political movement in Europe, aimed at the harsh economic measures that have been taken by the majority of votes in 2011, thanks to the opposition to the cost reductions proposed (and implemented) by the Liberian Chancellor of Alister Darling and subsequent coalition of Towers and Liberal Democrats.
Scotland would now not vote for independence only in order to take action against the harsh economy imposed by Berlin and Brussels.
Early sex education: Early age
Afro-American and Latin American girls usually reach sex ages earlier than their white-haired girls do research.
Physical changes do not mean that sexual harassment is near
There is no evidence that committed hormones or other chemicals
Experts believe that the epidemic of breastfeeding may be one of the early sexual harassment mechanisms
The trend towards early sex is not so expressed in boys
Former correspondent for CNN Pet Ettridge is a journalist who specializes in child health and family matters.
Should a mother be afraid if her daughter begins to form the beginnings of breast-feeding and gives birth to ovarian hair at age 7 or 8?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics this week in Orlando, Florida, Dr. Paul Caplovitz explained that these early physical changes were sufficiently widespread among American girls and were a new rule.
“ I’m spending a lot of time with calming parents, ” said Caplovitz.
The signs of development, such as growth breasts, limbs and muscle hair and body smells, are seen earlier in girls.
But there was only a small room at the age of manarche (first ministry) for the last four decades.
In the United States, the average age is 12.5 years and has declined from 12.75 in 1970.
“After breast development, it takes at least two or three years to menarche,” said Caplovitz, also author of the book Early Sexual Harassment for Girls: how to deal with this widespread problem.
Time is the most accurate check on how sexual harassment will progress.
The discussion is that it is a fact of sexual maturity, but it is considered to be “probably premature” when breast enlargement is accompanied by a sharp increase in growth by 8 years.
In most cases, the process slows down or stops, which is what the pediatrician can closely monitor.
Faster progress could serve as a basis for analysis of endocrinology in order to eliminate serious problems such as nausea or vomiting.
There are procedures to stop early mining and prevent another consequence: premature ageing of bones, which may ultimately lead to slowing growth and low growth in adulthood.
The recommendations for medical or hormonal therapy are based on the age of the child, the level of development, growth rates and emotional growth.
Psychosocial aspects are also important.
The Caplovitator is cautious of drugs, but acknowledges that “sexing can alleviate behavioural problems and the feeling of girls being different from those of the opposite sex”.
Another major problem is understandable: parents simply do not want their young girls to have a ministerial service.
“They are concerned about the risk of pregnancy or even about how they are dealing with hygiene,” Caplovitz said.
“That was a shock, ” recalls one woman whose daughter started her ministry at the age of 10.
Although there were signs and we talked about the ministry, she wasn't emotionally ready.
She came home from school scared and confused because she was the first of her friends.
There are many popular theories about the causes of early sexual harassment.
However, there is no consistent evidence that alcohol-induced hormones in milk or other foodstuffs, chemicals in the environment or sexual messages in the media.
Boys — like girls — have sex before.
The Caplovitator claims that the premise that has the greatest weight is the epidemic of lightning.
In 2001, he helped to conduct a study of girls from 6 to 9 years of age, which linked the number of pregnant women to the age of sex.
Other data confirm this conclusion, but there are many other contributing factors.
In this country, African and Latin American girls usually reach sex older than their white counterparts.
There are various explanations.
Throughout the world, early sex is likely to affect everything: from economic conditions and climate to genes.
The fact is, although boys have hair on their face and on their shoulders are younger, the trend toward full early sex is not as strong as that of girls.
Other doctors attending the AAP conference confirmed the complexity of the topic.
The appearance of facial and facial hair is even among young people and children of age.
“We need to be careful about how we define the real development of sex,” said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, child endocrinologist at Gorieb Children's Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to receive guidance from a pediatrician on how to talk to their child.
“This can mean more early than expected,” Caplovitz explained.
If you keep calm, your child will usually respond well.
Girls who develop early need to confirm that even when this happens earlier, this process is a normal part of life.
A resident of the United States Boeing is preparing for a flight
On Friday, 1 November, at 8:30 p.m., the open-air treaty observers flying over the territory of Russia and operating in the middle of an unplanned landing in Chia American aircraft will leave the city airstrip.
The airport’s management allowed the ship to board, getting the fuel money.
As reported at the airport, the plane will be picked up in Ulan-Ude.
According to other data, he will be sent to the United States.
As reported, a plane flying in Ulan-Udé landed in the Zabakal region because of the tsunami.
Because of unpaid accounts, he was not released from the Chitt airport.
There are 30 persons on board, including the crew, who spent two nights at the airport, reports ITARS.
As reported in the IDF, under the terms of the Open-air Treaty, people on board the aircraft do not have the right to travel beyond the border of China, they can only have border controls at two Russian airports in Cuba and Ulan Ude.
An open-air treaty was signed in 1992, with 34 States participating in it.
Observer flights are carried out over the territories of Russia, the United States of America, Canada, Europe.
The main objectives of the Treaty are to develop transparency, to facilitate the monitoring of arms control agreements, to enhance the ability to prevent and address crises within the framework of the OSCE and other international organizations.

The list also included Marilyn Monroe, John Lennon, and Albert Einstein.
In Moscow the first bottle of Igora Gulaeva opened
On 23 October, the opening of the first flagship shop of Igora Gulaeva in Moscow was held.
Designer Igor Gulaev is known for its great products from the luxury class.
And now they can appreciate even more fashion worshipers - in Moscow his first bottle was finally opened for which the designer and he set up a party in a dolce vita style.
I'm sure the most beautiful girls live in Russia.
That's why I'm especially glad I opened a store in Moscow.
It's not just an office, it's a place where I'm really part of it.
That's what Igore put on a beautiful tape and invited all those who wanted to... imitate the exciting models!
Manufacturers of reactive aircraft are impressed by the width of the seat when there are large orders on the horse
Among the leading aircraft producers, there was a heated dispute over the spread of the travel class seats on the distant voyages, leading to a tonne for a sharp confrontation at the Dubai Aviation Exhibition this month.
There will be a tension around the range of seats provided on the long-term economic-class passenger journeys whose interests are not always at the centre of the attention of airlines, while the amount of space assigned to them plays a key role in the approval of the effectiveness of the latest aircraft proposed by Airbus SAS and Boeing Co.
This week, Airbus called for the introduction of an industrial standard that would provide a seat width of at least 18 inches (46 cm) in the economic class halls, but its main American competitor Boeing said that this should be decided by airlines.
The dispute arises when aircraft manufacturers are confronted with increasingly larger versions of their two-engine long-distance aircraft and potential record orders are expected on 17-21 November.
The composition of the rear part of the aircraft — especially if 9 or 10 persons are in a row — is central to the economic effectiveness of the new Minni-Aerobus projects.
Boeing claims that its updated 777X will accommodate 406 people from more than 17 dinums in the range of 10 in each row.
Airbus said that the competing version of its A350 would transport 350 persons into the economic class on seats of 18 inches per row.
Aeroplane giants are often exchanged on technical issues by means of advertising in professional press.
And now Airbus is headed directly to the public before a plane in Dubai, where 777X is expected to be the leader with more than 100 orders.
She recently demonstrated what could be the beginning of a new advertising war, showing slide financiers depicting three people in a restaurant purchased by each other under the title "Would you like to do this?"
“Boeing offers long-distance flights on seating more expensive than regional turbulence aircraft”, said Airbus John Likhi, a sales manager.
With the change in food rations, people collect weights, but aircraft seats have not changed.
Between the early 1970s, Boeing 747, a broad-based, long-term travel standard, and outside the century, average American men aged 40 to 49 grew by 10 per cent, according to the U.S. Department of Health.
The average American male population of the 21st century is 39.7 per inch, according to the United States Health Service statistics.
Airbus argues that its competitor adheres to the concept of the 1950s seats when the average size of the talent of those who have recently been called the “reactive public”.
Airbus says that a study has been conducted that shows that the additional smoke in the widest seat improves the quality of sleep by 53 per cent.
Boeing disputed the Airbus figures on the size of seats and said that manufacturers should not be involved in the decision on how airlines find a balance between tariffs and facilities.
According to her, studies show that the convenience of the living room depends not only on the width of the seat.
“All in all cases is to provide airlines with the opportunity to do what they think they should do to achieve success,” said consultant Boeing on the Cantons of Kent Craver.
They don't want us to decide what's going to bring them.
They know their work better than anyone else.
The issue for passengers is to increase the area by side, but for suppliers this is increasingly a factor that can affect income.
The dispute is based on orders for aircraft estimated at least $700 billion at Catholic prices in the next decade — enough to change the relationship between US and European exports.
As reported by the Reiter Agency in July, the presence of seats is the result of a conflict between new reactive aircraft.
Both Airbus and Boeing claim a 20 per cent increase in profit per place in their latest two-engine long-distance models compared to the market leader in this segment, 365 Boeing 777-300ER.
The declared characteristics of Boeing are partly based on a comparison of 10 local lines 777X with the original 9 local components of the constructive decision 777.
Gains in individual ownership are reduced compared with the 10 local components currently used.
“The reason Boeing does this is to force more places and make his plane more competitive than our development,” said Kevin Keniston, head of the Airbus passenger comfort department in Europe.
On the other hand, analysts say that rooms with a total of 10 local lines for existing 777 indicate that many passengers prefer a flat plot that can be handy with lower tariffs.
“Sixty-seven tyres would be ideal for passengers, but the reality is that the Airbus proposal is from a commercial point of view because of the threat to the 777 model,” said consultant for the Mary Kirby salon, founder and editor Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing are not setting up a table, but they offer a list of suppliers from which airlines can choose.
Travellers of reactive aircraft are even driving their own wheels to check competitive planning.
Commending the comfort, all manufacturers also offer aircraft with a very flat component for budget airlines and regional flights.
Airbus offers A350 with 10 local lines, but says she hasn't sold it yet.
Recently, Airbus stressed the need for further changes in the living room, offering more space to pass on some of its aircraft.
Without the support of another manufacturer of large modern aircraft, experts say that its call to the new industrial standard is “unless” but may draw attention to the slow sale of model 777X.
A new anti-inhibitin vaccine may interfere with the smoking process
Scientists have developed an anti-nicoctinal vaccine that could disrupt the smoking process of satisfaction.
A single dose of vaccines has been able to protect mice from nicotine addiction for the rest of their lives.
Further tests are needed before human trials begin, which will take several years, but Professor Ronald Crystal of New York's Health College, Will Cornell, said that the first results are encouraging.
“We very much hope that such a vaccine strategy can finally help millions of smokers who have tried to throw away all the methods available on the market today, but have found that their nicotine dependence is strong enough to overcome it with these modern means,” said Professor Cornell.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been developed to carry genetic information for the production of antibiotics.
The virus is selectively infecting cells of paper that then begin to produce a stable flow of antibodies.
Antithelials release any molecules of nicotine into the blood by neutralizing them before they reach their brain, preventing them from getting nicotine-induced.
The tested vaccined mice, which subsequently gave nicotine, continued their normal activity.
And the mice that didn't give the vaccine “were weakened” and this is a sign that nicotine had reached their brains, say researchers.
These experiments are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
Previous tobacco vaccines have failed because they contain antibodies.
In order to maintain high levels of antibodies, schools had to be done so often that they were expensive and not practical.
But the value of the new vaccine will probably be much lower because it turns the cells into the antithelial factory.
Professor Crystal said that if a future human vaccine were to be completely safe, it could be given to children before they would like to try cigarettes that prevent nicotine addiction.
But it's more likely to be used by smokers to smoke.
“They will know that if they start smoking again, they won’t get it because of nicotine vaccine, and it can help them get out of this habit,” he said.
British scientists said the results were interesting, but warned that additional studies were needed.
Olynics: Third rural settlements Sub-Moscow completely docile
Deputy Governor Yuri Olynikov said that almost three thirds of the rural communities in the Moscow area were entirely dominating
The total budget of the region is 187 settlements from 288.
In 2013, 187 settlements from 288 receive allocations from the area budget.
The share of contributions in the income of the 122 rural settlements budget exceeds 50 per cent and 83 per cent are grants.
Under the regional budget, some 25 billion rubles are allocated," Olynikov said.
The Deputy Governor also noted that in only three urban settlements - Mítiš, Odice and Pushkino - the budget revenue is worth more than 1 billion rubles for 2013.
The income of rural settlements in many areas is less than 3 million rubles, "that's not enough."
The cost of holding a local administrative apparatus in 88 housings is over 70 per cent, "but the quality of services is reduced", Olynikov noted.
Earlier he had instructed the heads of municipal education in Submoskoya to consider what housing needs to be built up, a town-based integration or a change in the administration system.
These proposals will be drawn up by the end of January.
The Governor of the Moscow area stated that under the administrative reform in the subregion, it is planned to reduce the number of rural settlements.
Also in the Mojay, Kasherian, Sunny, Colmensian regions, Luberca and Cottnik there is a request for the expansion of municipalities.
This issue was discussed in the cities and regions of the region in November.
President Mozalduma Igor Brençalov also stated that, as a whole, there are about 30 rural settlements in the 12 sub-Saharan region.
This is related to the fact that less than three thirds of 178 rural settlements in the subregion have a “acceptable” financial base and 100 docs.
Diana Arbenina had given up Halloween with her children
Diana Arbenina does not hide what great satisfaction she has received from raising her children.
Despite the fact that Argentina is now giving more time to creation and public activities, it still has the opportunity to drive with Martha and Artem and not only to spend time in their education but also to enjoy it as much as possible.
In the last week, Diana was twice reported to her fellow worshipers on her educational talents.
First, she showed a photograph in Facebook, which shows how she is teaching children to read.
And yesterday she beat the fans and showed me how Artema and Martha arranged for Halloween.
To the metal runs ready! our first halloween" - so she called Diana's photo of her children dressed in holiday costumes.
However, it is unwise because they, like no other Russian boys and girls, are related to this holiday because they were born in America.
Germany introduced "undefined sex" in Europe when registering children
Germany will be the first country in Europe to be allowed to indicate "uncertain" when registering children born of hemafrodite instead of male or female.
The child's parents will have the right to leave the “pol” schedule in the case of an incomplete birth certificate.
Instead of "F" (female gender) or "M" (male gender) parents may write "X" (undefined).
This decision is aimed at not putting parents in a hurry with the "extreme" sex operation.
According to statistics, one of the 2,000 newborns in the world is born with hemafrodite.
Tripodi refuses to be influenced by Obeda
Former Minister of Labour of New South Wales, Joe Tripodi, will be the investigator of the anti-corruption oversight body of the state.
Former Minister of New South Wales, Joe Tripodi, examined changes in the lease of marine facilities at the request of his political instructor, Eddie Obeida, who had a secret share in three state-owned facilities.
The Independent Anti-Corruption Commission (ICAC) expanded its investigation on Friday whether Mr. Obeid had solicited several ministers of the state to extend the rent contract to Serkiyular Ki, where Obeid's family belonged to two restaurants and coffee, without entering the tent after the expiry of their term of office in August 2005.
It is now investigating the allegations that Mr. Tripodi was aware of Mr. Obeida ' s secret involvement in the non-movability facilities, following the evidence given by Mr. Tripodi Linn Espoul, former Deputy Head of Administration on Thursday.
During the several years of discussions in 2005, the Government insisted that the rent be held in open competition.
The lessors were against this, as well as wanted longer periods of rent.
In 2009, the leases of companies at Serkiular Ki, which brought the Obeid family around $2.5 million a year, were extended without an open competition.
Mr. Tripodi, who was Minister of Infrastructure and Transport from February 2006 to November 2009, initially spoke for open competition.
He refused, however, that the changes had been made at the request of Mr. Obeda, who, as Mr. Tripodi acknowledged, urged him to make changes to the Government ' s rental policy.
The ICAC ' s telephone communications were presented in August and September 2007 between Mr. Obeid, Mr. Tripod and Steve Dan, the senior officer who came to the post-office office after work under Mr. Obeida in the Fisheries Division.
“Was there a question that was discussed during these telephone talks about the development of commercial rental policy?” asked Commissioner Anthony Willi Tripodi.
"No," replied Mr. Tripodi.
I can't remember what was discussed, but it definitely wasn't.
It's definitely not between me and Mr. Obed.
According to the senior officer, Israeli military aircraft attack within Syria
The senior administrative officer in Fox News confirmed that Israeli military aircraft had been attacked for the purpose of the Syrian port of Latakia on Thursday night.
The officer didn't explain what it was for, but said at least one.
Assoyed Press reports that the objective was to be the rockets of the Russian production SA-125.
At least two times a year earlier, Israel had carried aircraft on missiles inside Syria.
Foreign workers under sub-class 457 may be tested for “diversity”
The “diversity” test for foreign workers under the 457 class is under consideration by the Government as it intends to increase repression.
This test will, if accepted, be applied to the criteria for preventing the use of Class 457 visas for fill-in or as a haven for family and friends in Australia.
A document submitted by the Government for discussion was published today, while former Liberian MP Maxine Mackyu criticized the Government ' s rhetoric on foreign workers, saying it could be tried by the neighbors of Australia.
“The gross statements of the "foreigners" and "the beginning of the work of Australians" are very unpleasant for the time when trade unions demanded a protected labour market," she said to the Australian-India Institute today.
It has historically meant that it was a white job to protect — and I would not be surprised if some in the region had seen the prints of this historic artifact.
The document presented in the discussion contained 12 measures that had previously been considered by former Minister of Immigration Chris Bowen.
Mr. Brendan O'Connor, who was yesterday in Sri Lanka, where he met with officials on trafficking in persons, had already made five of the recommended changes and the others were at the stage of consideration.
If the criteria of “diversity” are adopted, the visa applicant may be able to examine whether “the applicant is a true candidate under conditions where the candidate is a relative or a close-known owner or person with respect to the financing of the undertaking”.
Businesses may also need to be counted on the number of visa holders in sub-class 457, since earlier companies aimed at sponsoring a small number of workers then took hundreds of jobs.
Meanwhile, 35-year-old Sri Lankan refugee is expected to die from heart failure after arriving on a ship with refugees on the island of Christmas this week.
The nine-year-old son of this man was killed along the way to Australia, and since his father's death in the middle of him has been supported by a twin brother who has also been on board the ship.
The Australian authorities promptly sent a man to the hospital on the island of Christmas where he died.
Seed Varlamova said the hockeyist suffered from alcoholism
A fellow hockeyist Seed Varlamova Evginya Vavirinuk stated that it suffered from alcoholism, which was transferred by the Russian News Service.
"He has no idea how to stop drinking," said the woman, in particular.
We recall that Vavirinuk had been sentenced to a death sentence on the Russian General Semen Varlamov who was also a member of the Colorado Club.
According to her, a hockeyist beat her with his hair and killed her after her hands, breasts, life and face.
Varlamov himself came to the Devere police and admitted to the murder, detailing what had happened.
He was arrested but later released at $5,000.
The court did not restrict sportsmen from moving abroad, but prevented them from approaching Vavirinuk.
He is also threatened with imprisonment for up to 6 years for domestic violence.
The Government of Great Britain announced a study aimed at improving the economic impact of Scotland on the project of the HS2 Railway Master.
The HS2 project is intended to open a high-speed communication with Scotland and northern England, starting in the First Step in 2026
Minister of Transport Baronese Kramer noted that the project "will unite Britain".
The Minister for Transport of Scotland, Kit Brown, said that he was "in the second" from the perspective of working on a plan with the Government of Great Britain.
The first phase will take place in the construction of a new high-speed rail line between London and West Midlands.
When the Second Step is completed, the lines will be placed in Manchester and Lids.
In June, the Government revised the estimated cost of building a high-speed line between London and northern England from £32.7 to £42.6 billion.
The Government of Great Britain, which is negotiating with Transport Scotland, commissioned HS2 Ltd to consider further improvements in the ability to pass by rail and reduce the duration of the journey to North England and Scotland.
This should include the possibility of crossing the road from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London within three hours or less.
Baronese Kramer said: "Our goal on HS2 is to create a national network that makes Britain and its city closer to each other."
We're developing HS2 because the benefits it brings are enormous.
Without it we'll face a crisis of passage capacity in our railway network.
But it is also about the transport of cities together; 18 cities throughout Britain, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, will be better informed by HS2.
Scotland's vice-president Alister Carmicel added: "Today's announcement is good news for Scotland".
On behalf of the Government of Scotland, Kit Brown called on Mr. Carmicla "sometimes" to support the integration of Scotland into the HS2 network.
Mr. Brown said: “The high-speed rail road has all the opportunities to bring great economic benefits to Scotland, but also adds Scotland's economic weight to the general argument on the high-speed rail route throughout the United Kingdom”.
We are therefore pleased to work together with the Government of Great Britain to consider the options for building a high-speed railway in Scotland, creating benefits for all and continuing the Glasgow-Edinburg railway line, which is already planned by the Scottish Government.
I look forward to considering the results of the study with the British ministers next year and the joint decision on the following steps.
Tory is the new hope for nuclear energy?
Governments throughout the world continue to think about how to provide energy needs.
Fueling hydrocarbons (where they are available) has a negative impact on the climate.
Renewable energy sources require large areas for generation.
Atom energya is treated without any other but leaves behind the mass of roads in waste disposal.
Scientists have recently drawn attention to the tower as another radio component of the Mendeleva system.
It meets around the world and, as experts say, its disbursement does not leave the waste that has to be preserved for centuries.
Rules for the use of electronic devices on aircraft in Australia as long as they remain in force
Travelers from Australian airlines will also need to shut down their plans and smartphones during flight and landing, despite measures in the United States to simplify the rules on the equipment.
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration has allowed US carriers to change their procedures so that passengers can read e-books, watch video or play games on their devices during flight and landings, provided they remain in the flight regime.
Passengers may already do this during the main part of the flight, but many express that they do not have access to their e-books during flight and landing.
Australia's carriers considered the decision required by US airlines to carry out a large amount of work in accordance with new requirements, but indicated that they were not planning to change their procedures in the near future.
The Civil Aviation Safety Office also noted that they were considering this statement, but stressed that restrictions on the use of electronic devices in critical phases of flight are still in force in Australia.
“The Administration of Civil Aviation Safety does not currently have special rules governing the use of electronic devices in aircraft”, it stated.
This issue is governed by rules that require air carriers to maintain safety at any time and by passengers to comply with the safety rules notified to them by crew members.
The Virginia company, which had already discussed with the Civil Aviation Safety Authority the expansion of its entertainment system with Wi-Fi, was not opposed to changes, but stated that it would follow the instructions of the regulator.
“We would welcome the Office of Civil Aviation Safety on the issue of allowing electronic devices to be used, because we really think it will improve the quality of customer service now when it (the shipless entertainment system) is on our planes,” said the press secretary.
Qantas stated that the existing rules would be maintained at this time.
“Our current policy is that electronic devices cannot be used during flight and landings, and we are not planning to change them in the near future,” she said.
The FAU regulation is distributed to US airlines.
However, we are always interested in the regular changes that could benefit passengers, and we will, of course, carefully study the FAO decision and the reasons for it.
For US carriers the impact of the decision will vary from the airline to the airline and will depend on the age of their airport.
Transporters should demonstrate that their aircraft are capable of maintaining radios from mobile devices, as well as revising the benefits, training materials, hand-held rules and passenger instructions.
“After the airline will check and confirm the flexibility of its fleet, it may allow passengers to use portable, light electronic equipment such as planes, electronic books and smartphones at any height,” said the FAU.
In rare cases, poor visibility of the crew would give passengers instructions to disable their equipment during landing.
Furthermore, according to the Panel ' s recommendation, more heavy equipment should be located under seats or in upper bulkheads during landing and landing.
Heads of Dagestana are listening to the great Cuban extremist notes
The football match between Anji and Cuba was fought in a political coalition between the authorities of the Krassandar region and Dagestan after the patients took up the Dagestan flag, and the Cuban Games sounded different.
The head of Dagestan Ramasan Abdulatipov invited Republican parliamentarians to call on the court on Thursday, as the game of the Krassandar End is both calling for an international difference, in particular calling for war against "bassurmans".
Take the Game of the Great End, which was adopted in 1995 in our time.
That's the same view, and no one's interested in it.
"Remembering you here as a mother, an enemy, we are going to fight death in the mountains" - why such words are written in a poem, to hurt some believers in other believers," said the solidarity with Abdulatip President of Parliament, Hizri Shishaid.
Putin suffered impunity for his friend Asad
And now, news from the ocean, namely from Syria, where, as we know today, Israel has been hit by the rockets of Russian production, which, according to reports, were designated as "Hezbolle".
Today, Syria has met an important requirement to destroy its production of chemical weapons by 1 November.
This was done within the framework of an agreement reached by Russia and the United States that allowed them not to carry out the military operation they had carried out this year.
More details on weapons and what this means for the Syrian President will be told by our main international correspondent, Richard Engel.
Washington said that the Assada regime would be punished for it.
More than 1,400 peaceful people, including hundreds of children, were killed in August by the gas.
And punishment came.
But it's not like American bombings, it's like a deal set up by an Asada friend Vladimir Putin.
Syria rejects its chemical weapons to mid-year.
And today is an important vessel.
The Group of International Experts reported that Syria had removed the alleged arms production factory from its construction.
A longer and more difficult task is the destruction of tons of chemical weapons and components.
As we understand it, it's about a thousand tons.
Washington earlier said that Asada's days were counted.
I think Assad should go.
The question is not whether it will happen, but when it will happen.
He's not legitimate anymore, and he's got to go.
But Assad remains.
And he feels even more confident.
His army continues to use artillery, rockets and fire.
His opponents were reported and badly armed.
His people had to leave their homes; many were starving.
Some have to eat with leaves and bones.
Many believe that Barar Assad escaped the punishment for mass murder.
The Chemical Weapons Agreement calls for the success of diplomacy, the Inspectors have condemned the Nobel Peace Prize, and Assad itself has produced an impression on the human being ready for cooperation.
Today, the United States Ambassador to Syria in Washington has had to answer questions.
When a child dies from hunger, is his mother much easier than he was killed by chemical weapons?
Assassin's still on.
And he's changing his weapon.
The President of the RF established a separate Ministry of Construction and the JCH
The President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, established a new Ministry of Construction and the CPC and proposed that his ex-governate, Michael Menu, lead him to a personal meeting.
The President met Michael Menem in his residence in Nova Ogarev, and Mena refused to take the lead in the new village.
The press secretary of the President of Russia, Dmitri Peskov, explained that all construction and HCK functions are transferred to a new Ministry from the region.
Michael Menj - son of a well - known Orthodox priest, Alexander Mena, finished the Moscow Institute of Petroleum called Gobkina.
Since 1995, his political career - he has been elected in the Moscow area as a member of the State Dum, the first Vice-President of the Government of the Moscow area, the Deputy Prime Minister of the Government of Moscow.
From 2005 to 16 October 2013, Michael Mene was the governor of the Ivan area.
Shipowners in Singapore are doing well while the middle class is experiencing difficulties
Janani Amirhaling, at Bendemir Trade Center in Singapore, holds a gold necklace, ring and series to pay for her daughter's school education.
"My husband and I just bought a house, so all my money is put there," said Mrs. Amirthaling.
Although she and S$3,000 ($2400) are employed monthly as an administrator and her husband is also working, the monthly income of the family is not enough, she says.
Indeed, the demand in various parts of South-East Asia, where household debt is growing, is that ValueMax, where it is engaged, became the third Lombard registered at the Singapore Foundation.
Loans under the treasury of jewellery are not just a quick way to get money (S$1300 in the case of Ms. Amirthaling), but almost the same amount as unencumbered bank loans.
Singapore’s Lombars typically account for an effective annual percentage rate of 17 per cent — more than 15,4 per cent proposed in the United Overseas Bank, a local creditor with a branch at the same trading center.
However, the Lombars have the advantage that they do not require verification of the credit capacity or proof of payment and may issue credit faster than banks.
As a result, millions of people throughout the region are being forced into poverty, as families feel pressure from rising the cost of living and the rapid increase in household debt and consumer debt.
After five years of sustained growth following the global financial crisis and generous loans under the free monetary and credit policy in developed countries, families with low and medium income are being turned into portfolios to compensate for the decrease in income as their economies slow down.
This week, the Standard & Poor's rating agency indicated an increase in the family credit plate, mainly due to the growth of mortgages, as a risk factor for the credit capacity of Asian banks.
It stated that Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore had the highest domestic debt ratio to the major domestic product in Asia.
Malaysia headed the list from 80 per cent of GDP compared to 60 per cent in 2008.
The economists are also concerned about the high level of consumer debt in Thailand, which has barely emerged from the technical recession this week.
The fourth showed an ongoing decline in exports and consumer demand.
“The fact that people in the middle and lower part of [the income scale] will look for ways to fill their income where they can,” says Song Song Won, economist CIMB, Malaysian bank.
The high prices of gold in the last two years have made it a challenge for people to invest their personal belongings, as they use money for their family decorations.
In Singapore, about 70 per cent of the materials placed in 200 port sites of the city are gold products.
The people say, "The price of gold is good. Let us set up a golden calf and let us get it back in the next month."
In Thailand, the largest shipyard operator in EasyMoney observed an increase in the number of customers using its offices in recent months, up to 20 per cent.
Growth in Lombard Business such as ValueMax, the office operator in Bendemir and 15 others in Singapore, plans to expand not only in neighboring Malaysia where he has four shops but also beyond Asia's borders, says Jay Lee Ching, Executive Director.
The company will finance an increase using 60 per cent of the US$66 million this week in connection with the deployment of shares at the Singapore Foundation Exchange.
While some creditors have raised fire criticisms due to high percentage rates, Ms. Yeah says that the Lombard does not only offer higher rates than other creditors, nor does it increase the debt directly.
“Clients hold items that they already own, and personal asset monitoring does not increase household debt,” she says.
The loan generates a growing public recognition as a means of obtaining short-term and secure funding.
And these are not the only categories of people in a difficult financial situation.
The rich people in Singapore also use the ValueMax offices, with gold rings or Rolex watches, which can give up to 60 per cent of their purchase price.
We see customers from all sectors of society.
“They include individuals who need to make money for short-term commercial projects or investments or small businesses that need to overcome temporary financial difficulties,” said Ms. Yeah.
Sometimes they just need money very quickly.
Today, the number and status of available medical institutions is not important for the population, but the quality of medical assistance.
The implementation of the programme "Modernization of the Tull Health Area 2011-2013 " will allow the reorganization of our city ' s medical facilities to create an optimal structure for the provision of medical assistance to the population, including gynaecologically ill, pregnant and breast-feeding.
Thus, since the merger with the miner, there has been an even greater opportunity to attract senior specialists from the GUZ “NGCB” for consultations with different pathologists, to carry out additional hospital-based investigations.
During the implementation of the modernization programme, the material and technical base of the home has been significantly improved, and modern equipment has appeared in line with world standards.
In those years, around 8 million rubles were allocated to the capital building, 112 units of equipment for 42 million rubles.
The most modern equipment has an intense post for newborns.
The Sell-Siever device is used to collect blood from the surgical wound during surgery and after special treatment to return its red cells to avoid bleeding from foreign blood.
Modern equipment is also equipped with a clinical-laboratory diagnostic office.
In women ' s consultation, an electronic register is in operation, and an electronic card and patient's history is being planned in the near future.
Thanks to the development of telemedicine, it was possible to consult gynaecologically ill, pregnant, breast-feeding and newborns with regional specialists.
Chechnya killed and stole 60 prostitutes in Strasbourg
The Chechens were arrested by the French police for suspecting a series of attacks on prostitution.
The investigation has been ongoing since March of this year.
Some 60 women were appalled for the actions of the convicts.
The gangs reportedly ordered prostitution in one of the Strasbourg hotels and then beat and arrested them.
The head of the gang was 27 years old before Chechny's court student.
"Babaria" Protector David Alaba became the best sportsman in Austria in 2013, reports the official Bundesley website.
In this dispute, he has appointed representatives of winter sports, which are traditionally best in the country.
The second place was where Colonel Marcel Hirsher was hired, and the third was a beach prawn from Gregor Schlerenzauer's trample.
During the past 21 year period, the Austrian Filipino-Nigerian origins helped their team win the League of Championships, Championships and Cuba Germany, as well as the UEFA Summit.
Former wife of Archavian breathing with actor André Chad
An ex-Chief of Pietro's "Zenita" soccer woman, Andrey Archavian Julia Baranovskaya, is taking a vacation with actor Andre Chad.
Julia breathes in Italy in the actress of Anastasia Zavros, her wife, Figurist Sergey Slavnova, and actor Andrey Chadov.
The photos of the Joint Prolongation are published in the Instagram of the Road.
It's not the first joint photo of Andrey and Julia.
On 5 October, the Travel has published a photo on which the pair is on the coast of the Finnish Gulf in Komarovo.
In mid-October, the Zenita Hawbek Andrey Archavin admitted that he lived apart from his wife, Julia.
Remember, Julia Baranovskaya and Andrey Archavin were together with three children in 2003.
It has recently been known that Archavin meets with the ex-model Alice Kazmin.
A new friend of Archavin was married to a top corporate manager.
Rescue package of $325 million for Tasman ' s health
The Federal Government insists that a $325 million rescue package for a weakened Tasman health system will be supplemented by harsh conditions that guarantee that the Government will not lose funds.
The Federal Minister for Health Tanya Plybersek stated that the Society was taking " urgent measures" to prevent the crisis caused by the ageing population of this island state, higher levels of chronic illness and system constraints.
The financing decision for four years was adopted after the Government consulted with independent Tasmani Andrew Wilki.
“The delegation has proposed a package of external rescue measures, which we believe will address specific problems facing the state,” said Mrs. Plierseck today.
The $325 million package includes $31 million for the planning company.
Another 2600 operations, including orthopedic and catalytic removal operations, will help to overcome the delay.
There is also money for clinics who receive patients without prior records in Hobarte and Lonsestone to improve the quality of care after the station, health care training, mental health services and the introduction of personal electronic health cards in local hospitals.
“These investments will lead to the ideas expressed by the doctors on how best to help the Tasman health system,” said Mrs. Plybersek.
The Minister insisted that the Government of Tasmania would work in a strict reporting and accountability regime.
The State will need to support current levels of funding in order to obtain the Society ' s funds and to report on the cost of these additional funds on a monthly basis.
A three-person commission will be established to ensure that the State provides services as effective and effective as possible.
Mr. Wilki said today that $325 million would not be resolved unless they were followed by a real reform that would put Tasmania's health system on a more sustainable basis.
However, he commended the Government for responding to its urgent request for assistance, which he first referred to the Prime Minister in early May.
“I hope that the federal aid package will significantly contribute to the completion of this state’s health system from critical situations,” said Mr. Wilki.
According to the Government, these additional electoral procedures significantly compensate for recent reductions.
However, the federal opposition health representative Peter Datton believes that today's statement is “a decision similar to that of a leopard”.
“The reason we are here is that the Government of the state of Lebosty has grown $430 million from the health system,” he said to ABC TV.
When the Government spends nearly half a billion dollars and the Society invests 300 million, it cannot be assumed that this is good news.
Mr. Datton asked Mrs. Plybersec to ensure that no dollar from the rescue package would be spent on additional bureaucracy.
The e-clarification of Gioom Niklu Romana, Danny Didro, can be admired by the exceptional order and historical details, but it is also more difficult to understand what should be done.
The film, which takes place in France in the 1760 ’ s, tells the dark story of Susanna, a young aristocrat who was sent to the monastery of her family.
When she began to rebel, she experienced extreme cruelty by her neighbor and became the object of erotic fantasies for others.
The film is never released until it is sent or felt — and in this case it is all.
Because of its serious seriousness, behaviour is at the risk of becoming a test of the nature of the officer and for the audience.
Syria destroyed its means of producing chemical weapons, said the observer group
Syria destroyed the main equipment for the production of chemical weapons and explosives, declared in the fourth international observation group, while sharp collisions were being held in the north, not far from one of the facilities where toxic substances were supposed to be stored.
The fourth Syrian activist group also stated that more than 120,000 people had been killed since the beginning of the civil war in the country nearly three years ago.
Declaration of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons was made one day before
at the end of 1 November, established by this Hague-based organization to destroy Damascus or to “incapacitate” all means of the production of chemical weapons and mechanisms to mix chemicals with gas-containing substances and fill them with ammunition.
The conclusion of the initial phase of destruction is an important milestone in an ambitious chart that aims to destroy all the chemical weapons of Damascus by mid-2014.
The destruction of equipment means that Syria can no longer produce new chemical weapons.
Nevertheless, Damascus still needs to start destroying existing weapons and stocks.
The country is estimated to have about 1,000 metric tons of chemicals and weapons, including hot gas and nuclear paralytic gas.
This statement was made during the four-month war in Safira, where, according to experts, there is a chemical weapon production facility, as well as its storage site, which is based in Britain by the Syrian Centre for the Protection of Human Rights.
A group of activists who were following the loss through a network of activists in Syria reported on Thursday that 120,296 people were killed.
Of these, 61,067 were said to be civilians, including 6365 children.
On the part of the Government, the Group stated that 29,954 persons were members of the armed forces of President Barara Asada, 18678 were government fighters and 187 Lebanese fighting men of Hezbollah.
Among the dead, as stated in the statement, there were 2202 military fugitives and about 5375 opposition fighters, many of whom were foreign.
According to the UN assessment of 25 July, 100,000 died in the conflict since March 2011.
Since then, this number has not been updated.
The conflict has affected about 2 million people to flee the country.
Asada's army had fought in Safire for several weeks with rebels, many of whom were associated with al-Qaida groups.
The Centre stated that on Thursday there were victims from both sides but did not provide specific data.
The fighting highlighted the dangers faced by the chemical weapons inspectors raised by the deadlines of their mission to rescue Syria from the toxic arsenal in the outbreak of the ongoing civil war.
The OZHO statement, which works in close cooperation with the United Nations, stated that its team was now “satisfied that it had examined and seen all the critically important production and equipment for mixing/resulting products and equipment declared by Syria”.
She added that “no additional inspection activities are currently planned”.
Earlier this week, the inspectors stated that they had completed their first round of verification, visiting 21 out of 23 sites declared by Damascus.
They were unable to visit two places of security, the inspectors said.
The fourth OZHO stated that both sites had been, according to Syria ' s statement, “damaged and... articles of the chemical weapons programme contained in them were transferred to other sites that were tested”.
It was not possible to find out immediately whether the facility in Safire was one of the two places that the inspectors of the OZHO were unable to visit.
Syria has submitted a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons, which should be approved by the Executive Committee of the WHO next month.
“I welcome the courage and courage you have all shown in carrying out the most difficult mission ever undertaken by this organization,” said the Director-General of the Monitoring Group of Ahmed Uzomji in a comment published by OZHO.
For the past three years, civil war has been facing rebels, mainly Muslims, with the Government of Asada and its security forces, who will be members of its al-Alavites sector, in response to Shiat Islam.
With regard to other events, the director of Rami Abdurhman Centre said there was a strong explosion in the center of the PWO facility in the Syrian coastal province of Latakia.
The cause of the explosion is unknown, he said.
Anger over the punishment of the organizers of the campaign in Bali
The remaining 202 survivors and relatives who died as a result of the bombing in Bali in 2002 reacted angrily to the sentence brought before the court by the last indictees and claimed that Umar Patek should be shot.
The flight, which took nearly 10 years in refugee camps as one of the most researched people in South-East Asia, was sentenced to 20 years of deprivation of liberty for its role in the creation of explosive devices used during the course of the day.
It may be released within 15 years if it is granted conditionally.
The 45-year-old trial was recognized as responsible for mass murder as a result of an attack on two night clubs in the popular tourist area of Kuwait during which 202 people, including 88 Australians, were killed and 10 others were injured.
He was also convicted of a number of other charges related to terrorism, including the wave of church explosions throughout Indonesia in the birth of the year 2000.
The prosecutors needed a life term, although they might insist that a person named "the consignee" should be sentenced to death by the master of the production of explosive devices.
This decision deepened the painful memories of Perth John Cortin's mother, who lost her 39-year-old daughter, Jane and Jenny, in the course of Patek's and his communications nearly ten years ago.
She said that Patek should have been sentenced to death.
“I really think he should follow the steps of other guys.
He must stand before the firing squad, said Mrs. Cortin AAP.
“I have to live every day, knowing that I will no longer have grandchildren and I will not see my daughters.”
The Sari club was destroyed when a massive explosive device was introduced into the parking lot immediately after 11 evenings of 12 October 2002.
Peter Hughes was at Paddy's bar, where a terrorist bombed the rocket that started the explosion 20 seconds earlier.
After this course, he fell into whom he had been killed three times a month, being connected to the life-sustainment system.
Mr. Hughes said that Patek should divide the three other members of the terrorist cell "Jemaa Islama", responsible for blood war, Amrosi, Mukhlas and Imam Samudri, who were executed four years ago.
In fact, this guy deserves the death penalty more than everyone else.
Keep him alive, well, there's no reason to keep him alive.
20 years after he killed 202 people and injured hundreds, that is not so much.
The route is the last of the parties to the case in Bali presented before the court.
He was hiding for nearly ten years, but at the end of January 2011, he was detained in the Pakistan City of Abbottabad, where American troops killed former Al-Qaida capital of Usama Ben Laden less than four months ago.
During the trial, the FBI agent indicated that the findings were evidenced that the road was in Pakistan to meet Ben Laden in an attempt to rebuild contact between terrorist groups in South-East Asia and Al-Qaida.
"He didn't come back," said Mrs. Cortin.
In recent times, he has not regretted how much he has caused others to suffer.
The sentence was issued in advance of the 10th anniversary of the course to be observed later this year in Bali and Australia.
“It will be very late this year,” said Mrs. Cortin.
The path can still appeal to his sentence.
FAO: "Aerial passengers can now use jets on planes (but not on mobile phones)"
Passengers will be able to use their electronic devices throughout the flight to read, work, play games, watch movies and listen to music but not to talk on mobile phones, according to the new guidelines published by the Federal Aviation Administration on Thursday.
But passengers should not expect changes to take place immediately.
As soon as such a change will take place, depending on the airline, FAO administrator Michael Wart said at the press conference.
Air carriers are required to show FAU how their aircraft respond to new guidelines and that they update their training benefits for flight crew members and equipment table rules to comply with new guidelines.
The FAU stated that it had already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of portable electronic devices in aircraft.
Delta and JetBlue were among the airlines that have already submitted plans.
“ Depending on the state of the plan, we could approve the increase in the use of electronic devices very soon,” said the FAO.
Passengers are now obliged to turn off their smartphones, planes and other devices as soon as the airport door closes.
They shall not restart them until they reach the altitude of 10,000 feet and the captain shall not get "good".
Passengers shall be required to disable their equipment again when the aircraft is reduced to land and not included until the aircraft is landed on the ground.
In accordance with the new guidelines, airlines whose aircraft are adequately protected from electronic interference may allow passengers to use these devices during flight, landing and driving, the FAU stated.
Most new aircraft and other aircraft modified so that passengers can use Wi-Fi at large altitudes are expected to meet these criteria.
Laura Glading, President of the Association of Professional Shipowners, welcomed these changes.
“After the new policy has been well implemented (and we are going to work closely with the carrier to achieve it), this will be an inexhaustible option,” said Glading.
We have openly ceased to feel “infuriated by school” when the matter comes to an end.
However, the Internet connection for Serfing, e-mail exchange, text messages or data loading would be prohibited at a level of less than 10,000 feet, the agency reported.
Passengers will be asked to convert their smartphones, planes and other devices into aircraft mode.
Thus, there are still no words with friends, an intellectual internet game where actor Alek Boldwin played his smartphone in 2011, when a shocking case occurred: the actor was taken off the American Airlines aircraft for refusing to turn off the device while the aircraft was on its way out.
And more heavy devices, such as laptops, will still have to be put in the trunk office because they can hurt someone if they fly through the living room.
Cell phones in the field will also continue to be banned.
Regular telephone calls shall be provided by the Federal Commission on Communications, not the FAU.
The FAU may remove the ban on certain electronic devices during landing and landing
Last month, Mark Rosenker of the National Transport Security Council, the CBS News national security expert, stated that hundreds of telephone calls are still considered to be a risk.
“Soft phones are really a problem, not only because they can potentially create slots for navigational devices, but we know from the FCS that they can create slots for more than a hundred connections when the plane is in the air,” Rozenker said.
The Industrial Advisory Committee established by FAO to study this issue recommended that the Government allow for greater use of personal electronic devices last month.
In recent years, pressure on FAO has increased with a view to weakening restrictions on their use.
Critics, such as Senator-Democrat of Missouri, Claire Maccaquil, claim that there are no major security reasons to prohibit them.
The monitoring of restrictions is also becoming increasingly difficult as the application of devices has become universal.
Some studies show that up to three passengers forget or ignore orders to turn off their devices.
The FAU began to limit the use of electronic devices by passengers in 1966 in response to communication messages for navigation and communication equipment when passengers began carrying FM radio receivers, high-tech newspapers at the time.
New aircraft are much more dependent on electrical systems than previous aircraft generation, but they are also being developed and approved by FAU as sustainable for electronic interference.
Air carriers offer passengers the use of Wi-Fi at the creater height for several years.
Aeroplanes modified for the Wi-Fi system are also more sustainable.
The overwhelming majority of liners are adapted for the wider use of electronic devices in accordance with new guidelines, Uert said.
Today's electronic devices usually remove radio signals much less than the previous generation of devices.
E-book reading devices, for example, only remove minimum signals when pages are rescanted.
But the signals become stronger when the devices load or send data.
Among those who were able to reduce restrictions on the use of electronic devices were Amazon.com.
In 2011, the company's representatives loaded the entire airline with their devices to read the book of Kindle and flew on it to check the problem, but did not find them.
The members of the FAO Advisory Committee expressed mixed feelings as to whether the use of any device posed any risk.
Douglas Kidd of the National Aeronautics Association stated that he considered the shifts from devices to real, even if the risk is minimal.
Other members of the Committee said that there were only separate pilot reports confirming that devices could create slots for aviation systems, and most of these communications were very old.
However, the Committee recommended that FAU allow pilots to require passengers to turn off their equipment during flight landings under limited visibility.
The group of representatives of the tourism industry welcomed these changes, calling them a healthy step towards meeting passengers who are now using a number of technological devices.
“We are pleased that FAO recognizes that passenger comfort is not incompatible with security and protection,” said Roger Dou, Director General of the Tourist Association of the United States.
Automobiles can carry out studies on driving rights
Driver rights exams will enable private companies with their own computerized vehicle.
In this regard, the Commersant refers to the draft Government ' s decision on vehicle management.
According to the newspaper, there are now about 30 such automobiles in Russia.
It is expected that students of such “privileged” vehicle will take into account the results of internal testing.
In doing so, the Gosavto inspection will be conducted each year to monitor the performance of the examinations.
If it is found that more than 30 per cent of the exams on theory and more than 20 per cent of the classrooms do not give up for the first time, such a school will be deprived of privileges for the first time.
The technical requirements for motor vehicles contained in the draft government regulation shall enter into force from 5 November 2014.
The project also contains requirements for the training of dual-collar technology.
From 1 January 2015, motorcyclists for category A rights will have to conduct an examination under urban conditions.
Moreover, as of 5 May 2014, companies were unable to engage foreign leaders with foreign rights.
Such workers should be entitled to Russian rights after the examination.
A bird flying by air in a safe place with a bow station in the North Sea is released back into the wild
A bird that had been skimmed by the coast after being found in a standing position on the oil wells in the North Sea was released back into the wild.
This guide was placed on a helicopter sent to Aberdin last month and was then transferred by the Scottish Office of the Society for the Prevention of Cruel Treatment of Animals (SPCA) at the Rescue Centre in Alloa.
The manager of the Colin Seddon Centre said: “This watery pasta is most likely a winter migrant from North Europe who has fallen into a zone of strong winds over the North Sea”.
It seems that the bird was obese and was able to find shelter on the oil roof.
He said, “It was not possible for her to be taken away, so they sought help from us.”
The water was healthy and in good condition until it was released.
Is the European elite ready to do business with England?
The Business for Britain campaign was launched in April with an obligation to collect business representatives and to determine what changes the United Kingdom would like to see in relations with the EU.
To that end, we commissioned the largest and most complete examination of British business leaders, asking them to express their views on Britain, business and the EU.
YouGov interviewed more than 1,000 business leaders, who represented a wide deal of business in Britain by size, sectors and regions.
The conclusions of the survey are unexpected for many.
We have explained that the overwhelming majority of enterprises are currently seeking export opportunities outside Europe, paying particular attention to the countries that are undergoing modernization and growth while the EU countries are still in existence.
They want the Government to give priority to new trade links with countries such as China, India and Brazil, rather than spending time in the long and difficult process of reforming EU institutions.
When asked about their views on specific political issues, from anti-dumping regulations to product laws, most business leaders felt that the control of these key areas of competence should be returned to Westminster.
There was a general dissatisfaction on the single market, with business representatives claiming that the costs of the Brussels regulation are now overprivileged by the benefits of the entry into the trading area of Europe, even 40 per cent of large enterprises, traditionally the most pro-European of all companies.
The last and most obvious is our review of business leaders found that a clear majority would want Britain to conduct a course of treaty change and trade-based relations with the EU rather than politics.
This result, which has been observed among enterprises of all sizes and major business groups, shows that business is focusing on a “significant change” that will return power to Britain.
High rates of treaty change and more favourable conditions for Britain will provide 16 per cent of the vote in order to remain in the EU.
The Prime Minister should have no doubt: this review shows that British business supports its plan to review the conditions of membership of Great Britain in the EU.
It also shows that business expects a review to lead to a significant move in the current balance of force back to Britain.
The best conditions for British business are possible and are becoming increasingly necessary as the eurozone enters into closer economic and financial integration.
The priority should be given to jobs and economic growth in Britain, and as the results of our review show, this means increased focus on trade and fundamental changes in Brussels ' s regulatory activities.
The U.S. Special Service heard a personal phone from the Pope of Rome
The activities of the Vatican are under U.S. intelligence control.
The new documents from Edward Snoudden's collection show that the United States intelligence was listening to all the talks of the former Pope Benedict, and now the Pope of France is well cared for.
His phone began to be heard before he became the head of the Vatican.
The selection process of the new pope was also under observation.
Of what particular importance was the United States.
The special service involved hundreds of telephones of cardinals who were gathered in Rome to elect a regular Pope.
The telephones of the residents were also heard where the condoms lived.
The American spies were listening to all the main defendants on the papal throne to prevent him from appearing undesirable to Washington.
The Panorama newspaper says that "the great ears of the United States" continued to cover the talks before the end of the 12th March.
It is established that the Argentine Archbishop of Bergolio has been appointed in the United States since 2005 as the future Pope of Rome.
The U.S. survey also rejected negotiations on the election of the new President of the Vatican Bank.
The Italian magazine writes that the United States Mission continues to work with a secret group of CRU and ABB operators receiving information on policies and financial flows.
In turn, the Vatican has peacefully declared that it does not care about the American "hearing," even if it does.

Snoobardist for the Olympic Cup took special photos
In the middle of the year, the Bank of Russia issued a memorial note on the city of Sochi, where the Olympic Games will be held in the winter.
The buyer's name is 100 rubles.
But bloggers are already actively harmonizing the memory bank.
Following the presentation of the Olympic Cup on 30 October, they drew attention to the fact that the image of a banker can be found in the photos.
In particular, in the free StockExchange photo warehouse, where this photo was dated 2005.
The same photo is used in a photoshop study published on the Russian site Megaobsor on 18 January 2011.
In addition, it has already been used in the RugGear smartphone advertising.
The Olympic banknote is executed in a sine-deep range.
On one side is a snowboarder flying over Sochi, on the other hand, the type of Olympic Stadium and Jar Birds.
The author of the design note is Paul Bushuev, who won a competition among the students of the St. Petersburg Academy of Arts named Repina.
The presentation noted that a number of types of sport were being considered — a gorilla, a fresco and a tramplin, but as a result, a snowboard was chosen because it was relatively young.
According to the source of the "Inquiry", near the CB, the regulator does not have any public opinion on the wide distribution of the image of the neo-Bordist from the Olympic Bank and are currently studying the situation.
And there's not too much concern about the noise around the Olympic Bank.
Ms. Natalia Nikiforova, director of the press service, said that all the discussions on the beach were ridiculous.
Snoobordist of the banks will return to the right, on photos in the network - on the left, - Nikiforova explained.
A person at the photo session to create a dot was taken from different points, and a final image was chosen, which was characterized by a neo-Bordist.
She also noted that copyright laws were not distributed on the Olympic banknote, as the artist had received wages for work.
According to experts, the discussion around the Olympic Cup is both positive and positive.
The availability of images on the buyer - plus its movement - is considered by NP Executive Director RussBrend, Aleksey Popovicev.
It is difficult to prove the percentage of images in the buyer and in the photobanks, so the demand for intellectual property on this image is unlikely to be met.
The first Olympic banknote appeared in China - to the Olympic game in Beijing in 2008 was released on 10 June.
Russia has decided to support this tradition.
Legal prohibitions imposed less beer for Russians
The Russian beer has a bad mood.
According to them, the consumption of beer in the country will remain at the previous level in the coming year, and that is best.
Although businessmen were much in the way of growth.
The current year is a failure for them: sales fell by 7 per cent.
Or has all of this led to the head of one of the country's largest beer companies, the President of the Council of the Russian brewers Isaac Sheps at the IIIrd Annual Conference of the Institute of Adam Smith on Daily Demands in Russia, which has just ended in Moscow.
It was discussed by the public administration of the market.
From 2008 to 2012, the Russian beer market has already decreased by 18 per cent, as in recent years there has been a significant increase in the regulation of the beer industry in parts of beer production and trade - drinking with low alcoholic beverages - Sheps has told his audience.
No country in the world has such a severe restriction on the beer market, which is not expected to introduce any new and new illegal prohibitions that are based on such a fight against alcohol abuse.
The paper noted that many legislative prohibitions aimed at reducing the level of alcohol abuse did not have a particular impact, but all new initiatives were constantly under way.
More than all beer producers have been affected by the ban on selling alcohol in cheeses since this year.
"We lost 35,000 consumers immediately," said Isaac Sheps.
For the next year, the beer has two forecasts.
Optimistic is the one that Sheps mentioned: the sale of pen drinks remains at the previous level.
Pessimistic is still 2-3 per cent.
In order to maintain their income, businessmen have to leave the classes counted on by the mass consumer in the premium class: beer will become less expensive, but it will stand on the way.
Meanwhile, the radical effects of the decline in sales with a small amount of spirit still remain unrecognizable.
“I observe that the level of alcoholism remains about the same level,” Dr. Alexe Sotnik reported.
True, there has been a rise in the proportion of the sick ones who have been drinking bitter spirits, as well as those who have been “subsisted” to alcoholic beverages of the Yaguara kind, while ten years ago they have been dominated by “drink” alcoholism.
In September, 600 people were fired from Ford's parking lot in Vévologska.
According to the trade unions, all who were released received compensation.
However, the question of reducing production in the region is more acute than the problems of workers.
At the meeting, a member of the District Act, Aleksey Etmanov, said that the Ford company in the University had reduced the number of 600.
It was, he said, in September, that the voluntary release programme, which had been developed together with the trade union of the organization, drew up some 600 people.
The workers who decided to resign themselves were offered “golden parachutes” in the amount of several salaries.
As a result, the overwhelming majority left their jobs on their own.
According to Etmanov, however, such a number of people are all night shifts.
I don't think that's going to be limited.
However, in the next two years, the authorities are not planning to take any programmes to support firms in difficulty,” he explained, adding that when the budget is adopted, the Government does not take into account the stagnation of production in the region and the large reduction of jobs.
The Forde does not review or confirm this information.
We're waiting for the company's response, and as soon as it turns out, we're obliged to publish it.
Discussions on the reduction of workers at Forda in the University of Velvologska have been on for a long time.
For example, the company's plans to release 600 people became known in September.
In the past, the company had said that it would stop the production of cars.
As a result, they called for a demand for Ford cars in Russia.
According to Petrostot, by the end of 2013, industrial production in Lenoblast decreased by 5.4 per cent.
The production of vehicles and equipment decreased by 11.5 per cent.
In the United States, mobile phones can be used during flight and landing
New rules on safe use of mobile devices during flight and landings are approved in the United States, reports BBC.
It is expected that U.S. airlines will allow passengers to use smartphones and planes throughout the trip, and new rules will begin to operate by the end of 2013.
However, Internet access to and e-mail will be prohibited during flights of less than 3 kilometres.
As a result of the danger of inter-shipment between aircraft, hundreds of votes remain under ban.
Thus, air passengers are allowed to read e-books, play games on planets and other agendas, and watch videos during domestic and international flights.
Before the rules are adopted, airlines will be obliged to check the safety of the use of electronic devices during flight.
In addition, airlines must convince US Civil Aviation Administration that they are capable of dealing with the alleged impact of mobile aircraft and aircraft management.
According to the source, for example, the United States may also review existing standards for the use of electronic devices in flights.
For the Russian mob in the United States, a new name was finally adopted - the "British Circle"
This week the list of Russian mafia in America was filled with new names and four companies.
The Ministry of Finance of the United States has introduced three representatives of Russia, two citizens of Uzbekistan and Israeli.
One of the Russians was a famous singer Grigory Lemps, who was suspected of carrying money to members of the group.
However, in the black list of 22 persons in the United States, who are members of the "Brothers' circle" and six associated organizations.
However, many experts doubt the existence of such an organization.
"The Declaration on the 'British Circle ' is more likely to attempt to bring together various criminal groups," said an expert on organized crime and professor at the University of New York, Mark Galeotti.
In his view, the "British Circle" reflects the popular view of "Russian Mafia".
“I have never met anyone in the Russian law enforcement authorities or anywhere else who would have confirmed the existence of such a criminal organization,” he quoted Mr. Galeotti, American Centre for the Study of Corruption and Organized Crime.
Mr. Galeotti agreed with Professor George Mason Liz Shelley, University.
"If they and they are in communication, it is more like a criminal network but not an organization," the Centre for Corruption and Organized Crime says.
In the middle of the past year, Mark Galletty suggested that the "British Circle" was bringing together the most closely related Russian gate into the law of Aslan Usoyan, known as Father Hassan.
The criminal authority was killed in January of this year.
Thus, the activities of Lashi Shushanashvili and Zechariah Kalusov, who completed the 2012 list, were closely linked to Santa Claus, and yet another member of the list, Temuri Mirzoev, came to Father Hassan's family.
However, Mr. Galeotti notes that some individuals are not related to Usujan.
In his view, all of them were closer to common financial and criminal interests, such as drug delivery from Afghanistan.
In the meantime, he scand the area of inclusion in the "Brethral Circle" Grigoria Lepsa - a beloved singer of Russian President Vladimir Putin - attracted the attention of Cremla.
Of course, we are counting on more detailed information from our American partners about why such a decision was taken, said the press secretary of the Head of State Dmitry Peskov.
In any case he (Leps) is a citizen of the RF.
As with the interests of all RF citizens, its interests will be protected.
Head of Gasprom Alexey Miller says the pipeline in Bulgaria is a new gas urea
The construction of the South Stream in Bulgaria is the launch of one of the major energy projects in Europe, said the head of the Gasproma.
“Today there has been a landmark event: the construction of the Bulgarian South Stream pipeline, the largest and most important project in Europe,” said President Aleksey Miller in his statement on Thursday.
This project is a key element of the energy security of the entire European continent.
The South Stream is intended to diversify Russia's export routes through Europe.
The contract dispute between Gaspromo and its partners in Ukraine, in which most of Russia's gas for Europe, raises the risk level for conventional routes, speaks to officials.
Miller stated that direct contact with Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, meant that geopolitical risks associated with transit countries were “always removed”.
Bulgarian consumers will receive the South Stream gas at reduced prices as soon as the entire project begins to work in 2015.
Gasprom stated that construction should begin in other countries along the road to gas pipelines by the end of the year.
The annual project transition capacity of the pipeline consists of 2.2 trillion cubic miles of natural gas.

Two YMCA officers are accused of sexual crimes before charges against Jonathan Lord, as known by the Royal Commission
Two YMCA NSW officers were charged with sexual crimes against children before the 2011 charge against childcare agency staff in Caringbahe, Jonathan Lord, reported to the Royal Commission on Sexual Violence against Children.
However, the Commission ' s introductory statement stated that it had “never dealt with cases of sexual violence against children within its organization”.
The Chief Executive Director, Philip Haira, asked about one case when an employee of YMCA was accused of child pornography crimes and another when an instructor was charged with sexual crimes against children under his supervision in 1991 at YMCA Caringbah Hall.
Mr. Heir said that Mr. Gail Fernes, a lawyer who was helping the Commission, knew about the first case but did not know about the second.
He acknowledged that YMCA also admitted in its opening statement to the Commission that “there were external verifications of YMCA which recognized that YMCA was in the first line to ensure the safety of children”.
The witness commissions report that YMCA was informed that it had received a second of the four possible quality audits carried out by the Department of Education and Communities in August of this year.
Mr. Heir, who entered the YMCA when he was 21 years old, acknowledged that he and the following leadership had allowed him to make a mistake, and had failed to provide clear understanding of the staff of his obligations to report violations of the child ' s security policy.
Earlier this year, Lord was convicted of sexual crimes against 12 boys during his two years of work at YMCA.
He was imprisoned for at least six years.
However, Mr. Heir rejected the assumption that the corporate ethics of YMCA prevented staff from reporting violations of the Lord in the area of children's safety.
The staff showed that they had observed violations, including that Lord was with the children, had personally arrested them, blamed them on their knees, said that he loved one of them and allowed them to play their cell phone.
Daniel Okwell, who was led by Lord, and asked for her protection because she was concerned about her behavior, testified that she found Jackie Barnat, the child care manager of the YMCA office in Caringbah, who was the leader of Lorda, “a very scary and often difficult one”.
The Executive Director said that he did not accept the explanation of staff having been unable to report the situation to his senior managers.
Soon, he said, their friendship with Lord had led them to think that they needed to talk about him.
Mr. Heir said that he had presented his opinion to the New South Wales YMCA Council that the lesson for the organization of Jonathan Lord ' s "Event" was not "related to the provision of information" by staff members, and the Council agreed with him.
Mr. Heir stated that the decision to force staff to sign a confidentiality agreement soon after the charges had been made by the Director-General of YMCA on the care of children by Liam Witley.
He said that this was called for the prevention of a number of evidence, but that was “repressed” and that the decision was badly implemented.
YMCA New South Wales was not safe for children of the organization during its work in 2009-2011, Professor Steven Smolboon of the University of Griffit told the Commission of Experts on Child Growth.
He said that there were “serious problems” in the collection, teaming, instruction, training and monitoring of staff.
The hearings are suspended until 20 December.

Tony Blair said he was taking advantage of the opportunity to return as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, but admitted that the return was a minor one.
The 59-year-old policy has expressed its views on various aspects of domestic policy by late evening in an interview on the fifth year of his post.
Since his resignation in June 2007, after ten years as a leader, Blair has largely avoided discussion of British policies, limiting the majority of its comments on foreign affairs and its role in the fourth round of Middle East peacemakers.
In response to the question whether he would return to the post of Prime Minister, Blair, according to the London Evening Standard, he said: “Yes, of course, but if that happens, so ...”
Major coach Milano Massimiliano Allegri expressed regret at the failure of the 10th round of the Italian Championship with Lacio.
The expert also noted that failure to start has resulted in a series of injuries to leading players.
I'm sorry we couldn't win, 'cause the word Tmw of Allegry.
The team played a good match, creating 3-4 good opportunities.
In the first team, we didn't let Lacio.
In the second novel, I can't say we lost our concentration.
I had to win.
In the past season, we had the task of landing in the League of Champions.
Now we're leaving the graph, but this is due to a series of key football players traumas.
Rammy and Honda?
It's very good games, of course.
But our composition is still good.
Look at Kaka, who's having a high-level meeting.
Contestants in Cardiff knew that the competition would be very high.
But no one was prepared to appear three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.
Not even a schoolboy, but just a few months before his first step, this little boy, with his little Chetland-Schotland Miss Toffi, ran through three rounds to take the main prize, leaving 30 adults behind.
This unique pair — the same growth — received high external assessments, conduct and style at an annual competition held at the Sannibank horse station in Radri near Cardiffa.
In a general view of the background of men and women in excellent shoes, he pulled his hat off his head and was proud to walk around the two-year-old Toffi.
The judges commended Fentona for its relatively recent capacity to deal with evil.
And Toffi received a higher assessment of the external nature and nature.
Fenton struck Toffi on his third day of birth in March last year, and since then he has been dealing with the Shetland pony every day.
His 30-year-old mother, Donna, said: "Fenton and Toffi are a beautiful duette."
They had a lot of opponents, but these two came out with gold cubes and glasses.
It was his second speech with Toffi, and we were all in the second place when he won.
It was thought to be so phenomenal that unknown people on the arena wanted to photograph it.
This man from the village of Nantiglo, who is not far from Ebb-Wilt in South Wales, is walking at his aunt Sharon Howells, who has been exposing the evils for more than 10 years.
Ms. Howells said: “The entire audience was defeated, and all shouted for the approval of the voices and the boys.”
He ran for the sand all along the arena and, although he seemed so short, he did his job well.
Fenton has no idea about animals — he loves evils, tractors, and farms, and he has two chips that he cares about.
The trial, as it began, will soon take part in the "Loshedi" year, and I am sure it will be good.
The representative of this annual horse show said: “Fenton is only three years old, but he knows how to deal with his pony.”
Together they're a great team.
The judges noticed Fenton and Toffi's appearance and how they presented themselves at the show.
They appreciate the harmony of the Pony and the sponsors — Fenton and Toffi — who were the best at the race.
I'm sure Fenton helped his attractive approach, he really looked good in his role.
Public address of the Chinese newspaper “Reorganization is in the hands of reorganization”
The Chinese newspaper, which published its first round of calls for the release of the accused in the reporter ' s file, should be reorganised, reports the press regulator.
An unexpected public statement was made in the newspaper New Express in Guangjuo with the request for the release of journalist Chen Unchjoo.
However, Mr. Chan later admitted on television that he had taken over the recording of false articles on a company with a public share of property.
The New Express should now pass “the process of full bugfixing”, as the regulator reports.
The “error correction” order came from the Government of Guandun in the field of press and publications, radio, film and television.
The preliminary investigation showed that the New Express newspaper Yangcheng Evening News Group published several false reports of Zoomlion's registered bid for September 2012 to August 2013.
“The management of the New Express edition was deoriented,” said the regulator.
He reported that the decision had been taken “to place an administrative claim on Cheng Yunjiu in response to its reporting licence”.
He also “instructed Yangcheng Evening News Group to make a complete correction to the New Express and recommended that it conduct an investigation into the situation of the journalists concerned and immediately change the New Express Guide”.
Mr. Chen wrote several articles for the “New Express” in which he stated financial violations in the company's construction equipment called Zoomlion.
After his arrest, his newspaper published two calls for his release in the first half, stating that he was supporting his journalist activity.
But Mr. Chen then appeared on public television, acknowledging that he had published fake money articles.
“In this case, I have damaged the Zoomlion company, as well as all the news media industry and its ability to earn public trust,” he told CCTV.
I did this mainly because I wanted money and fame.
I realized my fault.
Following Mr. Chenya's confession, the New Express issued an apology on the first floor, stating that the newspaper could not properly verify his report.
Recently, a number of high-level suspects have given television recognition.
Experts say that the practice of selection of recognition in China remains widespread despite recent amendments to laws prohibiting authorities from force anyone to self-negotiate.
The U.S. tunnel discovered — Mexico for drug trafficking equipped with its own railway
One of the most complex tunnels for drug trafficking between the United States and Mexico was found, provided by their own lighting, ventilation and electrical refrigerant systems.
The U.S. authorities described the tunnel as one of the most complex secrets ever discovered.
This tunnel, which consists of nearly six football fields, connects the warehouses up to the city of Tihuan (Mexico) and San Diego (USA).
The area is filled with unmarked stocks that facilitates the hidden cargo of drugs.
Tunnel was closed before any drugs were smuggled through it, as the authorities said.
According to judicial documents, the law enforcement officers confiscated eight and a half tons of marijuana and 327 pounds of cocaine when the tunnel was discovered.
Three men, who, according to law enforcement officers, worked as drivers, were charged with storing marijuana and cocaine for distribution.
In the case of sentences, they are threatened with imprisonment from 10 years to a life-threatening deprivation of liberty.
In Nogales, Arizona, anti-bandists use large underground drains.
Tunnel is an eight-year walk discovered in San Diego since 2006.
A number of major tunnels were discovered in Central Mexico after the harvest of rice marijuana in October, which placed a difficult task for drug users to deliver their products to consumers.
In 2010, the authorities found a long passage of some 700 yards along the railway routes from one of the houses in Taiwan to two warehouses in San Diego.
In Belarus, pensions have increased since November
In Belarus since November of this year, pensions have been increased and the BELTA correspondent has been informed of the main management of the Ministry of Labour and Social Protection pension.
Since 1 November of this year, the average wage adjustment for workers in the Republic applied in the previous pension rebate will be made with an increase of 5.4 per cent and the corresponding recalculation of pensions will be carried out in accordance with Decree No. 478 of 21 October 2013.
As a result of the November recalculation of employment pensions, an average of 5.3 per cent is estimated to be higher.
The average age pension is Br2 million, 295 000.
The increase in pensions amounts to 2.4 million people in the Republic.
The social protection fund of the Ministry of Labour and Social Protection of Belarus for pensions has increased to Br274.3 billion per month since November.
At the same time, in November of this year, minimum and social pensions, supplements, increases and pensions will be recalculated as a result of an increase in the budget of the living minimum in the middle of the population.
BPM for the period from 1 November 2013 to 31 January 2014 was approved by the Government by Br1 million to 2.1 per cent above the period from 1 August to 31 October.
As of 1 November, 2.1 per cent of minimum employment pensions, social pensions and benefits, increases and double pensions will be increased.
In Belarus, more Br53-0 dollars were paid for pensions due to increases in 2013-
The British police are giving Assassin a notice of extradition
The British police today issued a notice of the expulsion of Founder WikiLeaks Julian Assanja, who was detained in Ecuador's London mission and asked for asylum.
In Scotland-Yarde, they had given Australia 40 years ' time "official requirement to surrender" with a request to appear in the police station, adding that if he did not meet that requirement, he would still be arrested.
Assanju threatened to extradite Sweden for sexual offences after he had exhausted his opportunity under British law when the Supreme Court dismissed his appeal for extradition earlier this month.
Fearing that Stockholm would transfer it to the United States, on 19 June it had fled to Ecuador, London, asking this South American country for political asylum.
Scotland Yard “has issued an official requirement for a 40-year-old man to arrive at the police station every day and time after our election,” the press secretary reported.
It continues to violate the conditions of release under the pretext.
The mission refused to comment on the action of the police.
Assassin is afraid that he will be expelled from Sweden to the United States in order to file possible accusations of spying after the publication of more than 250,000 American diplomatic spies on the anti-secretary Web site WikiLeaks.
A driver running at a speed of 130 miles during a hot drink between his legs, injured at £1000
The driver was fired at £1,000 for driving speeds up to 130 miles per hour (210 km/h) with a hot drink held between the legs.
35-year-old Andrew Houi from Tiptre, Essex, was noted for his role as Mercedes Benz on the A120th floor in Breintra on 27 May.
When the police stopped him, they discovered a drink to bring him between his feet.
In the world court, Colchester Houi acknowledged the charge of conduct without due consideration and attention.
Addition to his driving licence resulted in a six-month ban on driving.
Houi also had to pay costs of £90 and an additional collection to help victims of crime at £100.
Tax for foreign real estate owners will result in London's collapse
Qualifications had been carried out with a preliminary assessment of the capital increase tax measure, but expected a final decision by Mr. Osborne, who, in 2012 budgeted 7 per cent of the government's sales to households at the cost of more than £2 million and annual payments to buyers who decided to own households in partnership rather than as natural persons.
At the present time, the housing estate in Westminster, Kensington and Chelsea regions, comprising 708 million pounds in 2012/13 for the financial year, already exceeds the total amount of Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, the North-East, North-West, Yorkshire and Hamburg together.
Mr. Kuk stated: “After the increase in the household allowance and the introduction of the legislation relating to removal, it was very difficult to establish that the tax on property tax was reduced regardless of the impact of the old municipal tax system”.
“But this can lead to the fact that some foreign investors will not be willing to buy real estate in London or its current owners will not want to sell it,” he added.
The value of first-class mobility — the top 5-10 % of the priced housing market — in the rich south-west corner of London, which extends from Fulham to Wimblon, increased by 11.8 % in the previous year.
According to Savills, prices in central London continued to show a sustainable growth of 5.6 per cent per year in the calculation, but they ended up actively developing a “productive market” with a high price in the south-west, north (7.4 per cent) and east (6.5 per cent) of the city.
Scientists have come to light on how the movements of dogs are related to their formation.
Early studies have shown that sufficient dogs are driven to the right side (from the dog's perspective) while mixed dogs are mostly to the left.
But now scientists say that other representatives of the dog family may notice and respond to these sharp differences.
Professor George Wallortgara, neurobiologist from Trent University, says: “It is well known that people on the left and right of the brain are more likely to participate in the formation of constructors who cause positive or negative emotions. ”
Here we were trying to look at this and other kinds of things.
He added that just as a human has the right part of the brain, the dog controls the left side of the body and the back, and two halfs play different roles in emotions.
To learn more about how dogs react to the various effects of other dogs, researchers observed animals watching films about other dogs.
They measured the rate of animal cardiac arrest and analysed their behavior.
We'll probably soon figure out why their wings sometimes go one way and sometimes they go another way.
Professor Vallortgara said: "We showed dogs a video of dogs, either naturalistic versions or silhouettes to escape any other evidence, and we could manipulate the movement of the tail and send the tail to the left or right."
When the animals saw that in the rest of the non-expressive dog movement (from the point of view of the emerging dog) they were completely weakened.
But when they noticed that the whale had fallen to the left (again from the point of view of the kitten of the dog), their hearts began to tremble and they looked confused.
Professor Vallortgar said he didn't think dogs were deliberately interfering with each other through these movements.
In fact, he believes that dogs have learned from their experience what moves they should worry about and what not.
He notes: “If there are several meetings with other dogs and often their stiffness is related to more friendly behavior and the right party is less friendly, the dog responds to this experience.”
Researchers say that these results can give owners, veterinarians and printers a deeper understanding of their animal emotions.
The expert on dog behavior, John Bradshaw, invited by a scientist at the University of Bristol Medical School, said that this was not the first study to check whether the dog was relevant to the left and right sides.
Last year a group of university students found out that dogs were turning their heads left if they looked at an aggressive dog and right when they looked at a good dog.
In another research work at Victoria University in Canada, he reported: “The dogs were more likely to approach the dog when its neck was turned left rather than right rather than to become confused, the opposite of the Italian study. ”
He said that differences could be due to the fact that dogs in different studies did not fully understand animals in films or rocket dogs as dogs.
It could be useful to study how dogs respond to these dogs, he explained.
“While there is sufficient evidence for different dairy populations that two brains are used for different purposes, many details still need to be explained, and dogs are not excluded,” he said.
However, given the ease with which their behavior can be registered, we will likely soon understand why they are sometimes sent on one side and sometimes on the other.
Arctic Monkeys is a concert in Glazgo because of Alex Turner's disease
The Arctic Monkeys rock group stopped a concert in Glasgow after her vocalist was diagnosed with laryngitis.
This group was to be held at the Hydro concert site on Friday.
However, the disease caused by vealist Alex Turner to transfer them to the show.

Pope Francis names the first cardinals in February
Pope Francis takes the lead in the dream of the new cardinals of the Catholic Church for the first time during his service on 22 February, as declared in the fourth Vatican.
Cardinals are the highest authority in the Catholic Church after the pope, and they choose the pope, so that Francis will appoint his first group of people who will eventually take part in the election of his successor.
There are currently 201 cardinals.
However, after reaching the age of 80, he could no longer participate in the papal elections, which was a pre-warning group of 120 "cardinal electors".
In proclaiming this news, the press secretary of the Vatican Father Federico Lombardi said that before the funeral, a collection of all the current cardinals known as constoria would be held.
“The Pope Francis has decided to report earlier on his decision to convene a Consistency in February to facilitate the planning of other meetings with the participation of cardinals from various parts of the world,” Lombardi said.
Jack Valero from the Catholic Voting Organization said that by February the number of electoral candidates would probably fall.
He said that the pope would normally call as many cardinals as necessary to bring the number of electoral candidates back to 120, as well as the number of cardinals over 80 years of age as he would like.
The Consortium will be of great importance next year because it will be the first since the election of France in March of this year, according to Valero.
At this point, there is a kind of prejudice for Europe and for Italy in particular.
“It will be interesting to see whether a new cardinal from other regions of the world will be appointed to restore balance,” he noted.
In South America, there are 40 per cent of Catholics, but they are represented by the number of cardinals.
These will also be the first selected cardinals since the formation of the French Council of cardinals, a group of eight cardinals from all over the world, who are commissioned to look for ways to reform the church.
In the past, the pope decided everything by himself.
"Now Francis chose eight cardinals to help him," said Valero.
He said that "if possible" that France would be referred to cardinals after the Council.
But we have not been in such a situation before — all of this is for us first.
Valero said that the popes usually took the office of the cardinal of the bishops from large revenues, but Francesc said “a lot of surprises – so we don’t know what he will be called”.
GM calls for a number of new pickups in the United States to prepare seats
General Motors Co calls for nearly 19,000 new Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra models in 2014 to address problems with manual control of seat restraints, as reported on Friday by the United States governing bodies in the field of transport safety.
In some of the peaks, front seats may have a defect in the spinal cord mechanism.
As a result, the seat back does not meet the federal safety standards of car transport by contractors.
“When a vehicle hits the back, the headmaster may not adequately protect drivers and passengers by increasing the risk of getting trauma,” says the National Road Safety Administration website.
The models were prepared for the period from 1 August to 10 September.
The release of GM peaks began in June and was the most important start of the car in series for the leading American car manufacturer since its restructuring due to bankruptcy in 2009.
GM informed the owners of the failure in the first half of October.
The National Road Safety Administration was unable to review the notification to the owners regarding the 16-day termination of the Government ' s work, which reduced the sales of cars in October.
The sales of Silverado and Sierra pics, which were updated for the 2014 model series, increased by about 20 per cent during the first 10 months of the year, as told by GM on Friday.
In October GM sold 42,660 Silverado peaks and 16,503 Sierra peaks.
GM operations at the New York Foundation Exchange on Friday increased by 1.4 per cent to $37.47.
Cricket of Obama's electoral desirability
I voted in favour of President Obama twice, sharing my hope of a change
He said that Obama had allowed the Republican disstructionism to make no effort to praise the Republicans.
Obstructionism cannot serve as a justification for problems with the web site reformed by the U.S.
The 2008 Obama campaign was a memorable reminder that it could be
Nathaniel P. Morris is a student of the second course of the Harvard University Medical College.
I'm reading a really good book these days.
I thought this book would inspire me during my second course at the medical college and give me a feeling of hope.
It is called "Deerness for Victory", and it is a reminder of the 2008 presidential campaign of Barak Obama.
When I finish writing about my patients at night and lie in bed, this book brings me back when millions of people were inspired by politics, and statements could catch the spirit.
The victory in the elections has been overwhelming, and the leading news programmes have been slowing down for this historic moment.
My classmates cried out with joy, and my parents watched all the newspapers they could find.
A young strategy team had to come to the White House, and the people were ready to change.
During Obama ' s entry into office in 2008, its support level was 82 per cent.
Then I'm closing the book.
The return is a grave warning as to how to escape from a dream.
It is hard to remember those days of optimism — they are said to be a long memory, a painful reminder of lost opportunities.
Over the years since I left my first ballot card, changes have really happened.
It was because I couldn't even imagine myself.
I commend Obama for his great and varied achievements, from the adoption of the law on access to medical assistance to the withdrawal of our soldiers from Iraq, the repeal of the rule “Do not ask, don’t speak”, of the murder of Usama Ben Laden.
Moreover, I believe that party obstructionism has blocked too many attempts to move our country forward: immigration reform, the possibility of public health and the closure of a base in Guantánamo among others.
But after a number of times when I was on the side of Obama's administration, protecting her from colleagues and witnesses, I ended up with the explanations I could give.
I've reached a point of political despair.
Obstructionism of the Republicans cannot justify permission to listen to foreign leaders or impose attacks on innocent children in other countries.
It cannot explain the collection of data on the private life of Americans by the National Security Agency or the persecution of publishers who reveal the wrong actions of the Government.
It cannot explain the killing of American citizen Anvar al-Avoï without trial and the investigation or failure to comply with the limits of public funding and expenditure during presidential campaigns.
It cannot justify the conclusions of the report, which states that the White House efforts to keep the media silent are “the only aggressive... since the time of the administration of Nixon”.
And he has not recently been able to justify that it is not possible to develop a simple website within more than three years of the signing of the Medical Aid Act.
I don't know if that's what I should have expected.
Should I have been 18 years old to realize that the leadership can be opposed to the political campaigns that are ahead of it?
It is clear that work at the electoral office is not a predictable programme of action, as our public dialogue will form an opposition political party and events such as the overthrow of Newton.
However, in all the examples I have listed above, it is evident that they have been a significant choice of administration.
And that's what worries me most.
I voted for Obama again in 2012, but not because I was a pool of enthusiasm for his candidate.
Mitt Romani was an inconceivable and poor alternative, saying that he was unable to make a decision on his own policy or opinion.
I believed that, in my second term, Obama, freed from the pressure of future elections, was justified by the hope we had heard for such a long time.
However, when Obama's rating dropped by less than 45 per cent this week, it was much more difficult to return through the book in 2008.
This makes me look forward to many promises that have failed.
This week I read the part of the book that describes how Clinton gave Obama a final victory at the first elections in Pennsylvania.
At the meeting on the reasons for failure, he told his staff that they should return to the normal routine and remain faithful to their purpose.
"I want us to return our attraction," he said.
“We must remember who we are.”
Five years ago, Mr. President, and I fully agree with you.
The comments made in this commentary are exclusively made by Nathaniel Morris.
Klew Palmer claims that Tony Ebbota has a conflict of interest in childcare leave.
MP Kleev Palmer says that Prime Minister Tony Ebbota has a conflict of interest in childcare leave because his daughters can take it and draw it out.
This mining engine, with an unregulated charge of carbon emissions of $6 million, made this statement when he tried to get rid of the issue of whether he had a conflict.
The Palmer Joint Party may control up to four votes in the Senate, which may be of critical importance in the decision on the abolition of carbon monoxide taxes and mining activities.
But Mr. Palmer claimed that the conflict of interests could only be with ministers, and said that Mr. Ebbota's daughters would be personally exposed to political action.
“He has a major conflict of interests when it comes to childcare leave, because if any of these girls are arrested, they will be directly interested in whether or not they will receive it,” said Mr. Palmer.
Two months after the elections, the Electoral Commission officially announced Mr. Palmer's victory in the battle against the Sanchain-Cost electoral district of Fairfax with 53 votes in favour after the vote.
Mr. Palmer called for a revision of the voting procedure to speed up the process.
The daughters of Tony Ebbot Francis and Bridget.
Should the decision on these elections be taken two months after we voted?
“ We need a better system, ” he said.
Why should we not have such a system so that we can come in, put our data into the computer, vote immediately and get results at 18:30 that same night?
Mr. Palmer also criticised the use of a note mark in the booklets.
That's because they can keep the results if he doesn't like anyone?
Using a carandex in our time seems strange.
The Electoral Commission is studying the possibilities for electronic voting and has recently published a joint discussion paper with New Zealand.
59th-year-old Mr. Palmer said that his programme included an international airport for Sanchain-Cost and would be “very serious” about his new work.
The State post is intended for the service of the public.
“We do not receive any reward except from history, because we can serve this area at critical times,” he said.
RBS removes two currencies
The Royal Bank of Scotland temporarily withdrew from the work of two contractors in its Monetary Operations Unit, according to information from two persons identified in the situation, which is another confirmation that the global check by the regulators of the supposed cash manipulations on the market is strictly commercial.
Some of the world's largest banks, including BB, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, have confirmed that they are working with regulators in the world's largest financial market, the daily turnover of $5.3 trillion.
These two will be the first RBS staff removed during the development investigation, which is due to a scandal related to the interbank manipulation of the LIBOR.
By refusing to comment on the removal, the Bank confirmed that this month it had received requests for information from regulatory authorities.
“Our ongoing investigation of this issue continues, and we are fully cooperating with the FCA and our other regulators,” reported to the bank two weeks ago.
Last month, the informed persons said that RBS had transmitted e-mails and e-mails that had been received and sent by his former contractor to the United Kingdom Financial Control Office (FCA).
This trader, Richard Asher, resigned from the RBS in 2010, and, as he is known, was granted permission to his current position as the European Coal and Steel Trade Manager at JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, the European trade leader in Citi, was released this week, while Matt Gardiner, the former monetary trader in Barclays and BB, was removed from the work of the Standard Chartered bank this week.
None of these contractors were charged with any violations.
Mr. Asher ' s Contact Group included bankers from Barclays and Citigroup, as reported.
The Bank of BB reported this week that it had taken action against some of its staff after Swiss regulator Finma said it was investigating the expected manipulations on the currency market in a number of Swiss banks.
At least six governing bodies in the world — the European Commission, Finland, the Anti-Fraud Body of Switzerland Weko, the FCA, the Ministry of Justice of the United States and the Hong Kong Monetary Office — consider claims that banks have entered into a currency-based agreement.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse also initiated internal checks or received requests for information from regulatory bodies that were known to the situation of persons.
Banks are looking at forged communications and e-mails for several years in search of offences.
In recent years, the audits have increased the number of contractors who have been one of the largest sources of income from investment firms, which in this year, have faced difficulties because low currency volatility has reduced the opportunities for buyers.
Some banks have tried to minimize the seriousness of the situation by saying that a large and high-cost currency market cannot be manipulated, but older traders say that this is not always true.
According to the senior trader, despite the large number of daily trades on the currency market, the fragmentation of liquidity between different trading platforms and the wider use of their internal platforms by banks means that “they can begin to influence the market at a very low price”.
The news came on the same day when the Bank of Credit Suisse announced that it had dropped one of its trades dealers from the London Stock Exchange this week after it had caused a loss of nearly $6 million at the end of last year.
The Bank immediately notified the relevant bodies and cooperated with its regulators.
“We are convinced that the trader has been acting alone and that this issue has been located,” said Credit Suisse.
The Supreme Court upheld Obama ' s health law
The Supreme Court of the United States has today decided that the Barack Obama Health Code is constitutional, which is a major success for Obama administration.
By voting 5 against 4, the judges decided that separate provisions under the Patient Protection Act and available health care that required citizens to obtain medical insurance by 2014 or to pay taxes were constitutional in accordance with the powers of the tax Government.
The President of the Supreme Court, John Roberts, joined four more liberal members of the court, while judges Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy opposed.
The Court also left the remaining sections of this 2700-page law and decided that the requirement of the health law to improve compliance with the requirements of the Medicaid programme or that they lose all federal funding of the Medicaid programme is not institutionally compulsory.
The bill was sought to block 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Business.
The Act was firmly against each of the main Republican candidates in the presidential elections during the 2012 pre-election season, including the proposed candidate Mitt Romni.
Football — Why the Difference?
In the House of Lords, under the Open-Tribunal Policy and Experts on how to maintain national peace in Russia.
Among the proposals was this: to ban football in North Caucasus because of this game is one scandal and divorce.
Specialist Sergey Narishkin recalled recent events in Beirut and said that to reduce the "pressure rate in society" policy and media should be correct in terms of statements.
He probably had in mind a recent scandal with Vladimir Girinowski, who in one of his telegrams threatened to surround Cavca with a wheelchair if they didn't want to limit birth...
All speakers also spoke of measures to regulate migration from the countries of the GNP and of measures to harmonise relations between the peoples of Russia, which contributed to the discussion of the embargo.
Maxim Grigoreev said that the events in Beirut were "the model conflict that could have been predicted", but "we have too many people and institutions" and there are seven blind children.
The concept of multiculturalism, which has long been practiced by Europe against migrants, seems to the public, has failed and must seek its way.
Historian Yuri Peterov put great hope in a new single historian.
"The culture of the country's peoples' history still needs to be supported so that students in Tatarstan know that people live in and on the contrary," he said.
Ghennadi Züganov proposed that criminal responsibility be placed for "the call to Russia" "If you say on the radio that you have to send Alaska to Russia, you will be arrested and sentenced to 20 years in prison!"
Vladimir Girinowski has been trying very hard not to survive.
As usual, he accused journalists who were causing painful and serious national problems to public debate: “Is there anything that can be said about the boredom in the dust?”
The leader of the "One Russia" group, Vladimir Vasiliev, advised journalists to conclude a "charity" and agree to hold discussions on this subject carefully, and then these same obligations could be taken into account by themselves and policies.
We have adopted about 30 laws governing migration, and the order is generally established, said Mr. Vasiliev.
As an example, he introduced a law requiring regional and municipal authorities to take responsibility for international peace in their territory.
But Ludmila Andričenko did not separate the east from the law: it does not have a “counterfeit representations of the adaptation of migrants, its mechanisms and borders.
Thus, subjects would be treated differently.
At the same time, municipalities do not have the funds needed to deal with such complex issues, but the methodology they could use does not give them the centre...
The head of the thought-making Committee on Nationalities, Gadjimet Safaraliev, proposed the establishment of a special forum called the Ministry of National Security, which would deal with national policy issues.
But Valerie Tishkov, who was headed by a similar village, later released, spoke against.
It is sufficient to have at the federal level a special human, "Minister without a portfolio" to which it could be called, if any.
"We are on our way to the country, and we are going to face a number of challenges, it is very important for representatives of various ethnic and religious groups to speak against provocations together, and this work should be given valuable information support," said the representative of the RPC on relations with the University of Chaplin.
No State ' s neutrality over dangerous ideology, including religious ideology, should, in his view, be excluded.
Oleg Nilov here gave the debate in an unexpected fashion: "More talented people than Chechnya or Tajikistan are still looking for, but they don't understand them on the way, not on that road," he said.
"Not that way" is the development of football: "It's a football player who beats the whole crowd, it's a jigsaw bird, it's a rock fellow, it's a rock fellow.
Maybe we don't need that football?
There's another kind of sport - regby is called...
"They will not be equal in the world in this kind of sport," said the Voice.
There's no one playing in the Caucasus's reggae.
You're still kerling them!
We need to know the national features, it's all the same as the "Protection" thing to offer...
In Yaroslavle, representatives of the Musko club were distinguished by good conduct on the tribunals during the local club.
The football has to be banned all over the country...
The head of the RFS Disciplinary Committee, Arthur Grigorianz, reported that Cuban was sentenced to 500 thousand rubles by Philipp Papenkov from the Home Football Correspondence.
Such sanctions for the beauty club are applied for the support of the Dagestan flag by patients at the tribunal during the 14th round of the anti-Anji round.
At the meetings were representatives of both clubs, a man from the RFPL.
We studied all the materials available.
For the wrong conduct of Cubans, 500 thousand rubles were executed.
Against Google, Samsung, Huawei patented Nortel
The group of thousands of former Nortel patents has submitted a full fourth series of patent claims against mobile phone manufacturers, including Google, which it has passed on to Nortel's banknote auction.
The Rockstar Consortium, which bought $4.5 billion Nortel patents, filed claims for violations of patent rights in the U.S. District Court in Texas against Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei and four other companies.
Rockstar is owned jointly by Apple, Microsoft, Blackberry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is accused of violating seven patents.
These patents include technologies that help to compare the Internet search keywords with their respective advertising, which is the basis for Google's search business.
The representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar were unavailable and did not comment.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC are preparing mobile phones operating on the Android operating system from Google, which is closely competing with Apple and Microsoft mobile products.
In 2011, Google offered Nortel's patents the original price of $900 million.
Google has increased the proposed price several times, finally offering a total of $4.4 billion.
Having lost the case of the Nortel Consortium Rockstar patents, Google has acquired Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, and in this case it was part of the Motorola patent library.
“In spite of the failed attempt to obtain patents that are the subject of demand, Google has violated and continues to violate them,” says the court.
Rockstar calls for an increase in Google's losses, as it claims that the violation of Google's patent rights is deliberate, as required.
In Egypt, the first freely elected President takes an oath
Muhammad Mursey has taken an oath, but his protest day will hardly be the end of the political struggle in Egypt.
Islamist Muhammed Mursi promised "new Egypt," when he made an oath, he became the first freely elected president of the country, replaceing Hosni Mubarak, who was confused 16 months ago.
At its inauguration before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Mursi also became the first freely elected Islamic President of the Arab world and the fifth head of the State in Egypt some 60 years after the monarchy was brought to power.
He has taken an oath before 18 judges in black Mants in the building of a court on the banks of the Nile, built in the style of the ancient Egyptian temple.
“We are looking forward to a better future, a new Egypt and a second republic,” Murcy said at a funeral ceremony that was shown on public television.
“The people of Egypt today laid the foundation for a new life — absolute freedom, true democracy and stability,” said Mursey, 60-year-old engineer with American education from the “Brothers Muslim”, a fundamentalist group whose most of its 84 years of existence was a banned organization serving as a mouse for the cruel acts of other Governments.
The building was protected by hundreds of soldiers and police, when Mursey arrived with a small fence shortly after 11 a.m. after the local time.
Only a few hundred of the parties were gathered at the court building to welcome the new President, and, unlike the presidential bombing of Mubarak, the movement was stopped for only a short time in order to pass his autocolonial on the usual live road that unites the city's center with the southern suburbs.
While Mursi laughed as a non-aristic “Secretary” Brothers, his personal prestige grew rapidly from his victory and his fifth speech, in which he tried to present himself as a candidate not only to Islamists but to all those who wanted to bring to the end the 2011 rebellion against the authoritarian Mubarak.
“Today Egypt is a civil, national, constitutional and modern State,” said Mursey, who wore blue business costumes with red gloves, judges in general wooden panels, where he had taken an oath.
Later, Murcy went to Cairo University, where he had to do his inaugural thing.
He was given an official reception with an army orchestra performed by the state gym during which he stood “silent”.
A military agent, Field Marshal Hussein Tantavi, was present.
His visit was attended by the “Armiya and the People — One Hand, ” which had been recorded by hundreds of people gathered in the principal lecture hall of the university.
Founded in 1908 as a World Education Prize, the Cairo University in 1970 became the platform for Islamic student groups.
Murcy took a symbolic oath on Friday at Tahrir Square, where a revolt was brought to an end by the authoritarian regime of Mubarak last year, and promised to return the authority of the President whose office was lost by the military council taking action by the alleged leader.
But by agreeing to take an official oath before the court, rather than before Parliament, it fulfils the will of the military, and this is a sign that the struggle for power will continue.
The word Murzy on Tahrir Square was filled with the theatre populist atrocities.
A regular meeting of the Association of Tumen Engineers was held on the basis of the Jalutorov Automobile Station.
As part of the event, a new line was introduced for the production of steel electric tubes.
As the business director of Denis Gribanov said, a marketing study on the market for solid construction was conducted in 2011 by a new owner.
It has been found that the region consumes over 50,000 tons of electric power pipes per month.
Thereafter, a decision was taken to modify the profile of the factory and to install equipment for its production.
This year more than 7,000 tons of the product produced have been downloaded.
Over 120 million ruble investments in the plant were reported by Dennis Gribanov.
In October a new state was launched, which allowed an increase in assortment.
The factory is made up of small tubes, which are used for high-quality industries, small forms of construction and furniture, as well as large - for the construction industry.
We plan to produce 50 thousand tons of production per year, which will account for about 10 per cent of its consumption in the Tumen area.
Despite a change in activities, the number of business staff has not decreased - now it is 157 persons, in plans for the purchase of new equipment - more than 50 staff increase.
The company is being retrained, and the necessary professionals are being collected from those already available.
In the coming year, a new set of long-distance resins has become a density of up to five millimetres, which will reduce the productivity of the product as well as another state, at the speed of production of the tube up to 47 metres per minute.
By the end of 2014, the companies are planning to develop pipes that are used in the housing-communal economy.
The management of the company has the task of closing up to 70 per cent of the needs of the Timonese area in this product.
The Deputy Director of the Department of Investment Policy, Leonid Ostrumov, addressed the leaders of production, advised to give greater attention to modernization of machinery companies.
This includes forms of public support for industry, which include reimbursement of interest rates for new equipment purchases and costs under its licence.
This year it is intended to allocate 150 million rubles, two thirds of which have already been lost.
The latter commission, which will consider the subsidization treaties, shall adopt documents from enterprises until 15 November.
In addition, the budget is reimbursed for the participation of local producers in international brands.
The budget will provide 150 million rubles for the next year, which can be used to compensate for licensing payments and credits for new equipment.
5 million will be allocated to the market, 3 million will be allocated to energy conservation programmes.
Up to 72 million rubles are reduced to the reimbursement of the ordered and paid equipment produced in the south of the Tuman oil complex.
According to Leonida Ostrumova, this form of support would be terminated in the future, as it would have been the reason for its introduction to compensate for the profits incurred by oil companies in the area budget.
They are not doing this at present and subsidies are becoming a direct cost obligation in the region.
In this regard, the Government considers direct support for industrial enterprises rather than through the oil industry.
Budget assistance will be linked to investment projects that will be implemented in production.
Many business leaders expressed concern about the situation in relation to oil.
The acquisition of equipment is a competitive advantage of the South Tymenian industry, and it will be difficult to compare with the average share of Russia, where the labour force is more scarce.
In addition, the question of the transferability of the new TNC-VR owner, Rosneft, who has not yet placed its orders on the tobacco companies.
An agreement on the implementation of the Wawat project was reached in 2013, and its applications for extension were not received.
At present, South-South companies specializing in the oil sector cannot form a portfolio of orders for the coming year.
The question remains whether the oil tax in the U.S. region will be received in the region's budget or will be paid at the location of the registration of the new owner of the premises.
Tomić works 240 hours for extremist role in the series
The Lenin District Court of Tomska condemned the city ' s compulsory work for 240 hours, which placed the video of extremism in the social network, and reported to RIA News on Friday by the press representative of the District Court.
According to the court, in March 2013, a man posted on his page a video on a popular social network, which was included in the Federal List of Extreme Materials.
In this regard, a criminal case was initiated under article of the CFF “Acts aimed at incitement of hatred and hatred, as well as undermining the dignity of the public”.
“The Lenin District Court considered the case in particular and recognized the man as guilty of the above-mentioned crime by imposing a penalty of 240 hours of compulsory work”, said the agency ' s associates.
She added that the man fully recognized his guilt.
Azarov promised the Ukrainians the price of goods after the signing of an association with the European Union
Prime Minister Nikolai Azarov of Ukraine is convinced that prices in the country will be significantly reduced after the country has signed an association agreement with the European Union.
He said this during a meeting with the readers of his page on Facebook.
I can definitely say that prices are defined by a large number of factors, including customs payments.
Following the signing of the Agreement and the entry into force of the free trade zone, the level of customs duties on imports of goods from the EU will be significantly reduced.
And this will mean that prices should also be reduced.
"It's about goods coming from EU countries," said Azarov.
In the case of other goods, the impact of the price agreement will not be so direct and it will be focused.
However, there must also be no price increases.
That is why the report on billboards, which has recently appeared in our country, that the association with the EU is growing at a price, is not quite so, or if it is not, it is not."
Follow-up checks on child abuse in Bisk
On 29 October, the media reported that one of the children's gardens in the city of Bisca was housed in the basement for educational purposes.
The investigators are currently clarifying all the circumstances, as well as the legal assessment of the actions of children ' s garden staff.
Eugenia Vasilieva spoke after the charge of immunization
Eugenia Vasilieva, a person with almost a year's attention to the media, has not yet commented on many publications in the press, both about temptations in Minoboron and about her personal relations with the former Minister of Defence Anatolia Cardukov, her position and her commitment to valuable things.
However, on November 1st, the defense service figurines broke the silence.
In his interview with Life News Vasilieva, he said: "Of course, the task was one: to remove any negative information from me about the former Minister of Defence."
There was a chance that I had to give evidence, or I was put in jail.
Today, these threats have ceased.
We'll go to court and prove our innocence.
We're 100 per cent confident in the victory.
However, it can be concluded from the interview that Vasiliev was most concerned about what he did not have with his taste.
It is likely that the statement made by the official representative of the SC RF Vladimir Markin that in the collection of the picture collected by the Defence Service figure was made available.
Among the arrested property are a number of paintings that the owner, convinced in his deep knowledge of art, acquired as the headquarters of the world biography.
However, the art expert appointed by the investigators after the arrest of these paintings has found that they have no artistic value and, in short, are really cheap," Markin noted early in October.
Some paintings stolen by the Ministry of Defence...
Then they all admitted that they were not stolen from Minoboron, and they said I had a bad taste.
Who has the right to discuss my taste, to discuss some personal moments?
I think it's just an indistinct," Vasilieva says.
In this regard, whether she admitted her guilt even in one of her 12 criminal episodes, Vasilieva said: "Of course not.
To admit something at all.
Moreover, there is no harm to the Russian Federation.
They're just leading the people astray, here and there.
In addition, in response to today's statement by SC RF that Vasilieva is excluded from the study of criminal matters, the figure lawyer stated that he and his client "has not been identified with the material of the case".
What led to the openings of Vasili's home arrest until he was released from the press?
How could a woman not respond to the charge of bad taste?
Or did the rights of the journalist "Comsomolki", who claimed a couple of days ago that she "had fallen into more transit under domestic arrest" because of reports of the reconciliation of Anatolia Serdukov with his wife and his return to the family home?
In his article "Serduks has returned to her?" a well-known military critic, Victor Baranez, wrote: "The followers are not excluded from the fact that after this shock she can become more persuasive at questions."
Former Vasilieva has taken up some allegations of illegal sale of the real estate of Minoboron.
Presumptuous guys.

A reverse trend appears to be observed in Flight Centre.
The company has updated its projections for the full year and is expecting recorded income from the rest of Australia and Great Britain.
This tourist company is now expected to have its main annual income to tax from $325 to $340 million, compared with the previous forecast in the range of $305 to $315 million.
If current trends are achieved, this will result in a 12-17 per cent increase compared to the recorded income of $290.4 million received in 2011/2012.
Director Graham Turner said that Flight Centre received 8 per cent in the first half of the year and started a second half with good indicators, especially on weekly trips to Australia and Great Britain.
“For the first time in the year, we are working with income from our 10 countries, and some of them are expected to receive a record of high income for the full year until the interest and tax contributions are calculated,” he said.
- Australia and Great Britain are here, which usually bring us the greatest profits.”
In Australia business in the second half of the second half of the year has been reimbursed by a number of weaker domestic corporate travel markets.
Similarly, in Britain, the Flight Centre business in the field of business has been quite good, while corporate customers have suffered less.
Her business in the United States had compensated for losses incurred during the seasonally weak first half of the year and was expected to be received in the third full year.
Yesterday's Flight Centre shares grew to 3 cents until $38.20.
On 31 October, the Barnaul police identified two gymnasiums.

At the time of the game's checkout.
There were 24 cars in the club.
The second game club was found in the Lenin district on Anton Petrov Street.
There were 20 games here.
The Russian Federation on Barnau reported that administrative materials were made under article “Illicit organization and gambling”.

In Ekaterinburg, the criminal killed two sisters and smelled their bodies.
In Ekaterinburg, the police are looking for a criminal who has violently argued with two sisters.
After the murder, their bodies sank.
As told by the "New Region" in the press office of GUE MD RF on the Sverdlov area, the day after the fire in a three-room apartment on the streets of Uralski, two women were found dead with signs of violent death.
Soon the identity of the dead was established.
It was made clear that these sisters, one of them, were 44-year-old Ekaterinburg, the second was 33-year-old Orenburg.
They took off the hottest apartment a few days ago.
His investigation was conducted by the Chief Police Region, Michael Borodin.
The internal authorities are dealing with various versions of the murder, verifying either former convicted citizens or persons involved in such acts.
In addition, it was established that women had taken out the apartment and where they had lived before the relationship they had enjoyed.
Schools called for more attention to mathematics, spelling and grammar
Schools of English literature will require students to study at least one section of Shakespeare, the 19th - century Romance, the romantic poetry and modern British art literature since 1914.
There will also be “non-programmed texts” to encourage wider reading.
The common course of English literature and language will be abolished.
Since 2015, students will be required to conduct a separate language examination, with the encouragement to choose English literature as a separate exam.
The Department of Education should issue new training programmes on English and mathematics, the first subject of the radical review.
It will make changes in other key items next year.
A separate regulatory body in the field of OFQUAL examinations will present the revised structure of secondary school exams, with a new system of evaluations and a lower level of course work.
During the summer, Minister of Education Michael Gouv said that there was “a broad consensus that we should reform our system of exams in order to return public confidence”, stressing that school exams would be “more complex, more ambitious and strict”.
Studies show that English schools devote less time to mathematics (116 hours per year, or three hours per week during the fourth) than in most countries.
For comparison, Australian schools give an average of 143 hours a year, while students in Singapore spend about 138 hours.
While the formal requirement for more time is not going to be in mathematics, sources in the coalition have said that large-scale math exams combined with the higher factor in the rating table would serve as an incentive to provide additional education schools on this subject.
The training will focus more on “real life goals”, including financial mathematics.
The tickets in Hehe will be for tourists in 2,200 rubles.
Since the morning from Blagavostänska in Hehe, tourists will begin to take the court to the airstrip.
This means additional expenses for those wishing to travel to China.
The tire ticket is usually much more expensive than the heat.
As reported in AmoreASSO's back office, the standard ticket price is 2,200 rubles.
The walk through the upper comfort room will cost 2,800 rubles.
In fact, in this season, cars did not travel at the same price as tourists and the latter, and the year before harvest.
Dmitry Medvedev: GDP growth rates are insufficient for the development of the State
Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev considers that the rate of growth of its GDP is insufficient for the IMF and is convinced that the situation can be improved by simplifying terms of business credit and measuring the structure of the Russian economy, focusing on innovation, Reuters reports.
We planned an increase in GDP in the area of 3 per cent this year, perhaps even more.
It'll actually hear less than 2 per cent.
At the bottom of the recession in general, some European countries would not be very bad, but we do not think so, because neither the economic base is as strong as in a number of countries in general, and in general, in order to develop, there must be a higher rate.
It is now very important for Russian companies, Russian businesses, to receive normal loans at a normal price, which is the first thing that must be done," the head of government stressed.

Travel on shores, rivers and jungles for free medical assistance
Dr. George Bwelle provides free medical assistance in the rural area of Cameroon
Bwelle and its teams carry out almost every exit, taking hundreds of patients
In this Western African country, doctors are not so many — only one per 5,000 people
Advertise here or through your mobile device
Dr. George Bwelle is one of the 10 major CNN heroes in 2013.
You can vote for him or any of the other 10 main heroes so he can become the year CNN.
This person will receive $250,000 to continue his devoted work.
During the 21 year George Bwell saw his father return to life and again fell unconscious, looking for patients who were not properly equipped to help him.
James Bwelle was injured in an automobile accident in 1981 shortly after Yaounde, Cameroon’s capital.
At first, he had only a broken arm, but the infection spread to his brain and caused him to think about himself until the end of his life.
"There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon," said George Bwell.
If we had money, we'd get him out of Cameroon.
Instead, Bwell spent years with his father in crowded hospitals and hospitals, receiving any treatment they could get.
"It's not easy," said Bwell.
- You can leave home at 5:00 a.m. to run to the hospital for the first time, but you're no longer the first.
There's a lot of patients.
Some may die because they have to wait.
The situation has not changed much since Father Belle died in 2002.
According to the World Health Organization, Cameroon has only one doctor for 5,000 people.
For comparison, the relationship in the United States is one doctor for 413 people.
And even if the cameras were able to contact the doctor, many of them wouldn't be on the car.
Two out of five people in that country live in poverty, and nearly three quarters of their health costs are private.
“Their only problem is poverty,” Bwell said.
And because of their poverty they cannot enjoy their life.
Seeing the suffering of his father and very many of his colleagues, Bwelle was determined to do something about it.
Last year, Dr. George Bwell and his volunteer team conducted 700 free operations.
He himself became a doctor and worked as a neighbor surgeon at Yaounde Central Hospital.
It also established an ASCOVIME non-profit organization, which organizes trips to the rural outpost to provide free medical assistance.
Since 2008, he and his group of volunteers have assisted nearly 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday, he and up to 30 others live in the vans, bind up medical supplies, and travel to a remote area to visit those in need of rural assistance.
They're not always successful.
They had to drive their cars through rivers and streams.
But when they arrive, they will meet them like the heroes of this world: it is a festival with songs and dances and a better place, which only local people can offer.
Free health care in these villages is indeed a reason for the holiday, and Bwelle, with its broad shade and unlimited energy, is more happy to join the holiday.
The next morning, hundreds of patients began taking care of the Brigade.
“ We take 500 people every trip, ” said Bwell.
They come from all over 60 miles [60 km] from the village, and they come by foot.
Each of these clinics provides various health services.
Many people are treated with malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others may receive scholarships, visas or free birth certificates — documents necessary for schools that many poor families simply cannot afford.
In the evenings, Brigadiers are conducting simple operations under local anesthesia.
Operations usually take place in schools, municipal buildings or at home; after the patient's procedure, they stand up and come into the postoperative zone to free the next person.
Using a generator to light up operational and sanitation equipment, Bwell and his volunteers worked until the early morning of the resurrection.
This is a weak pace, but the focus of the Brigadiers usually helps to support wooden musicians.
"They've been in the barn all night for us to get up and continue working," said Bwell.
The resurrected Brigadiers are sent back to the city, stable but proud of their work.
This group, consisting of Cameroonian doctors and foreign medical students, carried out 700 free operations last year, and they knew that their assistance could be of great importance to those whom they were helping.
One person explained that his free care operation would allow him to work again.
“ It will change the future for me and my family, ” said the man.
In addition to these clinical admissions in the outpatient and hospital of Bwell, he also works at night in private medical clinics around Yaounde.
This second work, he said, would provide 60 per cent of its non-commercial organization; the remaining funds would be covered by private contributions.
"I don't even know when he's asleep," said Katie O'Mallley, a medical student at the second course of Drescel University in Philadelphia, volunteer at the Bwell Group.
He's always in the hospital or he's trying to earn money for the organization so that these campaigns can continue.
For future doctors and nurses, such as O'Melly, who come from the United States and Europe to join Bwell in his mission, this is an opportunity that they would never have had at home.
“We have been given the opportunity to assist in operations where we have helped to remove five blood or keep the tools for Dr. Bwell,” said O'Melly.
As a secondary school student, you'd never get that opportunity in America.
Students of volunteers usually pay their own way to Cameroon, often coming with donated medicines.
But when they arrived in Yaounde, their food, transport and training were paid to Bwell.
"He's a hero, no doubt," said O'Malley.
He gives his life to this organization, and his desire to help the people of Cameroon is endless.
For Bwell almost constant load of work is not a difficult test.
Helping others to live a happy life by fulfilling this promise to their father is a source of great joy.
“ I am so happy when I do this work, ” said Bwell.
- And I'm thinking about my father.
I hope he sees what I'm doing.
I'm doing this to make people laugh to ease their pain.

Snoudden agreed to give evidence of Merkel's hearing
The rebel member of Hans-Christian Strebelle met with Edward Snoudden in Moscow.
During the discussion, the question was raised as to whether Snouden could be questioned as a witness to the FRG Genocide on the possible hearing of the German Chancellor's phone with the US Special Forces.
Snoudden expressed his willingness to provide the necessary evidence.
The meeting could be held either in Moscow or in Germany.
He clearly understood, said Hans Christian Strebelle, who knows a lot.
Although the National Security Agency led by Kitto Alexander blocked all its movements, Snouden was ready to come to Germany.
However, it began to define clearly all the conditions for his arrival. . . .
Meanwhile, US legislators are beginning to take action in response to the scandals around the US spy programmes.
The Senate Committee on Disclosure yesterday approved a draft legislation which further restrictions the activities of the American Electronic Disclosure Board.
Belarus and Turkey are interested in developing and deepening relations in all areas and areas.
In this regard, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Belarus, Vladimir Macey, made a statement to journalists at the press conference following a meeting with Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu, told BELTA.
We are very pleased that our Turkish colleagues and partners at all levels are interested in the development and deepening of Belarus-Turkey relations in all areas and areas.
Belarus is also interested in this, so we agreed that the authorities of the Government of the two countries would provide overall support and support to entrepreneurs who establish direct trade and economic contacts between themselves," said Vladimir Macey.
He stressed that the Government of Belarus would create all the necessary conditions for this and provide maximum assistance.
The Minister also reported that the 8th regular meeting of the Belarusian-Turkey Joint Intergovernmental Economic Commission, which resulted in the signing of the Protocol, was held in Ankara.
The Parties have drawn up a road map of Belarus-Turkey interaction, which, according to the head of the Belarusian Foreign Office, aims at deepening bilateral cooperation in trade and investment, industrial cooperation, transport, agriculture, energy, and new forms and directions of interaction.
“The protocol of the previous meeting is fully implemented, and I am confident that the present protocol will also be implemented, as Belarus and Turkey consider each other as trustworthy partners,” he said.
Minister for Foreign Affairs of Turkey Ahmet Davutoglu, in turn, reported that, during the negotiations, the Heads of Two Foreign Affairs had decided to further develop mutual cooperation and to carry out various projects.
The dispute between Belarus and Turkey, the Minister believes, needs to be increased and led to a $1 billion indicator.
Turkey is also an important partner in investment cooperation, which needs to be developed further, as there is no capacity to use in this area.
There has always been a very warm relationship between our countries, and we hope that in the future they will be further strengthened and expanded.
All necessary conditions will also be established for trade and economic relations and for the successful work of Turkish companies in Belarus and Belarus and in Turkey," Ahmet Davutoglu noted.
Both reject their words on health
In the midst of a critical storm yesterday, President Obama went to a drink about his frequent, significant promise that “if you like your medical insurance plan, you can keep it”.
As hundreds of thousands of people have been informed of the termination of services from their suppliers, the Republicans have recently criticized the President for leading an American society astray.
Earlier, Obama had made a number of public promises.
“Most people with health insurance who work can keep it,” he said in his statement in Boston.
With regard to what he called “innovation in the news” about the termination of services, Obama called on those who received these warnings to seek other options on the market.
Most people will be able to obtain better comprehensive health insurance plans at the same price or even less than expected.
“You will get better terms,” he said.
The Administration stated that no one should be surprised that 5 per cent of the people who buy insurance on their own may have to change plans because their coverage does not conform to new standards required under the access to medical assistance law.
"Let me tell you directly to these Americans that you deserve the best," Sibelius said in a statement to the Energy and Trade Committee of the House of Representatives in Washington.
Sibelius, who was involved in the implementation of the law on access to medical assistance, said that the launch of the internet site of sale was “a terrible evil” since October.
"I'm confused and confused, just like everything," she said.
“I really want to return your trust.”
The distinguished Sibelius quoted the phrase that caught the included microphone sitting behind her assistant in the hearings yesterday after the hot debate with a member of the House of Representatives of Billie Long, Republic of Missouri, on whether she was obliged to join the Obama Health Programme itself.
After more than three hours of listening, Sibelius once again urged him to explain why the Architect of the Available Medical Assistance Act had not voluntarily refused from the sponsored government insurance for the purchase of a plan through HealthCare.gov, which it now imposes on millions of Americans.
The Rosbalt Agency has lost its status as a non-assessary defence media
On 31 October, Mosgorsud decided to recognize an invalid license for the registration of the Rosbalt agency, which is written by Lenta.
In the absence of the media status agency, Roskomnasor insisted on systematic and gross violations of the media law.
An unpleasant precedent was established during the process: the court considered it possible to close the media and rejected the issue of the right to express objections.
What's "Rosbalt"?
The "Rosbalt Information Agency" was established in St. Petersburg in 2000.
Over the years, the Agency has opened a second headquarters office in Moscow and a number of regional units.
The agencies also have missions in the countries of the former SSR.
Since 2001, Rosbalt has developed and worked as a federal information and analysis agency.
By the mid-2000s, the agency was listed among the most familiar private media in Russia.
At the same time, Rosbalt has always had a sufficiently specific heading: the agency ' s core of exclusive publications had (and so far) taken note of the reference to sources in law enforcement.
Discussions on the proximity of publications to strong structures continued throughout the Agency ' s existence.
In addition to having a broad base of sources in various departments, Natalya Chaplin, wife of Victor Cherkesov, spoke on the basis of such assumptions.
At the same time, the role of Chaplin in the direction "Rosbalt" to the end is unclear: it is often called "the project manager".
The Director-General of the Agency is Larissa Afonina, chief editor-in-chief, Nicolai Ulyanov.
Recently, Rosbalt did not appear in federal media ratings, either by citriculosity or by audition.
In October, the agency took the 25th place in estimating the presence of Russian media sites on LiveInternet.
According to the same LiveInternet, the average audience of the Rosbalt.ru site is about 150 thousand unique visitors (and up to 500 thousand reviews), a month of about three million unique visitors.
Among the most popular materials in the last five months are comments on the helplessness of Crimea in relation to Ukraine, the death of the King and Shot Group's deaths in the capital of Beirut.
The Rosbalta conflict with Roscomnasor began in July 2013, when amendments to the Media Act were introduced to prevent journalists from using non-censorship.
The public discovered a prohibited lexical on two websites (Gigit from Krassandara and Pussy Riot covered oil peaks).
The other sides are described differently.
The grower, based on the findings of videotapes, accused Rosbalt of gross and systematic violations of the media law and called on the court to select a licence from the agency.
In Rosbalt, claims were incorrect: firstly, the roles were not editorial material, secondly, their mother's words were masked, and thirdly, shortly after the role was taken away from the site.
The agency's representatives appealed to Roscommnasor ' s claims in the world court - and when Mosgorsud adopted a request for Roscommnasor on 22 October 2013, the consideration of these complaints continued.
However, 25 world judges have already taken no decision on the benefit of Rosbalt: Chief Editor Nicholas Ulyanova has recognized the blame for violating the Code on Administrative Offences and sentenced 20,000 rubles to 10,000 per role.
Obviously, this has led to a hearing in Mosgorsud - if you refuse to think that the outcome could be predicated before.
On 31 October, the court decided to recognize the ineffective evidence of the registration of Rosbalta, which actually ceased the media status agency.
It cannot be said that Rosbalt remained alone during this resistance.
The Agency supported Gosduma's MPs (a statement on 10 October, on behalf of the Head of Director, Alexander Jarova, signed 26 MPs; the document itself was submitted on the initiative of the CPRF).
The head of the Russian Federation of Journalists of the University of Godan, the President of the Moscow Union of Journalists Paul Gusev and the head of the Presidential Human Rights Council, Michael Fedotov, declared the inadmissibility of the issue.
Moreover, according to Godanov, Roskomnasor's leadership even gave him some assurances that the case would not come to an end.
The Roosevelt Court showed that the more secure media is available in Russia today is a major issue.
Syria destroyed its weapons equipment
Syria destroyed all declared chemical weapons production powers and recognized the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons.
This first phase of disarmament was completed by Damascus within one day until the time limit.
By 1 November, Syria had to destroy productive and other support facilities intended for the preparation of combatants for use by Bi-bi-cy.
The destruction of the most toxic substances or their chemical components should be completed by mid-2014.
According to the representative of OZHO, toxic substances are currently in sealed warehouses.
International inspectors were sent to Syria after more than 1,400 people were killed during a chemical attack on the coast of Damascus on 21 August.
The chief task of inspectors was not to waste time - not to allow the Syrian authorities to produce more weapons - and to destroy the infrastructure for the mixing of chemicals and ammunition.
These productive forces will now be closely monitored so as not to allow their actions.
The following weaver was mid-November: By this time, OZH and Syria had to agree on a detailed plan for the destruction of existing waste stocks.
I've asked a lot of questions here.
Where will they be destroyed?
Who will provide this equipment?
All Syrian statements will be thoroughly checked by Western intelligence.
They will be ready to advise inspectors on new verification facilities if there are grounds for suspecting that Damascus is not finally open.
The United States dollars are of the opinion that this weapon was carried out by regular forces.
Syria and Russia insist that this is the case by the Syrian rebels.
The world community required the Syrian leadership, in accordance with the agreement reached at the Russian media, to destroy or bring into disrepute all its powers for the production of gas and liquids and for the filling of the equipment of these substances.
Now that this phase has passed, the next step must be the destruction of the already existing Syrian army of weapons.
It is estimated that there may be more than 1,000 tons of nerve-paralytic pollutants, each greenhouse gas and other banned chemicals that are stored in several tens of different locations.
To destroy it, it was necessary for the OZH and the Syrian authorities to agree on a plan of action for the first time, which lasted two weeks.
Director of field operations OZHO Jerry Smith stated that his inspectors "watched the destruction of equipment on their own".
“They are now unable to carry out further production or mixture of chemical weapons,” he said.
The OZHO statement states that the inspectors visited 21 out of 23 premises in Syria and convinced that equipment and waste facilities were either destroyed or destroyed.
The remaining two facilities are too dangerous to inspect there, but equipment has been transferred from there and tested by OZH experts.
According to Smith, the process of the destruction of the weapons production infrastructure was “not so easy” as to work under the conditions of the ongoing conflict.
At the beginning of October, OZHO received the Nobel Peace Prize, but according to Smith, it was time for inspectors to leave it before they found it - they were too busy.
John Kerry says in his unprecedented recognition that the US spy "has gone into an unpleasant place"
John Kerry demonstrated the ease of the United States follow-up programme protection tactics by acknowledging that in some cases the US spy “has gone far away”.
The Secretary also acknowledged that he was guilty, together with Barak Obama, that he had been “in the car” during the mass release of Edward Snoudene on the AMB spy.
These leaks have been placed by the Government of the United States in the centre of a diplomatic scandal with its allies.
Speaking on video links at an open government conference in London, Mr. Kerry said: “There is no doubt that the President and I, as well as other members of the Government, have actually taken some of the things that have occurred on the highway, because this opportunity has already existed – and during World War II and in very difficult years of cold war, and of course, 11 September”.
He then became the first high-ranking member of the Government of the United States, who recognized that the US spy had gone too far but stressed that no rights had been violated.
He said, “In some cases, this has proved to be very unpleasant.
And the President of Poland is determined to shed light on this issue and to explain it to people, and he is now carrying out a thorough analysis to ensure that no one has any sense of abuse.
I assure you, there is no harm in this process for the innocent.”
Mr. Kerry pointed out, however, that the ABB had been doing well and that its follow-up operations had saved a lot more lives.
He said, “We are working for a new world, where people are ready to fire.
In the world there is radical extremism, indiscriminate and full determination to kill people, strike people and attack Governments.
What if you were able to capture it, keep it before it happens?
In fact, we prevented the destruction of planes, buildings and people's killings because we were able to learn about these plans earlier.”
Meanwhile, American legislators are going to Europe to help address issues related to the proposed US overseas spying and convince Europeans that they need to continue joint anti-terrorism activities with the United States, the Vice-President of the Senate Committee on European Affairs said on Thursday.
Senator Chris Murphy said he had spoken with members of the European Parliament and others this week and was concerned about their threats to stop participating in anti-terrorism organizations because of the disappointment of the follow-up of the National Security Agency.
“To the benefit of national security of the United States, it is really important for Europeans to remain our parties to our common counter-terrorism efforts,” said the Merfie Democrat, who worked for the first time and was the Vice-Chair of the International Relations Committee of the Senate on European Affairs, in an interview from Washington.
“And I go to Europe to let them know that we must continue to cooperate in the fight against terrorism despite their anger over these ABB programmes.”
News that ABB has collected millions of phone calls in Europe has weakened relations with some U.S. allies, although the head of the agency said this week that they were incorrect and reflected a misunderstanding of the metadata collected by NATO federations and shared with the United States.
Other publications were published by Snoudden, which showed that AMB had been monitoring the German Angel Merkel’s mobile phone, as well as some 34 other world leaders.
The Director of National Intelligence James Clapper protected the spying activity against the Union as necessary and said it was a common case on both sides.
On the basis of this smile, Murphy said that his office was organizing a visit of Congress members, which is expected to take place this year, and that he hoped that the members of both parties and the two Chambers would join the delegation.
The names of other participating legislators should be known in the near future.
According to him, the travel programme is still under development.
Although Murphy stated that the purpose of the trip was to help improve relations, he said that some degree of “best from best incentives” would also be demonstrated.
He said that European leaders should be honest with their people in what spy programs they themselves have used for many years.
“As we can change our follow-up programmes in order to better protect the rights of Europeans, they must also agree that we are not the only ones involved in intelligence,” said Murphy.
Meanwhile, Mr. Kerry should be sent to these East and Poland to address the challenges of hostility to the US strategy in Syria, Egypt and Iran, as well as to the United States intelligence.
The impact of prisoners will be increased in the new compositions of the public surveillance commissions
Today, the Council of the General Assembly (OP) can adopt new compositions of the Public Oversight Commission (UNC) in 43 regions of Russia.
When a vote is taken, the lobbyists increase their influence.
UNCs are public structures that control the conditions of detention in places of deprivation of liberty.
In the case of Sergei Magnitic and Leonida, the release in the copy column - that is, through the UNC - is made clear most of the rational events for the settlement.
There is a struggle between human rights defenders and lobbyists to control the UN.
At the meeting of the OP working group on the formation of the United Nations, I proposed that the selection of human rights activities should be a criterion.
"They didn't accept it and formed lists, they didn't develop criteria," says Valerie Borstev.
Bortsev, current Chairman of the Moscow Monitoring Commission and the Association of Independent Observers, is a universal human rights structure dealing with prison problems.
As a member of the House of Lords of Jabloka, he has developed a law governing the activities of the United Nations.
The OP Council should vote for the composition of UNC in 43 regions of the country.
In the 1800s, less than a thousand volunteers were required, and in Ingustia and Cabardino-Balkaria, competitions were unable to organize because of the lack of candidates.
The OP promises to organize a donation to holiday facilities.
UNC Moscow is one of the few competition commissions, despite the fact that there will be 40 participants in the new composition instead of 20.
According to Bortzeva, the current composition of the capital commission of 11 human rights defenders and 9 strengths and the option to vote in the OP changed from 17 to 23.
At the same time, 30 human rights defenders were sought in the capital commission.
Therefore, the representative of the "Bie's Brothers" will be re-elected in the new composition.
He was a member of the United Nations for three years, but he never visited prisoners.
The fighter believes that the forces appointed by their UN President will be able to do the work of human rights defenders, so human rights defenders do not exclude collective exits from the Commission.
In their view, the movement of force forces is coordinated by a member of UNC. Anton Cvetkov, head of the “Russian Officers”, an organization that supports the interests of the authorities.
"I don't eat young people on the track," said RBC Daily Anton Flowers.
He rejected the promotion of any lists and said that it was not intended to prevent human rights defenders from visiting arrested opponents.
According to Cvetkova, he was not even interested in what list they are currently voting for in the OP.
It considers the publication of the Burst information to be a form of pressure.
The possible success of human rights defenders is the planning change of the leadership of the Chelsea UNC.
Its former leaders are removed because of previous copies.
The General Chamber concluded that the leadership of the local commission ignored the problems of prisoners.
And this is where the United Nations Rostova-na-Donu can move from human rights defenders to strengths.
A new list of the missing human rights defender of the local commission was made up of one of his comments, although in May 2013, the Federal Public Chamber excluded him from conduct that was not ethical.
Lists of the Moscow and the Bortsev Commission are considered to be "the place for Copenhagen".
The release of the Tolokonnik Hopes did not affect the UNC Mordonia, which they consider to be "strong": in the new composition, only one human rights defender wanted to be released, and it did not even accept documents for competition.
A member of the OP Council, Nicolai Svanidé, told RBK daily that he had voted against the proposed list, as he was in favour of the situation in Moscow and Rostov-na-Donu.
He forwarded his position to other members of the Council.
His OP colleague Paul Gusev said he had voted in favour of the proposed Moscow list.
The United Nations Under-Secretary-General of OP Vladislav Grib, also a member of the FSIN Institute of Science and Research, has co-ordinated the list.
Grib told RBC Daily that it was not appropriate to make candidates for human rights defenders and strengths and that it was not agreed that the chairmen of the Commission had sufficient powers to stop the work of its members.
Grib is not allowed to predict the outcome of the vote of the OP Council.

Australian woman appealed against a prison term in Thailand
A 21-year-old woman from Sydney who was sentenced to 15 hours in prison on the island of Phuket for false allegations of being attacked by a taxi driver, appealed to the court and was released under bail.
St. Rochel Bumbleford was initially recognized by the Phuket Provincial Court for a false claim after reporting to the Thai police that the local taxi driver had launched an attack on the night of the 10th of June, while two other men had arrested her.
However, video cameras later revealed that she had returned to her hotel in good time after breaking up her relationship with her Australian boyfriend.
The Phuket police asked Bumford for two days before she admitted that she had invented this story.
She was held before the court in local police chambers.
Bambaford was sentenced to a 15-hour prison term at the centre of the general regime in Phuqueta district, not in a female prison for adults.
She is the daughter of the former Australian Alliance of Peter Tanks, who has been referred to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Canberra for assistance to her daughter.
Tanks told the Sydney Sunday Telegraph that the entire family was “very worried” about the welfare of their daughter and hoped her return to Australia.
"Of course it was a time of concern, but we hope that she will return home as soon as possible," said Tanks.
Bamford appealed to his sentence and was released under a charge of 50,000 battalions.
According to reports in Australia, it currently leaves in the curative zone of Krabi in southern Thailand.
The legal sources in Thailand reported that Bamford was currently a local lawyer in Phuket, but warned that the appeal could lead to an increase in her sentence for two years and to her imprisonment for adults.
However, after the recent murder of Australian surgeon Michel Smith in Phuket Thailand, he may also seek to restore his damaged tourist image, which would lead to a justifiable sentence.

Remember, this novel became the finalist of four prizes: "The Clear Field", "Russian Booker", "National Bestseller" and "The Great Book".
In the past year, the author of this book has been awarded the prizes of the Government of the Russian Federation in the field of culture.
Roman Senchin is an undisputed leader in the generation of current thirty-year-old and sorcalic prosages.
Virtually every publication of its violent material based on current life stories and behaviour raises heated controversy among the criticisms of the most diverse directions.
It can be argued that the collection of articles on the pros and publications of Sencin, reviews on its books and journals have created a loving and unexpected Dutchmanship of Russian literature from the end of the 1990s to the beginning of 2010.
In the discussion of the “one of the most controversial contemporary writers”, according to the criticism of Sergei Cuprine, most of the words are understood by its participants under the word “the literature” which they see now and in the future not only in our terms but also in our lives.
Unfortunately, most of the articles and reviews from regional media and blogosphere have not been included in the book.
Analytical and review articles are usually given as a reduction in the sections "Absac... "
