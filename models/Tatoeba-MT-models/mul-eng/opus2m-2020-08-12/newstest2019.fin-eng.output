Eemel Kouki led Hurrikan's home at the opening - Savo Volley's second win
He returned seven times after the men's flight to the Mestaruusliei Airport, Hurikaani-Loimaa began in the days 2018-19 at home when Raision Loimu disappeared on Saturday from 3 to 0.
From Romania, the general player, Emil Kouki, who returned from Finland to Finland, was 22 points most effective at Hurrikan.
The aliens had some powers, but they didn't do them, and then came to call from Loima.
It's time for the morning to come to an agreement, Kouki said.
I also played Tom Rumpun's support in Loimus on 18 points.
The most effective of the vineyards was the village of Samul Kaislasalo on 17 points.
The winning of the opening game is always important.
Many players had an experience on the other side, and it brought extra to the game.
Our game isn't ready yet, but it's a goal of course, Kouki said.
Set Savo Volley as Effective
Miro Mättennen was 18 points in Savo Volley's most effective time when the group fell by the Vieremäl Vantana Ducks 3-0.
Our game was especially exciting in the fight, but we were fortunately rewarded.
I didn't have any information on any different events when I played against that group of mine, Mättennen said.
Antti Siltala, who started his career in the 3rd series of flights from 2000 to 01, made 12 points.
Major Jukka Tuvinen was satisfied with many things.
Halli was small, i.e. a feeling in the hole all the time.
A good file was left out of the house.
Miro was a hero, Silly played a good game, Tuvinen said.
The previous time of the battle was 2006-07, then he was able to jump off Pielavaden Sammos in the Tuvise as the main candidate.
Thiago Maciel was at Ducks' 14 points.
Akaa-Volley's star again
In the past 2012-13, Joni Mikkonen, who won the final score, has begun with a strong start over this period.
Hakcuri made 25 points when Akaka-Volley took his open-ended open-air experience when he was thrown into the Kokkola Tikirets 3-2.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Today it was near the end of the day, because we had four children at the end of 17-21.
I was hoping for something different, and five of them came there the same way, Mikkone said.
A few years ago, the most effective of the final processing of the Turks had been made 28 points by Hector Edvarts Buivids.
Mr. Aleksandrs Kudriashaws supported 17 points.
There's nothing I can do to take your friend's jackets, Mikkone's body.
Compared with Finland's human capital to the world's unity
Finland is in the heart of the world in comparison with human capital, says scientists Lance.
The study compared the development of human capital from 1990 to 2016.
During the years, 195 was compared to the land.
In both years Finland was one of the statistics.
In 2016 there was almost as high as in 1990 as in 2016.
Later in Finland, there were Iceland, Denmark, Canada and the Netherlands.
Later, Holland was placed on one of the highest points, and instead of Canada was found in Taiwan.
In 2016, the worst comparison was that of Niger and South Sudan.
By measuring human capital, we will examine the education levels of the public, access to education, art and health.
The World Bank has launched economic growth in the context of human capital.
Real Madrid Thibaut Courtois was held in Atletico's course, the local game ended as a drawless.
The real Madrid painter Thibaut Courtois was awarded the Vishni games, and the local game of the Madridian teams ended up on the ground floor late in the afternoon in the Spanish football field.
Atletico Madrid, Antoine Griezmann and Diego Costa were the closest to the country, but the Belgian guard at Courttois was not to be fought.
Courttois played at Atletico through three loan cards while playing Chelsea.
In the beginning of the week, the International Football League Fifa chose him as the world's top leader.
In real life, the best ground was found by Garreth Bale, but his roof was finally heading toward the end of the ground's opening.
The ball left after the fall because of more travel.
According to the ESPN, those who were deceived by Real supporters also called the name Christian Ronaldo in the event of the transition to Juvent.
In the United States, there are now attacks on abortion rights - A powerful document tells us why
In the United States, the Senate is trying to find out whether one of the nine members of the Supreme Court could be elected President Donald Trump to appoint President Brett Kavanaugh.
On the part of the Republic, many hope that Kavanaugh's decisive vote will be brought to an end against Roe's decision known as Wade, which took place in the United States in 1973 on abortion.
Ricki Sternin and Annie Sundberg's documentaries Reversing Roe - U.S. and abortion rights tell us how this has happened in recent years.
Incredible as it feels, the subject is timeless in Finland as well.
Foreign Minister Timo Soin (sin) has made public work against a safe abortion and has received special support from our country's representatives.
At the beginning of a powerful document, gynaecology Colleen McNicholas, which is the only abortions left to be a doctor in the State of Missouri, is found.
The client's armed guard is telling his advocate of the freedom of religion in the United States.
News videos remind the clinics of the killer terrorist reasons.
Let's move back to the time when the abortion was illegal in the United States.
The association of Lutheran churchmen was then completely clear of the creation of absorbed doctors who trusted women.
The reasons of the pastor's challenge are good, but they don't even need them, the picture itself is enough for an abortion of a dead woman.
The death toll was about 5,000 years ago in the United States.
The legislator of abortions is particularly a party to the Republic.
In 1967, Governor Ronald Reagan signed an abortion law in California.
Later, during the 1980 presidential campaign, Reagan began to mix religion with political voters.
Her abortion was also followed by her parents George Bush.
And so did Donald Trump.
The most serious document on the subject is to look for a basis for the policy of abortion.
When there was a lack of tax exemption from religious organizations supporting the movement, they became politically active.
As a cappie surgeon, they were selected to be an abortion.
The religion has introduced exceptional political sensitivities.
In writing this, in the United States, there is a situation in which the voice of religious justice has been shaken by sexual harassment, but by abortion, the president has chosen the highest right to appeal to Kavanaugh, which many women are now guilty of sexual harassment.
Kavanaugh can be granted the rule of law based on the law of 164 million American women and girls.
Israel’s army shot seven Palestinians, a group of two children at the border of the Great Depression
Nearly 200 Palestinians have been killed in the year Israel has come to mind at the border crossing.
Israel's soldiers shot seven Palestinians in the Gaza border on Friday, the Palestinian Ministry of Health says.
There are two children, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health: 12 and 14 years of age.
According to the Ministry, 505 people have been injured.
Of these 89 were victims of nature.
The army of Israel has confirmed that it opened up and made a border crossing of space when the conspirators threw Israel’s troops into the rock and into the rocks.
The army says that when they start using force, they don't want to cross the border or cross it on the other side.
At least 191 Palestinians have died in Gaza after March, when the Palestinians started weekly demonstrations at the border.
The target is 12 000 per UN human rights.
In 1948, when the State of Israel was established, it was required that the Palestinians enter the areas where they had to leave.
A Palestinian spy has killed an Israeli army.
Explosions from the missiles and helium bombs sent by Palestinians have burned forest areas and agricultural countries in Israel.
The thing is, Pucky got a warrant. You didn't get to shoot yourself.
Wigan's top Chey Dunkley showed him back in the field of punishment.
Special Agent Gavin Ward gave the game to go on.
According to his interpretation, the roof was clean.
The thing Puck could not believe his eyes.
The situation would have been difficult for Judge Wardia, who sentenced Norwich to 85 minutes in prison when Pucki was arrested.
Ward appeared to be a criminal officer, and Mario Vrancic started a 1-0 fighter.
It's been made up of five lands for Norway in the Master's Land.
The previous one was born last Saturday against QPR with a pleasant winter dress.
The work was eaten again for Puki.
When he lost his ball, he went on to the end of the situation.
He created soil conditions and defended without fatigue.
Norwich's appointment was five weeks ago.
The team's going to keep going.
There's five wins in the back.
Pedophilia’s support was immediately implemented - in Finland about 40,000 experiences of interest in children
According to the estimate, at least two percent of men and a small proportion of women experience at least some of the same sexual interest in preteens.
In Finland this means about 40,000 people.
For children or young people who have been sexually interested in sex, it has been difficult to get help until now.
The joint seriesE project of the Criminal Care Foundation and Sexpo is training professionals to meet pedophiles as well as helping people who experience sexual interest in children.
When the project was announced in the morning, an e-mail from Sexpo offering advice and therapy began, and the meeting hours ended very quickly, Yle tells.
However, these are promised to the extent of free will.
The sexual inclination of children leads to many embarrassment.
Most of the pedophile feelings in itself have not been taken into account by their fantasies and have thus done nothing criminal.
However, the opinion is generally a permanent feature.
Most of them hope to get away from thoughts that bother them and confuse them.
They also challenge normal life, says Dr. Patricia Thesleff, who acts as a special expert on the project.
I think the job is valuable if one child survives sexual violence, Thesleff says.
Korean leaders or Congolese gynecologists?
In the United States, President Donald Trump Nobel Peace Prize winner - the idea may suddenly sound strange, but Trump is one of the most popular awards.
As a result, the role of Trumpi in achieving North Korea is at least at the level of peace, committed to its nuclear state.
Most of the peace promoters of Nobel are, on the basis of reports, President Moon Jae and North Korea, Kim Jong, who have already met three times this year and have agreed to try a peace agreement between their countries.
The warming of the Koreans is significant because in recent years there have been fine ones.
Nevertheless, in the years leading up to the German occupation and to the Red Sea, Kim’s remuneration would undoubtedly also raise criticism.
Nobel laureates are published from Monday and on Friday is the most important prize for peace.
If the award is not granted to Korean diplomats, there is one of the most promising Congolese doctor, Denis Mukwege.
The estimated gynaecology has treated thousands of women who were victims of gang rape in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in the hospital and have risen to be the leading expert in the world.
Mukwege has been paying attention to sexual violence, which is a cruel side product of many conflicts.
A strong proposal has also been considered a UN refugee organization which won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1954 and 1981.
The Nobel Committee has been informed that this year it is 331 candidates for the award.
The names of the proposals are not disclosed to the public.
The trumpet wouldn't even get worse if Nobel got it.
In May the supplier asked him in the White House if he should think about the peace prize.
Everyone likes it, but I would never say that myself.
I want to get this ready.
The fight I want is a victory for the whole world, the President continued to refer to North Korea's negotiations.
However, there are obstacles that make the Nobel Prize unlikely.
The Norwegian Nobel Committee to be elected has often given recognition to individuals and organizations that represent liberal democracy and a multi-faceted world order - just the international cooperation that Trump has seen as the backbone.
In the 2000s, three U.S. policies have been awarded: Jimmy Carter in 2002, Al Gore in 2007 and Barack Obama in 2009.
The awarding of the trumpet would therefore require the Nobel Committee to adopt a complete ideologie.
Ballistics in the tunnels: Cars were used as trailers and walked wrong direction
On September 8th, a traffic accident struck on Lohja alone.
The traffic in the tunnel was interrupted because of the notification, both in the direction of Turun and Helsinki.
When he found out that this was a system-wide issue, he tried to make traffic normal.
However, it didn't work very fast.
We tried to open the road once before, but the Road Centre said it couldn't open because there are drivers on the road soda and they know how to get hurt, the day-to-day pilot Pasi Kärriänen told the STT at that time.
At that time, the engine was driven to the wrong direction only after a moment of waiting.
When the first starts to act against traffic rules, some others follow up often after, the traffic security liaison supervisor Tapio Heskanen is surprised.
According to traffic rules, motors and tunnels must not be stopped for any other reason.
Transport security recalls that in exceptional circumstances, transport cannot be threatened by emergency solutions.
The warning vehicles must always provide the most possible stopway.
On the contrary, a reasonable engine has been banned in particular, as well as the creation and withdrawal of u-translation.
The same prohibitions are also valid in sensors which must also always be connected to the aircraft.
It is also prohibited to stop without a valid reason, as is true of course.
There have even been cases where the carrier has stopped the tunnel to drive the world out of his car.
It should be made clear that there is a wrong place and time for this activity, Heskanen says in the Information on Transport Security.
The Ilves fans would have wanted to continue their party, even if the ship was stuck in the bottom of the sea.
The Ilves fans of the inner-ship M/S Tampere would have wanted to stay on the ship to continue its victory celebration, even though the ship had been caught by the seabed, says the captain of the ship, who was working at the event in Juho Sirj.
The M/S Tampere, who was on his way to Tampere, later left his train on Sunday evening and was arrested on the north side of the Old Sea in Akayas.
There were 19 passengers on board and five crew members were evacuated to the mainland at night.
No one got sick in the morning.
The Ilves fans would have wanted to continue their party by morning, but of course it would have been more reasonable to send them off to the camp at the airport and by bus home, Sirja told the STT.
The Ilves fans had been in Hämeenlin, following the arrest of Ilves and HPK, which ended in the 4-3 battle of Ilves.
According to the report, on the afternoon of the summer, the seabed was caused by the fact that the water surface was about six feet [half m] below normal.
According to Sirjj, navigation was also difficult because the most rare sign was hidden in the closets, so its reflections were not normally seen in dark waters.
No more noise
The ship was hit by a cave on the west side of God’s village shortly after the ship had landed between Tampere and Helsing.
The greater dramatic case did not relate to Sirje, as the speed of the ship was very low at the time and did not lead to a more significant deterioration on the ground.
According to the report, the landing on the ground has not caused ships to sink and the pressure is not so great and the ship’s cruises seem to continue normally.
On Saturday morning, the vessel was on its way to check the ship’s cargo before the ship was sinking from the bottom.
We're still on the stage for security check that there's no harm to this, Sirja tells us.
Sirjär believes that the M/S Tampere followed, firstly by a week-long cruise, can be treated in an appropriate manner.
The ship's cruise line continues with him until the date of his suicide.
No use for ambulances
The rescue facility received a warning on Sunday afternoon shortly after the 20th.
The ambulances were warned at the port of Vijala to take away abandoned passengers, but the ambulances were not used.
The day-to-day pilot Matti Willman later night told me that the conditions at sea were difficult because of a dark and almost severe wind.
The rescue facility announced half a month after three o'clock last night that all those on board had been evacuated and passengers had been transferred by line to Tampere.
The cruiser built in 1957 was born in 2001, 2014 and 2017.
The Court of Justice of Trump, accused of arrest and arrest, may remain a senior officer
Mr. Brett Kavanaugh, who was presented as the Supreme Court of the United States, may well remain in office for his purpose, was assessed by programmer Mika Aalola from the International Institute.
So far, at least three women have blamed Kavanaugh on sexual harassment and abuse during their school years.
According to Aaltola, doubts have caused so much political pressure on the Republican side that President Donald Trump may decide to present an official to another person.
In the United States this time, the President's proposal for the Supreme Court of Justice has raised serious disputes.
In this case, the judge's usually dismissed himself, says Aalola.
The President has thus been able to maintain his growth.
The name would be a lot of democracies
The United States has the highest right to try to be politically superior, but at least in the case of Kavanaugh, a new judge's election has become a very politically bold process.
If Kavanaugh is named, it is likely that Aaltola will make the decision in the future of the large-scale Congress of the Democratic Party.
It would raise votership among young people and women who would vote more likely democratically.
On the other hand, the appointment of a conservative judge to the Supreme Court would have been a long-term victory for the Republicans.
The opportunity for appointment does not belong to any of the Presidential Council, since in the United States, the Supreme Court is designated as a living person.
In practice, some of them have left their request for retirement at about 70 to 80 years of age.
Some of the Republicans were also disappointed by the name
In the United States, the Supreme Court of Justice will normally make a retrospective statement, Aalola's reality.
Although Trump has only set a week's time limit for the FBI's additional disclosure, it can still reveal something essential according to Aaltolan.
Yes, it can.
I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know.
According to the Aalto, at least it is certain that Kavanaugh's compatibility or incompatibility will be discussed in the official capacity more briefly before the Senate takes its decision.
The Republicans have a majority of 51-49 votes in senates, but at least two women's Republican Republican women are undoubtedly considered to be the name of Kavanaugh.
It would be a shame that the name would be taken to vote and that the Republicans would be destroyed.
A woman named Salisbury as a military intelligence agent
A Russian woman has been informed by the general radio company BBC about the concerns of Salisbury as an agent of the Russian military intelligence service.
The woman told on the basis of the photos that there was a military investigation at GRU with Anatoli Sh Shep.
The Bellingcat Net Community and the Russian Insider Russia reported earlier on their discovery of other suspects to the Czech Republic.
They had already found evidence that men’s present personality is hidden.
The BBC team traveled to the border between Russia and China near the border with the Czech Republic.
A woman living in Kenya recognized a picture published by young Shepigan Bellingcat.
He introduced the same man to the picture of the British police in which Ruslan Boshirov appeared himself today.
Russian men are suspicious of the harassment of former two-year-old Agent Sergei Cripal and his daughter at Novitshok-hermomyrik in March.
The scripters would find out in the air.
Everste Tshepi has been awarded, among other things, the honor mark of Russia's Sancairy in 2014.
Russia still challenges the GRU connection.
In September, suspect men told Russia’s TV about the concerns they had been facing as tourists in Salisbury.
Older people as hostages in military reform
Now there has been a living example of what the Government of Sipil has defined in the application of the military reform framework.
The Vaala military services of my birth are produced by Oulkaera, who is the former district director of Attendo in 2016.
The Heads of State shall notify the authority of the amendment.
If the soldiers are up now, they're going to move state troops in the future.
While the central decision makers survived, most of them are also preparing for a major structural change in human care, which would end the annual health centre's facility and small memory facilities.
Home care would be added, which means that people living in isolated areas will be taken away from their homes to the "home" of the health centre.
Attendo was confident that the customer would pay for it.
The left-hand side of the road did not give way to bad preparation, but rather a good public order, which became a lot of property, close friends and also authorized by other parties.
I have presented the parts of the military-country preparation of how people are being treated in the Kingdom of Vala at this moment at home most throughout the North-Northern country.
She was also authorized by the neighboring community to take part in the West Carina.
The local newspaper made an excellent case, and it also led the Oulkaera manufacturers to the backyard.
Sote manufacturers do not write on any papers that Attendo has built a new Valaala warehouse, which is now waiting for its residents to be emptied.
There are no other service producers.
Manufacturers are only talking about services, but they don't tell us what levels of treatment it gets or what staff structure Attendo needs to treat people after delivery.
Without a nurse?
So the health centre's facilities are closed because there is no doctor's daycare.
Attendo should also be provided to doctors at the Vaala Health Centre.
The example of the option tells us how central officials rotate the authorized information and are authorized to be given both by limiting the wall.
In this way, the central party clears away the residents of the Waala, for anyone who stays there safely will be free to live if there is a chance to change.
Was there one option I had to discuss that the whole country would be regarded as a settlement?
Turkish President Erdogan opened the Grand Duchy in Cologne
Thousands of people in the city of Kolnin in Germany were reminded when Turkish visiting President Recep Tayyip Erdogan opened the largest mosque in Europe.
Hundreds of thousands of people had been gathered to Reinjo's beach this morning.
Erdogan, you're not welcome, including in the audiences, and in school you were sentenced to a fascism.
During the initial visit to Tordogan, several suggestions have been made, and the safety measures have been strict.
On the coast, about 10,000 people were expected to protest, including Turkey's human rights policy.
Erdogan's support had also been collected to the Grand Duchy's approach.
However, the police had separated a large area from the Moscow area from its security environment.
In its opening speech, Erdogan called for the success of its German presidency and assessed its strengthening relations between Germany and Turkey.
During his tour, Erdogan met two of Angela Merkel's allies.
Erdogan and Merkel had sworn on Friday to rebuild their relations with the countries that had significantly deteriorated since Turkey’s state aid company in 2016.
However, it stressed that there are serious differences between countries, including human rights issues.
Review of the environment visit
Both the Mayor of Cologne, Henriette Reker and Prime Minister of the Nordic-Westfalen state, Armin Laschet, started their participation in the openings when the consideration of Erdogan's visit was rapid.
A 30-year-old student from Turkey told Cansu that he had come to a meeting with Erdogan from Switzerland.
I want to be a voice for those who can't go to the streets in Turkey.
They've been arrested, killed, and tortured.
For Erdogan, everything that's out of his mind is terrorism.
In the last phase of Erdogan's journey to Germany, a significant part of the population in North Rhine-Westphalia is Turkish refugees.
In Slovakia, three charges against the complainant's murder
In Slovakia, three people have been charged with the murder of the victim of Jan Kucia.
The prosecutor told us on Friday that three people were charged with Kuciak and this brutal murder and other crimes.
Earlier this week, the police arrested eight people in a murder investigation, but five of them were released.
Kuciak was found in Bratislava, with his wife, who had been shot in a car accident in February.
He's been studying the relationship between politics and the Italian Mafia.
The police have questioned Kucia's findings about the murders.
The event and the article published by Kuciak have raised concerns about media freedom and corruption in Slovakia.
There may be problems in the case of search agencies on Sunday.
As a result of the result, Karjalane is also required to be posted on Sundays without reference.
This may be seen in the distribution of the page in the search agencies where distribution to the Community is required to be carried out from abroad.
The situation was on the same day as the paper, and the problem may continue on Monday.
The post office will place an extra number of press officers in the country.
Other Finnish newspapers are posted separately on Monday.
The distribution of these papers is slowing down.
The water is a Finnish astronaut
Actor Arto Nyberg is currently challenging the future debate programme, including Vesa Heilaa.
Water is in the study on the resulting space travel that she stole from Virginia Galactica in 2010.
The price was EUR 151,000, which was needed as a bank.
If the original plans had been in place, Vesa would have gone into space some time ago.
However, the date of departure has expired since the year.
Now it seems that after the failure, in 2014 and the death penalty, things are in progress.
If all goes well, commercial flights are still starting this year or at the end of the year.
The number of the water plane is 300, i.e. its journey from the first departure of about a year.
The plane lasts 2.5 hours and is 5 minutes at 100 km high, the Finnish astronaut tells you about the future home times.
In the same way, he also makes his way into space.
As a child, I read about the space travel series and saw Star Trek's TV series.
The war of stars has been seen, and that's why the idea was stuck...
Why not?
Everyone has their own wounds.
Manchester City was a quiet old man
Manchester City continued her life in Valio when it disappeared on Sunday at her home in Brighton country from 2 to 0.
During the six-year-old master team, Raheem Sterling and Sergio Aguuro work as a winner.
Sterling was able to guide his fourth leg through the close proximity to the empty ground when Leroy Sané found him in 30 minutes from the back end of Brighton.
Aguro got his own painting reference when he and Sterling got back to Brighton's defense at the 65th game.
Argentinian was able to place 2-0 end-of-lifes on the penal scene easily.
With six wins and one level of start-up City, Valioliiga is running 19 points on the islands.
However, less than one take-off played Liverpool at just one point.
The Liverpool is located on its own at the seventh round of the series of Chelsea.
Young people chose new decision makers in Joensus
At the end of the meeting on Sunday, the Finnish Youth Council elected new decision makers for the next three-year period 2019-2021.
The President was elected Anu Sivonen from the Upper Savos and Vice-President Petra Mäkeläinen Hämee.
The Board of Governors was elected as 40 senior members and 40 senior members, the Finnish Youth Council will inform you on Sunday.
The Youth Council was held in Joensusu.
We want our cultural heritage to be known for its quality and security.
In the three-year operational objectives of the Youth Assembly, which is organized in the context of the agreement, we will have three promises: we will keep the doors open to all, and we will organise equal value-added accommodation and background, and we will support voluntary activities and people in their own growth fields, the Youth Council of Finland will tell you in its report.
Lewis Hamilton went over Kim Röikkkö and surprised Ferraria: "To lose a very important driver"
The Swedish newspaper Blickin challenged the British language of Mersu, he believed that the release of Kimi Réikkós from Ferrari’s services would help Hamilton finally.
Hamilton leads the MM points to Ferrari's second kiss of Sebastian Vetteli at 40 points.
A little less than three weeks ago Ferrari said that the Regikönen would not continue to rent by first and at the same time, Reikkönen announced that he had moved to Sauber.
I don't think Hamilton's naturalist believes that the Räikkonen will solve his problems in a bag.
I don't think Kim's gonna change in the rest of the cases.
He's an exceptional professional, fantastic driver.
He's staying one of my favorites, and I'm sure Ferrari's missing a very important driver.
I don't think that makes any sense.
Hamilton has previously been told that the Council has been one of his predecessors.
I don't know if Kim knows this, but when I was a young man and I played F1 game at PlayStation all day long.
I've always been Kim, which is a bit crazy, Hamilton said in June.
The F1 case continues on Sunday in Russia's joint contest.
At 14 o'clock in the morning, you're leaving Mercedes Valtteri Bottas.
It's been a while since the day.
The competition for a master race in the A-young series of SMs became a complete farsi: the opponent reached the location by only 7 players.
The boys of the football team will end up in the afternoon when they're playing the last round.
Prior to the start of the 13th round of the master competition, the starting points were clear: FC Lahti Akatemia is one of the points against Vasa IFK.
In order for the situation to be changed by the last cycle, Ilves, who is in the Master Camp, must be defeated by PK-35 and expected to be killed.
However, the skill of the bats was ensured in practice before the start of the match, since Vasa IFK had reached the bat by only seven players.
If there had been one fewer casualties, the reception would not have been started.
FC Lahti Akatemia won the 16-0 deal.
On the roof, the wires lead 7-0.
One reason for the poor player's absence is that the team has played part of the same players in the A-young SM series, the P20 series and the C-section of men.
The left IFK has played in the Kakkos practice against falling for a whole period of time.
In the second round of decisions tomorrow, Vasa IFK will have to win the JBK visit and at the same time hope that Tampere United will lose its negotiations against KuFua against Siilinjärve Doival.
The car ended up in a Catholic in Enos - according to the rescue plant was happy
The car was driven out of the road and ended at the Catholic Church in Enosh at 9: 00 a.m. on Sunday.
There were four people in the accident.
Two of them were badly injured, the rescue device reported.
Good luck with that. It's true.
According to the rescue facility, the road was marked from behind the port.
The police party went to an accident site.
Supo is waiting for new means of communication: equipment projects and recruitments have already been made, and the operation of foreign planning does not delay
According to the Chief of Supo, Antti Pelttar has been provided with equipment projects and training staff.
The increase in the amount of EUR 10 million would continue to be the result of the entry into force of the information services.
The protection policy (sub) services in Helsinki Ratakadula are already fully prepared for the entry into force of the information society.
Mr President, Mr Pelttar tells the Western Media that equipment projects have already been undertaken for future information privileges.
Serena Williams is excited by the video where she sings in the upper room - campaigning for her breast-feeding.
The superintendent Serena Williams will meet again.
Now he campaignes to increase awareness of breast cancer by publishing his Instagram video, where he sings his hands just in front of his chests, says the news agency AFP.
Kappala was hit by the Australian The Divinyls in 1991 by I Touch Myself.
The video Williams supports Australia's breastfeeding campaign.
"I used The Divinyls' global hit to remind women of regular self-assessment checks," Williams writes in his Instagram.
And yes, this put me in the area of disability, but I wanted to do it because it's about all women regardless of color in the world.
Timely detection is everything aa and o-- it's saving a lot of lives.
The Divinyls's second writer is Chrissy Amphlett, who died about five years ago at the age of 53.
The music video is part of the I Touch Myself project that has been made to honor Chrissy Amphlett.
"He went to his chest, but he gave us an invitation to remind us of women to put their health first," Williams says.

The Chinese mining industry at the mountain range does not apply to high-level farmers
The restaurant offers wonderful countries in addition to traditional Chinese bees.
In the province of Zhejiang, China, an exceptional restaurant has been opened.
It's written in the language of love.
There you can look at a forest that's wide down there.
At the peaks of the country, the food industry will be able to find their lives in the mountain range of Longquan.
Getting to the restaurant requires a break between the trunks.
The restaurant opened to the rebels 19.9.2018.
Youtube comments are surprised where the restaurant is located.
The lack of a restaurant requires a good foundation, instead of being told.
This is how everything ends.
It's all going to be okay.
Today, this is what happens to the domestic landscape drama Corpela, which has been quite popular.
The third production year has gone like six languages: last week he saw the first of 722,000 Finnish TV.
There is no more practical value in the puzzles, since the series of Heikki Creator and Jukka Mäkis is not going on.
In the final period, the relationship between Jaskan and Mirk is again taken into consideration, and Yaska’s mother may think of it as the first thing I want to do.
Anssin and Miissa are also warm, in the light of recent events, they are romantic, but then the pictures again appear in Laiho.
The police are also suspicious of a man's relationship.
However, no one is able to predict the future of the Law.
Anita's got some incredible news on her behalf.
The last wish for a long time will be published, which will get a woman's daughter to the party.
After a week and a half, on Sunday evenings, Sorion will continue to reunite.
I'm having a party tonight on TV1 at 21:05.
Do you mind going to work in a small river tomorrow?
Here are the facts for and against.
Your flux is hot.
A lot of Arpos are staying home or not.
However, the job market supports the idea of encouraging others to suffer because the disease can be endured, even if its symptoms are small.
Outside of the flu, the symptoms of the flu are falling slowly between the outbreaks of hippies.
In the next option, you may already be suffering from others, even if your symptoms are small, tell the Prevention publication.
So why don't you just stay home?
Prevention says that fluid must be maintained even when the person has no symptoms.
The virus shall be kept for a day before the outbreaks begin and before the next five days a week.
Children may be more likely to suffer from disease.
As soon as you're aware of symptoms, you shouldn't be at school or at work.
You can go back to work when you cry and you're not angry anymore, says Dr. Gregory Poland.
Training is also a way to avoid.
It's too fast to get back to the island to slow down.
In addition, wash your hands, dry your nose and throw your dirty paper into your pocket.
But I'm not going to move?
If the home is to be removed as a disease, consider how to use it.
The mask doesn't like viruses in the corner, but the user's head is aware of the area.
Then you're not gonna put a rope in your mouth or your mouth, Poland says.
Also, the radiation is limited to the machine.
So how can you avoid the trauma?
The best way is still to wash your hands and avoid touching your growth.
However, it is difficult to avoid the consequences.
For example, in the United States, average blood pressure affects their eyes, noses or mouth between 15-30 seconds, Poland warns.

Three years ago, Alina met her current partner, Jonas Hurrin, who is known for the Pelicans River.
After the U.S.A., the ice schooler has played abroad, such as in Sweden and China.
In 2009, he was part of the Finnish team at the MMCs of 18 years.
In the early days of the conflict, the couple were in the middle of nearly a year, but later Alina was able to travel with her husband to the world.
If I were to get to the winner's club and then I'd be proud of it, I don't want to believe it would affect our relationship in any way.
Although we have to live separate lives, so we have trust working well and it is good for us to keep it all together in May.
The continued growth of joy, the death of our neighbors
Almost everyone is concerned about the sustainability of the planet.
Still, I don't want to let anything go.
Sustainable growth is sought for alternatives, but the theory of a fair economy also poses major problems.
The continued growth of the economy has led to a number of generations of ordinary people, especially in the northern part of the world, with a life of paganism, which before it was just a dream.
However, the long-term surplus and climate change in the world’s stocks will be at risk of being swallowed up by this market economy.

The police have arrested one person who may have contributed to the disappearance.
The police are also looking for a second case of suspicion.

Now they are being transferred by line-up to Tamperet, the daily head of the Jari Nieminen STT told him at one hour after night.
At the port of Vijala, ambulances were warned to take away abandoned passengers.

Ex-managers require Robert Heleneus to pay unpaid wages
Nickentist Robert Heleneus's night of action against Erka Teper is saving money.
At night-Sanomat reported today's turnout manager Jaakko Helmen and deputy director Jussi Kokkyla's application for a challenge, with a total of over EUR 80 000 for outstanding managerial bills.
According to the challenge application, Helminen and Kokkyla worked for Helenuk 15.4.2014-30.1.2015.
We've tried to agree, but there's no other option.
There has been a clear performance here, and a lot of work has been done, Kokkila tells the night Sanomi.
The current manager of the resurrection sent Markus Sundman to the contrary at night, telling of the incident in the sight of the poet.
Helenius argues that he is obliged to pay the amount required.
According to the reply, Kokkila and Helminen had offered their services in an economically supportive position to Helenuks and had agreed to be able to arrange for the proceeds and sponsors.
It was certainly agreed that Helenius is obliged to pay wages only as a percentage of his earnings.
It was repeatedly confirmed that Helenius does not need any payment, but only receive the income they arrange for.
This is also normal and only practice in the management of professional trainees.
The strike has never been agreed upon, and this would also have been an orderly case in the case of Heleneu, which Sundman will find in his message.
No written agreement was ever made on cooperation.
According to the answer, Helenius had initially wanted a suitable income in writing, but Kokkila and Sundman had been born before the end of 2014.
He presented the proposal for his own sake as a candidate and terminated his cooperation with Kokyla and Helms.
Helenius did not take part in his dealings with Kokyl and Helmen.
After the end of the year of cooperation, Helenuks had been shown to be "unclassified but not limited" to the work of the manager.
This year you have been raised on the same claim.
Helenius considers the successors of Helmenas and Kokyla to be a powerful, contrasting activity.
Today, Helenus is dealing with the IBF's seven-year-old heavy line in Erka Teperin Stuttgart.

We have also been very successful in our partnership project, and in addition, the production of world Cups has been at the top of the competition.

Sari Piippo left his career in Brussels and became a homemaker in Finland - I remember two ideas about the series: lack of training was not delayed
The attack of nature started at one time on my husband's divorce, where he proposed that he develop it as a person in history, tells an espoolian serialist, homewife and former EU translator, Sari Piippo.
Seri Piippo tells us that he has been an EU translator of economic and legal matters in Brussels until ten years later from the family of the fourth child.
I'm really sorry to be home.
This has been the best time of my life, but at some point it came to mind what it would be like when a little child began to be big.
Then, in 2014, the picture became a series picture.
Piippo tells me that he never dreamed of making a series, even though he had read Ak Ankka, Tintt and Asterix little.
I had been confined to my last childhood, but when these Genesis records began to be born then the situation changed.
At first, I did a few ten handcuffs at the window desk.
My daughter Vivi Valkama (s. 2000) is probably a border guard, but I didn't get her excited until mid 2016 when I gave her a visa with the help of a border guard.
His whole life lasted like a decade's stripe, and then he had to start trying to make a play of Philippo, who told him that he was a great promoter.
It's easy, and it's a tool to try to get something early.
I didn't even try to limit the paper, says Pippo's relationship with what he usually spends at night.
Handcuffs continue to appeal to my mind, but I don't usually prepare once.
Three rounds of strip is going even more than an hour.
I think I'm gonna do my lunch once, and I like to play with the colors.
The start of the restriction is always difficult because the restriction is not a strong gene.
Sari Piippo tells her valuable stories about the current pictures, including Scott Adams Dilbert.
The L-theme of the nature attack has been inspired by a mother of porcine who has a saltwater flu.
The other people are men, Psychiatrics and Caxos.
In the world of nature, man is what he eats.
The ideas of the series come from their own life and social media.
Seri Piippo doesn't want to send or offer a package even if it's the Creator’s will for a while.
The boy tells his story to his husband and his children.
It's such a great feeling when she looks at her haircut and realizes that I've done this today.
And the challenges are enough for your parents!

Rehn focused on Europe's conclusion to its trade: "Look at the next tweet"
The trade between the United States and China will be restored to the whole world economy.
In all Europe, growth increases have been estimated and Finland's Bank has also slightly reduced its economic growth estimates.
President Olli Rehn said that while there is no direct impact on European trade unions, it undermines confidence, which is due to reflect on corporate investment decisions.
The situation also concerns the export of Finnish companies.
In my view, Europe is a very broad one.
It has succeeded in building an interconnected environment with the United States and is also involved in a peaceful situation with China and Japan.
Europe does not consider Rehn to be the feet of a fragrant trade war.
We need to look at the next tweet and then evaluate it.
We have an unprecedented time with my partner in Washington, but he said in the challenge.
Europe also has its own risks.
One of these is the third largest national economy in the euro area, Italy, which is also one of the most indebted countries in the euro area and the whole Western world.
Last night, the markets reacted to the clear budget of the Italian Government's Thursday evening.
First of all, more than 2.4 per cent of the product in the country is needed for the first year.
Rehn thinks the Italian situation is worrying.
Five per cent of the country's legislation is a problem credit, and there are over 10 per cent unorganised loans.
In addition, its public economy is in the wrong hands and the country shows its commitment to its European partners again.
It may not be possible to support the landing of new crises, Rehn replied when he was asked if Italy would take a new European economic crisis.
The second issue facing Europe is the difference between Britain and the EU.
Rehn hoped it would be okay.
Much more negative effects should be avoided from the dispute.
Rehn started as head of the Finnish Bank in July.
Mario Draghi, Head of the European Central Bank (ECB), will take over his duties after a year.
The debate with his followers has begun.
Both Rehn and his predecessor, Erkki Likasen, have been hated in their speech.
No doubt it is no offense if Finnish names are involved, Rehn said and added that he is not going to comment on this longer.
HS superseded Black Boxes will continue again next week - the last tickets in Helsinki are on sale
The best Black Tablet presentations organised by Helsinki Sanomien will continue again on the very beginning of the week.
Other presentations are presented in National Theatres 2, 8 and 11 October.
October 23rd Black Square is visiting for the first time in Tampere's theatre.
There's still some slippers on the national character.
Tampere's presentation has been finalized.
Lipput mey Lippu.fi.
The suppliers and artists present at the stage during the night will repeat a long-standing documentary that has not previously been published in any HS instrument.
There's something else I've never seen before.
"I am surprised at the blindness of Helsinki at night, to be able to report on the other side of the globe and to talk about a very timely health issue," says Esa Lija, one of the manufacturer of the Black plant.
After the presentation, the public has the opportunity to meet HS suppliers and artists and to continue the discussion.
Helsingin Sanomat has organized the evenings of living journalism for three years.
They were initially recommended and often final sales.
There's already been over 15,000 people on the scene.
From the black age, Bonnier was hired as a journalist for the year.
The recruiters were grateful for the new way to make journalism and the desire of journalists to get close to their readers.
In May 2019 the Black Star is seen in National Theatres in March-April.
The presentation will also be attended by Tampere and Turkey.
The presentation then shows different content than this one at night.
The missing wall was found because of "unprecedented trial"
The presence of Finnish police drone is the world's top: "We ask for training"
According to the Department of Police Department, the police can use drones in addition to the search for missing persons, for example in crime investigation and research.
The Ouija board succeeded in finding a missing porter's drone in Raha in just a few minutes.
Rector Kimmo Himberg of the Police Department of Education quoted the case and mentioned, inter alia, that "by means of an unpredictable experience and effective education we are the highest in the world".
Drone's really new arrest and it's even more new to the police.
There are no statistics that the Finnish police would be master of the use of drones.
According to Himberg, however, there is a strong attitude.
This has been demonstrated, for example, when the experience of the Finnish police has been reported in international events.
There's something else I'm particularly interested in, Himberg says.
It would have been very difficult for Turkish visitors to see the operation of the Finnish police.
We're being asked for training.
It's more common than ever.
Himberg recalls that finding lost in the winter conditions in Finland is as important as possible as possible.
As you can see, in the Raa's case, a drone was found only in a few minutes.
The Finnish police have already trained hundreds of drone pilots.
According to Himberg, they're meant to train more.
The drone is now being used in a lot of police activity, and its use is becoming public and increasing in the future.
That's what I believe.
In addition to searching for lost persons, the police may use drones in accident or crime investigation and in certain research activities.
For example, it is already necessary to use some area as far away as possible to fear that violence will be encountered there.
Drone can be used in advance.
Karjalan Rugby went up to the left side
Karjalan Rugby celebrates the victory of the 2nd division in Kuopios on Saturday.
The Joensulians were still in the middle of the race at the 7-12th floor of Helsinki Rugby Club, but they found in the second half of the summer and were baptized as guests in the south 26-12.
The master of the 2nd division was at the same time as the historical growth of Karjalan Rugby to the 1st division.
In the past, the track has been played in one but at that time the Finnish Ruggby series activity had been divided into two levels, the SM series and the multi-phase 1 division.
Seura's going to take a rowing place, but she's going to know a lot of work for the first time.
The current need for twenty-five players has to be raised to 25.
The 1-division also knows the growth of the number of games and the longer game trips, so the funding project must also be in line with it.
Kotkanym will start a long time in Montreal, strengthen the prime minister
Claude Julien, chief executive of Montreal Canadien at NHL, confirmed on Twitter that the Finnish ambassador, Jesper Kotkanemi, will start in Montreal a long time.
Montreal acquired the superpower of Kotkaniemen, 18, with the first round number three in the reserve.
The attacker was associated with the end of Montreal's exercise strength and has presented strong lessons in September's practice negotiations.
Kotkanym was immediately successful in his first exercise negotiations to make a map.
After the arrival of the results, President Julien was asked by the Finnish authorities to take major steps towards the development of the results.
NHL's chain line begins in the first week of Thursday night in Finland.
Montreal is located on the open-air tour of Toronto Maple Leafs.
What's a good leader?
This week in Finland, there's been a lot of leadership.
The president of the government of certain countries, Risto Siilasmaa, told HS's challenge in his book Paranoid Optimist, in which he exposes his philosophy of leadership.
At the same time, he appreciates the leadership of his predecessor Jorma Olila.
There was a strong criticism of the charges, but in the previous Nokia clarifications, the leaders' inability to act as a group was discussed; fear and uncertainty, which led to the collapse of the mobile phone business.
The company's growth rate has lost its ability to risk and sustainability.
The week in Helsinki also organized a business life event in the Nordic Business Forum, which was dedicated to the Centre for Trade in Finland.
In addition to Barack Obaman, 12 business countries' stars rose in the valley.
You need to talk about good leadership.
The head of the board of directors, Gary Hamel, said that a good leader should trust the company in the future even when the company goes well.
The problem is that decisions are made by those who are spiritualally most involved in past decisions.
John Mackey, founder of the World Foods marketing package known as a wide range of nature, said that the director had to share a message to the entire staff of the company.
And that can't be the only thing to do to the owners.
Susan Cain, who wrote of the book’s introverts, said that the most successful leaders were extremely humble.
They act peacefully, quietly and decisively.
They're often introverts.
Professor Aswath Damodara of the financial sector recalled that the qualities of a good leader should be shared with the life-cycle of the company.
At the start of the company, the manager must share a story on which the future of the company is based.
The growing company needs a leader who knows the numbers.
These teachers at the Nordic Business Forum listened to 7,500 visitors - mainly Finnish leaders.
They're in danger of having an information message.
A good leader needs a lot.
That's why driving goes so often, even at the highest level.
There were also Silesia and Ollila.
They talked to each other in church friendlyly.
However, perhaps they wondered whether they were the right leaders of Nokia at the right time.
And it wasn't easy to evaluate their humility.
Sara Chafak came to a beautiful red land directly from Los Angeles - spend most of his year abroad
But Sarah Chafak got to the missionary in a nice black neighborhood.
In 2012 there was also a long story in Miss Finland.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I came back from Los Angeles.
It's been a long time since I spent most of my time there, Chafak is telling me about his whereabouts.
Chafak tells me he's on his way to Los Angeles.
He's done some of the famous pictures.
In the United States, he describes himself as interesting and as similar in Finland.
In fact, he says he has to do more than that, because the model works are always easy to find.
It's gotta be tougher and be aggressive, Chafak says.
Coregraf Sonya Lindforss 30 000 euro live art - rent in Kuopios
Artist Sonya Lindfors won 30 000 euros of valuable cultural prizes in Kuopios on Sunday.
Anti Festival International Price for Live Art Award Lindfors works on choreography, community activism and teaching.
Sonya Lindfors' art is life-threatening to the nearest environment.
His work gives others the opportunity to work and create opportunities for dialogue in environments where they have been lost before, he describes the winner.
In addition to the Finnish Lindfors, there were a number of international artists.
The award is awarded annually to an artist or group of artists in the field of art.
The Danish police found Volvo looking for a large operation: "We can't tell you where"
The extensive search for the Danish police has resulted.
At the start of the operation, the movement was closed at the Jewish Union and the Ison-Belt.
All road and rail traffic on the island of Själlan was closed in Sweden, Germany and other Denmark.
The police are looking for a black Volvo V90 registered in Sweden.
The IS aimed at the head office of the Media Centre of the Copenhagen Police Centre.
The car you've been looking for has been found.
We can't tell you where the car was found. Henrik Storm tells Sanomi about the information from Köpenhamina's police to the Night Sanomi.
According to Storm, the black Volvola was looking for no direct contact with the police.
He thinks the biggest danger is over.
The Danish Extra Blade told the police yesterday about the intelligence situation.
The research director, Jørgen Bergen Skov, was responsible for the cost of fiatoneinin surgery.
He didn't want to tell me where the criminal is investigating it.
However, Skok said there's a "serious crime" in this case.
This was about the threat of human life.
There are three people in the operation.
The police don't tell us if they've been arrested.
According to the paper, restrictions on road transport have been lifted.
The police in the shop were also following the events on Twitter.
According to the STT, however, the large public is no longer concerned about the threat posed to certain people.
The name of Macedonia has resulted in decades of discrimination - now the people vote on the issue in the relevant elections
In the Balkans in Macedonia, the best proposal for a new country is to be voted for.
According to the Agreement between Macedonia and the Greek Governments, your name would be equivalent to that of Northern Macedonia.
Greece has thus been able to prevent its efforts to become a member of Naton and EU.
According to Greece, the name Macedonia belongs to the northern part of the country.
The question of national vote does not mention a new name, but it is known whether the voter supports Macedonia's EU and Nato membership by accepting the agreement.
The vote was launched online at least in the school in central Skopje.
At school, a retired nurse named Olivera Argirosvka hoped to support the contract.
The vote will mean a change if it opens the doors to Europe and Nato.
It means a change especially for young people, he said.
In 1991 the name of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia was used in official contacts with Macedonia.
The government of Prime Minister Zoran Zaev has campaigned for the adoption of the agreement.
Nationalist opposition to the rule of law, including President Gjorge Ivanov, has again been called upon to vote against the people.
In addition to the result, it is sufficient to increase the voting threshold by more than 50 per cent.
National vote is not binding, but the victory of the vote would allow the mandate to change the constitution.
A two-thirds majority of Parliament is required to change the Constitution.
The Greek Parliament must also adopt an agreement.
At 8:00 p.m., the voting places will be closed during Finland.
Come on! Come on!
Robert Helenius your brother, Erka Teperin
Robert Helenius later met with Erka Teper's heavy liner at a professional training course in Germany.
At 34 years of age, Finnish took a 36-year-old German counterattack in Waldenbuch, a village in the county of Stuttgart.
In the evening, the main proceedings were the Intercontinental proceedings of the IBF's heavy series.
Its winner may open up the opportunity to take up more difficult tasks on Sunday, which are of major economic importance.
Helenus would have decided to take the take in one of the eightties, when he threw Teper’s left arm over his left arm.
Teper was no longer able to get up from Latvia.
"Nordic Nightmore" hit his opponent in one of the thirds where Germans began to shed blood.
Helenus and Teper were on their way for the first time.
They had to be taken in December 2015.
Then Teper took you to the hospital and was taken away from the hospital.
After that, it became evident that the German had dropped twice in the doping test.
Helenius has brought out 28 of his professional staff and suffered two losses.
Teper has won 19 professional awards and lost three times in the course of the course.
In the case of a non-hospital settlement, it's 50 points between Vettelin and Vetteli.
The formula for each master was drawn up again as Mercedes Lewis Hamilton won Russia's gp and won his MM score in Ferrari Sebastian Vetteli for 50 points (306-256).
There's still five more.
Valtter Bottas, who left the port of Kisa, went second.
In the last year in Sotshi, where his uranium was taken by Bottas, it was supposed to be located in the middle of the gas station, but Mercedes ordered Botta to get rid of Hamilton.
Wettel started third, Ferrari Kimi's fourth.
Red Bull Max Verstappe was five.
Two of the bad guys in Joensusus... were stuck in the back of the card.
Two men were tortured by 31-year-old Joensus at 12:00 a.m. after 18:00 a.m.
According to the police, men also analyzed the victim's phone.
The police wanted to suspect that a 35-year-old man and a 39-year-old man who was interested in getting a card soon after it happened.
They were arrested as suspects of robbery, the police tell us.
The victim was given cancer vaccines that didn't require medical treatment.
Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla, will be the president of the company.
The mouse has agreed with the U.S. authorities.
At the same time, Musk has been allocated $20 million on television, which says he would have secured funding to remove Tesla from the purse.
The U.S. Securities Commission SEC has been accused of Moscow's securities issue.
Musk continues to be the provider of Tesla, but the company must also pay EUR 20 million if the agreement between the authorities and Muski is confirmed by law.
Canada is fighting time to get a match from the oil with the United States
Time is threatening to end between negotiations between the United States and Canada on the Free Trade Agreement on Oil.
The United States has been set up as a baker on Sunday, and the country's negotiating parties have discussed it in detail over the weekend.
The Chief Negotiator of Canada, Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland, gave his speech at the UN General Meeting so that he could focus on full trade negotiations.
On the request of President Donald Trump, the United States, Canada and Mexico, began negotiations about a year ago to renew the North American Free Trade Agreement on Nafta.
By the end of August, Mexico and the United States had reached the middle of the agreement, but the agreement with Canada had not yet been born.
The United States and Mexico wish to enter into force of the agreement before the Presidential elections of Mexico, Mr Manuel Lopez Obrador, who won, took office in early December.
Trump has said that the Canadian side is not necessary in the contract.
He has previously informed the Congress that the plan is to sign the contract at the end of November whether Canada is involved or not.
For these periods, the text of the Agreement between the United States and Canada should be prepared on Sunday so that the United States Congress will have sufficient time to assess it.
The neighbor thought of the fireplace in Kaakkuri - the prayer was announced to the place
On the other hand, the fire alarm was triggered by the fire alarm on Monday night by the fire department in Kaakkuri.
The site was notified to the ten-year relief plant because of the possible reporting bill.
The site would find out that the firehouse doors burned at the entrance had appeared against the house, so it was reported to the emergency center.
There was no fire in the area.
The police arrested 11 people after the Hong Kong-HJK trial - in the field and in the metro station
The police arrested individuals on Sunday afternoon following the training of the HJK-HJK football team in Espoo, the West New Police Commissioner Theemu Värtinen confirmed to the STT.
As a basis for non-inhibiting was the protection of crime and disturbance.
The arrested was released after the situation had calmed down, Valtine said.
He told me earlier about the Night-Sanomat.
The deal ended 0-0.
After the end of the campaign, a large group of HJK's supporters were surrounded by spectators from the scene.
The situation led to a breakdown and a riot between the supporters of the groups.
In order to end the situation, there was also a need for train police.
In addition to Kent, the operation took place in a nearby metro area, where some of the interesting events took place.
I wasn't at the place, but what I saw here, so the situation must have been awkward, Valtine's reference to what happened in the field.
I believe that no crime has been reported as a result of the events.
The window led to the creation of its SE-time in the world's manculation, and also at the end of the day
Jenna Luukkanen and Riku Pöytäkiv have made progress to the finals on the day of the World Cup 3/7 competition in the Netherlands.
You know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know,
The HSS's Protocol opened up a 50-metre front in Finland, where it was the second time of 2282.
Earlier in September, Pöytäkiv took a trip to Helsinki to SE time 22.77.
Ari-Pekka Luukkonen, representing the Espoola of Cetus, was born at 24:68.
Swimming Club Vukatin Luukkanen was at the beginning of the first six months at 30,48 and before the final.
At the beginning of the two thousand - foot - long [2.14.25 m] sequential course, the 15th was at 2.14.25.
Students show a rare feeling: the ancient tragedy - scared Orestia affects the vision
The tragedies of antibiotics are rare in Finnish sights.
For example, the National Theatre has recently seen an ancient tragedy, Sofoklen Filokte, in 1988.
Now the Theater University brought the National Theatre to the start of the race, once only as a whole, a complete sample of the arthrology, Aisikylos Orestea.
In early 2015 Lavat opened! projects at the Theatre School of Exhibitions are working internationally with a professional director.
This fourth project, like the first one, is directed by Mikko Roiha, who lives in Berlin.
Oreste was born in Berlin in April.
The Russian accord from Russia strengthens the report on the completion of the bloodbath of Atreus, which was destroyed and the birth of the rule of law for 20 minutes, especially by clarifying red blood cells.
The work succeeds in being very faithful to the soul of Kirsti Simonsure in his excellent Finnish (2003).
The dramatic lights and the theater pages of the presentation highlight the embodimented and church-like reflection.
Its center is the dynamics of the events of the race, of the nominees, and of the deaths.
The presentation uses both two- and three-digit denominators.
The exhibitors were not removed from the scene at all, so, for example, the killings of Agamemnon and this military base of Kassandra are shown by display, other than those of ancient history.
Toki's presentation is not to be stressed that he's not an anti-primary tradition.
In front of the viewer’s eyes, a modern, faithful translation of the text is created, which is constantly known for its ritualistic.
The roach has succeeded in getting the master-level exhibitors into a close group, acting as one organism, and a group of rats.
In particular, in black-sighted, well-expressed, well-smokered group systems, exhibitors will be able to gain their rights in the background, only by using white exclusion, by showing them.
That's impressive.
The presentation of Orestea continues in the theatre of Kouvola and Oulu.
The Korean manufacturer prepares his first water pump
The innovation is beginning to be seen in Europe, in particular in terms of cooperation with Hydina and Switzerland with H2 Energy.
According to a cooperation agreement published by Hannover IAA, Hyundai will provide a thousand new models of the vehicle with the use of the health insurance company and its partners.
At that market, Hyundai continues to use the fuel-consumer truck with both Nexon and ix35/Tucson Fuel Cell models by referring to the road as the manufacturer of the vehicles.
In this quality of the world's first project, we will bring fuel technology to a much longer stage.
We also continue to look for opportunities to expand the market area of these vehicles by, for example, following the development of a tank network, Hyundai Motor Stockpiling Director In Cheol Lee said that the contract was published.
The Nyrks flew several times into the Kayana
A little over three-thirds of the man was ill-treated by three men at a restaurant in central Kayana and its representative on Sunday morning.
The man first found one man inside the restaurant, and as a result he was removed from the place.
Outside, he would work for another man, and in the absence of a third man, an evil officer found him.
The police arrested the suspect.
The police officer was still aggressive, and he was going to shoot another cop at his feet.
The man also threatened the police with ill-treatment and murder.
The man was taken out to rest.
The matter will be examined as a three-way complaint and as a violent response by the official.
In the centre of Kajaan, the Mediterranean also suffered another form of ill-treatment on Saturday morning.
The victim was a victim of two men.
At about 20 years of age, a kayanaman found a victim.
A little later, another man killed him on the ground, and the man who had earlier betrayed another victim.
The outsiders lured criminals away from the victim and the police were called into the area.
However, the factors are expected to leave before the police arrive.
The police will ask the eyewitnesses of the event to contact the Kayan police phone 0295 416 520 or by e-mail researchta.kainu@polisis.fi.
Long line radio driver Erkki Pälli is dead
Erkki Pälli, known as a longer-term supplier, went on to eat at 83 years of age.
Radio driver Erkki Päll, 83, is dead.
He went to his payroll without any improvement, which he told on his Facebook page in March 2018.
Yeah, it's gone now.
The doctor has also said it, once a day of life, he commented on the situation for the night months ago.
The safety of trade mark and seat belts shall be ensured
For the first time in 1984, I received an award for the press.
When some of these years have come to an end, it is usually about the same news.
When I wrote (Karjalinen, 27.9) about the safety of the small business workers, I was surprised and angry for a moment.
I also talked about the case of the Service Union of Experts (PAM) of the Environment Commissioner Erika Käärä.
He says the crime statistics don't tell the real situation.
The problem is growing, even though employers of course claim to be different.
The police's knowledge is only going to clearly worsen cases and many of the right violence will remain unreported.
"The companies have this obligation to statistics closely based on their current situation of safety at work, but these statistics remain in use and do not collect their information at all," he said.
The human bugs don't end up in statistics.
In cases of violence, there has always been the problem that physical injuries do not always occur.
Psychiatric traumas can be much more serious than blacks and wounds.
The difference between violence and the threat of violence is difficult to bear when a certain level of aggressive threat is to be calculated as violence - even if it is not possible to use it.
Too many people are afraid of their jobs, even if they don't have a real thing to do.
Some residential areas are uneven.
The store's got guards.
At the time of the opening hours, there was also a apparent delay in the media from its impact on the safety of the sellers.
"Then, in time, many employers organized guards' services at least at night to avoid working alone," Khehrä commented.
When nothing happens, we make the wrong decision.
This would seem to have had an effect now, but this creates a new negative trend.
When the precautionary situation remained well controlled, it was thought that the precautionary procedure would not be necessary.
In many places today, they are seeking solutions that may remove expensive security services.
A good feeling of injury is an expert, and it is very understandable that the sellers of the injury did not want to make an investigation into a criminal who usually lives in the mail.
However, according to the 2011 law, a low level of ill-treatment will become a subject of the prosecutor if it occurs at work.
I think we need pre-trial cases now.
When the next time the trader or his father is arrested, the police should investigate and accuse the prosecutor.
If justice were to take some of the perpetrators to prison, and they would be punished with severe punishment, they would be punished.
A society where food trade must also be open to small towns almost overnight will ensure the safety of trade workers.
Heidi Sohlberg told Miss before the start of the mission - "Sara, Iiro is married then"
I don't see a funeral this year in a traditional way on TV, but the post shows a Viafree page.
The letter was sent by Ms. Heidi Sohlberg and Mr. Viasat and the father of the NHL and KHL studios Iiro Harjula.
Janni Hussi works as the backstager and the red floor.
Before sending directly, the news officer told the local callers and the media about the cost of sending.
At first, Sohlberg asked the public to give Harjula adjoining apples.
Now all the women are fucked up!
Now look at this our husband, Sohlberg broke up with his colleague in public.
Etrusive cheeses follow a lot of other things in the years of Miss Finland.
Among other things, Sara Chafak and Sara Sieppi were sitting next to each other and Sohlberg threw a small piece of shit into the direction of the other.
Sara, Iiro's married!
Sohlberg would read me looking at Sararo.
Which is more likely to refer to Sohlberg by referring to the very different Sieppi, who drew attention to the comment, even though it seemed to start out of surprise.
Sippi spoke for the first time in the evening of Sanomi's weekend.
The Missile said he didn't want to open up the cause of the difference more precisely in public because it's between him and Roope Salsie.
He said he didn't have a speedy relationship, but he's gonna focus on himself.
I'm focusing on my own affairs and especially on my own life, Sara Sieppi told me.
Harjula’s marriage certificate was issued at a later stage when Sohlberg was forced to call Janni Hussia and Iiro Harjula into the parish.
The three of us were laughing at each other.
Irohan was married or how did it go?
Janni Hussi's getting out of here.
The basic man endured his gun wound by throwing, burning and feeding a heavy bag
On the other hand, the law of the north has sentenced a 34-year-old man to three years in prison for a number of crimes committed by his divorce in Kokkola.
The crime instrument included night, cabals and nipples.
The Court ruled that the State had lost its power.
You know, I'm afraid I'm wondering why I'm here.
However, this charge was rejected.
The reason for this was the fact that there were four forms of torture, one of which was cruel, one which was cruel, one which threatened the establishment, one which was free of charge, the other which was responsible for the loss of freedom and two injuries.
The offences took place between 26 March and 24 May.
The man was arrested and imprisoned a few days later.
In the past week, the Northern Hemisphere court granted its judgment and sentenced him to 34 years in Vaasa prison.
No evidence of pregnancy
Between 34 years of age, two cases of deprivation of liberty were also reported and two cases were reported on 22 May.
However, these charges were denied in truth.
The case was handled at the back of the doors closed in court.
However, the Court of Justice gave the judgment in public order.
According to the Court of Justice, he had been accused of resorting to violence, threats and forced labor in situations in which it had been linked.
The blame was placed on the victim by means of a washing machine, a smoker, a thick casket, and water and coffee were poured over it.
In that case, the right of the State would have been set up as a missing criminal instrument: iron and cable, as well as clay, as well as clay, as well as clay.
Four Witnesses
According to the Court of Justice, the parties continued to cooperate between the facts.
It is clear from the case-law that most of the worst acts took place at the end of the crime.
Four witnesses were heard in court, two women and two men.
At 34 years of age, victims will be paid compensation for the loss of weight, weight, suffering and temporary harm totalling EUR 5800.
He probably has these money because he's already committed to old age.
Prison sentence is not a man's first.
In the evening no name is given for the protection of the victim's personal identity.
The Court of First Instance is not competent in writing.
The Ryder Cup solution for Europe's four points
European golf professionals were imprisoned on Sunday for their traditional competition against the United States.
Europe will lead the player Ryder Cupia score 10-6 while there are still two games to play on Sundays.
Europe won three of the four rounds on Sundays, and the winnings were 2-2 in the afternoon.
The European leader was Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, who won dinner and lunch all four couples playing.
In the past, there has been no European flag.
On Sunday, both of them are going to have more history.
No European player has won five points together in Ryder Cup, and no American has been able to play like three players: Arnold Palmer and Gardner Dickinson (1969) and Larry Nelson (1979).
HJK will judge his supporters' borders in Hong Kong: "The strength does not belong to the football"
The HJK’s soccer team will publish Sunday information that will judge its supporters in the southern FC Hongka valley in Tapiola.
"We are sorry for what happened after the Hong Kong-HJK trial," says the report.
After about 50 HJK supporters from around you in the field, the part seemed to attempt to challenge the problem with Hong Kong supporters.
There was also a gap between the supporters.
The police, as well as the trainers, were not allowed to rest.
HJK will inform the group that players and actors have been affected by the event.
The events following the adoption are not always in line with the values we observe at 111 years of age.
"We are talking about everything from action that threatens the safety of the incidents," says the report.
HJK agrees to assist authorities and event organizers in resolving and eliminating hazardous factors.
The support culture is part of the football field and an important issue for HJK.
We support all ways of positive, joyful and encouraging action in football fields.
"It's not part of this," says the report.
The Philippines pilots fly in a drone car - so they avoid traffic noise
Mendiola is a Filipino poet, hip-hop dancer and some Pelle Peloton.
He now belongs to a growing group of people in the world who swears in their own cars or at least their own version of it.
For example, he has competitors such as Audi and Airbus.
However, Mendiola does not believe in mass production.
According to reports from around the world, a man has used a large part of his property to build his dream.
Six years ago, he started developing his flying car.
Now he's calling the development version a drone car.
Later on, he says he made his first successful test flight... he stepped up his gear at a height of more than seven meters.
One of his goals was to avoid traffic accidents.
I hope that the device will produce positive reactions.
This was just a dream five years ago, Mendiola said according to British Daily Mail.
JHL foretold: Tomorrow's work start in children's day care and social and health services
In the public and well-being sectors, starting tomorrow's work and shifts, particularly in social and health services as well as in day care for children, JHL's President, Mr Niemi-Laine, said.
The effects will be wide and they will certainly be seen in a way that is not sufficient for the staff at the place.
Everyone has to think about how they're looking for their child.
The employer must now be careful that the services play and no one's spirit is in danger, Niemi-Laine tells the STT.
According to Niemi-Laine, there was also a low number of workers at the beginning of the year when the members of JHL were in the exchange of work and time.
The employers have made it possible through the flexibility that the staff have not been paid, but the workers have been left over or changed to months.
This isn't a job interview yet.
There is a high level of safety at work, and there is a high standard for each employee to be concerned about regular working hours and to do so only.
The JHL is opposed to the operation of the government's plans to improve the protection of small businesses.
The employer’s employer’s employer, Markku Jalonen, is not going to assess the effects of overwork and shift barriers.
However, he does not believe that they are very attractive, even though services may be weak.
Workers around Finland are aware of this and have made preparations for what is involved.
The area is so vast, social and health activities and the technical sector that it is difficult to say.
The effects can change a lot to industry, regions and employers, Jalonen told the STT.
In the past week, he says that experience has already been gained, including by the Superintendent and the Social and Health Professional Organization of Techy, for three days of continuous work.
Their effects were time-consuming.
The JHL's change in working and working conditions concerns, inter alia, the workers in the public, church, state and private social and health sectors.
For example, family day care providers are limited to outside.
At this stage, there are almost 100 000 members of the JHL.
According to Niemi-Laine, JHL's actions may last a long time.
The Annex has also been prepared for other work operations if the preparation of the irradiation line continues.
The government should now admit that this is a wall and a hard one.
From the point of view of the leg, both the ay movement and the government must come against it.
It's special here that the bones are already in the dark, although the presentation has not yet been given, Jalon's birthday.
Great Coralism is born with the power of children and adults - in the context of the presentation to learn about the lives of rice and seaweed
In the other rooms, the Great Corali Congregation received its first evening in Hamphur and the last afternoon it was presented in Finland the second time, this time in Cannelola.
In the way of the group's main works, the Great Coralirium is a work that is built from the beginning to the end together with the public.
This time, however, a clearer presentation will also be built, which will shape and cover the findings made in the practice of the beginning.
In theaters there are enough of hundreds or even of children with disabilities.
The child’s view has already been taken into account at the preparatory stage of the work.
However, the great Coralirium is not a childish presentation, but a presentation by adults and children in cooperation.
It gives adults information and findings about children’s habit of taking information against and making art.
The ability of children to avoid practice and joint games also enhance the distance between adults and children.
The great Coralirity also reminds some of some of the sand's sandballs, but it eventually comes to life in other non-human conditions around the visitors.
The great Coralirium begins with identifying corals and coral reefs of living organisms and fish movements.
In six different urban areas, the animals of the sea and the sea are also taught.
Finally, an hour - long measurable presentation will be made where music, lights, and contrasting paintings and trees will help you to know the life of coral reefs.
The Great Coralirium includes both people who observe the life of coral reefs and coral reefs that are being examined.
In addition, there are life-threatening coral reefs.
Many of the tests and findings that have been shown in the direction of many make the presentation difficult and exciting.
There will be a country of life, a country of inspection and a second life of life or a country - and all of this at the same time.
It doesn't seem hard for children.
In other areas, the group will try to exercise the idea and the scope of the action to which access is challenging when it consists of both children and adults.
On the other hand, the participation of children makes it more important.
After work, Sitratratri arranges a silent opinion on dangerous corals.
No matter how difficult it may be to understand what is important in the exercise of one’s self - consciousness in the face of disasters, there is no need to be consumed by disasters beyond human understanding.
In other places, they have built their work to respect the diversity of life as well as the political environment.
There are other cultures, other kinds of information, other types and future generations whose entertainment and entertainment are subject to this disorder.
Children grow up too fast - I'm happy that there wasn't any brainphones in my childhood.
Today's kids and young people are more responsible for it.
Young people start smoking and drinking all the time, younger and younger.
I think children should be children all their childhood, and they don't die because of days and sex, because others say they're doing it.
I was surprised when my friend told me he had to apply for a fifth grade for a "boy" trust weekend.
When he came to ask for forgiveness for his sister, this told him about his sexual encounters that evening.
I can't imagine my sister in the same situation, because we have been told and warned all our childhood that it is not possible to touch the sun and sex is a matter for adults.
I hope that today’s children will be able to live a decent life and not need to grow up because of peer pressure.
I continue to see more and more younger girls in Instagram, who are pictured as wearing masks and revealing clothes on their heads.
Snapchatta is used to take and send nightly images.
It's more difficult for girls to think what age they are.
The present 13-year-olds can easily appear from 18-year-olds and even older ones.
My childhood was made up of playing in the woods and playing chess.
I'm glad my childhood wasn't smart.
I've been a child for many years, and I didn't need to think about what others think of me.
Above: Officials have told the state situation that the case of Ariston Helmi is not related to national security
According to Ilkka Kanerva, the defence police and defence forces visited the Security and Foreign Affairs Committee earlier this week.
The Finnish Head of State has been told that Iriston Helmen is not currently studying the link between national security, but organised crime, Yle reported.
Ilkka Kanerva (kok), President of the General Defence Committee, confirmed the information of the missing sources.
According to Kenerva, defence forces and defence police visited the Committee on Defence and Foreign Affairs this week to conduct an ongoing investigation.
This is seen primarily as an economic crisis.
They were quite tired of not speculating that this would be different, Kanerva's comment on the challenge.
According to the above data, the safety material has not yet been shown to be related to national security, but the investigation is only in the area.
We can't know anything else about what can be seen there, one of the challenging facts of Ylen.
A week later, large-scale domestic residents from the island of Turu and the mainland have raised the question of whether it is just economic uncertainty or a threat to internal security in Finland.
Last night, it was made up of a case this week, which deals with claims both for and against.
Video: The dream was saved by Liverpool's death row
The percentage percentage of Liverpool Valioliiga's initiative came to a conclusion, but it was still more satisfied with the group's 1-1 level at Stamford Bridge.
Sunday will be the last year when Manchester City arrived at Stamford Bridge and sought a 1-0-way trip.
And then the Pep Guardola system sent a whole of the Valioliga signal that the City was now in fact.
Everyone remembers how it ended last time.
And certainly the manager of Liverpool Jörgen Klopp reached the same ideal in West London.
The Reds had begun with the six final victory of Valiolia.
Liverpool became stronger and, in particular, Virgil van Dijk felt that he alone was in control of his own destiny.
In Chelsea there was, for example, an average week’s great trip from Anfield Road.
At that time, Eden Hazard rose from the alternative to resolve the issue with a wonderful individual direction.
Now, of course, Hazard was with me right now from the beginning.
Twenty-five minutes later, he returned to a small three-player game with Matthew Kovacic and Jorgen.
Finally, Croatia saw Hazard's food supply before and sent a full weighted surplus to it.
Hazard was thinking of a small area of punishment, but he bombed from there a perfect left road to the back.
The half-brassor Alison was a little slow in his fight and got no more than a ball on his back.
Klopp must have felt that the death scene was a bit unfair, as soon after Antonio Rüdiger broke Mo Salah's lead map.
On the other hand, Chelsea Vesser Kepa also came into the truth.
The Baskwart quickly responded to the Sadio Mané storm and worked at the top of the tower as a dome.
On the other hand, because of Alison's refusal to fire, Alison went through Hazard.
The best place for the wheels came in 72 minutes when James Milner found his central Bobby Firmon.
However, the brassitah forest was headed for the village of David Luisa, who saved his father’s leadership.
So it didn't last 89 minutes when an alternative man, Daniel Sturridge, came free to shoot 25 meters.
Sturridge played an old home stadium, and the attacker bombed it as an unreceptive vehicle.
Liverpool's percentage of overruns came to a decision at 1-1 level, but it's still in a surplus - together with Manchester City.
Chelsea is also clearly involved in the master's performance two points behind the scenes.
In the case of kelon transfer, the potatoes are deep
I remember when a newspaper ten years ago asked different Finnish actors what to share with the people of Finland.
The answer to Juice Leskise was the only one that remained in mind: Your head.
Some of them have nin-heads and others don't.
The jakoline can only be born, and there was one offer here.
Finland has been given EU time to end the annual transition.
Many feel the same way about two times a year the wave movement has caused many of the problems of fraud.
Finally, this achievement is at least the easiest solution in Finland, even if it has been easy.
The problem is now to decide which time will finally end: the current summer or winter or some other period of time.
This will also enable the people to say their opinion on the page.fi.
The question has been opened by the Ministry of Transport and Communications, and it is open to spring 12 October.
The discussion will be conducted in coffee table and social media, and everyone has a say in his speech.
Day-to-day defenders base their position on the influence of the morning on the well-being of the people and the summer on the effect of the night on the outside of the people and through it on the well-being of the people.
Both are bound by their endurance and good reasons for it.
According to studies, morning light is also a part of a person’s day and gives an office.
On the other hand, if you do not suffer in the dark, increase your awareness of people's movement outside and give you better opportunities for, for example, to hot spots.
The number of additional hours has already been calculated after normal working days.
I wish I could take both of them, but the worst place for us in the north corner of the world is that we can't do anything.
The roofs are too dark and are too bright for many people in any case.
The discussion on a typical subject is that our own views and our other views are strongly opposed.
You don't listen to the arguments on the contrary, because it's important what you feel about yourself.
Since almost everyone has opinions on this matter, there is someone who needs to try to turn the other head.
That's where you're going back to the garbage.
The subject is an easy argument because it does not require a great deal of pressure and for reasons enough mutual awareness.
In general, there is a more complex and unproductive dispute about the types of things that are at stake.
You'll regret it if the wrong option becomes a complaint, but I don't think it's appropriate.
And always it also offers a suitable sin if life feels about it.
Josba fought against this foreign force.
Josban's first tour of the Saliband in Divary produced three series points against Nurmon Jyuma.
From Seinjjjjoj to the home base of 6-5 (3-1, 0-3, 3-1) wins.
Nurmo was still in the country at the beginning of the third time, but Joseph sought compositions and turned men into castes.
During the period 50.47 brothers Eetu and Juuso Lettinimen were fighting 6-5 fighters.
In the winter of both groups, decisive minutes were played on the balance sheet.
Josban was most effective in Lithuania (2+1).
The caskket was also powerful when Teemu Tukhnen (1+1), Jere Karatinen (1+0) and Jere Kettunen (1+0) also appeared.
Mika Kosonenek (1+0) played his painting at birth in a double box.
Josbala has six points after the three series.
In contrast, O2-Jyväsky will be visited after two weeks.
I'm going to church every Sunday for 200 years.
The 200th anniversary of the church will be delivered on Sunday morning, partly in very serious emotions.
A week later, the church’s riot broke out.
I was kept in custody of the church two nights after the fire.
Despite the storm today, there is a party place.
Although no one would want to do so, the church of Enon is now the oldest church in the congregation of Joensuu.
In the middle of the church, there has always been Eno's heart in all the world's civil and other alliances.
The family starts at Eno church today at 10 a.m.
After that, they are transferred to the congregation hall at the end of a wooden table.
The programme has a long day of all kinds inside and outside.
For example, church buildings can be found in the rest of the world, with the education of 37 - year - old Ari Räsäsen.
The Church's birthday also means the end of one period.
Already removed from use, the congregation office built in 1982 will have opened its doors for the last time today.
Now they're in the offices in the old hall, Captain Marku Koistinen says.
The congregation destroyed internal problems, but the church has stood in good stead for 200 years.
Elon Musk claims to be the head of the Government of Thessaloniki - Petos' charges were settled at $40 million
The manufacturer of Tesla and the supplier of the company Elon Musk have agreed with the US Securities Market Authority SEC.
SEC questioned Muski’s alleged securities issue, and Musk was at risk of being forced to separate from the company’s establishment.
However, must continue as Tesla's delivery director.
Instead, Musk has to defend the President of the Government of Thessaloniki for three years.
The company has to hire the president of the foreign government.
The muscle also needs to be monitored more closely.
According to the agreement, Teslan should pay two independent leaders and should continue to monitor the communication of Musk.
In addition, Tesla and Musk pay both 20 million dollars (about EUR 17 million) to adjust the case.
"The decision is to prevent new market disturbances and the damage caused to the Tesla shareholders," said President Steven Peikin of SEC.
The event started in August when Musk wrote on Twitter that he could take the company out of the press.
Musk also wrote that the company's funding is secure.
Twitt was temporarily released from Teslan's share course.
SEC questioned Muskin's guilt for securities.
According to the Office, the tweet was false and misleading, and Musk had not talked about the arrangement with other directors or potential financial intermediaries.
In practice, the agency accused Moscow of misdirecting investors.
The SEC announced its challenge to the rights of the company and of Muski on Friday.
The SEC said that Musk would be judged on the grounds and that he would no longer be able to act under the control of the Persian companies.
The SEC challenge has been met by investors, and Teslan's share has gone down into power.
Over 800 people died in Indonesia's aftermath and tsunamis.
In Indonesia's earthquake and subsequent tsunamis, the number of deaths has increased to at least 832:, according to AFP, according to the country's disaster agency.
The number of deaths is still believed to be growing because the resolution of the destructions is at the centre.
According to former President Yusuf Kallan, the final number may rise to thousands.
The traditional landscape rose to a tsunami that attacked the city of Please, located on the island of Sulawes.
A warning was given immediately after completion of Tsunami, however, which was immediately withdrawn.
According to the authorities, almost all the dead who are in the knowledge are at least twice as likely to be from Palu.
The rescue authorities are concerned, among other things, about the region of Doghra, located in the centre of the settlement, where the situation is still quite uncertain.
Now many people know that they're dead.
Rouen applications for aid
The Indonesian army has been warned to help rescue workers find victims.
President Joko Widodon, who arrived in the area of destruction today, urged soldiers to continue their rescue without delay day and night.
One central point for rescue is a hotel located in Palu, where 50-60 people are still believed to be in ruins.
The head of the rescue department, Muhammad Syaugi, told us that one person was killed last night at the ruins of the popular Roa-Roa Hotel.
We also heard people's requests for help, he told me.
According to I am concerned, the final and tsunami area would quickly find a heavy amount of radiation.
Many Indonesians have turned to Facebook and other social media to find their loved ones who are missing.
Help me, you in Palu and the neighborhood.
My friend's family members are still in bed, one writer invited me to the Facebook group.
Number of political phone calls per year to deal with obstacles in Britain
Many British politicians had to be disturbed when their contact information was published because of the shortcomings in the application.
The obstacles were due, inter alia, to the number of ministers.
In this respect, the application was made to the United Kingdom Conservative Party meeting in the Government.
For example, British Minister for Environment, Food and Agriculture Michael Gove and former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson had to be disturbed.
A lot of people were getting trouble calls.
Due to the lack of confidentiality of the application, the public was able to apply to policy profiles which were a conservative party in the mobile application of the annual meeting.
The public was able to access profiles using the e-mail address of the policy, which was easily available on the network.
The profile writer was able to view and form the content stored in the profile.
Someone succeeded in changing for a moment Boris Johnson's profile as a porn star and the titler.
Michael Goven's profile was changed by the media module Rupert Murdoch.
The Guardian wrote that Dawn Foster described the problem by writing that the meeting was allowed to write to other people’s profiles in these e-mail addresses.
Writers can then check the profile profile data and even send messages in these names.
The application was made by the public opinion of each supplier, policy and participant, Foster.
The information officer of the Conservative Party asked for an apology.
He said that technical problems were resolved and the application now works safely.
The UK IT support the data year.
The application created an Australian Crown Comms company.
The opposition's party considers that the Conservative Party cannot be trusted in security matters.
The Wall of Finland has a large number of Polishmen every week.
Careful observers took note of the results of the study release of The Wall Finland.
The Wall quickly spread the United States format around the world to the Finnish version of Nero last Sunday.
The Hickki Paasossen parent game show is described in Poland in the same study where other international productions are produced.
In the Polish study, the possibility of drawing was exceptional, since the format required space for a 12 - foot - high [12 m] high performance.
During the initial period of social media, a program was presented, which was translated into Polish.
On Twitter, the office was discussing whether the Polish people in the study were sitting in the fields of the game playing in Finland.
The Head of Fourth Home Programmes Unne Sormunen highlights the matter for the Night.
He tells us that the studio is close to the players, other Finnish, non-Muslims living in Poland, as well as well as Polish viewers.
The public is composed of international players in Finland, as well as the generals of The Wall in the same production sector in other countries.
In Finland there are also such distortions, such as the so-called professional journals, which are used in various programmes, to remind Sormune.
He recalls that following up on the game itself is not so difficult, even if it is not understood in the language in which it is played.
It's easy to separate red and green from the wall.
However, there are translation teams in the Viera language study that handle translation.
There are two translations that explain the same interpretation to the studio director all the time.
And then the studio director will direct the audience and tell us what passes there for example are thrown out and what situation is going on, Sormunen says.
He compares the situation to the way David Hasselhoff was presented in domestic production.
David Hasselhoff was a few years ago with Talent in Finnish pictures with us in Finland.
He was given a full-time parallel interpretation, and he knew everything that was said in the pictures, the sum of Sormun.
Japan's southernmost damaged tifuna is heading towards the accessory - the authorities warn of earthquakes and floods
Officials also warn of possible earthquakes and floods.
At least 50 people have been killed in the Taifuun Tram, but authorities say that such attacks have been avoided and there is no second information about the death penalty.
On the southern island of Okinawa, the wind has been so severe that it has turned cars around.
According to the NHK radio company, people have been evacuated from their homes and electricity has been cut off from over 300,000 households.
Over a thousand planes have been set up, and the crew are in a position to stop them because of the mist.

Tokyo's capital is not directly on the coast of Turkey, but it also has heavy winds and bridges.
Christmas has been established in Tokyo today.
According to scientists, Trami suffers from pain in Japan for months.
I've got my hair cut off from me.
The beginning of summer has been bad.
The sky is almost as long as the group disappears on Saturday at home for Vaasan Sport as much as 3-6 (0-2, 0-3, 3-1).
The police now have five rear endpoints, and the points from the six rounds are in the case of two.
None of the Asian defenses or two lower cats' players have yet to make a map.
The stress is also growing all the time.
Against sports, you've managed everything by the time the game was almost half past.
Six games are just played, and of course there's no reason to break up.
I'm worried it'll have to be because we failed to play it.
Especially the second time the presentation was devastating, assymptos 1+2 performed by Jarno Kärki told him.
The sport won, of course.
The group had a game under the parenthesis, so it'd have been thought to be visible.
Maybe it did, but Essat didn't make any use of it.
The number of visits on the day of the week continued to increase
On Saturday's mother, Pirkko Hyvärinn is amazed by the overall number of events in the exhibition hall.
So it was thought that maybe not so many people this year would come, the Hybrid will meet in the morning.
In September 2017, the SMs of the Tractoricinn were organised at the same time as Saturday, so there would be expectations that the overall amount could be even slightly lower than the previous year.
On the other hand, there was a change; the users were already heavily supported before ten, the sellers told the product's end, the new stock was sold earlier than 500 doses and the number of cars had increased.
The rating of the travel period has been about 6000, Your Grace will tell you later in the evening.
At five o’clock in the morning and in the evening, there was a lot of program for children, which would also attract them to a preview place.
In addition, the High Commissioner estimates that it will take longer.
And the salesmen also map to Lipper every year from the capital of the region.
This year, almost one hundred producers, distributors of products of textiles, textiles and fur products had arrived at their bakery.
On Saturday's Eve's mother, Pirkko Hyvärin, admired the general interest in the appearance of the hall.
At the start of the day, a hundred were blessed.
In the children's series, Teija Kivinieme's beautiful play won a public vote.
The children’s competition reached 11 different forms.
Winner Marjatta Vebsäläinen held the day at the March border.
7 x pretty bright - you know a good lamp from this
Get up in the spirit, create the right feeling of intrusion and read the book with your eyes closed.
You're going to have a good night's sleep.
We gathered together three good reasons to contribute to the enlightenment.
Vinkit gave Innoluxin marketing and marketing director Tarja Jokinemi.
Do Service to Your Eyes
The importance of fraud is growing, as the years of age are behind it.
In sufficient light, we can help many with problems that come to many through age when the accuracy of the vision decreases and there is still much more to be done.
Parents also need to grow in light.
The sixteenth needs light three times more than the twentieth.
Thus, the effects of light and light on the effects of light are already on the health of the tongue.
A good light gives enough light, but it's not too late, someone's fault.
Create the beauty of your surroundings
The beauty of the interior only comes to light in the right way.
The content of this moment has a choice.
There is a Japanese style that combines ethics, Scandinavianness and Japanese.
On the other hand, modern and play-inspired retrotyyl has also been inspired by a strong color, metal or ice color.
The aid goes the same way as the house itself in other parts of the world.
Materials now see wood, concrete, ceramics, paper, leather and bamboo.
Display Your Self - Sacrificing Spirit
Now more than ever before, the house has become a way of freeing itself.
Instead of mass production, they want to have a conversation at home, rather than a conversation that has a story to tell.
People are clearly looking for Finnish and Nordic products whose origins and designers are known.
So be very design-information, Jokinemi says.
You don't have to get home a new trendy class, but you don't think it's a classic that's been saved for years.
Some unintended, complex and elegant classics keep their surface from year to year, says Jokinemi.
Thank you and I see you.
KooKoo showed the door to the Canadian player after three games
KooKoon and the attacker Brendan O'Donnell's roads are up.
The Canadian football player played three Extra-trainings without any operations, KooKoo tells you when he knows.
O'Donnell moved to KooKoo in August with a one-year contract that included a long period of hardship at the end of September.
In the last 26 years, the attacker played Kulund Red Star on the KHL and KHL on the KHL farm in KHL in Heilongjiang.
There's no information about O'Donnell's new follow-up.
The player wants to show an example in rotation - goods are going to the world's turnarounds, shape changed to paper
The special types of games Games are currently also turning packaging materials in addition to games.
The products of the stone shop customers will no longer be packaged to the construction sites but to the rolling stock.
Net marketed products, for example, are packaged from farmers into customs packages.
All the packages that come to us are going to be used again.
We can use the equipment ten times, as long as the package is good enough to use it, Ville Puurla Oulu tells us about the player.
As welding material, the company shall make regular use of words sheet and other relevant rolling stock.
It shall be avoided for as long as possible.
In the near future, we are going to move back to rolling materials in letter boxes.
The move wants to be an example to others.
It is not too difficult to turn around according to Pourula.
There's no big problem starting to turn around.
There will also be economic savings when, for example, bad packages are used as new.
The conversion is of course compatible with the role of the Player, since the new products include games and equipment used in the central product selection process.
Each piece of information: One and the same layer acts in each institution
Classify materials operate from one institution to another than from another.
They create their multi-use model on the basis of good Garderob, as it is easy to build a variety of places for good quality classes.
The classics that are used in the glass are high-quality glasses.
This category also belongs to a black part.
Naturally made black with these semi-trailers cannot be mistaken.
The garment can be combined to either straight to the teeth, to the hairy as well as to the beards, and around it it can be made into both a small living room and a loose style.
The semi-trailer is suitable for modern dressers as well as for classic textiles markets.
That's how you trust the style.
The syxyon trendy look is produced from gold rushes and wide-eyed office buildings, black semi-trailers and hard-trailers.
In the middle of the class, along with other classics, blue-green skiing and wine-winning holidays, they form a woman’s beautiful home.
It is black to the semi-white by combining it with the trendy eyelids of the race: the furthest, the tallest toes and the fatty toes.
Young and pretty!
Russian intelligence services have a long tradition of satellite activity
There is no reason to believe that the Russian Federation's foreign intelligence SVR or GRU's military science would have been exempted from this activity.
During the Soviet Union, the so-called DRG groups were specialised.
The name will be a group of various groups of Russian-speaking people: the Sabatoas and the Information Group.
The experts working in the west of the KGB's Security Service have developed detailed plans for important satellite locations, says archival manager Vasili Mitro (1922-2004).
His information was published in Christopher Andrew's books at the end of the 1990s and at the beginning of the 2000s.
The destinations included ports, telecommunications, large bridges, oil spills and gas pipelines.
In Germany, the KGB has acquired DRG teams for the uniforms and facilities of the Bundeswehr, railways, freight guards and informants.
This trick was used by Russian computer stations in Crimea in February 2014: they were dressed in local Ukrainian police mercenaries, based mainly on audits for you leading Ukraine and separated from the country of Crimea.
During the Cold War, agents of the armed forces delivered needed packages to the relief teams in the country, containing mines, explosives, explosives, and means of communication.
In another year, in 1998, Switzerland was discovered by the KGB, which exploded when the authorities injected it on the water.
The police were planning on four rounds last night in the country.
The police were arrested on several sides of the North Carnival for four train rides on Friday and Tuesday night.
When he was 18 years old, an 18-year-old conticial man wore 1.57 promillas.
She walked half past four at night at the beginning of the Kayaanites in her home with two passengers.
On the day of July, a four-night car broke down, and the only one in the car was a 19-year-old local man who spoke to the police with 154 proms.
He didn't get any serious injuries in the first place.
In the middle of the night, a 20-year-old foreign - language man wore 1.33 proms.
The police suspect these men of the group of bicycles and the carrier of Polvijärve in addition to the threat of traffic safety.
On Saturday morning, in the Tuupuvavara, the local package car was transported by a 36-year-old man with 0.52 promillas.
He's suspected of riding a bike.
The police are asking to find out what happened after the fall of the Turkish railway station.
According to the police, a man was abused at the parking lot by representing a dangerous result.
It was recorded to the surveillance camera.
In the dark days, the dark clouds covered by clouds and the sandy or sandy lakes disappeared immediately after the fall of the snow on the road to the railway station.
One suspect was removed from the Poultry of Humiliestonkata to the center of the conversation.
The passenger died in a line car below Pors.
In a few days, he died early Sunday morning when he was hit by a line car.
The accident occurred after the morning at the Romanian border in Niittumana.
The driver of the line car is no doubt concerned about the crime.
The police were investigating incidents that led to an accident.
HPK keeps risk on the edge of the line. The time of the issue is over.
HPK's sports director Mika Doivola says Filip Riska (center) has been a group of important initiatives, abstinence and abstinence.
During the trial, Filip Risk continued at the end of the HPK in Hämeenlinn.
Experienced Risk, 33, the success of the roles offered to him assured the follow-up board.
Philip has been an important backer for us at the beginnings, in the play and in the role of blackmail.
Although there is still a need for improvement, the young team should keep this experience of the player, HPK's sports director Mika Doivola commented on the follow-up information.
It is hoped that the risk will rise when the Liigan solution games are played.
In the past, a key player at home, Riska has played a major role in the JYPs, Lukos and Sport.
The prosecutor, Oskari Lehtinen, was replaced by no agreement after the trial.
As a witness on TV today: The hostages were left to die twice
American Beck Weathers wrote a book 18 years ago.
Left for Dead: My Journey Home From Everest is based on his experiences.
Tonight's film is made on their basis.
Everes now gets his first night on the TV in Finland.
In May 1996, the destroyed Lummyrky was surprised by the climbers at Mount Everest.
The direction of Baltasar Kormákur in 2015 refers to the relief fund, which has been managed by the farmer.
The tragedy has been filmed - and documents - before.
The facts are also being discussed in this case.
The world's tallest mountain took 22 years ago the life of eight racers.
Two of them were experienced leaders of racing societies: Scott Fischer and Rob Hall.
Just Hall works as a teacher of Weathers.
The Spirit of Weathers could be saved before the eyes of Nepal.
As a result of this and the air pressure, he lost his sight, so he had to leave the upper hand.
Rob Hall went on his way and he didn't come back.
However, the Winters game of life and death had just started.
At Myrsky's rise, he was there, and he couldn't find his way back to the camp.
When a man came looking for him, he was found so badly that he wasn't believed in survival.
Weathers was left to die.
As a miracle trade, however, he got on his feet and found others.
Unfortunately, the angry Weathers thought they were still going to die, and once again he was left on his own good foot.
It is clear that contrary to other expectations, Beck Weathers remained alive.
At some point, fellow athletes also began to believe in the possibility of being helped.
The movie Beck Weathersia presents Josh Brolin.
Rob Hall is Jason Clarke and Scott Fischer Jake Gyllenhaal.
Other roles include Robin Wright, Keira Knightley and Emily Watson.
Today has been celebrated by the Church of Eno for 200 years.
Since the year 200, the church has been celebrated by the church today.
The church was immediately instituted on 4 October 1818, and the celebration of the year was held on Sunday for the whole family.
The festival began at Eno church at 10 a.m. family, after which there was an antimium of a carnival tree in the Eno Congregation Hall.
The church was full.
There were 517 members of the family.
Mr. Armi of the Church was happy that people had come to the church so much.
It is a great joy yet long and gives power to work, says the Railway (in the picture).
The church’s fire has affected many, and it has not been on the side of the Eno Congregation’s 200th anniversary.
The church is now in the fiery furnace of the old Church of the Evangelical Lutheran Congregations of Joensu.
The wooden church was formed in 1770.
In the midst of the controversy, a riot occurred in the morning, where the church was delayed and it was remembered as a destroyed church.
Photos and videos: My doctor removed my power in Greece - Sea falls and the roof turned into a river
A powerful hurricane type of drought swept through Greece on Saturday afternoon.
My overseas cousin, my doctor, has been called Zorbá.
The Greek Air Agency has issued a red warning to the Athika, Peloponnesos, Ionian islands, Cyclades and Crete.
In the pictures taken from the region, there is a dramatic view of Greece.
A video published on Twitter shows how houses in the city of Kyoto have suddenly appeared instead of destruction because of coming.
The second video shows how the car has had to be transported by incoming waters.
A strong wind in the southernmost part of the Peloponesus caused a strong tide.
The Finnish Embassy of Athens directs people on Facebook pages to store myrsky in Greece.
The delegation shall be invited to follow the provisions and instructions of the local authorities.
My inter-seasonal urticaria, my doctor, is accompanied by radiation and even future dangers.
According to CNN, according to one study published in 2011, medical engineers appear only once or for two years around the world, typically on the roads of the cause class when the sea temperature is still high.
Now, the oral storm left its arrival in Tunisia and Libya before it continued its journey north to Europe.
Concerns in Greece have also caused refugees on islands like Lesboks.
The thousands of Syrian and Iraqi refugees living in these camps have limited access to adequate protection.
Under Myrsky are also in the midst of the devastated areas of rural areas in the Athenian environment.
In Greece my doctor died last November too.
The sea doesn't have to go now, you still fly on a schedule - the most dangerous of Syysmursk islands on the Greek islands of the world, the most beautiful of thousands of Finns.
The trajectory of the sea shall be removed and shall be carried on its way to be careful that it does not land on the shores or other surfaces of the sea.
Such instructions have been distributed to around 3,500 people in Greece through the Eastern Hemisphere for a relaxing Finnish weekend.
The guidelines will be necessary because even the Zorbas Mirsk, which is exposed to fear, has been predicted to be a long Greek island this weekend.
For example, near the island of Crete, wind speed can rise in the wood even within 45 metres per second.
There's a lot of hate going on.
All passengers from Greece who have reported their telephone numbers through the East and South Finland have been warned by the travel organizers by strong wind texts.
Still, the sun and the temperature
According to Inka Ikosen, the expert on the communication of the Sunset Islands has avoided the worst in the rest of the day.
For example, planes have fallen down and risen according to the normal schedule.
We're following the situation all the time.
Security goes ahead.
I brought the media journalist Antonia Schroderus tells us that their planes have also been on schedule.
We are constantly in contact with our personnel.
At least Crete was still at peace, he told us about the beginning of the day.
There are currently 1,500 Finnish passengers on the most popular roads on the Greek island, Rhodes and Crete.
In addition, several hundred passengers are allowed in smaller areas.
For example, the worst harvest on the island of Koss will be on Sunday morning.
On the other hand, on Sunday evening, Rodoks had a solar eclipse and a temperature of 27 degrees Fahrenheit [- 27 ° C], the sun's icon tells us.
Zorbasse has been assessed to move next to Turkey, indeed a little livent.
We have already been in contact with Turkey and our staff there, for example, and have reviewed, for example, the number of Finnish flights from Antalya Tulai, Schroderus says.
Shirley Karvisella and Janni Hussilla were completely identical in the messimals - so they reacted to the situation.
The media person and fitness performer Janni Hussi arrived at Miss Finland's final in the open morning.
Hussi tells her buyer from Mesleville.
I went to move, and I decided to trust professionals who found me a really great dress this evening, Husse smiles.
Of course, the same hope of the evening had also been chosen by Professor Shirley Karvinen.
Both of you also noticed the same living room and looked at the situation with a smile.
Karvinen told Sanomi that he had come in early preparation, and he had to get on the plane.
Hussis works as a backstage and red carpet in the militarized world, and he talks about the stars of the etourism that will reach the place.
There's a slight change in her back because she changed from Camp to Jätkäsar.
Now I'm going to stay there again. Let's see what's going on.
It's amazing that the new apartment has its own working room, Husse.
Before I change Hussi's play alone in Greece.
It was beautiful. I was just in the hotel for a week without leaving anything.
I got a flux at the stress break, but otherwise the rest was really successful, Husse tells me.
The use of Shirley Karvise on the plane aroused a lot of attention - your collection of live outdoor tests
In June 2016, Miss Finland Shirley Karvinen told Miss Finland's red earth about the events she had made with radio stations and Love Island pictures of Finland.
The speed has been enough even to ensure that Karvinen reached its final destination directly from the Finnair airport.
I was kidding. I put my hair on the machine.
This is it glamorous.
I'm gonna go home in the morning, Karvin's party.
Karvine tells us that he's in the middle of a living room.
His preparation also brought to the attention of his fellow passengers.
I had a big game and this is how people looked at it.
At least I was interested in having fun.
Carvin's flying to Spain once a week.
In Marbella she's been spending about a couple of days.
Karvinen tells his pleasure of his visit to Love Island as a spring in Finland.
He describes his experience as having to stop until now.
Karvinen tells you he's on his way to relax on Fridays.
It's kind of real love.
These are real human feelings, Karvine describes the feelings of the program's inner self.
How did they survive?
Three Perfect Examples
Classes are eyeglasses that operate from one place to another than the other.
The classics are often ten years old, but sometimes modern - day individuals are able to do so.
A few years ago, the rising levels of ice and ice have not been removed.
According to its name, the peaks above the pole are reimbursed from year to year and season to second.
They appear to share user opinions, but they are brave to support the model in the trials, no.
This is exactly what the university authorities agree on in any of the localities.
It is then known that the simple skin or activating surface of the needles is active from the faeces, lengths, inches or triangles.
The long reach looks good both in the festival and in the paper.
Black upper secondary schools fit very well with the hemispheres of the community.
They measure properly the choice of the opposite sex, the type of spouse and the gender, including the gender of the couple.
It's nice, but it's a really nice piece of paper in a romantic bed.
The location of a strong and low retrohencic system is made up of a long copper-grained mesh, upper surface layer, visible backbones, and nozzle.
Although there is a certain beauty in the surface areas, they are also fully suited to the archipelago together with a t-pad, long shorts and even trendy lipstick.
It's so easy and still so nice!
Two robots start moving in Espoo
They moved for the last year and took passengers to the city of Espoo to report.
The Otanian robot vehicles operate in the role of the bus simulator, since in the early part of the region, they are intended to start their transport on robotic buses.
The project develops and pilots around the year's robotic transport and tests the technical performance of vehicles in Finland.
In the test, you'll find out how robot cars work on the current cover network.
At the same time, the city offers robotic bus developers the opportunity to develop technology in the real environment, says traffic manager Johanna Nyberg.
For the first time, robotic vehicles are completely automatic in other modes without special transport systems.
The safety of vehicles always depends on the passenger sitting in the car.
Vehicles have been operating around the world for a number of times and have been assessing whether the vehicle is free of charge.
If it is not, they explain whether there has been an obstacle to the vehicle, the pump or, for example, the windshield, informs Sensible 4 supplier Harri Santamala, who is responsible for the development of robotic transport.
The robots walk all night three days a week: Tuesday 13-15.30, Wednesday 10-15 and Thursday 10-15.
The robot cars stop at six stops on the road and take passengers to the train.
The robot's brakes identify the stop markers.
The most sure way to get to Otakaar is by standing point number 1.
A mokoma-like bassist broke out of the bed in the middle of the bed and collapsed
Mokoma-yhyye reports about the amazing situation on the Facebook page at the Tampere Package Room.
At the Tampere Pakkaroom, there was a dramatic turn on Sunday when the band base of St. Helena broke down from the stage in the middle of the show.
The situation got worse when the band was taking the last chapter of the night.
This side of this side is broken.
The band will know about this on the Facebook page.
"Let's live!"
The sand was compacted yesterday in the Packaroom with the bathroom in the last beer and collapsed on its coast.
Let's hope you'll make a long improvement for your metallic brother!
The end of the round is treated with caution, read on the pages.
The Mokoma fans are responsible for a photo update where the bassist-Santu places his shirt in his hands on the bed.
This news was expected, it was time to worry about how bad it was.
The relief is great, the bones are going to get better over time.
Tsemppi and a long ride to Santu and a good ride to another band plus a carrier!
And thank you for the past, the great challenge was, but you're allowed to keep leaving behind this strong drama's ending? writes a fan.
Police are monitoring forestry in North Carolina and Savo.
The East-Swedish Police Agency conducted forest control on Friday and Sunday with the Metsahandungung and the Finnish Centre for Forestry in North Karrilla and North Savos, the police officers told the social media on Sunday.
The main focus of the monitoring was on the legality and reliability of the forest.
From each forester, the forest map was checked and the country's country-wide forestry permit was required.
In addition, the administrative authorisations for forestry vehicles and the authorized number of self-propelled weapons used in the canning were reviewed.
According to the police, 112 foresters were examined during the control period, and only one forester was found in the control area who lacked the required forestry permit.
The forester was assigned an unauthorized request for 12 days.
In addition, the police contacted 133 vehicle drivers, and two of them were suspected of riding a bike.
In addition, the parties dealt with five business ventures in the German communiqué, once a police force.
In this context, it can be seen that foresters are very good at the possibility of foresting.
A lot of foresters were surprised at the surveillance.
One forester said that "I've been forested in the area for 50 years and this was the first time someone checked the permits."
The East-Swedish Police Agency will continue to monitor forest management together with other supervisory authorities.
Mykkenen is going to Turkey to follow the Syrian quota election
Interior Minister Kai Mykänen (C.E.) is travelling to Turkey for the next few days to follow up on the selection of quota refugees coming to Finland.
Finland has decided this year to take 530 Syrian refugees from Turkish refugees.
Elections are usually made a few times a year, and there are representatives from the Immigration Office, the Ministry of Labour and Energy and the police.
The Committee of Government has already made the most of its challenges in Turkey.
The UNHCR first elects persons in a particularly vulnerable position.
In practice, it has meant people who are considered to be in a particularly urgent position in refugee camps, such as single - parent families, widows and the sick, women and children.
A group of people coming to Finland will be chosen more than the quota, since in practice part remains unreachable for various reasons.
I would also like to see the civil organizations of the Turkish Interior Minister Süleyman and Syrian border.
Ilkka Salmi is also involved in the trip.
In the event of an increase in the quota
Finland has taken quota packages since the 1970s.
In the last few years, the quota has been 750 packs a year.
The quota was a couple of years in the year 1,050, but the government has not yet been able to agree on its rise.
The meeting has supported the rise of the quota, but the project has finally lost its resistance to the blues.
Prime Minister Juha Sipil (center) recently presented the rise of quota to 1,500-2,000 people per year.
The visit to the House is the first visit to this House by the Minister of the Interior to follow up on the selection of quota refugees.
Former Interior Ministers Peter Orpo (c.e.) and Paula Risikko (c.e.) were required to move to their new duties before the visitors could be arranged.
Finland will receive EUR 10 000 from the EU for each of the refugees in a particularly vulnerable position.
Now let's go to the polls - no longer know if you're laughing or laughing
In the last day of the day, Karjalinen was updating the legislation to change the animal protection system.
The article provided that the legislation specifically prohibits the holding of all animals which are not specifically permitted by the regulations of the ministries of production, pet animals or other business.
All other animals referred to in the specific Regulation are therefore initially prohibited.
If the legislation is to be adopted by law, it means that we are rejecting the general principle of law in Western democracies by prohibiting acts that threaten social security or a good way of doing so.
Now there is an initial provision for the prohibition of all activities under which the law or regulation does not grant a separate authorisation.
The change is due to the fact that nothing new can be tried in business, for example, and to do nothing else before the law or regulation adopted it has been passed.
The operation of the administration in the preparation of legislation has generally been weak.
If we now move on to the road that is initially prohibited in Finland, which is not specifically allowed, we no longer know whether to cry or laugh.
I'm not sure if the animal protection system didn't require an update.
But this trend of legislation is not part of democracy.
Unfortunately I do not know the Constitution very well, but at the moment of its adoption, it will accept such a "abstaining of all things which are not in law or regulation" procedure.
It is hoped that there will be a reasonable minister who will interrupt the progress of such a legislative project.
Get Forsell's neck: I'm going to get four trendy fingers
The trend of this plague will be in the corners of the globe.
It looks particularly good in your teeth.
A single hair-shaped face for a pair of shorter parts, such as half or normal t-bits, so that the population remains content.
This silk is seen in red, and in particular our silk head is one of the most trendy views of the season.
With a beautiful smile, we walk beautifully along with a woman’s upper arm or wearing a couple of pairs.
You can play with the silk house more courageously and throw on your feet, for example, lentikers or silk trendy trendy cowboy boots.
It doesn't matter whether it's dry, dirty or multi-smoothing, all red-haired teeth are now part of every woman's black sea.
One of the various colors is courageously centred on, and also play with the box on the special upper part.
For example, the combination of iron and clay is beautiful.
Non-symmetrical cells are wind relief from the coldness of the summer, which can lead to a drought.
The non-symmetrical wind is equally female and playful and suitable for beauty as well as for celebration.
Alexia's baby, 3 kg, slowly bites in the eye of Jeren
In the family picture of Karalahti, there is an acute three-month Alexia virus.
Nana Karalaht tells Keraval of the Aito-based journal.
The actor Nanna Karalahti, 30, and ex-doctor Jere Karalahti, 43, received family support early in July.
The first son of Jax in Paris was two years old on May 2, while little Alexia is only a three-month-old baby.
Nana Karalahti recently had a train train train with Martina Aitolehde in Spain, where the Karalahd family was involved.
Nana published in Instagram a picture of the feeling of Spain, where the entire Karalah family is displaced.
The kids Jax and Alex are in their parents' eyes.
I take note of Alexia's mother-in-law who's wearing her hands.
Thank you for this.
Thank you for your goodness, for your forgiveness, for your forgiveness and for the forgiveness of people and for your joy, write Nana Karalahti on the front of the family portrait.
The fitness journals of the public programme Nanna Karalahti and former school principal Jere Karalahti recently went to the daily bus and opened the Aiito-day house to Keravald.
In addition to Karalahti, there are food experts Johannes Laine and Anna Lisanant, responsible for growth.
Johanna Tervo was hired as director of the day house.
In Turkey, travel calls are invited to be delivered for the harvest
In Greece on Saturday morning, Zorba Mirsk is expected to be transferred to Turkey on Sunday.
Meteorologists in particular warned the Western Seamen, fishermen and farmers of Greece on Saturday, wrote CNN Turkey.
The Troopy bear is told to move the coast from the south to the north during the day.
Catastrophe and emergency authorities invited citizens from the beginning of the day to fly their mobile phone before the storm and to ensure Internet access so that people can receive timely status updates, says the local news agency Anadolu Ajans.
People have been invited to stay at home and away from the windows and, for example, to move the wooden parlors away from the wind.
Turkey is expected to run and the wind is expected to stop 28-33 metres per second.
Green warning in Greece
On Saturday, the Greek Air Service issued a red alert to the areas of South Greece Attica, Peloponnesos, Jonah Islands, Cyclades and Crete.
The Greek Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Travel Organizations warned the Finnish authorities in Greece about Zorba.
The Finnish Athenian Embassy would also issue a missile warning.
Travelers were invited to follow the provisions and guidelines of the local authorities.
A little while later when I got in touch, there was a strong wind and a wave.
The people were very peaceful, and the messenger told the STT yesterday about Laura Aalton's Tui travel agency.
Aalton described the situation as similar in the afternoon.
Last night, too, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs had not received any messages from the Finnish people in difficulty.
In Greece several ports did not move on Saturday, told the local news agency Amna.
The venets heading down the sea were landed on Saturday, they were told about the travel services to the STT.
According to the Finnish Athenian delegation, temporary disturbances were expected in aircraft and ship transport.
The Finnish authorities were told on Saturday that the institution was being actively monitored.
Kimi Reikkonen closed the cause of Mercedes's improvement compared to Ferrari's
Ferrari Kimi Räikkönen was able to admit that the worst competitor Mercedes was too strong in the time of Russia's gp.
However, there is no reason for concern about the panic in Ferrari, the experienced driver assessed.
They were just faster than us, but there's no big deal.
Our car was at the best end of the week, but they were just too fast, fourth timed and clearly left behind by their cosmopolitan partner Sebastian Vettel.
Ferrar had a hard time in the previous village of Singapore.
In the meantime, they were asked what was the cause of the sudden collapse of Mercedes's request.
They seem to go faster than we're -- it's so simple.
If I knew why, we'd probably be as fast as they are.
But I don't know more than anyone else.
This is always an opinion, and they seem to be us right now.
Who knows why?
In time, there was a rare concern about Sauber, the future king of Réikkös.
Charles Leclerc, who was first replaced by Ferrar, was seventh, and the last time period was also marked by Marcus Ericsson.
The Swedish centre has ten outlets for more than three years.
And even though in the second session five drivers left all the time, the final outcome was good for Sauber.
And what about the future of the courageous race?
Yes, compared with where they were from the beginning, there has been a great step forward.
First year there's a different story, so let's see.
It was there - Robert Helenius your brother Erkan Teperin: "Robbe is back"
Robert Heleneus and Erka Teper in the night of Stuttgart in front of me in parallel marks.
The German was in the middle of a much more initial party, but he did not get good grades from behind.
Clearly, Helenius controlled the taking of heavy loads that were found on the very back.
Finnish was also clearly better physically than Teper.
At the end of the eight - month period, when Helenus fell to the left, directly at Teperin.
Osama was so hard that the concordant in front of her home didn't even try to get up on the road.
When the victory was assured, Helenius suddenly flew into the air.
In his appeal, he began to call on the public to create a good sense of humor and his opponent.
Then she turned into a ban on Finland for a moment.
Thank you to all the viewers and Finnish promoters.
We were taken tonight.
Helenus was happy right after the funeral.
That was indeed a great victory over the Iron Curtain.
Perhaps it would have been possible even to get to MM, Helenius commented on the night before taking.
I'd rather die than be able to finish the entire race.
Of course it's been taken into consideration.
There's no more young man here, 34-year-old Helenus confessed before Teper met him.
The number of victims of an Indonesian disaster can be doubled
According to The Guardian, the Vice-President of the country is calling for a clear increase in the number of victims.
According to former president Joseph Kallan, the total number of victims can rise to thousands.
Difficulty circumstances
The rescuers were looking for the remnants of the plague, as well as those who were wounded in the worst areas of the island of Sulawes: I beg of the port city and its neighbor, Doghara.
Secondly, all the victims are from Palu, the situation of Doghra is still unclear.
Hundreds of thousands of people are missing and about 540 are badly injured.
There are still people in destroyed buildings who have not managed to get out.
For example, Roa Roa-named hotel in Palu has been created.
The rescuers repeat the cries of the rest of the crowd, but the lack of relief has slowed down the start of the rescue.
The Indonesian President Joko Widodo has designated the army's rescues and raids.
It is necessary for an army and its fleet because in the disaster area, electricity and computer communications are very different.
The fuel stocks are also on alert.
Miss Finland's finalist inconsistencies and a long-term cause of nervousness
Billnäss in Ruuk will be chosen for the best of her new Miss Finland.
A question was raised to every misfinanist by the questionnaire.
The financiers asked the question about the lascillator at the table.
In particular, the number of six Emilia Antikoske, 23 ended up in a state-of-the-art response, but good-looking jokes.
The question posed to the old man was through Facebook.
User Pirkko-Ella wanted to know what the last book he'd read was misinformed.
In the past, however, they had thought of their response to a good hope before the beginning of the dispute.
Thank you for asking, Pirkko-Ella.
The last book I've read is... Anticoski said he was thinking.
The report was received in general during the course of a riot, until Antikoski continued to reply:
The last book I've read is...
I've read books in school!
I'm sure it's something about economic science.
So the last book I've read is that of someone against you, Anticoski.
After his response, Antikoski received a public-made aplods as an attack on the nose.
Later on in a traffic accident, Antikoski took note of the fact that he did not want to be thrown into prison because of his principles.
In 2018 Miss Finland will be crowned at 2 p.m. when the ceremony will end last year Miss Finland Michaela Söderholm.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
This prescription is for you who have good, acidic property from their own security, because domestic property is at a price at the expense of the trade.
The key may have to be bought, even if much time or effort is already increasing.
This can also be done only by the owner if the boss doesn't want to buy.
Of course, the pay is more diverse if the paycheck also weighs its head.

An international crime event will be held in January
In January of this month, Rukamo will hold the first international literacy festival, which will focus on crime in the north.
The Nordic Noir event programme consists of challenges, panel discussions, and other literary software and jazz events.
The festival's literary works include the stars of Swedish lexicographers Jens Lapidus and Erik Axel Sund, which are the backbones of the Swedish poets Jerker Eriksson and Håkan Axlander Sundquist.
In addition to the Swedish names, literature is also seen in Iceland, Norway and Finland.
The Finnish authors are represented by Max Seeck.
According to the organizers of the festival, the northern location, nature, the dark season and the unique environment of Kuusamo provide frameworks for unique written experience.
Status symbols do not attract friends - Four facts from the relationship
What makes a person popular, charismatic or amazing?
Researchers at the University of Sydney have analyzed the subject of two types of "cool" composed of a few different areas: generally impressive college and, in part, the opposite secondary school.
Unfortunately, people in college had many socially desired boundaries: they were out-of-date, friendly, friendly and competent.
There was also typical distance, selfishness, captivism, and pride for others.
They were practicing experiments, and they were just following a few external evaluations.
Both types combined a good sense of identity and a strong sense of life.
The role of Kovis is no longer cool: high status in teen age does not necessarily lead to success later in life.
This is how a United States study was published in the Children Development page in 2014.
In the early years of young people who followed, gambled, sought out good - looking prostitutes, and tried to encourage others, the young were at increased risk of using days and thoughts of crime.
In human relationships, they were weaker than ever before than ever before.
High-status message boxes, labels or bells don't make a person cool - or at least a truly attractive follow-up.
In a study published in August of the Social Psychological and Personality Science, most people were more willing to make friends at a normal market than with those dressed in a brand - although most chose a high level of knowledge.
If you're in the Greek lobby, beware!
There's a fear in there - a warning to cry red
During the weekend in southern Greece, there can be as much water as in Finland for half a year.
Zorbas-Hrimmymyrky runs to Greece during the weekend.
Be careful if you are in Peloponnesos, Jonah Islands, Cyclades or Crete.
Myrsky is very powerful, so the Finnish Athenian Embassy announces it on the Facebook page.
According to the great approach, the Greek Air Service has provided the regions with a red warning.
There is also a regular service in Forecan's blogs.
It says that the strongest trees in the corn are even 45 meters per second.
As a result of this comparison, from the beginning of Finland, Kuisma-Myrsky was hit by the most violent waves in 31 meters per second.
According to blog Zorbas-Myrski, however, the biggest concern is not wind, but rich sands.
On weekends in South Greece, more than 300 millimetres of water can be obtained.
It corresponds to about half of Finland's annual quota.
The Severe Weather Europe Service has shared a video about the development of the mouse on the Facebook page.
Zorbas-Myrsky has been responsible for coming to Tunisia and Libya this week.
Do you recognize the dead men's Love Island in Finland -Ankun?
Presented in amazing YouTube videos
It is rare to know that in the Love Island series of Finland, many men die of beauty Anku also appears strangely in YouTube videos published in 2010.
In videos, Anku advises soldiers, including to prepare a black box of old economic paper.
The tongue also looks at its sympathetic style as a sympathetic one can attack those who grow up in the right branches.
Now we're going to be able to grow, but we're doing it in a little amazing way.
You can watch videos from here or from Anku YouTube channel.
Valtteri Bottas is all over and your cousin Adrenaline in Sotshi. Is he supposed to be Hamilton's assistant on Sunday?
Valttari Bottas filled out a few more ten minutes after his flight time from Russia's Gp when he was in front of the media.
The great turn left behind Mercedes's lonely Lewis Hamilton and was certainly a spiritual critical one to a group of Finnishs.
Mukava will turn around.
I don't know what happened to Lewis when he left the middle of the settlement.
It's feeling good. It's a little important yet, Bottas found out.
I've only been away this year, in East (middle) so time has passed by law.
This train has been good for me before, and I've got a good ride again.
It is not easy to finish the war, so the departure is particularly important.
And it's true that Bottas was able to answer the outside if he was going to win tomorrow or if there's going to be a hit by Hamilton's next MM.
It's absolutely unlikely that I'm trying to win.
There can be no other purpose from leaving, Bottas from leaving.
But this morning we'll fight both masters.
Lewis' guide to Sebastian Vetteli is time big and different to me, so it should be kept in mind.
Let's see what's going on, but Bottas is full of you.
After some time, Hamilton was genuinely happy about Botta's success, and Mercedes's famous Toto Wolffly also enjoyed it.
Lewis had a plan to win Valtter, but he didn't succeed in the fight.
The Governor knows he has to review everything himself to defeat Lewis.
And he was so upset that the adrenalin trail out of your ear, Wolff broke.
The question is if he gave Bottas and Hamilton the time straight, Wolff said he was wrong.
We'll discuss it in the morning, and we'll see how it goes.
Kiteelian Erno Kinnunen reached the train’s master’s height in Finland
The roadcar's SM series has recently ended.
Perhaps the brothers have never done before as masters of Finland at the same time.
Now it was done by Eerik and Henrik Pietarinen in a decisive decision-making environment in the Turun and Salon environment, as Eerik won SM1 and Henrik SM2.
Kiteelän Erno Kinnunen assured her that her career was the best one when the third place of the decision was assigned to her from the two-way SM4 category of cars in Finland.
The contestants of Honda Civicil Ville Mäkelä started a competition with the Turu, as the starting points were clear: the investment in the group was going back to the SM title.
In the dark of the spring night, two had to be paid when some of the extra lights were missed in another special test.
It was time for a third party to be placed in the kitchen.
In such a case, it is not appropriate to be treated.
On Saturday only the second row was followed by the speed of Juss Tepon, Kinnunen told me.
Syria requires the United States, France and Turkey to withdraw their team
The Syrian Foreign Minister requires the United States, France and Turkey to take their group out of Syria.
At the UN General Meeting yesterday, Foreign Minister Walid Muallem says foreign groups must leave Syria immediately and without conditions.
Muallem said that foreign groups are in Syria fighting terrorism, and war against terrorists is "close end".
In his UN speech, Muallem also invited Syrian refugees to return to their homeland.
However, for the seventh year of the continued war, there is no end.
More than 36 million people have died in the war.
Member of the Union, Angela Merkel, told Germany on Friday that it was planned for the end of October that the Presidents of France, Russia and Turkey would join him.
Not exactly Super Bowl, but tens of millions of Americans were looking at the Supreme Court of Justice on TV.
Judge Brett Kavanaugh, in his highest position, and Professor Christine Blasey Ford, who blames him for his concern, received an extraordinary number of people from the Red Cross.
In the United States, at least 20 million people were placed on top of their television screens.
At that time, Professor Blasey Ford of California, Kavanaugh, and his concern, Donald Trumpi, were present in front of the Senate's judicial committee.
According to the initial results, the hearings resulted in a total of 20.4 million viewers from ABC, CBS, CNN, FOX News, MSNBC and NBC.
In addition to their network, there were millions of more listening.
The NBC said that the lead streams followed 6.8 million people and CNN reported on its year-on-year forecast at 8.2 million at the start of the liveway.
The number of CNNs increases by over 10 million when you are calculated via YouTube and Facebook.
Fox News Digital also reached 8.0 million.
Digital launchs are Canals' own, TV viewers are the original research and data analysis company Nielsen.
Nielsen publishes final readings on Mondays, but they are mostly in each case.
It's hard to get 20 million.
More than 20 million spectators are usually only in the United States, as well as the major Oscar and Grammy games in the entertainment world, as well as several political events such as presidential talks and presidential elections in 2016.
In the United States' annual programme, the U.S. football finalisation of the NFL Super Bowli is on its way.
This year, Super Bowl collected about 103 million people on the NBC channel.
In the last year, the first talk of the conference in Trump, according to Nielsen, totaled about 48 million people and 30 million officials.
The main issue is:
The Supreme Court of Justice is a very important case in the United States because the authorities are alive.
Trump was already able to appoint a new judge when Antonin Scalia left early in 2016 and the Republicans succeeded in preventing such president Barack Obama from appointing him as his successor.
Another place opened when Judge Anthony Kennedy, 81, announced his retirement this year.
Kennedy was the president of the Republic named Ronald Reaganin, but he was a lawyer in so many questions, who could decide on the position of the nine-person tribunal.
He was an advocate for the rights of abortions and sexual minorities and, for example, in 2015 he decided by voting that the same sex parties had received the right to marriage in the entire country of the Union.
Kavanaugh is significantly more conservative.
His choice to the highest right may include your decades of conservative power.
The child has the right to send his or her information to the parents
Only the parents of children under 10 years of age can see the health data of their children in the Kanta service.
It's a big problem, it's wrong and it's ridiculous.
Of course, the situation of the Kanta service in the beginning was even more worrying: the parents were not able to see even small health data or prescriptions.
The situation was temporarily corrected by a fall in 2016 for a period of less than 10 years.
After that, the practice has been allowed to be corrected, but it has gone a long way.
Now the correction is under promise - in 2020.
Since the problem is clear, the amendment of the Constitution should not have been more than a matter of urgency.
After that, the understanding of the ground is about the pressure of the tap: when the hole is shut down, it opens.
A child can show his or her information to his parents if he has bank credentials or official personal identity card.
But how many are 10 years old?
The personal card is taxable, and banking is not even possible at the age of 10.
In practice, the fourth-class information in the school is therefore not available to see anyone other than by asking for it.
This is not about the rights of parents or children.
It is of utmost importance that parents can be involved in the child’s care.
Of course, the rights of teenagers to privacy must be cared for.
There may also be family members who cannot talk about all things freely.
They are often associated with sexual health, from which free care is a very important human right.
In the United States, the FBI began to deal with Kavanaugh's disturbances
According to the U.S. media, the FBI will address at least two women's concerns.
Another woman was a member of the Senate's judicial committee this week.
Kavanaugh has challenged allegations of alleged sexual harassment during his school years.
In the United States, President Donald Trump appointed the FBI to investigate complaints at the request of the Senate's judicial committee.
The explanation can't last a week longer.
According to Washington Post, this is a criminal investigation into a more restrictive finding, and it does not necessarily become public.
A man threatened to kill the police at the police station in Kayana.
The arrested fireman continued the drilling still in the room.
The police tell a man in the police station to stop.
The police had to face the threat of a suspected criminal in Kayana on Tuesday night.
The authorities report on the case that started when a 30-year-old man tried to compete at a central court.
The man was sorry for the other customer in the treatment unit.
This led to the removal of the restaurant.
An outside killer attacked another man by looking at him on the ground.
When the third party tried, the man found him too.
The triangular treatment led to the police's call.

A man is suspected of three abuses and a violent response from an official.
Aid organisations are preparing to start work in Indonesia Sulawes - "Punta water is the fastest"
The United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) and other international aid organisations are ready to assist Indonesia on the island of Sulawes, Finland's information officer Kirsi Haru tells us.
Local authorities are leading rescue operations, but the need for additional assistance is already evident at this stage.
Unicef works in almost all countries, and we also have long-term programmes in Indonesia.
In addition to normal activity, UNICEF always has full emergency preparedness, says Haru.
The first task is now to find people from the ruins, both living and dead.
The rescue operations in the city of Sulawes are underway, but in the area of Dodhara, there is a slightly more northerly situation.
There are locations in front of which contacts are not working.
The aid measures are difficult because the roads are also small, the truth is that Haru.
The buildings are often fragile in Sulawes, so the damage caused by earthquakes and tsunamis is great.
When they've been found, they need protection - first of all, for example, rooms and clean water.
Pure water is the fastest in crisis situations.
For the first time, humans can usually be provided with water-cleaning tablets that are also stored in UNICEF.
Water systems are trying to fix as soon as possible, but in an emergency, water is transported first by vessels.
In crisis situations, many children have to separate from their parents.
The search for family members and the integration of families is part of the work of UNICEF.
Food aid will also be organised by the World Food Programme (WFP), which is part of the UN.
At the start of the emergency phase, funds collected previously shall be used.
However, among others, UNICEF has already launched a financial crisis to help the Indonesian landscape and tsunami victims.
billionaire Elon Musk ends up as President of the Government of Thessaloniki - 20 million dollars from the tweets
Elon Musk, founder of companies that manufacture spare parts and electronic vehicles, avoids fraud under an agreement with the US Securities Commission.
Mr Elon Musk will end his task as President of the Teslan government and will be responsible for 20 million dollars in Germans.
Musk argues that it is part of a contract he has signed with the US Securities Markets Authority.
By agreeing with Musk to avoid fraud.
The US Securities Commission SEC threatened Moscow's securities issue in August because of its tweets.
In them Musk wrote that he is preparing an electric company to remove Tesla from the press, which has made the company's share rate rise fast.
According to the Treaty, Musk cannot act as President of the Government of Thessaloniki for three years.
In addition, Teslan has to appoint a new "undependent member" to his government and to appoint two "independent leaders" in its steering group.
Teslan must also establish a committee to monitor the communication of Muski.
Musk can still continue as Tesla's delivery director.
In addition to 20 million personal dollars, Tesla also has to pay 20 million corresponding shares to the financial supervisor.
Tweets lead investors to the market
According to SEC, Muskin tweets lead investors and Tesla shareholders to practice.
Musk claimed that he would have secured the funding that Tesla would buy from the bags back as your private shareholding.
According to the twitter of the billionaire, the company would have been bought from the Persians at a share price of $420.
Tésla’s share rate rose by more than ten percent a year after the tweets, but later it decreased.
According to SEC, Muski's claims had no basis.
According to the supervisor, he did not really have any consultations on the financial statements.
He had also not discussed the removal of porcelain with another steering group or company government.
This week's average rate fell by 14 per cent when SEC security guards reported fraud.
The new agreement is expected to re-establish the company's courses.
The final judgment is not a cause
Of course, the clocks of the court are not sound when the wise men are not moving.
That's a technical mistake.
Helsing's court hearing clock has been suspended.
The Visers show the clock at 2:00.
The situation is like the central horror scene: while the church screamed from the church’s screams and cries to themselves.
This is not a natural phenomenon, but the clock has been suspended for technical reasons: it's gone.
It has been seen by the repairer, but some of it has gone down and is expected to be a new part, since Evelyn Jamsen tells us.
At the same time, Jamesen will strengthen the Church in Helsinki - a Twitter account already mentioned.
The record thus states that the final judgment is not the reason for the suspension of the hour.
Jamsen says the church's bells aren't just for a drink.
