28-year-old father found dying in a large factory in San Francisco
This Sunday in a large supermarket there was a 28-year-old man who recently moved to San Francisco .
But the victim's brother says that he can't imagine anyone who would want to do more than his brother, saying, "His life finally started to improve."
Líchi, who was found on Wednesday at Westfield's Grandfather's office, was identified as 28-year-old Sanfrancian citizen Franks Galicia, a representative of the Sanfrancian Medicines Agency.
The San Francisco police reported that her death was recognized as a fraud and is currently under investigation.
Upura's brother Luis Galicia told the San Francisco radio station ABC KGO that Frank had previously worked as a fireman in Boston, but six months ago he believed in his dream at the "Sons & Daughters" Sanfranski restaurant.
The representative of the restaurant "Sons & Daughters" reports that the news of her death shocked them and shocked them.
"We are a small team that works as a united family and we are very lacking," said the representative.
During this difficult time, we thought we were together with friends and family from France.
Luis Galicia says that at first Franks were in the hostels, but lately life was finally improving.
"He picked up a new apartment and met a girl," Luis tells the KGO radio station.
Luis Galicia claims he doesn't know who would want to hurt his younger brother.
He was a good man with a wide heart.
"He always fed his family by preparing a great meal and making lunch," said Luis Galicia
He never wanted to get involved in fights.
He was the brother who adapted to the others.
"In view of all that has happened in the world quickly, he was like an unprocessed diamond that died suddenly every day," he said.
Anyone who has information about the event is invited to call the SFPD Information Phone 415-575-4444.
New doctor strike: calls for new protests
The new doctors ask their trade union to initiate protests against a new contract.
The New Medical Committee (JAK) of the United Kingdom Medical Association (LMA) is preparing to ask the Council to support further protests in early September.
The JAK considers that ministers have not been able to raise doubts about the contract.
In July, new doctors and medical students rejected the LMA contract.
58 % of all members who participated in the vote voted against the contract.
In a letter published on Thursday evening on Twitter, a member of the U.S. Council of America, Elena McCorta, said that the government was continuing to listen to this issue and therefore the offer of the contract was rejected.
She said: "In view of this, the proposal for a contract as a result of the US vote has been completely rejected and decided to request new formal talks to discuss the most important issues."
In response to the Government's closure, the U.S.A. today formally requested the LMA Council to authorise the development of new contracts which would take effect in September.
As a result of the conflict, new doctors participated in six strokes, including the first time in NHS's history, which stopped work.
Following the vote, which rejected the terms of the contract offered by the LMA, recommended by BMA, the LMA new doctor Dr. Johan Malwana withdrew from the office.
Before meeting with 54 000 new doctors and medical students, he had told BMA members that the offer was good and will be accepted.
Following the vote, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunts informed that the contract would be concluded with British doctors.
Russia and Turkey: Attituto Alliance?
The pain that ended the crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey were held on Tuesday to discuss and report eight months of long terms and economic sanctions at the end of the war.
However, when Vladimir Putin met with Turkey's leader in St. Petersburg, he felt that these partnerships were more necessary for Ankara.
However, they both argued.
Vladimira Putina’s smile looked at the meeting and did not give rise to warm emotions, even taking into account her apparent state of mind.
On the other hand, Rajips Erdogans at least five times named Putin as his "dear friend" of the message.
I don't know how many.
He also promised that relations with Russia would not only improve until the pre-crisis level but will become even stronger.
The next day, a newspaper reported that Erdogan had acted as if nothing had happened.
I think her enthusiasm is causing a bit of controversy.
However, a report from Putina shows that Russia’s leader has not forgotten anything.
The first thing he mentioned in his speech was the destruction of Russia’s aircraft on the Syrian border.
At the same time, Moscow responded.
Putin accused Ankar of having a dozen of them in Moscow's back.
The abuse was even more painful in view of the fact that it came from a friend.
The restoration of true trust will be very difficult, perhaps even impossible.
Since November Russia’s public position has changed.
For several months the government controlled television spread aggressive accusations against Ankara.
They thought everyone was guilty of being Turkish.
The most serious allegations were that the Erdogan family itself benefited from the illegal oil trade with part of Syria under the control of the Islamic State.
He himself, of course, refused.
However, the main message of the St. Petersburg meeting is that it is time to forget the past.
Finally, this meeting was only because Putin received President Erdogan's apology.
Russia could view it as its kind of victory.
The benefits of Ancara from the peace agreement are obvious.
First, Erdogan needs all his potential friends after a failed recovery last month, where he tried to find them.
countless terrorist attacks have also undermined her position.
There are also economic reasons.
Russian sanctions have caused significant losses, particularly the ban on charters, which usually provides for several million Russian tourists arriving in Turkey's areas each year.
The number of tourists decreased by almost 90%.
Russian tourism operators and charter companies have also facilitated flights when regular flights are renewed.
They are looking forward to holiday in the Mediterranean season.
This week the national TV is already planning to reduce the prices of fruit and vegetables as the imports of fruit and vegetables from Turkey will be renewed.
As elsewhere in the local newspaper Vedemosti: "The tourists to them, the dead to us."
However, there were other political reasons for the visit from Moscow.
Ankara is friendly to the West about, of course, a weak response to the challenge.
There can also be a lack of satisfaction with the long-term negotiations on joining the EU and Putin, which best serves the situation of Turkey's withdrawal from the West.
Russia’s leader has undoubtedly obtained additional points in Ankara’s eyes by expressing support for its elected government after a coup attempt.
Note that Moscow understands this well because it is deeply rooted in the fear of the change in the regime.
The summation that took place in this Greek seaport gave Russia and Turkey the opportunity to present, as one analyst called it, the "responsive alliance" of two countries that felt excluded from the West.
In spite of public unity, however, there are still considerable differences of opinion between the two countries.
The main differences affect Syria, where Russia presents itself as a haven of peace, but indeed Russia and Turkey support the opposing parties.
After more than three hours of initial negotiations, the two Presidents at the press conference announced that they had not discussed this issue.
The President of Turkey deliberately avoided the issues of non-compliance between the two countries, while President Putins wanted to stress them.
There is no clear consensus on how both countries could find common language on the issue of Syria.
However, after months of bad relations and potential disasters have been discovered when Turkey, a NATO member of the Russian Air Force, announced that the situation has improved as both leaders have at least begun negotiations.
Scotland Royal Bank will no longer be available to customers outside Scotland
The Bank’s Executive Director will continue to play a role in helping SMEs.
In addition to Scotland, SMEs will no longer be available.
Ross Makevans tells the BBC channel in Scotland that the SKB label was associated with bank ambitions globally.
It has turned away from these ambitions because the bank had nearly collapsed eight years ago and needed financial assistance.
Only experts in the labelling strategy have used the SKB label to protect other consumer financial brands.
The Bank received millions of races from international sports sponsors starting with the Six Nations regime and ending with the Vimblon Tennis Championship of Endi Mure.
However, it is now decided to draw up other national labels in the draft.
The Scottish Royal Bank will be available to Scottish customers, but it will not be initialised.
In England and Wales, all references to SKB, outside the main office and official list of beer, will be replaced by the name NatWest.
The Ulster Bank has already been used in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
Now there will also be less private financial marks, such as Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond, and Holt's Military Bank.
Macevan was interviewed during a tour with clients and employees via Invernesshire.
He sent BBC Scotland Channel: "The SKB will become our investor mark and our employees work with it, because we are now becoming more of a brand bank."
In time, the bank became a global sign, and the SKB became a global sign.
Now I say that we no longer have global ambitions, we have local ambitions.
Each of these brands will represent something unique in their sector and our employees will work with customers under these brands.
The SKB has already announced that it will not continue sponsoring "Six Nations" and will be involved in sponsoring various brands.
"It has been a real time to become a brand bank because we have already asked ourselves how to become a better bank to our customers?" said the Executive Director.
Three years ago it would have been very cynical if we announced that we would become a large bank to our customers and develop these brands.
But thanks to hard work and focusing on customer needs, not on our own needs, we have obviously made big changes.
We can relive these signs, so I think it's the right time now.
Frankis Detori won the 3000th victory, winning the first place in New York with the Iron Curtain Predilation
Detori recaptures the champagne by winning his 3000 wins twice as soon as he ends up in New York City first.
On Friday, Frank Detori won his 3,000th victory in the history of Britain, winning the first place in New York City.
He achieved this by defeating the second victory in these events that took place in his hometown of Predillection, which is trained by John Gosdens.
At 45 years of age, Italy is a six-year-old bird that has achieved such results in the birds' nests.
He joined Seram Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Pigot, Pitt Eder and William Carson.
The three-time champion of Detori, who had previously won the Ghyyyar horse, said, "It's something special."
I'm very upset because my family is here.
I am very happy that this has happened in New York because I have lived here for 30 years.
This isn't a big deal, it's not a royal Ashot, but it's a common Friday night with 20,000 people.
I feel relieved and very grateful.
After victory, Detori and Predillection are expected with applause and applause.
Two jokes have reached this record in line with obstacles - champion Richard Johnson and the final 20-year-old champion Sers Antony Mackojos, who has set up several records in his career, defeating more than 4300 winners.
Lester Pigots, the nine-year-old winner, won 4493 wins during his career.
Franky is one of the best jokes today, and there is no surprise that he has achieved achievements that are only rarely possible.
He's quiet and strong, but his tactics make him feel different from other jokes.
He's a fantastic young man's representative, his enthusiasm and his years of charisma attach fans to this kind of sport.
A few weeks ago, I told Epsomas that he would have won 6000 victories if he didn't participate only in the weekend and the big ones.
However, it is a real joy to know that for 30 years, France has been a regular winner of the United Kingdom.
He is a life-sustaining person who greatly benefits the British, and he is an excellent target.
Frank Detori noted this achievement with his company's brand - the flying decision.
From the wind speed of completion to the flying decision, Franky Detor has been the face of British horses for 20 years.
This has been a full way of life.
He has won countless great battles, including the famous "Great Seventh" in 1996 in Ascot, and has also experienced the disaster and disqualification of aircraft for the use of preparations.
Three years ago he had difficulty returning after six months of disqualification, but he demonstrated his character by encouraging those who doubted him to return in his best form.
And he could have participated in conversation for some time - Detor has previously said that to welcome continued participation would be at least 50 years of age.
Russian President Putins resigned the Administrator's Director Sergey Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putins unexpectedly dismissed Sergei Ivanov, head of administration.
Ivanov has been found for many years in the nearest town of Putina.
At 63 years of age, an old politician has been appointed as a special representative in matters of nature and transport.
The Kremlin Communication states that Putin "has decided to release Ivanov from the duties of the director of the work of the Russian President", without giving any reason.
Mr Vaino, who has been his vice-president since 2012, has been appointed to serve in Ivanov.
44-year-old Vaino has won a diploma.
The case was born in 1972 in Tallinn, the capital of Estonia, graduated from the Moscow State Institute for International Relations (MVSAI) and later worked in the Tokyo Embassy.
As sent by Kremlin’s website (in Russian), he later led the President’s protocol and the management of government staff.
After his appointment he said to Putin, "Thank you for your faith."
I believe that the main work of the administration is to support your work in the role of the President of the State by developing laws and controlling the implementation of your decisions.
Putin told a Russian company on Friday that Ivanov himself wanted to leave the office and recommended Vaino as his replacement.
Do you believe in dreams?
This step has undermined Moscow.
Sergey Ivanovs is a wise and close friend of Vladimir Putina and, like Putin, has worked in the Security Council at his own time in the VDK.
He was one of the most influential men in Russia.
At a national television station, two men announced that Ivanov would withdraw from the office on his own initiative.
But in spite of the nightmares facing the cameras, which are rarely confirmed by such an explanation, especially before Parliament's elections.
Is this the result of a struggle for power?
Nobody knows that.
However, the official claim that a man who was considered to be a potential president immediately wanted to become a leader of Russia's environmental policy is covered by a large shield.
In the comments published on the Kremlin page Ivanovs says to Putin: "This is the fact that in early 2012, I asked you to trust me in this complicated task, I could even say, a problematic task, four years.
It will appear that I have worked on this task for four years and eight months.
Ivanov took office in December 2011.
He was previously Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and former VDK State Security Service, as well as Putins.
In the late 1990 ’ s, Putins led the Federal Security Service, which is the successor of the VDK, and Ivanovs took over his vice president’s office.
When Putin came to power, he named Ivanov among the five people he trusted most.
At the end of the second term, Ivanovs was considered to be a potential candidate for the President of Russia, as Putin's election to the third term would be an anti-constitutional.
But then another neighbor of Putina’s family became President - Dmitry Medvedevs.
Putin became prime minister, and after three and a half years he returned to the president's office.
Showing fish in a garden in the city of Banfas
A man from Banfa asks for help in clarifying the circumstances of the species of fish shown in his garden in Banfa.
Kevin Beins thinks that 75 fish could be rough dust that has gone off with a water stop .
Mr. Beina, who lives about 500 metres from the sea, published a fish video on the Periscope website, hoping that someone would know how these five inches of large fish landed in his garden.
Cruise of the winery: the fabric is now connected to Faifu.
It is now scheduled to end the 1,35 billion-dollar projects in May 2017.
The engineers have joined the northern part of the Quinsferi crossing and moved, which means that the bridge is now connected to Faifu.
The first of the four connectors has been completed, which means that the construction of the bridge is nearing completion.
The construction of the Fafias bridge is 600 metres long and 30 000 tons heavy.
It consists of 10 000 tonnes of steel, 20 000 tonnes of concrete and 46 supporting cables.
The project worth 1.35 billion peas is currently planned to be completed in May 2017.
Economic Secretary Keits Brauns had returned to the building site today and was one of the first to hit the bridge.
He said, "This is a symbolic and historical event in the construction of the vineyard."
In this project we see an inexhaustible engineering solution, where only over 30,000 tons of cement and steel were used in this part's construction.
Despite the heavy weight and size of the bridge, the link between the bridge and the bridge is an extremely delicate process in which there is a need for great precision.
In total, more than 79% of the roof floor has already been built and the last phase that will be included in the bridge with Rosita today means that all parts of the roof are ready to be included.
"The first connection is a very important point in any bridge construction," says Michael Martins, director of the fourth bridge project.
In this fantastic project, the first connection demonstrates the construction of the high-class engineering industry.
After the last stage of the installation and its connection to the north tower support, we are left with the northern stage with a part of the ground or a half.
This was done by breaking up a part of the north-east approach of 700 millimetres to the south.
It was a huge and simultaneously very delicate operation.
It was ridiculous because the transducer was 222 metres long, weighing about 6000 tons and had to reach about 3 % threshold.
Delicate, for access to both directions was limited to a few millimeters.
Congratulations, everyone has done well.
Simona Ballsa is getting gold for women.
Forget about it.
Forget the details.
Simon Bails doesn't worry about it.
A dynamic legend.
Without effort, he's carrying out his vingurts on the velvet.
It shall not be possible to operate on the floor.
It's completely innocent.
And finally also the Olympic Championship.
On the fourth day of the 19th year of his reign, the American vinedresser wore gold medals, showing a complete difference between himself and the rest of the world in the Olympics.
His total number of points 62,198 was more than the result of the winning of the steel medal and of his team member Elias Raismane and the winning of the winning of the bronze medals of the Russian sportsman Alija Mustafin.
On Thursday, U.S. sportsman Simona Bails performed a vinguration for white sports for individual multi-final women in the summer of 2016 in the Olympic Games in Riodejaneiro, Brazil.
The ball became a fourth American in order to gain the title of a multi-stakeholder championship and the fifth best winemaker, to reduce the reputation of the best winemaker in the history of his generation and possibly the best winemakers.
When the final result was announced, she was released in the summer, since the long journey to this warning was at the end.
This achievement draws them closer to the incompetence sportsmen like Michaels Felps, who wrapped up their sports type at another level.
In the last three years, Ballsa has dominated his sport by acquiring 15 medals in world championships, including 10 gold medals, in performing such a great, accurate and ambitious combination of vinyl vinyl, that in 1984 the Olympic champion Maria Lu Retone named him "the best winner she's ever seen".
In Brazil, she was given the final test, where she had to cope with the hopes she had placed on her rather than with other athletes.
She would give her will if she returned home in Spring, Texas without gold medals.
U.S. athletes Simona Bails (left) and Alija Raismane are discussing, as appropriate, the winery of gold and silver medals for individual multi-final women in the Olympics in Riodejaneiro, Brazil, which took place on Thursday, 2016.
The first gold medal, Balsa won the second day, making special election coordinators Marta Karolji's departure tickets.
Although Balsa claims that there has been no such thing on her long road to glory, it is not true.
Some of her presentation's free movements, including her special acrobatic transition, led to Latin music that would greatly affect the street near the Rio Olympics.
It's not a coincidence.
The girl who adopted her parents when she was still a child and who was discovered by the trainer’s mother, Emija Bourman, on a tour of the sports department where the Burmese races took place has now become the force to be calculated.
She has not lost several matches since summer 2013 and the victory series can continue as long as Bails wants it.
Although Mustafin was little in control during two rotations, it was only illusion.
The same blue and free movement - part of the competition where Balsa will defend her champion's title, is still just ahead.
She stood forward with a result of 15,433 on the balcony and strengthened her leadership with a result of 15,933 free movement
Raismane admired her mother - in - law as she looked forward to the results that were only formality and she missed out on the happy summers when the dream she had ever recorded in her notes book was fulfilled.
The result of Raisman was a small absence for four years of old events when she shared a third place with Mustafin, but lost the battle for bronze medal.
Recently, 22 years of age, the captain of the team, who is known as the "age" of the United States, emerged under convincing leadership.
After the supply, she was able to travel freely, with doubts about her return to her home, to the airstrip.
By the age of 19, Balssa’s official Twitter entry r, which she published this week, has already played a completely different role.
Six-year-old Mahaj Braun's "lost" survived an explosion in Philadelphia.
The police reported that 6-year-old boy had been kidnapped in Philadelphia by telling him that he was the second six-year-old person who had been raped in Philadelphia this week.
The parents of the CBS Philatelfian news channel confirmed that this is Mahay Brown.
The parents said that Brauns had been beaten several times, including in the church, in the foot, in the hand, and in the liver, but he was still on the knees when he was taken to the hospital.
Her grandmother Delores Mendezza told her television: "His little body was just a mess."
I can't do it.
The child is in critical condition in the hospital and has already undergone several operations.
The family informs him that he will definitely return.
He had to start attending the first class of the local school.
Braun is one of four people who were raped in part of the city of Germanton.
Three men were also raped: two 29-year-old men and one 32-year-old man.
Channel CBS Philadelphia reports that one of the 29-year-old men is in critical condition, while the other two are stable.
The channel reports that the child was found in the front seat of the car nearly 29 years old in a critical condition.
The other two victims were not found in the car and the police were investigating whether any of them had been shot.
The investigator told the channel CBS Philadelphia that several witches were most likely involved in the attack.
In place of the event, the weapons are found by patrollings belonging to different weapons.
It seems to have been a long-term harassment.
The contents of the two corridors are located on the sides of the road.
"So it seems that there were several armed witches here who were actively involved in the attack," said Chief of the Philadelphia Police, Antony Ginaldi.
The damage is also done in several homes and cars.
No one has been detained yet and police are reported to check the records of surveillance cameras.
On the second day of the raid, a six - year - old girl was raped while she was playing in front of her house in the Westaukina region.
She's less likely to rest, but the police are still looking for the guilty.
Why do we need Simon, Gaby, and Laurie?
I call it the Year's Olympic Olympic Team for several reasons.
First, I've been on all summer Olympics since 1984, and the US team has never been so good.
Second, there are three lightlights in this team, Simon Bails, Gabija Duglas and Lauria Hernandez, which include many new girls.
People can be proud that this team also consists of Elijah Raismane, who is a Hebrew and Medison Kociana, a Catholic.
Finally, this team really represents America.
It has also strengthened the participation of black and Latin American athletes in this sport.
In the last four years, the best winemaker has been an American of African origin.
Last year Simon and Gabia took places 1 and 2.
These are impressive results.
In the past Olympic games, Gabia Duglas became an Olympic champion, and America was able to swim.
Now the world has seen incredible wineries performed by Simon Bails, Duglas and Laurie Hernandez in the three - fold world champions of Simon Bails, Duglas and Laurie Hernandez, performing unpredictably but masterful wineries.
On the fourth day, Simon became a fourth American in order to obtain gold medals for individual women.
Her teammate Alija Raismane got a steel medal.
We have seen the best that this sport can do, but in the rest of the country, the situation is completely different in winter hours.
Simon, Gabia and Laurie entered the Olympic Games together with Elijah and Medison.
She's the "Olympical Friday", because the next Olympic winemaking team will have only four athletes, and this is the trainer Marta Karola's last year in the coach's work.
Winning is really a great sport. Winningers are primarily practicing private lighthouse clubs, and they are cared for by parents who pay for trains, rooms, trips, trainers, hotels (trainers, athletes and their families) and other expenses.
Most of this lighthouse club is located in urban areas that can allow this sport.
These clubs attract all their training, and it is a valuable and long contribution to easily accessible families.
Eimija Bürmana - Simona Bails trainer and Maggie Hainija - Lauria Hernandez trainer has trained their athletes since both girls began working with ease.
We need to provide young girls with more opportunities to train Simon, Gabija and Laurie.
I built my lighthouse organization 20 years ago.
My organization is located in Harlem, and we offer more than 15 000 young people in the city (mainly black and Spanish origins) winemaking trains at a cost or at a low price. We have also trained national and international championships.
In September we will open a branch office in Detroit, my hometown, to provide local young people with the opportunity to learn about this great sport.
It also taught hard work, discipline and progress towards the goal.
This combination ensures long life with good health and success both at school and at work.
This team will train thousands of new girls to practice easily and it's fantastic.
Working with this type of sport is very important, especially for young girls.
This is a very exciting time.
Thanks to Simona, Elijah, Gabia and Medison for the great " Girl's Strength" demonstration, by acquiring Olympic gold medals and by motivating countless new, different origins to become healthy, strong and successful new women.
Following Jeremiah’s rejection of Hannah’s offer, young doctors plan to avoid more stress.
The ministers hoped to end the dispute by reaching an agreement on changes in the agreement with the representatives of the United Kingdom Medical Association, but they rejected 58 per cent of the 37,000 new doctors who participated in the vote.
In July Hants announced plans to conclude a contract indicating that NHS is in a unstable state and that further delays will only harm workers and patients.
The first new doctors have already signed a new contract, which provides for changes in working conditions during the night and at the end of the week to improve working conditions in non-standard working hours.
Last night, BMA’s new doctor, Dr. Elena Macourta, announced that new doctors still have serious concerns about the contract offered, in particular that it will deepen the labour crisis and that it does not provide for all doctors equal conditions.
After eight weeks, until the first new doctor group will sign a new contract, progress must be made, as time is short.
The BMA's efforts to solve the problem through negotiations have coincided with the government's unwilling involvement and sometimes with complete closure.
This happened despite the fact that last month Jeremy Hunts said his door was always open.
Jeremy Hant has to act immediately, stop unemployment and cooperate with new doctors.
If he doesn't, the new doctors are ready for new protests.
At the end of the last strike, more than 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 visits were left, while nurses and consultants tried to replace doctors who had been given the ticket.
The ministers hoped to end the dispute by reaching an agreement on changes in the agreement with the representatives of the United Kingdom Medical Association.
BMA would like to increase the rate of work per week at the end of 54 000 new doctors concerned with new contracts.
The NHS Executive Director, Daniel Mortimers, called on new doctors not to give in to stress.
Mr. Mortimer explains that the stress is not resolved but only increases pressure on the disabled and causes stress and anxiety to patients, caregivers and their families.
In the past two months we have spoken with the new medical committee and together with the Ministry of Health and other institutions, we have responded positively to their questions about vendors and rapporteurs.
The employers hope that active cooperation on other important issues, such as job placement, flexible training, additional training for those who return after career interruptions, training costs, mutual recognition of training programmes, promotion of studies and gender in medicine - shows that employers, the health education institutions of England and the Ministry of Health are keen to implement agreements concluded with BME in November, February and May.
Medicines for 2 rats may reduce the risk of heart attack per day.
Thousands of patients with cardiac arrest could be treated with medicines for 2 days a day, as official representatives recommend that they be used for more people and longer periods of time.
Ticagrelor reduces repeated risk of heart attacks for people with heart disease.
This medicine has already been prescribed for use 12 months after heart strike, reducing repeated risk of heart attack.
The NHS representative recommends that this preparation be used for 4 years after heart rate to further reduce the risk of heart attack for people with heart and blood problems.
However, NHS is currently recommended to use this preparation for 4 years after heart rate to further reduce the risk of heart and blood vessels.
Each year some 140 000 people in England experience heart attacks, and a fourth of them experience repeated heart attacks or stroke.
Cardiac and insults cause fat deposition in the heart walls by forming defenses.
If a rash occurs, it can cause a thrombosis by blocking the blood flow to the heart and causing a heart attack.
On the other hand, if the thromboembolism departs from the blood vessels, it can develop further into the bloodstream and block the access of the blood to the brain by causing the heart.
People who have had a heart attack are subject to the highest repeated risk of heart attack.
Ticagrelor produced by AstraZeneca, a British company named Brilique, reduces the risk of thrombosis.
The new NICE guidelines published today recommend 90 mg Ticagrelor for 12 months and another 3 years for 60 mg twice daily with aspirin.
NICE Director of Health Technology, Professor Kerola Longson, explains: "Despite the availability of medicines to prevent heart attack, more than a quarter of people who have had heart stroke experience another heart attack or stroke that often has serious consequences."
The fear of repeated heart attacks can have a negative impact on the quality of human life.
There is evidence that Ticagrelor effectively reduces repeated risk of heart attacks and heart failure in humans who have already experienced it.
We are pleased to be able to extend treatment to thousands of people who are thus receiving treatment.
In the light of limited information on the efficacy and safety of Ticagrelor, in particular the risk of bleeding when using this medicine for more than three years, the draft guidelines do not recommend longer use of it over this period.
A policy-corrected culture promotes fraud in Muslim communities during election
According to the management report, former city mayor of Tauerhamlets Lutfurs Rahman was dismissed from office in connection with corruption.
The government report reveals that as a result of the culture of policy-correction, eyes are focused on widespread corruption in Muslim communities.
Former government minister Sers Erik Pikls criticises the police, the election will be watched and the city councils will ignore the sign of fraud in the process because "they are afraid to suppress ethnic and religious interests."
The former Community Secretary who has now become the leader of the anti-corruption organisation says that the intimidation of voters is so widespread for religious reasons that the police should be allowed to negotiate for election stations in order to protect the suspects.
He also suggested that voters should present a document proving persons when they vote in order to prove their true identity.
At present, voters need to specify only the name and address.
He even recommends that the voter be appointed with a special title in order to avoid double voting.
Reporters also need to ensure greater protection, says Sers Eriks.
He believes that the press should provide greater access to Council documents and decisions adopted by the informal committees and working groups.
He said: "The goal is not only to prevent fraud but also to protect the local government from the wider corruption and corruption culture that goes hand in hand with it."
The report was ordered by Daungstrita after the scandal in connection with the elections in Tauerhamlet City.
Last year's special election was decided by the court to withdraw the city's measure of Lutfur Rahman from the city's measure of corruption and illegal activities.
The Court found that Rahman 's religious view of his Muslim community was "censically distorted" and listened to his criticisms, accusing them of racism and Islamophobia.
"Rahman has led his election campaign on the basis that the religious duty of believing Muslims is to vote for him."
About 300 votes were false or questionable because one person had voted several times.
Also, Sers Eriks points out that there are signs of fraud throughout the country.
He pointed out that it is particularly disturbing to lie in voting for a post where older members of the Muslim community have forced others to vote for their own willing candidates.
Sers Erik recommended a series of measures to improve the electoral system, including the presentation of a document certifying persons in order to identify the identity of the person.
His report says: "The evidence shows that members of the vulnerable ethnic minority communities, especially women and young people, are forced to vote for the most elected candidates in the community, particularly in the Bangladesh and Pakistan communities."
"There is a concern that regional institutions are not paying attention to these problems because of political corrections, as ethnic and religious interests could be undermined."
Sers Eriks set out 50 recommendations on how to improve the electoral system, which also includes a ban on political activists working with votes cast by mail to prevent "voting".
The report by Teresa Meja also calls for a more careful check of registration to prevent the use of electoral lists for fraud in the area of immigration and benefits.
Consider the possibility before the vote to ask the voters to present a document that identifies persons.
Mark the votes of the voter with a special title to prevent a double vote.
Check the nationality of persons systematically to ensure that the person is entitled to vote.
Set the three-year limitations on automatic mail voting requirements.
To prohibit political campaign participants and activists from working with votes delivered by post and election to vote by post.
Ensuring the police the power to take care of the polls.
Amendments to the Law to facilitate the designation of persons under the Human Rights Act of 1983.
Stop taking photos of the selection in the areas.
Set the requirement to use only English (except in Vels).
Strengthen the training to ensure that the voters go to the polls by one.
Sers Eriks is critical of the Metropolis police, noting that there are no complaints in the Tauerhamlet case .
He says: "The love of justice has only discriminated against Luftur Rahman and his representatives for acts related to corruption and fraud."
He was convinced that he was guilty of a standard of criminal law on the basis of undisputed evidence.
He also criticises the failure of the city council's "examination" voters in the registers.
Sers Eriks points out: "The court decision taken last year is a call for fear.
Our country is known as the birth of Parliament, but a disturbing and secretive election to spread fraud and the exclusion of institutions that fraud does not threaten this good reputation.
Riding with bikes - Other counterparts and other Rio Olympics
In 2016, Rio Olympic fans were reminded of the French biker Paulin Ferrand Prevot, whom fans recognized as extremely similar to Kembridge's hercogiene.
But at the age of 24, the biker was not the only athlete who fought in this summer for gold, which, like the media, was impressed with his well - known friend.
For this reason, for the good Rio Olympics and all the famous faces that are currently visible on our screens, FC has created a list of Olympic players, which is most similar to Hollywood stars.
Farmer and wolf: A team of U.S. hunters' team member Breidijs Elison, on the left, has been compared since childhood to Leonardo Di Caprio
Despite other colleagues on the track, many people on the Internet point out that this lodger could be a superstar Leonardo Di Caprio's twin brother.
A member of the U.S. Men's Locator team, Breidys Elisons, brought wind on the Twitter site when photographs were published where he was very similar to Volstrítas Wilka.
The athlete also noticed wind in social media and recognized that he had been compared to Leonardo Di Caprio since childhood.
"I don't personally see a great look, except the bar", Breidys tells about the expenditure on Huffington Post.
"He's a good guy, so I'll take it as a compliment."
This year, there will no doubt be an even greater popularity among the most popular London Olympics in 2012: the ambiguity between the British far-off Greek Ruterford and the popular actor Nilu Patrick Harisa.
Russian lighthouse Alija Mustafin, thanks to its large, expressive eyes, is compared with the American singer Gloria Estefan.
When talking about swimming, South Africa's pilot Camerons van der Burgs has been compared for several years to the star "Showed to View" Mtjø Morson.

The same ancient counterparts are the tennis star Rafael Nadals and actor Josh Hartnet, who have similar designs and drawings.
Russian silver medalist Julia Efimova and actress Annaline Maccorda may not only look like sun-burning skin and blonde hair. As soon as fans consider the unique American athlete Nathan Adrians to be like Joseph Gordon Levi.
Women with disabilities: The football star (left) Houpi Solo and the series "Deksters" actress Jennifer Karpenter (right) are similar faces and eyes.
Not one: someone Twitter user was delighted to realize that others also encounter these similarities
The theory: This user believes that there may be a reason why both look so similar
Recently a Twitter user reported with real joy that "the other Internet users are agreeing that Houpa Solo and Jennifer Karpentre are actually looking identical."
The U.S. football star and the Deksters series actress are so exactly the same face form and eyes.
Other popular comparisons are about the Kerio Volš Jennings and her smile, which is almost identical to the taste of Laura's Line. Also, gold medals were obtained by easy-to-read Gabij Duglas' beauty, a wide smile similar to "Bring It On" star Gabriela's smile in the Union.
The CBC Olympic player apologizes for his comment that the Chinese footballer is 'complete as a pig'.
Baron Macdonalda's analysis of 14-year-old Ai Yanhas finished 4x200 m free-style staphetium in women's home at the fourth place of Ai Yan.
The Canadian Canal CBC was forced to apologize because one of its commentators commented that a 14-year-old Chinese dancer from the game was "escaped from the game that he just died" and "will end up like a dog".
Commentary Byrons McDonalds thought his microphone was off when 4x200 m free-style staff women finally expressed their personal views.
McDonald, who was included in the CBC Commentary Team to give comments on life, said: "The little fourteen-year-old from China can't stay with her."
"He's gone too far, he's gone out of the game that he just died and ended up like a bitch."
Thank you very much.
At 14 years of age, the result of Chinese explorer Ai Yanhana was 1:57.79, which is 1.61 seconds lower than Canadian Taylor Ruck's result by allowing Canadians to reach China.
Readers throughout Canada reacted immediately to the Internet because they were shocked to hear such tone and expressions.
Emets Makfarlains wrote on Twitter: "You just said that 14-year-old farmer from China "was finished like a pig?".??.
Idiot didn't realize they were still in the straight line.
Ai Yanha from China 4x200m free-style final women were named "a small fourteen-year-old Chinese woman who is not with her."
The criticism against Bahrain quickly came into effect, as many asked for explanations.
Twitter users were unable to make any comments from Bairona Makdonalda.
Twitter user Sarah Paradi wrote: "Oho, #ByronMacDonald.
You're a representative of CBC and Canada and you and you, we're all listening to you like you are. #pretty.
Shortly after Scott Rasel, who was currently leading the CBC directly, apologized for McDonald's comments, saying: "We apologize that the comment on the landing result was rejected in the immediate room."
It was a failed choice of words and we are very sorry that it happened.
CBC apologized more than 90 people who had responded to this comment on Twitter.
McDonald's colleague Skotam Raselm came and apologized to him.
CBC then included more than 90 Twitter users who complained about McDonald’s comment.
The channel also quickly published an apology and a statement.
We are very sorry that such comments were made and that they went directly into the room.
Last night we reacted immediately and apologized to all direct viewers and followers of social media.
For the sake of clarity, it should be said that the comments by Bairona were made about the delivery of the applicant, not addressed to him personally.
However, in any case they were not professionally and successfully selected and Baron was very sorry.
On Wednesday afternoon, McDonald personally apologized in the immediate room and tried to explain that he did not think his comment would be taken as a personal attack.
In the CBC Olympic game, he said, "I would like to use the alert and apologize for the comment I made last night after the women's free style matches."
I was talking about the delivery of the pensioner, not about him personally.
It's hard to say I didn't mean to be rude, and I'm really sorry it happened.
Primark bought a shock on a woman who accidentally hit the middle of the store.
The buyers felt uncomfortable when the woman began to dress in order to get into the middle of the business.
When the situation got worse, she asked them to make sure they were there for her and then the village, leaving the bus back in the shop.
She continued to look for clothes at the Volkestone Bouverie Place shopping center at the store and held four more biscuits.
Primark shop Bouverie Place is a shopping center in Folkeston – a place where this woman held her pillow and then put it back in her hair.
At the same time, two children were found at the store, Jeannie Davidson, who says that an unknown woman was attracted to her dress and pastry store, not to buy anything.
She points out that humans could not happen to their own eyes.
In the middle of the store, she took off her shoe pockets, picked up her pockets, and kissed them, and went on to the place.
She didn’t even try to find a more discreet place to measure it, she just held it on to the place.
Everyone saw how his uncle's biscuits and apparently the woman didn't like it because she just put it back in her hair.
She made three more biscuits until she decided that she didn’t like any of them.
They did not think that he would hold them back from watching or thinking about a person who would buy the clothes he was wearing.
Young Davidson (33 years old) from Kent says: "The idea is that someone will buy clothes that have been stolen by another person and that have not been lost."
The incident occurred on the second afternoon.
Mrs Davidson adds: "I accept that business workers have removed those clothes from the business shoes - which are also acceptable."
I cannot imagine that I could buy a new one and know that another woman has held it and has not lost it since.
The representative of the Primark indicated that Primark was known for the incident that took place on Tuesday, 9 August.
The specific clothes are removed from the business shoes.
How to protect yourself from firearms using Krav Maga
The world is a dangerous place, but this video from Dailymail.com could make it a little safer.
To find out how to protect ourselves near a distance from the attackers with a gun, we spoke to Krav Mag Major of New York Ron Mizraki.
Regardless of whether you're missing from the front or the back, this video shows how to protect yourself and get an advantage over the attacker.
The suspect indicates that if an attacker breaks off the wall, it is first to be forced to see the attacker clearly and to avoid this trajectory.
Then the gun shall stand between its front hand and its back and make a seat in the face of the opponent with his free elegance.
Then follow the side of the road along the circle and before the attacker gets into pain, he has to take his gun, walk on his face with a gun back and walk away, continuing to turn his weapon against him.
If an attacker is approaching from the front, the situation is similar - it must be avoided from this trajectory, it must be shot and it must be turned off so that the attacker can't escape.
At the same time, pressure on the weapon must be placed on the back of his chest and eventually he must be fired by the weapon and let go of it.
Do you hear trouble?
Look at the video to see exactly how Mirraki does it.
But remember, if you're not a master of Krav Maga, it's safer to give your money back to the rescuer.
The bathroom family is housed in Saltaša Cornvola’s social home and is placed on the street.
The water family has been expelled from the neighborhood for terroristizing neighbors by harming the social home of 50,000 pigs.
Tanja Skeldon and her partner, Sons Trebilkok, were dismissed from the property in Saltaša Kornvolo, as they were charged with several complaints.
When they were forced out of the property, the representatives of the shocked housing service found that the property was completely demolized.
The walls and walls were paved with pipes, waste was excavated, and walls were covered with graphite.
The family is now evicted from property and is more likely to live in a private property.
Donna Makevoja, managing director of the Cornvola House Service, says there is a concern that homes will not be able to be restored.
She says that people who lived here were extremely difficult and felt that they could not live.
In this case, several factors need to be assessed, as this property will not have a good reputation in Cornvol.
This family is famous and its name is well - known.
The others were three children who regularly remained in custody and the police said that their terror was expressed as violence, street abuse with baseball bats, intimidation of local people, drug use, drug trafficking and verbal abuse and restlessness.
47 years old Skeldon, whose name was owned, will be sentenced to antisocial behaviour in June.
A number of demolition houses have found waste.
In a home where previously marketed drugs are available, there are also several grades.
They say they've been on the street regularly and constantly being called the police.
The Cornvola Home Service released them from the pressure of their property when they were given 11 weeks to free them out of the house.
The missing neighbors were very happy about leaving because their lives had been absolute hell.
One said, "They didn't care about other people."
We lived with them for about 20 years. It's always been a joke.
I can't believe how often I've seen the police here.
We couldn't slow down.
We found out because there was so much noise here - we didn't get to it!
Now that they're finally gone, it'll be wonderful here.
Adam Fitzpatrik, head of the Protection of Neighborhood of the Cornvola Home Service, said that the family did not cooperate with local security authorities.
The family lived here for 20 years and here is called the police regularly.
A variety of old and unused items were found in the growing garden of houses.
He also said: "I am very sorry that the tenants did not show any responsibility for their behavior, since leaving the house is always the last step taken by the Cornvola House Service."
This was a very difficult case because their behavior was extreme and their neighbors were very strict about their behavior.
I appreciated the work that all my team, Devonas and Cornvola police and members of the community have done in this case, who were brave and cooperated with us by providing us with the necessary information.
I hope that this event will facilitate the lives of neighbors and show that antisocial behavior is unacceptable.
Fitzpatris said that all three children lived here for different periods, but all were about 20 years old.
A clean matrice left on the floor in one of the rooms after the discharge.
Service personnel will now have to clean up the lost sheep left at home.
In 2014, the house was demolished by the police and recovered more than 70 grams of marijuana, weights, accessories and 1700 pounds in cash.
Skeldon is only recognised as a criminal drug in the storage of Class B drugs for the purpose of distributing them.
She said that the money was meant for her son Lee Sheldon, who suffered from car accidents in 2013.
After the discharge, it is known that they are currently renting a private property in Plimut.
On many of the walls of the house, graphs were marked.
The police report that they will continue to put up with employers who violate their rental contracts.
The representative of the Devonas and Cornvolas Police, Angela Krova, points out that this exclusion is an indisputable warning to other tenants who continue to break the rules.
He also said, "This is a warning to those who think they can act like they want and will not have any consequences."
Devonas and Cronvola police are not acceptable criminal and anti-social behaviour, and the police will continue to work with our partners to protect the local communities.
The willingness to spend can give impetus to the economy.

The cannon measure shall be prohibited by the drilling of the pellets in the flatmala.
The city of Kannu, the southern coastal city of France, has been banned from selling plastic bags in this city's platinum, which almost completely protects the woman's body and is very much remembered by the local officials on Thursday.
The cannon scale of David Linnars has signed an order that "accessibility to plague and flooding is prohibited for everyone who does not have a pillage that respects good practice and secularism" as the basic principle of the French Republic.
"Pludmal fever, which manifests itself in an exceptional way during the period of religious presence when France and the places of culture are the target of terrorist attacks, may create a risk to public order (drinking, harassment, etc.) which is necessary to prevent it," said the Act.
"We are talking not about the ban on religious symbols in the platmal, but about an external suit that is linked to the faithful terrorist movements that war against us," explains the head of the municipal municipal service, Thierry Miguels.
He added that the Burkini peldkostima in the Kannu Plains has not been seen since 28 July when the good Central Party's "Republic" member Linars signed this order and it came into force.
This week, the water park in the city of Marseilles opened up planned private measures for Muslim women who were dressed in bunk beds, as the consensus on such measures was presented to both the good and the left-wing policy.
In France it is prohibited to wear the headgears of Muslim women who are face-to-face but are not prohibited by religious symbols or appropriate clothing.
On 14 July, 85 people were killed by the group "The State of Islam" in a terrorist attack in the nearby town of Nica.
On July 26, two attackers who had violated the trust of the Islamic State, brutally massacred the priests in the north of France.

The "Cubana" festival started in Lucassala.
On Thursday, 11 August, the evening in Lucassala was given a start for one of the last festivals of this summer - there will be "Cubana" until Sunday night.
On the first night, groups such as Enter Shikari from Britain, which were expected earlier, but without the program being lost, US banks "NOFX", DJ Maxim from "The Prodigy" and others.
The next festival day's program also has some interesting words - "Guano Apes" and "Garbage", Pan-Croat legend "Ramones" founder of Markijs Ramones with "Marky Ramone's Blitzkrieg", "Brutto&Lyapis" with the leader of the Baltician Pan-Croak in front of Sergei Mihaluk, popular Georgian actor and singer Vahtangs Kikabidze, Ukrainians "Vopli Vidoplyasova" and a series of others, but the full event programme can be viewed here.
This is the second year when the Cuban festival takes place in Latvia.
After this severe financial failure and serious losses, but it did not stop the drivers from re-examination - they added the title to the title, also included a Latvian group (on Friday night 19:15 on the "All Day Long" stage) and announced that now the festival has become "closer and gained local colours with the symbols of Riga like its pants and cats".
Whether these efforts will be justified or not is too much to be considered, because the festival just broke in, but, as Delfi Exclaide observed on the first night, at least the great efforts of the people to attract did not come out and the number of visitors were similar.
The British Railway Team twice had a good Olympic record and won the press.
On Thursday, the British team twice improved the Olympic record and won a victory in the race for men.
The first Olympic record improved in qualification, but firstly, the competition improved it from new Germans.
At the end of the Sprint, the British team was joined by New Zealand, and the British withdrew the title of the Olympic record owners by leaving them with silver medals.
The final British team won 42,440 seconds, exceeding 0.102 seconds.
In the battle for the bronze French team, Australia was defeated.
It should be noted that the record was also improved in the qualification of women's housing travel - the British team has improved the world record, which is now 4:13,260.
President who remained in the scene: Gustav Zemgala - 145.
On Friday, 12 August, around 145 years since the birth of the second Latvian President, Gustav Zemgal.
The Zemgals declared the State of Latvia, but the failure has been largely described by the first President of Latvia, Jan Chakste, and the last president of the pre-session, Karll Ulmanna.
None of our civil men have so much to defend democracy and justice as Zemgals, published by Gustav Zemgala ten years ago in his book Arnold Auzinš.
In a conversation with the Portal Delfi, Ausijn points out that the Zemgals is one of the rare high-level politicians who have had a sense of humor.
The others are so rigid, always very right.
He taught that it wasn't like it, it could be like Raymond Vyson.
"He was the one who was close to the people," said Auzn.
Today's politicians know stories badly, they refer to Karl Ulman as a good leader, but rarely does anyone know how negative he was.
The only person in the government sitting was General Balodis.
Even if he is mild and gentle in his imagination, he was, of course, historical.
"Zemgal with its sense of humor and democracy leaves a direct negative impact," says Auzins.
Professor of History and Philosophy of the University of Latvia at Aivars Stranga in the negotiations with "Delfi" agree with the Ausnia evaluation of the Earth as a peaceful and well-known citizen.
He also notes that Zemgals has raised respect for minorities and has regularly called on the Jewish representatives to the President's city.
"It was not at that time an act of aggression, after the country's president Alberts Kviesis took over this tradition," says the historian.
He was such a deaf and appreciated person who had come to talk about becoming the president for a long time.
He didn't believe in it himself. He just didn't.
He also felt quite critical because he did not know the French language but felt that the President must understand it.
"The French language bases were both taught during the Presidency," Stranga explains.
The land did not allow him to speak again, and he did not even like it.
In fact, he is a highly respected person in the history of Latvia, already in the city of the President before his arrival - he was a very demanding notary.
Zemgals also led the famous Zemgal kaki Suvorova Street 3, where there was a treasurer and treasurer company, where the practical government will negotiate with the Latvian state.
He was always progressive.
He was not a great Ulman, but he was not publicly opposed.
"In private talks both times, it has been said that Ulman's actions are not really sympathetic to him," Stranga says.
He lived a peaceful life without any suspicion of lawlessness or corruption.
How do we remember Armageddon today?
I'm sorry, but for most of them, he only associated with some street in Riga.
He was an absolute democracy, seemed to be central.
"There have been no major disruptions during her time, i.e. he could associate with such a real stable presidency," Stranga summarizes.
During the presidency of Gustava Zemgal from 1927 to 1930, Latvia's national visit to Sweden also took place, which at the time meant its full recognition in the neighbouring country and its inclusion in the North European democratic nation.
On 28 May 1929, Zemgals visited the country in Stockholm.
The visit of King Gustav V of Sweden to Latvia took place on 29 June 1929.
The second president of Latvia was born in 1871 but died forever in January 1939.
Simple ways to help children end up with breathing.
I often come face - to - face with the fact that the child’s smile, the presence of a nude, is viewed by his parents as something wrong and unusual.
When a child manifests his breath - we don't know how to react, Econet indicates psychologist Jekaterin Kesa.
The specialist encourages little conversation about these natural and human feelings - the dreams and dreams that each experience periodically.
Aggression - it's already a physical action directed against other people, and it usually shows up when we feel comfortable.
When we, adults, are spiritually tired, we usually know what is happening to us and how to end it.
We can say, push, hide, keep yourself, tell your friends or other neighbors about them, we can dream of crossing the couch, smoking cigarettes (it's not the best way to smell!), go in the shower, get in the chair on the table and do other things that we don't usually do.
We do not face our aggression against others because we know different ways to end these emotions.
Children who are exposed to ghosts do not understand what happens to them, how they are named, and how to live with them.
They can say, "Hey prom!", "You're deaf," "I don't care about you," "I'm not afraid of you" - and very rarely when I can say, "I'm mad at you."
Children live in a poetic sense, they are completely right here, this time, they are spontaneous and really in expressing their feelings, and often they are in different emotions.
It is very important that parents do not prevent their children from expressing their feelings, including feelings, not being told about them, but rather helping the child.
Do relationships need to be maintained?
The last working day on which not all windows have happened as you would like or simply bad timing - there are so many reasons why I would like to be on the alert, on the day or even longer "stop" from all over the world.
Is it possible to break off relationships and little more?
However, does this also show that each of the partners is on their way?
In his opinion, the king is divided into different ages.
Janis (23) is short and nuclear: "In my view, if you have to wait for the relationship, then you are not with the real person".
Eduards (30) has recently discovered a scheme that may help.
If you feel that your partner is starting to get nervous about each smaller issue, then you are certain that it is a real time to study other fields of the forest to see if you are missing or especially if you are not thinking or even wanting to see him again.
So the answer is - yes, keeping quiet can help save time and understand how important it is for you to be on the other side.
Kaspars (29) reveals his theory.
I think it is important to keep relationships between each other on a daily basis, because if you spend time with people 24 hours a day, seven days a week, then the conflicts are inevitable.
The result is that you notice each other’s actions, and that starts to work on your nerves.
People start covering each other, especially if there's no more to talk about, just about what you've done in the day.
My personal experience is this, so I have not had relations for more than a few months.
If you ever think of yourself as being better than others - then why has this woman with whom you are together benefited someone who may think that you are not good enough and there are paradise fields behind the mountains?
Just thinking is a little gift already.
I don't, I don't.
"I am, so I don't judge those who don't." said Edmunds (46).
King (33) has a completely opposite view of them.
I'll let everyone have the right time to stay.
You can't see every moment, all the time, from morning till evening, looking at each other's eyes and looking for love that's inextricable.
Watch out!
There are so many things - friends, work, ballet.
It's all your time.
Of course, for a friend or a woman, however, if both are to maintain their balance between family life and the rest of the world, then it can live to the point of death.
That's it and that's it.
Mortíns (27) says: "It's hard to say - whether it's necessary or not, whether it's possible or not to take it slow, but one is clear - it's a suggestion to the proposer something that has nothing to do with the end, something that's missing."
If this question arises, then it must be calculated that there will be a change in the near future - on the good or the bad side, it will depend on itself.
I think as long as you're new and new, you need so much time, but when everything is serious and relationships are going to be completely different, then there can be no talking about rest.
But you choose to live forever together!
"If you can't stop each other's company now and once again need a break, then what will be when you will be pensioners who comment on how boring cats die or fight for what the garden needs to be better protected in the day," explains Christap (19).
All of the Lord's names have been changed.
With its sensitive and sensitive personality, Rozentals first stimulated the interest of Latvian people in painting art.
"In this sense he was the first love of the Latvian people, which will remain forever," wrote Roman Suta, the oldest Latvian poet, Jani Rosental.
Also, in 2016, when discovering a wide retrospective exhibition of the oldmaster at the restored Latvian National Art Museum in the main building, Rozentals is the first love of Latvian art.
The exhibition was opened on 12 August, but from 13 August it is available to visitors and will be available until 30 October.
The Latvian National Museum of Art with a wide retrospective retrospective in the newly opened Great Exhibitions, Jani Rosental (1866-1916), which is one hundredth of the International Day of Birth, is included in the UNESCO's filming calendar.
The retrospective exhibition, which covers more than 150 jobs, is one of the central events of the New Rozental Jubilee programme.
The selection of works of art consists mostly of the collection of Latvian National Museum of Art, which is a convincing representation of the main stages of the work of the class and the genres, the style changes and the variety of techniques.
In addition, exhibitions were used by the Akseli Gallena-Kallela Museum, the Writing and Music Museum, the Liepaja Museum, the Tukuma Museum and several private collections in Latvia and Finland.
For centuries, the presence of photos of the meat has been relived, and the exhibition’s mobile application reveals a number of works of art in conjunction with photographs taken by the photographer himself with his camera.
On the other hand, the Somijas-Latvija company "Rozentáls-seura", which is named after the Latvian classic, offers the first quarter of a small information tour exhibition "With a flag in Finland, with a heart in Latvia" in the Latvian National Art Museum.
A similar exhibition in English, Finnish and Swedish languages will be opened in the "Virk" gallery in Helsinki.
Mets Leblanks is waiting patiently to return to the topGear show.
The television news "TopGear" ("Gazi Square!") led by Matts Leblanks said that he was looking forward to driving back in the second season of this car, but he realized that he did not know what to expect in the future.
Nothing official is expected.
"If there is, then the BBC will report on it," Leblanks opened up in a interview with television critics.
The news of the "Gasi grid!" came in July when a reconnaissancer, Chris Evanss, announced that he was coming from the scene.
After the seizure, Evans admits that Leblanks and "Gass on the floor!" are "as created by each other".
The stars of the former series "Friends" ("friends") are described as "true and brave men", thus undermining the fear that both friendship has fallen during filming.
When Leblank asked what he liked most about this, he replied that traveling to other countries, such as South Africa, Morocco and Ireland.
Telekanal BBC reports that this is not planning to replace Evans in the new 24th season.

However, the air will not be warmer than +18 degrees.
U.S. model business delays in her interpretation resulted in a perversity of distorted photosession gloves and a lack of noise film.
In fact, it is very provocative, to the balanced work of the wet and banana diversity, which makes it difficult to cross the borders between European art house films and the Hollywood generic product area.
The film with Vigo Mortensen in its main role focuses on whether parents’ conceptually chosen life models (ecological, vegetarianism, alternativeism and restrictions from consumer society’s folly and values) bring praise or destruction to their children.
The father of six children is an idealist after the death of a woman who is faced with questions of right choice and true values.

This survival solo number can be compared to James Franko's performance show in the 127-hour movie and Rainena Reinolds' game in the movie Description lives.
Perhaps there is also the main role of artist Mila Kunisa, who, from the perspective of creationists and whose family values, seems to be the only fantasy of all lost Hollywood stagers.
In Syria, the Islamic State has killed 2000 civilians.
The Islamic National Guards of the Terrorist Group, fleeing from Menbija, Syrian Aleppo, attacked about 2,000 civilians who were used as a giant, reported on Friday by the US-supported Kurd and Arab Alliance and observers.
"We are not ashamed of them because they took themselves with the civilian population when they fled to Jarabulus," said the representative of the Kurdu Menbija Military Council.
After two months of prolonged fighting, the Syrian Democratic Forces (QSD) which is supported by the U.S. Arab Alliance in northern Syria announced on Friday that Menbja has been released from the Jihads.
The Islamic State Menbiz was adopted in 2014.
In the past week, QSD has raised most of the "Islamic State" fighters from Menbija, but some have remained and have shown strong opposition.
However, on the fifth day they left the city, taking themselves with them to the streets.
Islamists go to Jerābul, located at Turkey's border.
The Syrian Observer for Human Rights (SOHR) organization based in London also reported that about 2,000 people were kidnapped by the Islamic State.
SOHR reported that Islamists robbed city cars, forced people to attack them, and then took them to Jerābul.
Islamic national activists also committed mass kidnappings.
In January, Islamists raided more than 400 civilians, including women and children, in the province of Deir ez Zoras in eastern Syria.
Later, about 270 Islamic prisoners were released.
As many Islamic state fighters have fled from Menbija, it is not known.
The representative of the Kurdu Menbija Military Council reported that QSD has been able to save 2500 people who have been detained by Islamists in Menbiz.
The information collected by SOHR shows that at least 437 civilians, including 105 children, have lost their lives in the battle against Menbiz.
Killed 299 QSD fighters and 1019 Jihadists.
Collegiants refuse to apply for VID.
The Head of State Environment Service Inga Collegova decided to withdraw its candidate from the Office of the Director-General of State Income Service (VID), which was informed by the Agency by the Ministry of Finance.
The collegiate states that the consultation of her candidate has increased between the ruling coalition parties.
It seems that the real reasons for the debate are related to the political views, but more often, the invisible interests and they have no say in my assessment of my professional abilities.
"It is not acceptable to me," he said, "and I have already been a victim of the VID leader's office.
In the case of its candidate being approved by the Government, it is clear that this would not be a convincing vote and would not allow it to work fully and carry out the necessary changes in the VID, with all the support of the Government.
Without it, it would not be possible for a full-time job, Collegiants.
"I have rather stressed in public that I do not want to be politically independent, but my entire application process is now too political," the official explains.
"Thank you for your trust and support to me, it is an experience that I value as a benefit," wrote the writer of Rezineze-Ozolai.
On the third day, the unity showed that during the meeting with Collegiants there was an "important contradiction" between the applicant's explanations and the information available in the public register on the costs of the SIA Pallogs dividends, as the decisions of the Pallogs participants are publicly available.
The current responsibility of the head of the VID is fulfilled by the Deputy Director-General of Dace Pelek.
Two small police involved in the rescue of children without supervision shall be informed by the Government of the Latgale region.
The report was received on Friday about 7 p.m. for children without surveillance leave.
They were located in Lebanon at the former store building.
Two small girls were immediately handed over for medical assistance.
There was also a sleep with documents and mobile phones.
Within half an hour, the law guards identified the location and dose of the children’s parents as possible.
When women entered the home of a civil man, the police found out that she was sleeping because she was in a strong alcohol supply.
After initial information, during the evening of 1992, a woman was born into an alcoholic relationship.
Once home after a joint meeting, women have decided to leave the business under unexplaned circumstances.
The police were immediately informed of the incident, which also resulted in a decision on the child’s next bed.
Riga's freedom has introduced all the recommendations of the UK regarding the Russian island project.
The Riga Freedom Administration has introduced all of the five state control (VK) recommendations on the development of the project Infrastructure for the transfer of port activities on the Russian island of Russia from the implementation of the city centre, reported to the company Dana.lv portal.
The approval of the project is planned at the next meeting of the Riga Freedom Board.
In order to implement the recommendations in accordance with the VC proposal, the Riga Freevost Management also conducted the legal and operational audit findings of the International Auditor Deloitte Riga Free Management and the recommendations made to improve the project management during the next phase of the project.
Information on the implementation of the recommendations has also been sent to the VC today.
Despite the fact that Riga's liberal administration does not agree with the VK's opinion on the usefulness of the implementation of the Russian island project, we are very responsible for the implementation of the project and the financing provider - the European Commission (EC).
I would like to stress that all the construction planned within the project is complete within the time-limits and the planned size.
"In order to prove to all those involved in the implementation of the project, including the EC, the VK and the stakeholders, that the main objective of freedom is to successfully implement the project, we have fully implemented all VC recommendations on project management and monitoring issues," says the director of the Russian island project Sanita Kaire.
The long-term action plan for monitoring and monitoring the project’s objective was complemented by the most important planned actions of the parties involved and the time-limits for the necessary decisions, for the definition of meetings and regular reports and their deadlines, for the monitoring of the planned construction process instruments and for the definition of the most important border points.
The approved action plan for achieving the project's objective by 31 December 2018, in accordance with the recommendations of the JRC, is complemented by implementing monitoring activities, thereby strengthening the control of the deadlines of the other parties involved in the implementation of the project from the Republic of Riga.
A project management plan has been developed for the development of project management and for the reduction of potential risks, by defining the areas of project management and by specifying the documents developed to ensure a control and monitoring mechanism for each of them.
A project management structure scheme is developed to enhance the project capacity, reflecting the structure, qualifications and functions of the project management team.
In order to improve the communication of Riga's voluntary management with the parties involved in the project, a communication plan has been developed by interested parties, which, in addition to the parties identified in the project's action plan, define the principles, forms and periodicity of the project concerned for the successful completion of the project.
On the other hand, in order to improve control of the use of financial resources, the need for the conclusion of a service contract or the opening of a procurement contract will continue to be more detailed and legal.
Under the project, the Russian island has built a port infrastructure that is consistent with global standards - four new deep water stations, railway routes and engineering communications.
The co-financed buildings of the Cohesion Fund have been completed and put into operation at the end of the year preceding the end of the year, reaching the amount of EUR 10.6 million allocated to it.
Safety at airports has been strengthened in Slovakia due to threats.
After non-specific threats were received, Slovakia reinforced security measures on Friday in several airports, announced by the Ministry of Home Affairs.
"In view of the risks, we have strengthened security measures at international airports in Bratislava, Poprad and Košic," AFP informed the news agency on Friday by the representative of the Ministry of Home Affairs of Slovakia.
"The National Security and Analysis Centre is currently analysing the information we have received", he adds.
On 16 September the capital of Slovakia will take place an informal European Union (EU) summit, which will be attended by all the countries of the block except for Britain.
The meeting will discuss the impact of the British Brexit referendum and discuss the future of the EU without Britain.
Slovakia is the EU Presidency by January.
German researchers are discussing the number of "Berlin's Wall" victims.
According to the new study, the number of casualties in the Communists in the south could be much higher than the abovementioned, but the doubts about the number of actual victims remained undisputed.
According to data provided on the third day by the Berlin Wall Museum Checkpoint Charlie, between 1945 and 1989 at the border with the west, and the most recent authorities of the Western Communists were gathering 1841 people who were trying to get out of their controlled territory.
The museum has been investigating border-related deaths for years and is constantly correcting the number of victims.
This year, 11 more deaths have been added to the list, including including a six-year-old son, who agreed to try to enter the family through the former Czech Republic and Hungary.
Among the new Berlin Wall victims are also council-martial desserts.
"The final amount of damage caused by the double evils of communism and socialism has not yet been fully documented," acknowledged the director of the museum, Alexandra Hildebrandte.
"Our task is to ensure that the heads of people who have suffered harm, trying to avoid the Communist-controlled state, are collected and not ignored," stressed Hildebrandtes in a report published.
However, other researchers have already questioned the number of new numbers.
"Number 1841 is unconfirmed", in an interview Süddeutsche Zeitung claims that the history of the Free University of Berlin is an expert in East Germany.
He, along with other researchers at the Free University of Berlin, is currently reviewing possible cases of suspected death at the border and has so far been able to approve only 260 cases.
Previously, researchers have noted that only 138 people were killed by the Berlin Wall.
In the light of those people who have suffered, trying to escape the Baltic Sea or to enter the Middle East through the territory of neighbouring countries, the number of victims, according to the State, could reach about a thousand.
However, this is significantly less than 1841.
One of the reasons for the number of victims could be different methodologies.
The Checkpoint Charlie Museum also records all cases of suicide of the East German border guard, whether or not they were directly related to their service.
The museum also includes cases of death that are not directly related to violence.
"If older people from 70 to 80 years of age die from heart attacks after border control," he should have the consequences of these "sleaking limits", Hildebrandte.
However, the State is convinced that it is necessary to make a distinction between the elderly who may have died as a result of their experience and those who have died because of a long waiting period in the bus by the border.
Regardless of its victim's record, it is not easy because the Communist Powers of East Germany did not disclose such statistics, and the researchers need to obtain documents in different deleted archives, states the State.
However, the State Group has recently received new documents, and therefore it could come up with a new number of calculations in the near future.
LPF President Pone on Rio owes to the trainer's accreditation; this is a surprise.
In recent days, President Kaspars Pone Riodejaneiro of the Latvian Federation of Peleging (LPF), who has won a bad reputation in the Olympic Games, has won a trainer accreditation, but he is surprised to hear about it.
On the third day, a large informant came after the words of the German trainer Alón Ribakov, who revealed that the last time he decided to go to Riodejaneiro to Pone, while the trainer had to stay home.
The original list of passengers was approved by Alona Ribakova and Uvis Kalniņš, trainers Jacubovskis and Davis Collins, as well as by President Pone of the Federation.
The Latvian Pledging Federation applied for five members of the Olympic Games, and even before the departure, Aldon Vrubläevskis claimed that Germany will have and he is looking for tickets.
"However, apparently for objective reasons, he was not there," said Pone, saying that this did not affect the outcome of Ribakov.
At the request of the Federation, Uvja trainer agreed to help her.
Mr., who himself is a member of the LOK Executive Committee, has criticised the operation of the LOK by bringing reproach on the Olympic Sport Supervisory Organisation.
In my view, it is unrealistic for the LOK Executive Committee to approve five persons and not take any of them away.
"I don't know why there was no place for the Pedestrian Federation right now," Pone says that the work of the federations and their presidents has not been evaluated in society, remembering that the federation's presidents do not receive wages.
Pone also criticised Jacubovski himself, arguing that before the London Olympic Games, when Ribakova was not approved among the participants, he appealed to the International Water Sports Federation (FINA) and called on Latvia not to send any athletes.
Mr. President could not tell why he was in Olympic games with a trainer's accreditation, which probably had to be entrusted to Jacubovski.
"I was asked as President of the Federation, but for some unknown reasons I received trainer accreditation and now I'm not here."
The situation changed every day, the number of accreditations available changed.
Until the last time I thought that Germans would be there because I had no other information.
After the information available at the Agency's LETA, a few days before the start of Ribakova, she had a conversation with Poni, and after her fiancé had a sharp eye, however, the LPF President himself showed that she had a daily conversation with a desire to start sportsmen before the start.
He recalled that LPF oversees five types of sports in the Olympic programme and that four of them also take place for children in Latvia.
The President of the Federation has shown that there are also important points of reference in Latvia and that he has talked about such programmes for almost two weeks.
He praised the work of the Federation and said that in Latvia in 2018 the World Cup could be resolved.
Finding Riodejaneiro is not my vacation here, I work here, spend my time and I try to implement the four-year programmes.
It'll take 600,000 lashes in the garage.
During the AS Latvian fishing resources renewal programme this week, in Daugau, Mangalsala, there is a shortage of salmon and timetables, and this year it is planned to allocate more than 600,000 once-year-old salmon and time-consuming fish stocks, raised by the scientific institute of Bior Tomes and Doles.
LETA informed the Latvian authorities that fishing will continue in the coming months - each year the total of the Daugava basins is allocated to 6,300,000 different species of fish and capillaries.
In the spring of 2016 and early summer, lead and snow will be released in June - strong, July - summer summer, August and September - summer and summer.
The Director of Latvian Production, Maris Könickis, said that environmental concerns are one of the main pillars of sustainable development of the Latvian Group.
"Every activity in the conservation and propagation of fish resources is aimed at environmental friendly actions in close cooperation with the Scientific Institute of the Office, both by raising and entering fish stocks in the Daugava basin and by carrying out other activities," Könickis said.
This year, Daugava will be free of more than 600,000 once a year.
For the second year before entry, small fish are marked on the bottom.
Today, there are 25,000 batches of small pieces with an average weight of 31.3 grams.
Each year, in the composition of scientificly based species and in the digital range of Dauga and its basic watersteels, there is the release of fish and capillaries.
In accordance with the legislation of the Office, the pooling of fish resources in Daugau and its waters shall be carried out on the basis of an expert on the damages caused to fish resources by the economic activity of Latvia and by giving a conclusion as to what compensation measures are to be taken in order to ensure the diversity of fisheries resources.
On the other hand, the State Environment Service shall, on the basis of that expertise, decide on the amount and type of compensation.
The annual amount of Latvia's compensation is EUR 1,035,000 in the programme for the renewal of fishing resources.
In spring 2016, in collaboration with the company "We Fish" for the fifth year, 400 artificial fishing nets will be located in Daugau near Kabala and Ikkoli.
Co-operation with the company, in order to promote a natural physician, is in addition to Latvia's initiative under the programme for the renewal of fishing resources.
The deployment of artificial kidney legends in the aquatic environment is an important measure that contributes to the protection and diversification of fish resources in Dauga.
The Festival "Sansusian concert" is a field base, forest, circus.
Guli in the room, eating like a restaurant, walking along the streets and listening to the wanted camera music, enjoying a quiet nature, - such a combination offers an alternative camera music festival in Sansu, which has already been invited by the third summer to the new Akniste.
The festival will take place in Susaya - no longer existing darkness - in the old desert plain, near forests and vineyards.
On three days - from 12 to 14 August - five views can combine carefree nature and academic music with pleasure.
Here is a theatre and a contemporary circus, performance and installation.
Opera and academic music, especially in its latest editions, will find new audiences in free and open environments without concerts.
The distance from the family to Riga is about 150 km, but to the soft face and light foot just a few minutes.
"Please don't look for a program because we've knowingly chosen not to publish it before, so that people don't take one particular measure or artist, because in Sansu it can only be heard by taking it all three days," the festival's founder and farmer, operbaritone Armand Silińš, called.
The name of the festival is Friday at 7:00 p.m. and the first concert is at 7:00 p.m.
Of course, on site there will be programmers with all the information.
Those who have to choose one day are recommended on the sixth day because it is most refreshing - from 9 a.m. to the next morning.
"The names of artists are available on the website www.sansusi.lv", says Armand Siliņš.
In the colourful works of artists there are, for example, the cosmopolitan Eva Bindere, chellet Kristine Blaumane, the operaist Inga Kalna, clarinet Guntis Kuzma, trumpetist Janis Porietis, pianist Reinis Zariņš, quartet Quadra and RIX, and even a commercial acrobattery Grete Gross, which together with Latvian music Eureka Kiršfeld, Martin Zilbert and Actari Anci Strazdu have created a contemporary circus exhibition of the artist's inner battle.
New jobs have also been introduced for the festival.
It shows children "Kukanis", which, according to the story of F. Kafkas, was composed by Olyesia Kozlovska and Jacob Nimanis, until an entomologist (cult researcher) Ugis Peterán will participate with Armandu Siline, music and actors.
Oskar Herliņš has dedicated the first Stigtéte, while Anna Čirse - Koku's opera, performances, which are the main features of the second Kalnozole regime with Katrina Neiburg's video projections and the second Egliše script will be three small bottles in three hectares in a wide circle.
By singing Laimas Ledinas, Dinars Rudánes and Zigmár Graša in the voice of the voice, they will come into romantic relations, as well as as in the study of the natural sciences of the age of light, Karlė Lineja Koku Kaza (1729).

Today's 16th start is also planned for the small-scale Latvian juridical Artura Žikiforenko, which starts in the weight category over 100 kilograms, first calling for a fight with Azerbaijani sportser Usangi Kukauri.
For Jewish this will be the first Olympic game in career.
THE Agency has already reported that during its first battle of up to 100 kilograms of weight loss on Thursday, young Latvian Jewel Jevgenijs Bordovko was killed.
He attacked Japan by Hag Ryunosski, who later won a bronze.
In 2000, Vsevolods Zełonijs brought to Latvia a prize of Olympic bronze, but in the next four Olympic games, the Latvian Jews won only one victory in seven wars, which was granted directly in London by Bordovko.
At 16.30 p.m., after the competition of the Latvian competition, Danis Upelniek will begin at the start of the contest, but the election will end on Saturday.

Reids argue that if Klintone is elected to the office of the President, he will appoint Garland as Judge of the Supreme Court .
The leader of the Senate Democrat Party Harijs Reids is convinced that if he becomes president, then he will appoint America Garland as the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court .
The Party of the People's Republic of the Senate has blocked Garland's approval since March when President Obama appointed him.
The leader of the Senate, Mičs Makonnels, said that the next president would be elected to replace the current Supreme Court judge Antonina Skaliu.
On Thursday at his conference, Reids announced that he was convinced that Clinton would choose Garland.
The representative of Reida later said that he had not personally talked about this subject with Clinton and that it was just speculation.
He praised Garland and said that the Clinton team did not want to "rescue the ship" with another choice.
Garland is the Chief Justice of the Court of Appeal of the United States of Columbia.
Reids said that the Republicans who block the nomination of Garland are "the refugees" and act in the interests of Donald Trampa, a candidate for the President of the Republic Party.
He also said that Tramps was not suitable for the President's work.
The Treats shall report to women and men about the images of the calendars.
The newspaper Treats will work with photographer David Belmer to create the 2017 calendar of Pirreli in the last 70th century.
In its 2017 U.S. calendar we plan to demonstrate new supermodels, not cool celebrity.

This magazine is for women.
Looks like he's also talking about a calendar.
Press release on the creation of a calendar says Shovs: "We have to return to the image of the unbridled and classical beauty, where women's body does not mulsify, but women's and men's wear."
Women will want to participate in this project because it is a great art work.
Models can send their photos electronically or in person at meetings in Los Angeles and New York.

Greenland Hajiv is the longest-lived pigeon - video review
Scientists claim that Greenland sharks are the most permanent of all muggers on our planet.
Haizivjes researcher Julius Nilsen says that the long-term record belongs to a mother who may be 272 to 512 years old and five meters long.
The Court of Justice of France rejects the requirement to commit business in the jungle refugee camp.
The French court rejected the request of the Kale authorities to hire dozens of self-contained shops and restaurants in the jungle, where thousands of refugees live.
At the sitting of the Court of First Instance on Monday, the authorities indicated that 72 self-contained shops should be purchased by the State where people in the territory of the country market different goods, such as cigarettes and energy drinks, offer refrigeration services, 50 cents (40p) and simple restaurants for some of the euro-created restaurants.
The Office of the Prefecture pointed out that these self-contained companies must be destroyed because they create a cheap economy and do not pay taxes, as well as create fire and sanitation risks.
The representatives of the human rights group explained to the court that these small enterprises are important because the food provided by the government and the support group does not ensure the need for shelters in which the number of owners continues to grow.
They also indicated that self-contained shops and restaurants often offer free bread and food to those who need it most.
The Court ruled that there was no legal basis for expelling people who had created 72 self-contained shops, but it understood the concerns of Kale Prefect.
Justice Jans-France Molla said that food, coffee and restaurants play a more important role than simply providing food to people living in "extremely uncivilized conditions".
He pointed out that these places are peaceful places for refugees and volunteers.
One of the places subject to the risk of confusion is the Jungle Book Kids coffee shop, which provides more than 200 free meals on the day of meal, English and French, and provides advice on asylum issues for hundreds of minors who are not protected without adult guidance.
More than 170,000 people have signed a petition for the protection of children.
A letter addressed to Guardian stated that the elimination of caffeine "would be a disaster for these children, some of whom are only 8 years old."
On Friday, two charity organisations "Help for Refugees" and "L'Auberge des Migrants" reported that the number of refugees in the jungle has increased to 9000 people who have been the highest since the rapid influx of migrants.

The impressive performance of the British election in the Rebija-7 series ended on Thursday when the state of Rio Fiji was convinced that they were being met with a result at Deodoro Stadium.
Fiji demonstrated masterclasses in the control of bombs, the play of bombs with legs, support game and brutal power game, putting gold - the first Olympic medal in its history of its existence.
Saquive brought valuable peace prizes - copper medals that were now the third medal of Great Britain. The British election can be successful in the first Olympic Rebija-7 tournament where they won New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
A strong battle half-final, where the boss team was arrested by a result of 7:5 days in the first half of the day, may have played in the UK final.
But in any case, Fiji's election is now in its best form to win 15 men's team.
Although little is believed, however, we know that peace for Britain could be the fact that at least one Brit got a gold medal. This is the chief coach of Fiji's choice Bens Raines - former English coach from Vimbledona.
For Britain, this was an exciting experience.
Eight years ago, under Rayen's leadership, they lost all games in the rebija-7 series in Adelaide.
This time they lost only one game.
It's painful, but growth is amazing.
Fiji suddenly began gambling by opening up the British forces’ methods for happiness.
Captain Tom Michel and his associates were like a collision with a number of buses on board and World Series champions were headed by 5:0 when the Ocean Colinisau won its first landing.
In the last four minutes, Jerry Tuwa has also increased his balance by making a fall in the right direction.
The results were 12:0 and the British team had not even really hit the bomb.
Michela’s great strength did not allow the generous Leoni Nakarava to get three points, but it only had little effect on Fiji’s results.
In the seventh minute of the game, Jasa Veremallu won the fall in good direction by strengthening the balance over Britain to 17:0.
After the game, Nakarava was even more violent and had been left for more than a minute... at the end of the first half.
Vatemo Rawovovovou avoided some of the inactions of the British forces and crossed the line by getting points.
The landing provided a result of 29:0.
I thought Fiji was born to play rebija-7 games while the British were still teaching.
In fact, it's also true.
The British team made fundamental changes at the end of the video player's line... full four minutes that were good after first half of the standards until Joshua Tuisova, after the fantastic team's win, gained some more points for the Fiji team.
Deam Norton was able to get points for the British team's good by making a fall on the left side and bringing the result to 36:7, but the game was already lost, as soon as the South Seafarers fan sounded, approached the cards and played in the tribins.
Fiji's life-threatening attitude cannot be overemphasized.
Mat Viliame made Fiji win even more sweeter with another fall at the end of the game.
At the end of the game, Fiji could start singing, but the British only had the ability to sit in the medicine after surgery.
On the first half of the day, Fiji won Japan with a score of 20:5, while Britain was more than South Africa, where in a very fierce battle the two teams gained their ground and the South Africans lost only a few points.
On the first half of Kails Browns led the Box team, but on the second half of Dens Nortons crossed the line with great skill and delivered a bomb between the pillars by providing British victory.
Markus Vadson, brother of the British team's brother Antonija, at the end of the game, gave the team a victory and another strength medal.
The trainer's battle with cancer inspired Helen Glover and Heter Stanning to win the air raids.
It'll be the most emotional gold medal in these pockets and it'll say a lot.
From the first to the last of the cancers, Helens Gloveres and Heteres Stanning’s gold ring had a special role in the path of Estacio da Lagoa.
Although there are only two athletes on board, she was guided by the support of Robin Viljamsa, who raised her up to the second Olympic gold medal for women, becoming the first women in the history of the British sport that had such success.
She was no doubt dominated by his unprejudiced victory for the 39th time.
Both great athletes with a floored elegance squeezing over the surface of the water, do not fully reflect this triumph.
After each gold medal has been won, a team of the whole team is working hard to continuously improve its performance and the biggest investment in their success, a trainer who had not yet known or experienced this day since he was diagnosed with cancer.
After he said it's gone as fast as it's shown.
I had an urinary tract, which is one of the things that can be operated and it happened.
If I didn't, it'd be spread throughout the body.
And the situation would become uncontrollable.
It doesn't change your vision much.
The virus was discovered in December 2013.
This three led to the possibility that Viljams could initiate the recovery procedure at the beginning of the mid-term period in 2014 and to reduce the duration of the suspension to a minimum if it can be said.
I needed income, so I had to get up quickly.
It stimulated recovery.
I was in the hospital, and I walked over six feet [6.10 m] and even 15 feet [15 m] long, although the doctor said he would take some steps.
It all started.
Self - esteem is a challenge, but this time it was even bigger.
After the victory, the first thought was about William, who was very upset all morning and spoke more than usual.
Staninga, who has lived in the Royal Artillery alone in Afghanistan, said: "This was a very difficult week, but it means a lot to me."
It only confirms how much it means to us and how much Helen and Robin have worked.
The three years with Helen and Robin have been great.
Without Robin we wouldn't have achieved anything, so thanks to him, he's the best coach in the world.
I can't imagine better trainers or better trainers.
Helen Glovere and Heter Staning have not lost any of their lives for five years.
The pair will reach such a speed that no competition can compete with.
Even in the last 500 meters when teams from New Zealand and Denmark began to approach, Stanings and Gloveres were too large.
We smell every smell.
Helena cried: "Keep the rhythm, keep the rhythm."
It is really important not to lose concentration.
We had a good start, but at the same time we did not have high hopes.
That day we didn't want to go through the records, but we were just good at getting and winning the games and we did the same.
After a few years, you will rest to decide what to do next.
The following month will be the case of the explorer Steve Bashala of Glover and TV.
Wait, she just wants to enjoy the smell.
I didn't mean to say that these were my last game.
This would have been too much pressure.
In London I needed about six months to understand that I was an Olympic champion.
It was a new experience and I was very excited.
This time it took about four minutes.
She said, "It's amazing."

The team leader of the VID will "be forward to the end".
Following her statement, Mr. Maurim Kučinski (Green and Land Union) and the Minister for Finance Dana Reisniecei-Ozolai (Green and Land Union) are now "primarily important" to approve the Minister of Finance's candidates for college in the role of the head of the VID.
Rajevski believes that both Kučinski and Reisnice-Ozolai in this government are "the first major decision" which can affect them as a political future.
If it is now beginning to change the position of the candidate of the head of the VID board, it will have a negative impact on their mother-in-law.
The next week's session of the Cabinet of Ministers has included the question of the transfer of the Director-General of the VVD to the General Directorate-General for VID, which shows the government's work schedule.
Mr Reisnice-Ozola, Minister of Finance, addressed the head of the VID, after the departure of Inar Petersson from the service, and when the motion for the Director-General of VID ended without a result.
On Thursday, 11 August, VID's manager, Dace Peléka, joined the Latvian Radio interview - if she was offered to apply for the director's office, she could agree.
The Minister of Finance shall also later recognise that he does not look at any other candidates of the VID leader.
Raivis Dintars, Head of the National Union of the Saeimas Group, also acknowledges that NA continues to support the leadership of Collegiants.
In Spain, the possibility of reducing budget deficit could not be threatened by the creation of a government.
Before 12 July, the European Commission (EC) concluded that Spain and Portugal had not implemented enough measures to reduce the level of budget deficit to 3% of the total domestic product required by the euro area (ICP).
The calculations show that, despite the savings measures implemented, Portugal’s budget deficit was 4.4% of GDP at the end of last year, but in Spain – 5.1%.
However, the European Commission decided not to apply economic sanctions to both countries while setting fiscal targets for the near future.
One of the reasons why the EC has not yet imposed sanctions on these two countries has increased Euroscepticism in many European Union countries.
Additional sanctions would only increase such negative disturbances.
Critics also point out that the EC is not consistent in its decisions, from the start of agreeing on uniform rules and then unable to apply them in life.
For example, German Bundesbank President Jens Veidmanns pointed out that Europe is losing its confidence by creating the people's impression that the European Union's rules are recommended, not binding.
The EC has now proposed and all Member States have agreed to extend the budget deficit deadline to Portugal by the end of this year and to Spain by 2018.
The European Commission intends to examine progress achieved by both countries within the next few months, while indicating that both Spain and Portugal must be ready to introduce additional conservation measures if required by the circumstances.
The initial projections show that the targets set for Portugal could be achieved at a given time and that this year the budget deficit could be reduced to 2.5% of the total domestic product.
This means that within the framework of the Stability Programme, the Government of this country has to implement conservation measures of 0.25% of GDP this year.
These measures should be included in the budget this year, with additional attention being paid to the control of purchase costs of goods and services.
In Spain, the situation is much more difficult.
This year's budget deficit should be reduced to 4.6%, this year up to 3.1% and 2018 up to 2.2% of GDP.
In addition, the consolidation measures for the next two years must be 0.5% of GDP per year.
In particular, it would be difficult to achieve these objectives because for eight months the political parties of Spain have not agreed on the establishment of a government, and it is becoming even more likely that Spain can reach a third time of the year to conduct a preliminary parliamentary election.
However, public opinion discussions show that third-party elections would also not significantly change in the political side of the country.
The most popular party is still the current Prime Minister of the country party headed by Mariano Rahoja, whose election would be re-elected by a 33% vote.
Only socialists have increased their popularity a little while the popularity of the "Podemos" or "We Together" and "Ciudadanos" or "Citizens" have been slightly reduced.
The People's Party wishes to achieve socialist and "Ciudadanos" involvement in the government in this month, otherwise it will not be possible to adopt and submit to the European Commission a draft budget for 2017 by mid-October.
As announced by the representative of the Parliamentary Group of the People's Party, Rafael Hernando, if the government is not established and Parliament's elections will also be held for a third time, Spain will become the whole of Europe.
The purity of the pludium is critical in the waters of the Riga Sea.
Over the last five years, activists have concluded that, unfortunately, the number of losses they have found each year has increased, and here are the most condemned visitors to rural areas.
The most polluted places are in Riga.
In the capital’s view, it is difficult to fight against unclean visitors every day.
In addition, waste left in the drylands can be pumped into water during waste gas, thus seriously damaging its quality.
With the exception of Liepaja beaches and certain places in Kurzem, the cleanliness of the beaches elsewhere in Latvia is critical.
Such a statement was made this week by the volunteers of the "My Sea" campaigns.
For five years, by measuring the road along the Riga Seabed, activists have concluded that the number of losses left by the population has increased by hundreds of meters.
Unfortunately this year's critical assessment has taken place.
"We see that this will be the year when the number of wastes per square foot of 100 meters may even exceed 200 units," says Janis Ulme, representative of the expedition "My Sea".
Latvijas Radio called, he was found in Your Pladmala, where he will continue his free journey along the river of the Riga Sea.
This year, between the various losses of life and the rest of the picnics, even the daily light bulbs left in the sands of the sea will be collected.
The transition participant and organizer Ulme said that the accused were directly affected by pollution.
"The main source is the visitors of the plague itself, because more than half of the total waste is plastic, different waste starting with mixtures, plastic bags that are already at the breaking stage, they can no longer be identified, and flavors, bottles, baskets," says Ulme.
Among the cleanest beaches there is also a swimming pool in Riga.
For example, in Daugavgrí every hundred metres, nearly 800 waste units have been collected on average, which is critically high.
The organizers of the campaign also make it clear that every step on the road is also cut off and not all signs of alert or ban are placed.
"The average figures for all three Riga landscapes together - Daugavgravrīv, Westbuljes and Parents - unfortunately are large and far beyond the desired or the goal of reducing the number of waste units to 135 units by 2020," concludes the environmental representative.
Cleaning of places in Riga every day, in summer’s hot days even twice, the representative of the Council explains Ugis Midauskis.
However, the fight against unclean visitors is very difficult.
We're going back to these people's cultural issues.
"For those who want to use alcohol, smoke and do all things they can't, even special signs don't work," says Midauskis.
This is why Midauskis calls on visitors to report on pollutants to the police as well.
You can call the police, make sure to refer to these violations and thus fight everyone.
Perhaps you can put some new warnings in place, but as I said, quite or as radically changing the situation.
"Since everyone should simply turn around and be indifferent to such offenders," he points out.
As far as water quality measurements have been carried out this evening, the Health Inspection has been carried out for the fourth time, which may provide for a ban on official pasture sites.
Today, as in other years, water quality is always good and satisfactory.
The present situation is that the quality of water in all 56 bathing areas has been good all the time and there is no restriction on bathing.
"For the last time, we will take an analysis at the end of August," said the senior environmental health inspector Normands Kadios.
The wastes left on land may be disposed of in water during solid waste gas.
This can, in turn, affect its quality, as indicated by an environmental expert.
Rotating in Russia will continue - change of manager in Putin administration.
Pats is a lover?
Vladimir Putins announced to the Russian media that Sergey Ivanovs wanted to do this work himself and will continue to be the Special Representative of the President on matters of natural protection, ecology and transport.
When I announced the change, Putin's television camera gave Ivanov the names "Sergey Borisovic, we've worked with you for many years together and we've been doing it successfully."
I am satisfied with how you fulfill your responsibilities.
I am well aware of our agreement not to use you in the office of the Head of Administration of this President for more than four years.
So I will wisely stand against your desire to change the field of action.
And I hope you will also make full use of your knowledge and experience in the new task.
However, it is noted that the management of the presidential administration is a very important task and has made Ivanov one of the most influential people in the country.
In view of the upcoming elections of the State Council in Russia, the fear of this step is linked to the struggle for power in the political elite of Russia.
Ivanov was also referred to as a possible representative of Putin, so the claim that he himself wanted to take over the role of the President in matters of nature and transport raised doubts.
As indicated by the Lsm.lv archive, Ivanovs is the VDK and the Federal Security Service General Puppet.
Ivanov and Russian President Vladimir Putina are members.
He began his career as a specialist in 1975, where he met Putin.
Later, when Putin became the head of the Federal Security Service, Ivanovs became his deputy.
On the other hand, at the end of the reign of Russian President Boris Jelcina, he was appointed Secretary of the Russian Security Council.
In 2000, after the arrival of Putina, the "Information Security Doctrine" developed by Ivanova was approved, including the renewal of national censorship mechanisms in Russia.
In 2001, Sergey Ivanov became Russia's Defence Minister, but in 2005 he was the Deputy Prime Minister Mihail Fradkova and was responsible for the development and export of arms by Russian defence companies.
Now, following the resignation of the head of the presidential administration, Ivanov will also remain in Russia's National Security Council, where the new head of the President's administration is now also working.
The blame comes from the family council party.
The President's board of directors of Vaino is recommending Ivanov himself.
I know Anton Eduardodovic and I already know him.
It's been since we worked in your government.
And in the last five years, we've been in virtually every day.
"So I am convinced that after all professional and personal qualities he is ready for this work," Ivanovs said.
The blame comes from a family belonging to the party elite of the council.
His father, Karls, took high positions in the Communist Party of Estonia, including his first secretary from ten years to 1988.
The Internet publication "Meduza" refers to the book "Independence and independence of Estonia" states that at the end of the 1980s Karls Vaino was asked to allow Moscow to use force against demonstrators.
However, he was denied and soon lost his job.
Soon thereafter Vaino moved to Moscow.
Anton Vaino has graduated from the Moscow International Relations Institute and manages the Japanese language.
However, he has resigned from the diplomatic service to work in the management of the President's Protocol.
It has been reported that in the last few weeks Russia has destroyed several senior military officers and even arrests, including replaced by several district governors and federal representatives.
According to politology, President Vladimir Putins re-elected the governing elite before the elections to be held in 2018.
One of the main features is the increasing number of representatives of the institutions.
He also dies a minor in Níkiforenko losing his Olympics in the first battle.
This was the first time the fight was, and the Latvian junta has ended his participation in the Olympic Games at the end of the 17th place.
Trainer Olyegs Baskins of Latvia's Television acknowledged that Níkiforenko's expectations were very low, and that was already clear before the competitions.
He also discovered that a young Jew had suffered a stroke during the war.
Of course, in order to get to the Olympic Road Marks, Níkiforenko came to start in another weight category other than the experience - i.e. in the weight category up to 100 kilograms.
The size of Azerbaijan was 25 pounds [25 kg] thicker.
It has already been reported that in the Bordovko war, Juvgenjis weighed up to 100 kilograms against Ryunosuki for a period of two minutes until the opposite was granted a year of pure victory.
So far, the Jewish game of Latvia has been closed by Rio.
Dreams die in Rio.
The fourth day was given by Jewish Jew Yevgenijs Bordovko.
Yes, he was even more hostile than he was, but at times ambitious he was able to give a surprise.
He didn't say anything.
Arthur’s assignment in Žikiforenko was even more difficult because his experience was smaller and he was also respectful.
The result is similar, though, for half a minute on the roof he stayed more than Borodovko.
Unfortunately, in recent times the Jewish people of Latvia have a direct lack of ambition.
Since the leadership of the Federation, Gunnars Xierson and his financial studio Vladimir Šestakovs have gone from Latvia to Aleksandr Jackevićs, no longer called "Golden Score" - the Jewish development rite by means of a leaking line.
Jackević, who here consults the Jews of Kazakhstan, and Vsevoldam Zelón doesn't see the men.
But if you don't, you won't.
And it's a federal priority.
Because of the fact that from another galaxy in the "Rita Panorama" the President of the Latvian Judo Federation promised Rio to break the medals.
The flight is far from reality.
In the evening, we looked forward to the playball game Samoilovs/Smédiņs - Evandru/Pedru Solbergs.
Intriga as already in the "death" group - losers in the game are over.
Latvia's gift had a small break - it could also be lost but not more than four points in two weeks.
The controversy was still on the horizon in the previous game.
No one wanted to die - this feeling over the wind-card fever all along the street.
For players, the violent wind caused further difficulties.
At first, I'd say that it could be ours - which is the most universal - .. .. .. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
But it didn't.
It was quite simple to play here against the Latvian customs.
It's as good as Samuel and waiting for him to break up.
On the Canadian side, on the Kub side at the end of the first and on the third, because there was no load.
In those days the carpenter could cook because the work was small, but when it was done, it was good.
The Brazilian Samouilovs with Shmedinju could have won two sets, because the first took over with 16:15, however, still on 16 others, also at the point of the loss limit.
But they could also lose with 0:2, because the second set of deficits was -4, however, thanks also to the governor, they managed to win.
The third was already placed on the Evandr service mark.
The chain was created - an unconfirmed service, the second game rarely flew too close to the network and Samuel was left completely vulnerable to the resulting attack.
If there was a neighbor in the field against the Cubans, then this time he was more successful, and only His recent loss would not be professional.
Creel also made a mistake, and very symbolicly, that the last bomb hit him in the block.
He's losing his team.
At the same time, there was also a lack of success - only two Evans attacks almost flew out of the map in the third set, but the bomb still hit the line.
Two of them were next to the line.
The video of the violent episodes is also decided for good opponents.
If Evandru had worked with the services in the first two games, it was very productive for us.
All total loss on the table.
The causes of failure should now be analysed in a peaceful manner.
It may have taken many people to live near the stadium, not with a delegation in the Olympics.
It's been a couple of hours on the road.
A series of seven semi-finals may have given little confidence.
Maybe you shouldn't have played in Klagenfurt, but you better get in here and get aclimatized.
It may have been a failure to find a sports platform.
We are waiting for more questions than answers.
Our lucky games are over.
The dream of the medals is over.
What's next?
There are still some world-class tournaments, as well as the "Masters" of the Sea.
Samuel’s experience is not unique, for there are so many different personalities.
But it's not necessary either.
When the dream of Olympic medals has been shattered, the thought of separation can also be found, because the blame will be sought not only in itself but also in the partner.
The solution is not difficult, but much more difficult will be found in Latvia to find decent partners.
The two brothers are playing the game, but John and Tom have already tried and got divorced, while Michael Samuels Samuel is still too green to start swallowing up the world’s tops.
You can try to go back to the Queen of Harald, Alexander Solove, Edgar Toc, but this will not be better than this option that has not just proved itself in the stages of the World Cup.
This time, they were not ridiculed by the Cubans.
A certain one.
Of course, it should also be taken into account that the pledmal volleyball is becoming more popular, it's becoming a new pair, and only the rare growth is less than two meters.
This still does not guarantee success, but it is an important argument in the fight for victory.
Our spirits don't stay.
For both athletes and journalists, it is possible to measure the places offered by the players as well as to choose their own.
The U.S. basketball team lives on a cruise ship, and some tennisists do not remain in the Olympic Games.
Also, some of the beach volleyballlists have visited the hotel in Copenhagen.
This time, prices were severely overexploited for journalists at all convenient places.
This is why the choice is also based on the rent of the apartment.
The risk is because sometimes they may be uncomfortable from a logical point of view.
The risk is therefore justified.
Together with Vladimir Vladimirovic we rent apartments on the Kopabana and Ipanema border.
Pludmale 200 meters away, a half-hour walk away from the arsenic.
The region is very safe because it is a favela but it must not lose courage either.
Vladimir Vladimirovich is not what some think at once, but the most professional sports journalist in Russian media Vladimir Ivanov.
P.S. It appears that another metal dream was sounded on Friday morning.
Laura Ikunice-Admidiņa has returned from her personal records in a 100-metre barge and high-rise.
But there are still five disciplines.
After 10 years of interruption "Porgijs and Besa" takes place in Liepaya.
The first study of the Portuguese and Besa opera was conducted in Latvia in 1973 at the Latvian National Opera.
Since then, the internationally recognized headquarters has not been re-registered.
That is why the organizers of the Cés Art Festival and the Liepaja Art Forum decided in close cooperation to give the audience the opportunity to enjoy George Géršvin's chair.
"We are delighted that after a ten-year break, when Liepaja was able to enjoy the study of the opera last time, this great George Gäršvina "Porgijs and Besa" opera concert is a pleasure to us in our new, newly opened concert "Great Ding", says the concert "Great Dintar" director of the Bible.
The opera "Porgijs and Besa" is a history of love, its insatiableness, ill will, as well as the tragedy of life and the simple everyday joys.
It reflects African American vitality, music and rhythm.
That is the lack of this policy correction in this operation, the exclusion of tolerance makes it so alive.
"And you have to, this love story is extremely powerful, very beautiful and in some way really deep," says Director Viesturs Kairs.
What I like most - by listening to or recognizable to this opera, there are always such touching points - famous melody, famous motives, but these transitions from one character to the other by lighting one person or another person, or corridors or orchestras.
"It's the most exciting, this building," the opera evaluates the opera "Porgijs and Besa" musical director and director of the concert studio Andris Poga.
Opera visitors agree that this is a grandiose event.
They are delighted to hear the famous Christmas opera in this world.
It is commendable that in Libya, the spirit of the world can be just that.
"Completion professional", the operator reviews Edgars Láms.
The concert study was special because the first time the orchestra was played by the orchestra and the first time an opera concert was performed.
The garden at the Art Museum's renovated buildings could be named after Janya Rosental.
In the opening of the exhibition of the Rīga Vice-President Andris Ameriks Rosentala said that the museum's own address could be not in the future than the Christian Valdemar Street 10a, but the New Rozental Field 1.
The director of the museum, Mara Láce, acknowledges that re-registering the addresses will create a strong bureaucratic burden, but in general, this idea is welcome and has therefore been accepted by the municipality's proposal.
In 1936, the city of Riga was founded on its main theme by creating the monument of Burkarda Jenna Janim Rosentalm, who stands at the museum.
The director of the museum at the time, Wilhelm Purvitis, was one of the first to create this monument.
In this way, this further action could be purely logical.
I've had a bad heart all the time - but Wilhelm Purvitis, where do we live his name?!!
"Bet, if you, Mr. America, promise to think," said Lace.
It is reported that the building of the National Museum of Art after massive reconstruction and modernization was officially closed this May.
This will finally start the reconstruction of the VEF Cultural City.
The cities of about 11 million euros will be restored to the SIA "Velve".
It is planned to renovate several city rooms, including two viewers, as well as the building to adapt to people with mobility disorders.
The Riga Council has intended to attract a project of EUR 6 million in the European Union's funds, but the Director of the Department of Specialities of the Riga Council of Directors Olyges Burovs recognises that there is still no complete clarity about the future of European funds for the project.
"In spite of the political desire to start the work of the VEF Culture community in connection with the European Structural Funds, it is, in months of waiting for a decision, real action from the heads of the Ministry of Finance, whether or not it will be granted or not," said Burovs.
Last December we were told that everything depends on Brussels.
Two weeks ago, the Ministry of Finance received a letter from the European Commission to decide on its own decision not to take a decision here by Brussels.
Now we see that there is another round of discussion again, and then we will see what we can expect in the near future.
"I would like to point out that the Riga Council is undoubtedly guaranteeing that this process will be started and completed within the deadlines," Burovs says.
It has already been reported that more than a year before, in March 2015, the city of VEF Culture collectively conducted a leisure concert immediately before the expected renovation of the building.
Although last year, the renovation of the building had not yet been started and it had continued to function collectively under unimplemented conditions.
The Department of Specialities strategy of the Riga Council of Culture, the renewal of the city of VEF, seems to be divided into independent reconstruction works, where each will ensure the implementation of the functions of the city.
First - increasing the availability of VEF Culture city and improving the environment.
It is intended to build the environment and communication and to restore the building’s façade.
The second is the improvement of VEF Culture City services.
It plans to improve the interior of the building, wall and ceiling restoration, view and sound records, as well as to build internal engineering communications.
Thirdly - Improving the working conditions of creative amateur collective work, which includes plans to improve work equipment, space heating and ventilation systems.
Before "Livu" on the 40th anniversary, the legendary rock band can be seen at the exhibition in Liepā.
The exhibition will look at various "Livus" features - photographs arranged on the time line to reflect the group's activities from the beginning to the year 2010 when the group is notified of the end of its activity.
There will also be exhibitions of viewers, musical instruments, ratings and concerts, as well as other issues that have not yet been seen by the wider public which have reflected the activities of the "Live" group.
The exhibition will be supplemented by the items of the Liepaja Museum's warehouse.
The exhibition's visual formation became in cooperation with fashion artist and painter Elitu Patmalnieci.
The musicians who had been associated with the "Live" group and their neighbors also called for the call and shared both objects and memories.
"Livu" was first sought in 1972 when a vocal instrument assembly was set up in the Liepaja Cultural House, led by Juris Pavitótols.
The Assembly participated in its original composition in the Festival of Liepajas in 1972 and 1974, as well as in cities and republics.
In 1976 an illegal meeting took place when Juris Pavitul met with Erich Chigel and Metalturg culture, calling for the accession of Ingrid Gütman, Andri Krózinji and Jani Groduma.
Over the years, the composition of the group has changed at least once.
The participants have joined, others have gone their way, some have returned.
However, most importantly - we want to prove that Latvian hand music is able to live and live - remains unchanged.
"Seeing no need - ginsots, bats and beards, these children were emotionally separated from the stereotype of the generalized strategy heritage," said music viewer Klaus Vávere.
In the group without the above-mentioned music, such as Igo, Wilnis Rjevinš, Moderis Sterns, Valdis Störcks, Laimis Rácnejs, Italian Spusbarniek, Ainars Virga, Aivars Brize, Guntars Muzeneks, Danis Virga, Thomas Klein and many others.
Entered into the exhibition without charge.
The exhibition shall be held from 19 August to 30 October.
On the 27th of August, the "Live" will be held at the "LIVFest 2" concert of the "LIVEFEST 2" group.

Zbigniew Stankevičs: The time is coming, and the truth is going up.
The Archbishop of the Catholic Church of Latvia, Mayor of Zbignævs Stankevičs, in an interview, stressed to the Independent that if we want to gain power in life, there must be a message from the Gospel in its center.
Because the power of truth is greater than the power of evil.
Many are already on their way to the Most Holy Virgin Mary’s celebration of the Lord’s Evening Meal in Aglono.
What messages will faithful ones receive this year?
In recent years the desire to take the lead in the ministry in Aglono has been expressed by the pope’s silence.
So, too, the main message is his message.
The tradition of your kind is also to consider the fact that John Bullis is the leader of the Krusta road.
He will also form his own message.
In the past day, I was taking the lead in the sacred service of the Virgin.
Last year I will turn my attention to the French encyclical "Laudato si" and update it to a common house, the theme of the land in the context of Latvia.
This year... of course, I'm watching what's going on in the world, and I'm trying to react to it.
My approach to meeting the church recommended that the Gospel message be kept at the center of life.
It must be shown that the Gospel answers the most troubling problems of human life and gives him the motivation to go on.
Then it's talking to people.
But in Cesius, in the debate on Lampas, you say that "they return to the understanding of the whole human being".
What do you understand?
Does this mean that a person is excluded from the priesthood?
And does the church have such a means of returning today?
Men dying on the street in the capital city of India.
No one in the capital city of India has ever heard of the deaths of men on the road - it seems he's been stuck on the streets for an hour and then still amplified, reports BBC.
It has been said that the man who was identified as Matibúl went to the market every day but worked for protection at night.
Matthew 5:30 a.m. went home on the road when they were hit by a light car.
The surveillance camera record shows that the driver is out of the car to look at the injured person and then walk away.
After an hour when no one knew of the bleeding man, he fell into a coma.
About 90 minutes after the quake, the police arrived and the injured man was taken to a hospital where he died from the trauma.
With reference to his candidate for the Office of the Director-General of the State Revenue Service (VID), Inga Koljegova, the Head of State Environment Service, has resigned the government from membership, he is considered by Professor Ojärs Skudra, associate professor of the University of Latvia's Social Sciences College.
The colloquial explanation of the withdrawal of the candidate in connection with the dispute ruling coalition is bound by the fact that he has initiated a coup.
In his interview with the LETA agency, he found it difficult to imagine that the government's "Oneness" will support the collegiate candidacy this week.
Accordingly, if the Ministers of Unity voted against, but the College so approved, it would lead to government democracies.
The expert also believes that before the notification of the withdrawal of the candidate, Collegiants have consulted both the finance minister Danu Reiznieci-Ozol and the Prime Minister Mári Kučinski.
At the same time, it is also a violation of the "Oneness" which strongly opposed its candidature.
When predicting whether to go out or to find an appropriate candidate by tendering, Skudra recognises that there are two options - either a figure of compromise will be selected or the authorities will continue to conduct the duties of the Director-General in Dace Pelek.
At the same time, he points out - if the Minister of Finance has so far claimed that no other candidate has been considered, it is home to Pelekaya that he cannot participate in the competition.
LATA has already stated that the Head of State Environment Service Collegova has decided to withdraw its candidate to the Office of the Director-General of VID.
Because of the "unity" opposition, the government left the approval of the College on the second day of the week at the Office of the Director-General of the VID.
After the government's decision to give up the decision, Collegiants confirmed that they were still ready to become VID leaders.
However, the thought was later changed - on Friday, in a presentation by the Finance Minister to Dan Reizniece-Ozolai, she indicates that she withdraws her consent to transfer to the VID director's office and does not have a easy choice for her.
Mr President, Mr Kučinska, Secretary of the Press, Mr Vaivars, explained to the LETA Agency that a new invitation will be made to the Office of the Deputy Director General of VID.
An accident occurred in the center of Riga involving a police car.
A road traffic accident involving a State police car occurred in the center of Riga this afternoon.
The police car with closed sound and light signals was mounted on the top of the category, until the crossings of the Christian Baron and Djirnavu street ended up with another car.
The police explain the circumstances, but the initial information shows that the second force does not release a long police car.
In the event of a woman's suffering.
The number of people living in Riga this year
At the beginning of this year, there were 638,784 people in Riga who were 0.34% less than in 2015, when the capital was officially registered as 641,000 people, the Agency informed the Central Statistical Administration (CSP).
On the other hand, Latvia’s capital is located in 30th place between the European Union (EU)’s capitals and major cities with a population of more than one million.
According to data from the EU Statistical Office Eurostat, Riga is the largest female figure - Latvia's capital is the leading figure among the largest cities in Europe with 127 women per 100 men.
All three capitals of the Baltic States are the largest women in Europe's largest cities: in Vienna they are 123, but in Tallinn 121 women are 100 men.
The warning icon will be placed at LNMM.
In the near days at the Latvian National Museum of Art (LNMM), warning signs will be posted - pictograms, LETA sent to the agency by the representative of the Department of Specialities of the Riga Council of the Department of Art (LNMM).
The improvement of the speed of the museum's glass damage has now been successful, resulting from the activities of the shipyards.
A warning pictogram will be posted in the next few days.
It will tell its citizens that the fate may be quiet and snowtime, and it must not be moved by cars, as well as by bicycles, textiles and textiles.
Ušakovs also wrote about this social network on Facebook, which indicated that no security threats were caused by damage, but "it seems unaccompanied" and scheduled "to be born".
Holidays for children and parents - Rīga are equipped with new children's wheelchairs.
During this summer season, the municipality of Riga has even established two new rotary areas in the city, Cyprus and Chile, which are now available to children.
A wide, multifunctional rotal ship with various lifting elements, tulips, games, drums and slippers is installed in the chips.
Rotary garden is intended for all adult children.
The field also includes the elements of silencing and various balancing elements.
For small shipowners of the fantasy world, the location of the attraction on the Danube coast with a look at the passenger port and the sights of cruise ships.
On the other hand, in the rolling field between the 4th and 5th crossing lines of the Chicurkalna, the boat, the path of the steps, the balance of the track, the symmetrical, rotal bomb and other game elements, as well as the winning area with the wheels of power and coordination training, the middle and the other sports elements.
The area is covered with rubber thread in different colors.
Up to the rotary field on the side of the road is a new, colorful bridge.
A reconstructed road phase has been opened in the woods.
Minister of Transport Uldis Augulis, Head of State of Latvia (LVC) and representatives of the building SIA "Binders" and the municipality opened today the national main road border of Russia (Grebnäva) -Räzekne-Daugavpils-Lietuvas border (Medumi) (A13) from Medumes to the border of Lithuania (156,4.163,05 km).
Roads are a national road map, especially border routes, so a particular delight is to open up a reconstruction phase on the border with our southern neighbours.
This is another example of improving the situation on national main roads thanks to the co-financing of the European Union funds.
"As forecasts show, available means will be available for roads in 2018, and we need to think about how to continue to maintain the most crowded roads in very good quality and also provide people's mobility throughout the regions of Latvia without funding from the European Union," said Uldis Auglis.
The Minister of Transport also indicated that proposals prepared by traffic experts on sustainable financing for Latvia's roads will be presented to the Government in the near future.
During the construction phase from Meduma to the border of Lithuania (156,4.-163,05 km) SIA Binders began early and continued this year following technological interruption.
The cost of reconstruction is EUR 13.5 million (including VAT), co-financed by the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF).
"The reconstruction phase has completely restored the construction of the road and tomorrow's next phase will start repair work from Meduma to Daugavpilj itself until all roads from the border of Lithuania to Daugavpilj will be set up," LVC President Janis Lange reported.
The main roads of the country are most crowded, and by 2018 we are planning to achieve that all main national roads are in good condition.
The next task will be to maintain them in good quality, temporarily ensuring periodic maintenance and to make changes to asphalt over every 7-9 years.
"It will, of course, require adequate funding, and all passengers with hope of the proposals of the expert group for the establishment of the road financing system," Lange noted.
The project includes road connections and lighting at the Centre of Medumes.
Substantive land operations: four stages of recovery and extensive recovery and recovery have been compared with road garen profile, which has so far been very unequal.
Renewal of public transport facilities and newly built return to public transport.
In the past, there were insufficient capacity and areas of releifs were not transparent because of the mountain roads, as well as the old road common releef.
In the next construction season, it is planned to renew the road from the city border of Daugavpils to the rebuilt stage (144,80-156,40 km).
This year the LVC plans to carry out various types of work more than 1100 kilometres of national road.
Information on all the repairs planned on the national road network this year is available on the LVC website www.lvceli.lv.
"To achieve the desired weight reduction results, it is very important to choose the right combination of food products," admitted Lithuanian Dietologist Laura Romeraite-Kuklieriene.
In addition, it is easy to enjoy summertime when our own gardens produce fresh fruits, eggs, and vegetables.
The combination of processed foods can help not only to reduce the remaining weight but also to contribute to various body processes.
Macaroni and etiquette are a successful combination because it provides long-term Satanic feelings and helps fight fats.
Studies published in the European Clinical Food Journal have shown that ethics has a beneficial effect on blood glucose levels and helps us improve our appearance.
The rich food of the cat’s peppers and whites, such as poultry meat or protein cocktails, causes not only the taste of salt but also a reduction in the meat’s legs after large meals in the next mealtimes.
The combination of such foods can also increase by up to 35% after meals.
Studies show that Caucasian peppers can help relieve fat flow in the liver.
Olu consists of a metabolic agent - Holin, while the paprika is a good source of vitamin C.
Taking sufficient amounts of this food may reduce cortisol levels, including fat storage around the body’s average.
The egg’s excess powder, which has been added to the fresh eggs, is another layer and fat-burning meal for breakfasts, which is worth including in their diet card.
The eggs and eggs contain solvents that, according to Canadian scientists, control the grain – appetite stimulated hormones – and thus also the sense of excretion.
In addition, the eggs contain polyphenols, which are supportive of weight reduction, and do not allow fat formation.
Plants and proteins are also able to perform miracles in weight reduction.
Such a combination can make Satan feel.
Plants contain water and liquids and thus contribute to Satan’s feeling.
At the same time, the protein slows down the heating process and gives Satan a long time to feel.
On Wednesdays you can eat rice with salads or also prepare a protein cocktail from a ready mixture and enjoy it together with your favorite vegetables.
Avoid any combinations of products.
The fruit contains cyccurides - monosharides or disacharides - one or two molecules.
On the other hand, the fortress in the gardens is a polysacharide.
Plants divide into the stomach mechanically, while chemically they do not divide until they reach a third or fourth degree in the fertilization process that occurs in the liver.
The wall is divided into three different stages that are already in the mouth.
It is therefore important not to eat sweet food immediately after meals.
Eating sweet food immediately after meals, it's "sprouted" in the stomach together with other foods where it's not chemically cooked and starts eating.
Do not eat meat, potatoes, poultry, bananas, dates or other products containing carbohydrates together with lemons, vines, oranges, grapefruits, pineapples or other acidic fruits.
An enzyme ptialine found in cells only works in the environment.
Plant acids inhibit not only the accumulation of carbohydrates but also contribute to their fermentation.
Do not eat eggs and meat, fat and meat, cheese and oil or cheese or rice, meat and milk, oil and milk or rice and milk and other protein-like combinations of rich products once in a meal.
It is necessary to process them in different strains, each with different strengths, characteristics and time when they need to arrive at the nest.
Beef, honeymelon, muscatmelone and other melons should always be eaten separately from other foods.
Melons shall not be frozen if they are in the stomach with other food products.
Fats in combination with protein-rich products.
Fats form a successful combination with hard, but they cannot be described as fats and protein substances - fats prevent protein accumulation.
The protein may be combined with a completely small amount of fat.
If a large number of protein-containing products are consumed, avoid all use of fat.
This also applies to freezing - it is not recommended to combine large amounts of rice (containing protein) with whole avocado (containing fat).
This combination prevents effective weight reduction.
How better to prepare?
"Preparation for food, thermal treatment causes significant food loss - approximately 15 to 55% of the original ingredients of the products," notes Dietology.
In most cases the food is lost by spilling food into the water.
However, the value of certain foodstuffs has increased, directly, by.
After gardening, it is recommended to use the remaining liquid for the preparation of soup - in this case you will not lose any nutrients left in the water and you will be able to drink it later.
It is recommended to prepare the vegetables, also to push them.
The thermal treatment significantly increases the bioavailability of the lycopene contained in tomatoes.
When tomatoes are harvested for 30 minutes, the amount of lycopene increases by 25%.
The thermal treatment also significantly increases the bioavailability of betakarotin found in red, yellow, orange plants such as tomatoes, burcanes, frozen potatoes and spinach.
The thermal treatment of eggs and meat removes the natural properties of the protein contained in them, making them easier to digest.
Treatment of meat and egg thermals also makes these products and other minerals more readily absorbed in the body.
It should also be borne in mind that the freezing of products may reduce vitamin C by 10% to 90%, however, the freezing of solvent does not affect.
In combination with tomatoes, the iron intake can be increased in the body, which provides better brain and muscle function.
Our body takes up to 33% less non-inflammable iron, which is found in plant products such as bees, leaves, grass products, rather than blood-producing iron, which are found in animal national products such as beef, fish and veal.
You can significantly increase the absorption of non-inflammable iron in the body by using non-insorbing iron products with vitamin C sources such as oranges, tomatoes and eggs.
Vitamin C helps to change non-instrumental iron so that our organism can absorb it more easily.
Iron is necessary for the production of haemoglobin, which ensures oxygen consumption in muscles and brains.
To maximize the benefit of salads, add them to healthy fats such as olive oil or flaxen oil.
When preparing skimming machines with lascis, add vitamin D to the rich lascillator or sardine free yogurt, which is a good source of calcium.
vitamin D increases the amount of calcium absorbed in the liver and plays an important role in bone formation.
Auzas (as well as other herbal products) together with vitamin C sources such as soils, eggs, sheep and other fruits or eggs help stabilize cholesterol levels and avoid arterial contamination.
Snapchat "Anime" effect in the criticism of Asian caricature
Snapchat representatives say this filter has inspired animation, but some commentators claim that it is racistly insensitive.
With this drop effect Snapchat allows 150 million users every day to change reality in an absurd way and play with their identity.
You can turn yourself into ananas, dog, or image that would be found in Paradise Lichstenstein.
The lens is a mythical, corrosive instrument that generates more than 30 million self-transformations per day.
Any error will soon become public.
The effects of Snapchat leukemia have already been criticised by receiving transmissions that the application popularizes too black or light facial tone as an ideal beauty level.
New leukemia effects were published on this Sunday, allowing users to make eye contact, facial expressions and facial expressions, and some critics called it a racist Asian character – “jelten’s comedy”.
The question was also raised whether such contradictions did not indicate that the company had greater problems with diversity.
The news and public negation occurred on the third day when The Verge and Motherboard reported that the effects of leukemia were withdrawn from the application.
The company explained that the aim of the legend is to depict the images of Anime, not to cariage people of Asian origin.
But for people who have experienced racism, these effects have been reminiscent of painful stereotypes.
Others categorized like Anime.
Korean American Art Student Greisas Sparapani Twitter entry for pictures has gained wide rationality. In an e-mail she points out that the effects are "inviting and not easy to say any more".
She adds that it is difficult not to notice the apparent similarity between Asian caricatures and the effects of lakes.
This shows that the effect of lightning is not just a yellow face but a yellow face in the sense of racism.
Snapchat is not the only company that has been established in these cultural sites.
The American culture is also involved in the endless struggle for diversity and inclusion from the meeting rooms of companies to Hollywood and the devices we use every day.
And Snapchat's large audience of young people representing different races, unlike the older population, is more sensitive to such matters.
If Snapchat falls to create an image that calls users, then "Today such things don't go unnoticed" was said on Thursday at a 25-year-old Keitia Jou interview.
On Thursday, Zhou, the manager of the Media product company, destroyed his Snapchat application and recommended that others do the same.
In her letter "Midium" and in her telephone interview she explained that she felt that the problems of race are due to the Snapchat employment policy, which does not support the diversity of race.
I criticised the company's management, which consists mainly of white men and then ended up writing with a reference #DeleteSnapchat.
"This means that there are no racial differences in the company, so such decisions are allowed. Or some other racial representatives are working in the company, but they do not take such an assignment in order to express their views safely and easily," says the Chinese American.
She also felt that others agreed, while Snapchat did not answer her complaint.
The company does not disclose how many employees represent different races, indicating that it is a private company.
Snapchat refused to discuss the origin of his employees, but his representative discovered that the company had become a staff specialist who would focus on representing also racial minorities who were not well represented and would promote inclusion in the company.
On the other hand, Juu will not update his Snapchat account by adding: "Amazing, do they really need more users like us to understand that it's not right?"
The Court of Congress reports that military officials have changed reports on the State of Islam.
On the fourth day of the communication, the Congress Chamber notes that the representatives of the United States Central Assembly have revised reports by reflecting the war against Islam in Iraq and Syria much more optimistic than is the truth.
The analysis of the Central Command Service shall present a general non-compliance with the provisional report of the mission unit established by representatives of the Committee of the Armed Forces, the Committee of Inquiry and the Sub-Committee for the Financing of the Communities, indicating that their management controlled reports on American progress in the fight against Islam.
The Central Command, known as Centcom, is a military base in Tampa, Florida, which supervises U.S. military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
Recent reports on this report indicate that the reports of the intelligence service, which were approved by senior military commanders of the Centcom, reflect the US's fight against terrorism more positively than is the case. The facts were regularly distorted, reflecting better achievements than any other analysis of the intelligence service.
The representative of the Republic of California said: "Centcom action is unacceptable - our soldiers are those who suffer if our policy makers receive incorrect reports."
Centcom management errors are sought at the top management of the organisation.
This 10-page report is detailed in detail about existing problems in the reflection and analysis of the Central Coalition and American efforts to prepare Iraq’s forces in 2014 and 2015.
Although this does not provide irrefutable evidence that the senior officials of the Obama administration had been allowed to review reports, it shows that Centcom’s management has made a known pressure on analysts to reflect a more optimistic view of the State of Islam (also known as ISIS or ISIL).
The report indicates that in the first half of 2015, the Central Administration Press Releases, Statements and Reports represented the situation in a much more positive light than it was in fact.
For example, the Centcom representatives publicly announced that the Mosula recovery operation could begin in April or May 2015.
Mosula is the second largest city in Iraq that is still under the control of the Islamic State.
In his report, the representative of the Kansas Party, Mike Pompeo, wrote: "The investigation of more than a few months clearly confirms it."
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, the United States Central Administration’s chief executives reviewed reports, representing ISIS’s risks lower than they were in the truth.
The Republican Party set up a working group, acknowledging that analysts are concerned that information about the Islamic State is being distorted.
To continue the investigation, the report published on Thursday will follow new disclosures in this case.
The General Inspectorate of the Ministry of Defence shall conduct an investigation into the activities of the Centcom intelligence service.
The members of the Democratic Party of the Committee for the Management of Exemptions published their own report on Thursday, which they agree with the conclusions of the Working Group of the Republican Party.
In its report, the Democrats representative Adams B. Šifs wrote that from 2014 to 2015, Centcom had too limited the preparation of the review reports on the ISIS and the Security Forces of Iraq.
Mr. Schifa explains that this process "stopped the dissemination of information", undermined the analytical work ethics and "distributed the facts that were not in line with the truth."
But the members of the Shefs and Democrat Party add that there is no evidence that the White House has put pressure on Centcom analysts to produce reports according to "pre-defined or political position".
The Daily Beast published provisional results of the congress investigation on Thursday.
In August The New York Times reported that the General Inspectorate of the Pentagon began an investigation after the centcom complaints.
The representative of the Pentagon, Lieutenant General Patrick Evans, said that the Pentagon would not comment on the report of the Congress until the investigation was continued.
He also adds that experts sometimes interpret complex data in different ways, and the Ministry of Defence and Investigation Management calls for constructive dialogue on vital national security issues.
The investigation is not only about whether the US-led bombing campaign in Iraq and Syria is successful (the claim made by an increasing number of representatives of the Ministry of Defence).
But last year's complaints are questioned whether President Obama can fully rely on the reports submitted by the Central Administration on military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan and other hot points.
Critics regarding the Islamic State's view of Islam remind us of more than ten years ago when Centcom's analyst Gregory Hükers published a study, claiming that George V. Bush's administration started the Afghan war, thinking too little of its possible consequences.
Hüker also played an important role in opening up the question of the State of Islam.
Last year’s official representatives reported that the Hücker team found that contrary to public reports, air raids on the Islamic State oil industry did not significantly improve the financial situation of the terrorist group because they had built temporary factories to sell oil on the black market.
In the September issue, The Times reported that this discovery did not go beyond the central management walls.
In the meantime, Commander General Loids Ostins III received an ass criticism because many lawmakers considered war reports to be too positive.
In April General Ostins resigned and replaced General Joseph L. Votels.
In the United States with British women's field hockey, the United States will win the fourth victory by order.
The day after victory over Japan with a result 6:1, the fourth day Keitia Bama won the first two words of the U.S. women's field hockey team, when Americans won the Indian team with a result 3:0.
Five good things in two games are unforgettable achievement, but 27 - year - old Bama said that she could not remember what had happened to her.
She said, "I don't feel any pain."
I'm not one of those people who count their names.
But she knows that the American result in the Olympic games is 4:0, which gives them in their group no distinction with Britain, which will not be won on Thursday after victory over Japan with result 2:0.
Britain and the United States will be on Saturday to play the first round of the latest games.
The two teams have already qualified for the fourth and the game will only determine which team will take the first place in the six teams and which one will be the second.
The first was soon to avoid meeting with the powerful Dutch elite, the leader of the second group.
Even if it is not a six-day game, the Americans have already called the surprise storm, four years ago in London, taking the last place between 12 teams.
In that command there was also Bama
Her husband in Bübbele, for the first time, accepted the farm hockey bride at the age of 3 (her older twin sisters had already worked with this type of sport in Dreksel) and joined the national election when she was 16 years old, becoming the most recent player in history.
She wasn't at the 2008 Olympics because she didn't get to the end.
However, in 2012 she and her team were unsuccessful.
In the following year, English Kregs Parhams was appointed as a trainee and all changed to a good side.
Bama called it "cultural, mental and physical changes."
In London we didn't do as much work as we do now.
We've completely changed everything.
In the fourth day of the game, Bama discovered the result by getting her words on the first half of her life with a back-up girl from nearby distance.
India started the game without winning its account, but their choice was very strong and kept a minimum result 0:1 until the end of the third period when Bama again won the awards.
She put the bombers in the area on the left side of the field, then she noticed going to the middle of the field and creating the bombs on the shoulders of the bombers, putting the Americans at 2:0.
In the middle of the fourth period, Melisa Gonzalez won another prize.
This was the first game of the U.S. Guard in the dry game of Jackie Brigas, each of the first three games to go through one gate.
She's stuck.
And so is Bama.
"We're going very well now," said Pahams, but how good, the game will appear on Saturday.
The most delicious food during the period of depression is "Sustainable meal"
In March 1933, shortly after the election of the president, Franklin Delano Rüzvelts sat in the oval room to hold meals.
The President of Rūzvelt was greeted by such delicate culinary delicateities as a pasta of zoos' livers or in the liver and the mouth of Merlanda's spinal cord.
However, today his painting was much more accurate: an oyster filled with tomatoes, potatoes biosphere and desert - a flood bottle.
Jane Ziegelmane says, "This is the way to solidify food preparation with people who lied very badly."
Her husband, Andrew Kou, adds: "It's also a message to the Americans how to eat."
A couple from the Brooklyn Heights area are food historians.
The last book "Darzenos Sautjaj" describes the Chinese cuisine in America, but Ziegelmane describes the life of his book "97 Abels" through the food house in the eastern part of Manhattan.
Their new joint work "Satisfying meal," published by Harper's publishing business on the second day, is a story of American food during the Great Depression.
By showing known solidarity in the culinary, they held meals together with reporters " Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop" in a simple half-day restaurant located in the Flatron region and operating since 1929 when a major depression began.
At 54 years of age, Ms. Ziegelmanes ordered butter with dried cheese and dried olives, while 57 - year - old Kou ordered salads for papayas, potatoes and vegetables.
When the reporter ordered a false sentence , the couple acknowledged that his choice was very appropriate for the discussion of the Great Depression meal .
Mrs. Ziegelmane told me that the fake dress was very popular.
There were groundnuts, livers and rabbits.
They were prepared from the basic ingredients and other ingredients that enriched the meals.
I thought what it was like to dig so many maps so that they could be in the middle of the day.
What kind of man's new?
"I'm sure I'm going to say that the liver is full of pigs," he added.
In the years leading up to predepression, half-days of the United States were similar to Swedish ships, especially in rural areas.
Women were ready to eat for their men workers and breakfasts, lunches and dinners.
During World War I, the Americans directly sent Europeans food. The "Special Malt" described how Americans adapted to conditions when America was no longer a state of overcrowding.
"At that time the meal became the main object of the American people's attention every day," said Mr. Kou, explaining why he and his wife wanted to write directly on this subject.
As important as new budget diets were: food such as fake dishes and snacks became daily, soaps were "a great way to use surpluses," noted Mrs. Ziegelmane, for the dangers could hide undesirable ingredients under harmful targets.
Fresh fruits were replaced by dried fruits.
The meat that had long been the main ingredient of American cuisine has now become an extremely rare luxury price.
During the time when the number of calories and food levels were more important than the sound of a new generation, there were still no shapes.
In an ancient manuscript, Mrs. Ziegelmanes chose recipes for preparing skimmings filled with groundnut butter.
"It wasn't a popular half-day table supplement."
Mrs. Ziegelmanen points out: "It was real."
The groundnut butter and fruit syrup are not compatible.
Many home meals were used in difficult times.
Economicists such as Luíze Stenly, head of the Federal Economics Office of the Economy from 1923 to 1943 established state food supplies that were not experienced either before or after the Great Depression.
By publishing letters and recipes in newspapers and magazines, they advised households to become "economicists" and to accept challenges such as turning macaroni and burcans into spiritual food.
"Sacrifice Maltíte" is a love of historical virtues.
It is particularly interesting to see evidence of the government's attitude towards its native citizens, for example, President Herbert Hüvera's "let me eat chicken" attitude.
Although he spoke publicly about his simple childhood and food in Ioo, he really ate like a little millionaire, which he had become.
What Mr. Kou says: "He liked the European cuisine, for example, fish with a
He ate almost in the crowded guest room eating half-day jackets.
He was completely absorbed in reality.
President Rūzvelt would have made the same mistake if his wife, Eleanor, had not advised him to show an example of her eating habits.
The book says that Rūzvelts became a house servant who did not learn to prepare food, so that the Baltic Nam became a place "where not only one of the most expensive meals were delivered in Washington, but also the most expensive food prepared".
As soon as the national economy is back, most of the symptoms of air culinary depression are eliminated.
But we continue to pay attention to calories and nutrients, as well as to how science is used in culinary, Mrs Ziegelmanes added.
He relates that when writing the book, they gained a greater understanding of Mrs. Ziegelman’s mother’s diet, such as why she could not eat outside.
"She was really afraid to miss out on a meal," said Mr. Kou.
Mrs. Ziegelmanen said, "She actually betrayed people."
Sometimes there was an incident with windshields.
When we were in Eisenberg's dining room, a couple of writers came out of the soma house prepared dessert: a bottle of flowers that President Rūzvelts wanted to eat on Wednesdays.
"It's a flood break," said Mrs. Ziegelmanes, adding that at the same time there was a distribution of income for suitable foods to give a short name.
It has no dirt, only dried streams, little flour, sugar, water and canal.
All were impatiently designed in the brown mass that was found on the solvents.
Surprisingly, it wasn't even that bad.
I'm sorry, sir. I'm sorry.
After listening to the experienced "economicist," he said to the woman, "The gold of a heap of sand. "
Gilead will receive compensation for legal expenditure in the fight against Merck for Hepatitis C patent
The district judge has decided that "Gilead Sciences Inc." is entitled to receive back expenses for legal services paid by him in the case of patenting Hepatitis C against Merck & Co Inc.
In June, Gilead was justified in the case of 200 million mercenaries' fines for two Merck patents, which threatened it with successful Sovaldi and Harvoni tablets when the U.S. federal judge found violations of Merk's operation, for example after the transfer of the animal and other inequity.
On the fourth day of the proceedings, U.S. district judge Bets Labson Frimens stated that Gilead has the right to claim compensation for the legal expenses incurred by it in this case.
Merck tries to gain positions on the market against Gilead, which dominates the market with new birth hepatitis C drugs, which are effective 90% in cases of liver disease.
The case was initiated in 2013, when both Gilead and Merck appealed to each other, trying to gain ownership of the newly developed active components of sofosbuvir, which is the main component of Gilead medicine.
The US-supported forces claim that they have completely taken control of the city of Manbidja from the Islamic State.
The US-supported forces in their control are fully occupied in the northern part of the city of Mandage and the last members of the Islamic State's military city have disappeared on Friday by the representative of the group.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDS) are currently opening up a city from the last enemy fighters who have not yet left the city.
They have released more than 2,000 civilian civilians who were defeated by the attackers, told the news agency Reuters that Charfan Darviss from the SDS-based Manbage Military Council.
"The city is now in full control of us and we are looking for fighters," he informed the Agency Reuters.
Clinton's income reached $10.75 million in 2015, and the couple paid 34.2 per cent of the federal tax rate.
Hilary Klintone published a 2015 tax declaration, which shows that the candidate of the President of the Democratic Party and her husband have won $10.75 million this year and paid the federal tax rate of 34.2 per cent, respectively.
During 2015, Clinton gave US$ 1 million, mainly to its Klinton charity. Former President Bill Clinton won about $5.3 million by standing as a sponsor and former Secretary of State received $3 million from his work book in the State Department, published in collaboration with Simon & Schuster.
Clinton's election was announced - US Secretary of State Tims Keins and his wife, Anna Holtton, published their tax declaration for the last 10 years.
In 2015, they paid a federal tax rate of 20.3 per cent.
"Hilaria Klintone and Tims Keins continued to set new financial transparency standards," wrote Clinton's campaign partner Jennifer Palmieri in his statement.
On the other hand, Donalds Tramps hides behind a variety of beneficiaries and tenders in order not to comply with promises to disclose his tax information.
The publication of tax information paid is a practice of registration for US presidential candidates, but it is not required by law.
New York businessman Tramps and his attorneys have audited the State Revenue Service as a reason not to disclose tax information.
"Your passport," in his Twitter entry, Ian Sams, a Klinton campaign partner, sent information about the tax information of the Democratic Party's candidate.
On Thursday, Trampa Special Adviser Michael Kohens told CNN that he would not allow Trampa to publish tax information before the audit was completed.
The trampa critics, including the presidential candidate of the Republican Party of 2012, Ms Romnij and other Republicans, claim that their refusal raises questions about the amount of his real property, the amount of his contributions and other business obligations, including those relating to Russia.
Clinton joined the oil fire on Friday, publishing videos where several influential Republicans asked Trappo to publish their tax information.
She returned to Michigan on Thursday during the economic discussion on this issue.
She said to her efforts: "He refuses to do what the other presidential candidates have done for decades."
Politicians reported that during 1990 Tramps had paid very little or no taxes for two years, and on Friday the author of the New York Times business store sent that many journalists and jurists believe that nothing has changed.
The federal tax rates are an important issue in this presidential election.
Clinton, in support of the proposal of billions of Varena Baffeta, popularizes the idea that every person who earns more than $1 million a year must pay tax at least 30%.
This proposal is also supported by President Barak Obama.
Last week at Clinton's station in Omaha, Nebraska, where his "Berkshire Hataway" conglomerate was also located, Bafets called on Trappo to exchange tax declarations.
Bafets said he was also audited by the Revenue Service and Tramps was afraid of the voters, not the tax authorities.
The Clinton campaign has published tax information up to 2007.
Klintoni now lives in the Czech Republic, New York and the period from 2007 to 2014 has paid an average federal tax rate of around 32 per cent and a total tax rate of about 40.5 per cent.
Clinton’s 2015 tax report shows that, unlike most Americans, only $100 of their income is paid.
Their main investment was the low cost index fund from which Clinton received $109,000 in dividends.

The director of the Hebrew film criticises hotels in Berlin about shutting down Israel's remote code on request - RT News
The director of the Hebrew-born French film series was quoted in the social media when he discovered that the "Kempinski Bristol" hotel in Berlin does not have an Israeli remote guard code available. The hotel staff are based on the requirement of Arab customers.
Claude Lancmans, the documentary film director of the Holocaust Shoah, did not hide his discontent with the Berlin Kempinski Bristol hotel and addressed an open letter to the German newspaper FAZ.
During the recent visit, Lancmans tried to find the Israel Remote Code in the list of hotels offered.
However, this country was not included in the list with countries to which it can be called directly from the hotel number.
How is it possible that Israel has been trapped and destroyed in Berlin, the new capital of Germany in 2016?
Written by Lancmans.
Instead, the Kempinski Bristol hotel offers to call this country through its call centre.
The director asked for an explanation from the hotel staff.
Lancmans writes that the answer he received "was shocked."
The hotel administrator explained that "this is a known hotel management decision".
The reason for the removal of the code was even more complex for the film director.
"Most of the guests are Arabs and they asked for the removal of the Israeli code," Lancmans explained in another hotel worker's explanation.
Suddeutsche Zeitung reports that Israel's Ambassador Jakovs Hadas-Handelsman in Germany has been referred to as "a great dog".
We're surprised and shocked about this incident.
The same thing about yourself is great beauty.
And the fact that this has happened right in Germany, right on this hotel network is even more low.
No explanations are required.
"We hope the hotel will make the right conclusions".
This event took place quite widely on the Internet, where people called it scandal.
Others believe that the Kempinski hotel has just been issued to Arab customers.
Another entry sent "behave", indicating that the hotel is located in Kurfurstendam on the street near the synagogue.
The issue of Der Spiegel reports that the hotel itself has quickly rejected all transfers by declaring that it is all "reconcilable" and apologized to Lancman.
"We have not received direct orders to remove Israel from the list of national numbers," Suddeutsche Zeitung, Kempinski, said.
And add that the code has been added to the list again.
The police use rubber and steel gas against protesting Brazilian students.
Student and police confrontation took place on Thursday in the city of Sanpaul, Brazil, where students took part in a demonstration against government education reform.
The police used rubber and steel gas against the students.
Problems began when lawyers tried to expel students as a result of the use of rubber and steel gas by the police.
Several hundred students participated in the demonstration to show their indifference to the reform of the education system.
Sanpaulu Governor Geraldo Alckmina's proposal is to close almost 100 public schools and 300 000 students will be transferred to other schools with a view to saving funds.
Some demonstrators marked on the wall a graph with letters against former President Michael Temer.
This protest took place only a few days after the previous protest, when the students in the hourly demonstrations were to give support to former President Dilma Rosefia, who had voted in favour of the press.
Skots Kelums Skinner ends first, bringing to Britain gold medal riding
Kelums Skinner from Scotland finished his first team of men riding a bike at Rio veal which took place last night. The British team won the title of its champion, which it won in the London Games in 2012.
At the age of 23, a 23-year-old sportsman from Glasgow played an important role in these events by making a nice legendary scoundrel of Sir Kris Hoy and giving victory to the well-being of New Zealand.
Four years ago, Britain won a remarkable victory when Hoys won a fifth of his six Olympic gold medals.
And they did it again at the World Championship in London, although Hoys had already finished his sports career.
Problems were at a stage between Beijing and London Olympics, as experienced beginner Jamie Stafu came to replace.
This was the last time they got it out.
When Hoys left, he tried to fill his place with Kianas Emmadi and Matt Krampton.
Britain’s coaches hoped for Skinner, looking at the potential he later proved.
Hindus, Kenijs - champions who started four years ago with Hoju and Skinners who set up the Olympic Qualification Record, but the best start was for the New Zealand team
However, British trio obtained gold medals.
The Hindus, after their turn of life, were under strict pressure, Kenys was in charge, and Skinner was in charge of this.
The change of the strategy played an important role in the victory because Hindus traveled with greater transfer to allow Kenya and especially Skinner to move faster.
Hoys was seen as a BBC representative and cut off Skinner, Kenya, and Hindi eyes at the time they climbed onto a good pastel.
The 23-year-old glaucoma said, "It was an unprejudiced promotion."
I do everything to protect my name.
We finally set up the Olympic record and won the World Championships.
That was just incredible.
There's no better victory.
After winning with Kenya and Hoju in the 2012 Olympic Games in London, Hindus admitted that they were on their way after a failed start.
Later he reviewed this comment and did not have the power to prove the opposite to British competitors.
There was no such difference at all.
Hindus said: "The British flag in the tribunals referred to London in memory."
Over the past three months, we have become a licensed team.
We have lost so many world championships, so the Olympics were really special.
One medal will be awarded to a country that won seven out of ten gold medals on its way to Beijing and London.
If this achievement is a team progress indicator over the last five months, the next five days will be very exciting.
In view of Kenya’s outcome, he could indeed resume Hoja’s success by acquiring three Olympic gold medals.
Kenya would mean six golden and one silver medal. Kenijs was born on March 23rd (it seems to be a British sacred date because this day has also been born by Steve Regreivs, Mo Farahs and Rogers Banisters).
This data also contains Hoys' birth.
Kenya's next series is a press that starts today and will continue for the next three days.
A 28-year-old sportsman from Bolton said, "Now I'm just trying it all.
The team's journey is always the best.
Because then you can win with team members.
If you're honest, then you're a little lonely."
He said, "If he gets two more gold medals, he'd have to be hired as a soldier."
That day it was the only war on medals, but it was not the only good news for Britain.
Sers Bradlys Vigins, Eds Klenseys, Steves Burks and Owens Douls showed the fastest qualification period in four kilometres.
His time was 3:51.943
The world record set up in London in 2012 is 3:51.659.
The first round and the final will take place today on the second side of the day, where Vigins will certainly be at the center of attention.
Last night before his qualifying trip, he had had a disagreement with the Commissioner when the judges called him to measure his growth.
In the women's journey that will continue and conclude today, Laura Trota, Joanna Rovsela Shanda, Elinor Barker and Keitia Archibalda from Malgavia set up a new record 4:13.260.
The British delegation hopes that the British Riding Team, hopefully, will end up in the middle of the Olympic Games in the middle of the season.
Looking back on the outstanding and unprecedented performance in Beijing and London, everyone looks forward to the same achievements as Rio.
As soon as it has passed, after allegations of sexuality and respect, technical director Sheins Satons has resigned, and Hojs and Victoria Bendletona have finished their career.
However, at the beginning of the first train rides, it is clear that Britain will always reach the highest level in the real time.
The future of the Portland castle will become unclear as a contract has been terminated.
The future of its employees in Portland, in Victoria, has become unclear because its main client energy company has announced a cessation of cooperation.
This Communication is based on the plans of the Government of Victoria to suspend the subsidy of an energy company which is vital to enable the company to continue its work.
The 20-year subsidy will be suspended in November.
Thus, more than 2000 Alkoas Portland's workplaces are at risk.
The risks could be either direct or indirect jobs up to 2000.
In addition, it will also have unexpected side effects because it is consumed about 10 per cent of all Victorian electricity supply.
In 2014, Alcoa closed the “Point Henry” cabinet leading to an end to the operation of the English station.
The Alcoa Portland cashier works with losses and can be closed.
These events have led to several years of speculation about the value of the Australian dollar and the cost of industrial production.
The supplier of industrial energy "AGL", which supplies energy from his "Loy Yang A" power station in Latroubes, says that the other three owners will probably also terminate their contracts.
Most power stations belong to Alcoa and Alumia Joint Undertaking, as well as parts of the company belong to Chinese CITIC and Japanese Marubini Corp holding companies.
"AGL" hopes to continue the work of the Portland industry, which would mean further energy supply to the customer," its representative said.
‘AGL’ stated that the contracts are so-called ‘risk-limiting contracts’ which are intended to enter into force from November 2016.
The contracts have a 12-month period of validity and will therefore be valid until 2017.
"AGL is planning to receive revenue from these contracts also in the fiscal year 2017," said the company's representative.
From the year 2018 onwards, the potential impact of the fiscal year on profits will be limited to a favourable market forecast for electricity wholesale prices in the future.
“AGL” claims that in its forecasts losses have already been calculated at $187 million , assuming that these contracts will be terminated .
Alcoa submits that the decision to terminate the contracts will not affect Alcoa's ability to continue or supply energy to it.
The US company reported that it had concluded a Loy Yang contract for 20 years in 2010, but it will be terminated in November. The company does not provide any explanations on why it will cease its cooperation.
Analysts have expressed concern about the possible closure of the Portland castle in Victoria and the closure of the Tomago industry shortly from New York, because of the weak economy of the sector.
In the past week, Executive Director Stevens Mikelson said that 600 megawatts and 900 megawatts were used during the Portland year following analyses.
If both of these industries were driven from the energy market, the demand for energy would be significantly reduced.
And that wouldn't be good at all.
The Community legal centre rejects 160,000 people every year.
More than 160 000 people are rejected each year, and the budget decline could be worsening.
Three out of five people in Queensland - mostly pensioners, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence and those who do not have the means to combat illegal exploitation are denied free legal assistance and representation.
The Community legal centre, which is already overrun, warns that reducing funding will only make the situation worse.
These legal centres will receive 30% less funding than they have so far since June.
Mr James Farels, Director of the Centre for Legal Affairs of Queensland, said that the latest report of the National Legal Centres Association reports that legal aid is currently being rejected by thousands of people in need.
Mr Farels pointed out that if this decision was not rejected, the situation would only get worse.
He also said: "The legal centre of Queensland is constantly receiving insufficient funding, which means that the aid is rejected by thousands of people it needs."
People who are trying to end violent relationships, people with deep debt, families who experience divorce, workers who are unjustly fired - all these people have legal problems and this report shows that they do not receive the help they need.
Since June 2017, the federal government has reduced funding by 30%, which means that more than a thousand of the people of Queensland will have to solve their complex legal problems without assistance.
We call on the Attorney-General and Senator George Brandis of Queensland to stop the reduction of funding immediately so that those who need legal assistance can obtain it.
In the past year, the government has opened its plans to create a level of legal aid up to the national average.
It is now time to also pay attention to the needs of local communities and their clients and to the Palazzo Government's investment in this important area.
Donald Trampa's campaign was filed in court because one of the employees fired the gun
New York: Donalda Trampa campaign organizers have been accused in court because they have not acted on the information that its North Carolin Operation Manager will shoot a gun at a worker when they arrived in one car in February.
This incident was described in a court order submitted by the Court of Charlotte on the third day by Vincent Bordi - former campaign programmer.
Boroni said he had waited months for an internal review of the case to be started, but understood that this would not happen.
Director ærls Philips "takes off his gun, puts his good showcase shop on the street and leads a stand against Vincent's road," Bordi claims in his complaint.
He also claimed that, by submitting complaints to the local and regional campaign management, Bordi knew that at least four people had experienced the same experience.
"The guns don't have to go out to cause losses," Bordy wrote in his complaint.
Only two days before the presentation of this case, a candidate from the Republican party to the presidential office caused scandal by informing people that "The People of the Second Amendment", i.e. the owners of arms and enthusiasts, could take action if the wish was to win his chance of Hilary Clinton and his chosen judges.
The representatives of the tramp campaign announced that the media had spoken his words from the context, and he never pushed anyone into violence.
Borons, on their request, would like to pay compensation from campaign organizers for ill-supervised monitoring, but from the Philippines - for the use of illegal weapons and the creation of emotional stress.
The representative of the trampa Houpa Hixa did not comment immediately.
You haven't been able to contact Philips.
WCCB - Charlotte’s local news agency reports that Philip has recently launched a campaign.
Also, he did not hesitate to contact the "Innovative Advisory Services" company.
The candidate for the presidential office of the Republican party Donald Tramps has implemented a controversial election campaign.

New tradition - Christmas and sports holidays in Čultije.
On the sixth day of July, the people celebrated their first Christmas and sports festivals.
After ten years of singing, it was decided that Ezra’s festival would no longer exist.
The new page is now split.
Day started with sports matches.
At the time, the competition was not traditional and was too serious to take because, for example, the shootings had to be done for a sleeping purpose, the flavor flew, with a man's left hand loss, "bumbleding" was not at all in any Olympic games.
Yet, each participant was able to show how strong, courageous, and courageous he was.
After the sports games, all of the time was spent in a free-of-life strategy where Christmas celebrations began.
At the same time, "children's discipline" also worked, where small ones could get involved in the exciting attractions and get a new picture of the scene in the gymnasium.
A youth who could also become a tradition was a traveling merchant in which both tractors and motorcycles were given.
Inga Kadiče-Skadina, the head of the Külciema estate administration, spoke all about things that were fun and cool, but that was not very disturbing.
The festival continued with the greeting of the newest people in the world.
It's really good that the priest has added five girls and one girl.
With advances to the Italians, more amateurs were introduced from Engores novada - viewers greatly liked the performances of the "Rudens rhythms", the performances of the "Reds" and the performances of the young dancers "Zelta Perles".
And it's nothing that happened on the secret view of something else.
Of course, the local people and the villagers were delighted by the famous poets Janis Jaráns and Danis Porgants, who was once again Mildinas Nabina and Clearite Kráninja, as well as the attractive women of Barzciema from the fishing seat "Dienjas".
Balli played "Bruggis" group.
Britain must maintain the Olympics and expand the Hitrova.
Not only will rapid prosperity and growth in the local regions and London but also throughout the country.
This, I think, makes Hitrov very attractive, just like in 2012 in London, where we have worked hard to get all the national regions from the Olympic Games.
Stratford and Eistenda won a great deal of the Olympics.
And we will do it again by providing local residents and businesses with business opportunities from Hitrova.
For local communities only, we will create 10,000 new business opportunities, 40,000 new jobs, and finally add a point to young people's unemployment in the Hytrov area.
As in the 2012 London Olympic Games, there will also be people who will consider this challenge too big and that the expansion of the Highway is too serious.
On the other hand, people said that Britain would never be able to prepare Olympics during the time and that it would be a global catastrophe.
Skeptics have failed in 2012 and will not be fair in the case of Hitrova.
There are always obstacles that must be overcome, but Hitrova has so far overcome everything.
Like the Olympic Games, Hytrova is a project of infrastructure that will benefit the entire society, not individual individuals.
The expansion is possible to create up to 180 000 new jobs, economic growth of 211 billion, creating soil for both employment and experience in this airport and throughout Britain.
A large team is working in an emergency, which has created an investment programme of 11 billion trucks worth of infrastructure, including in time and budget, starting with a terminal 5, which has been named five years from the site as the best airport in the world and finally with a terminal 2, which has been built between two more intensive flights around the world.
Now they are ready to set up a third-party flight, which will be financed by private investment in the amount of 16 billion cargoes.
The 2012 London Olympics were a great success, and I am convinced that it will be the same for the rapid expansion of Hétrova.
It is time to revive the Olympic era and expand Hitrov by ensuring our future of trade and creating a new employment environment with which Britain could be pleased.
Lord Paul Deitons is a member of the Hitrovas government and former secretary of the Ministry of Economics.
In Switzerland, a woman will climb up a hill trying to commit suicide.
In the middle of the night, he fell asleep on his knees.
The police tried to find Witnesses for the accident when four o’clock in the morning she was transferred across several cars.
The incident took place on Thursday afternoon after midnight on the A1 road near Vo Canton of the city of Morges.
Vo Canton police report said that if she wanted to commit suicide, the woman was on her way into the dark, where she was picked up by several cars.
Understandably, the victims, 49 - year - old Christmas, gathered several machines, including a heavy machine.
She died at the scene.
Several cases involving these persons have already given evidence, but the other interested parties have not yet been identified, says the police calling on the persons involved to call out witnesses of the accident.
The case also began a criminal investigation which, in this case, is a logical step, by the lawyer Gilles Hofstellers for the issue of Le Tribune de Geneva.
However, it is not yet known whether any of the drivers involved will be punished.
Was it possible to avoid harassment?
Hofstellers says, "You're a noskaidros prosecutor."
Two similar cases that have occurred over the last five years show that none of the drivers will be called responsible.
In both cases, the walker had gone through the middle of the night on the highway, so it was decided that car drivers could not expect to find a walker in the middle of the night, a message paper.
In the past year, a policeman was justified in notice after he visited a man who had been lying on the A1 road near Paijerna in August 2014.
The court found that the 22 - year - old victim was drunk and later found himself stuck on the road.
The Court concluded that a police officer who was on his way to the scene of the accident was travelling in an appropriate manner and the judge recognized that the sleeping man on the road was "fully unexpected and extraordinary".
Any person who has information about the events of the fourth day is invited to contact the police by telephone 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
On the Internet, they collect signatures for the conduct of a new VID director.
Avaaz.org Portal of Petitions has started the collection of signatures for the conduct of the invitation to tender by the new State Revenue Service (VID).
An application addressed to the Ministers of the National Union (NA) and the Green and Landing Union (ZZS) indicates that the public wants a cross-border and professional staffing process.
The petition was made on 10 August and is currently signed by 55 people.
The award process of Inga Collegiate Director-General of the VID is indisputable and non-professional.
It recalls the best traditions of the Council's staff of the Union.
It discredits public administration and, at the same time, makes public opinion in government and politics.
"There is a need for a tender with clear criteria for which all candidates should be assessed," the text of the petition.
Its author, Janis B., pointed out that the public did not know the criteria for choosing Collegova for the task.
In addition, it is not clear what the candidate's intended VID is for work.
The request indicates that a new open invitation to tender for professional candidates is required for the State Chancellor and an appropriate remuneration is offered.
Last week, Minister of Finance Dana Reiznieces-Ozola officially appealed to the Head of the College of VID, and this week he was scheduled to be approved in the new office, but all the party ministers voted against, so the issue of the week was raised.
Samuel: If we lose, then I won the wrong.
Pludmal volleyballist Aleksandr Samuelovs and Janis Šmedijn were waiting for the prize of Riodejaneiro’s Olympic Games, however, there is no difference where the competitions were closed after the tournament ended Samoilovs.
One of the world’s most powerful paddleball volleyballs in the four-day subgroup tournament in the final and decisive game with 1-2 (16:21, 22:20, 7:15) lost Brazilians Evandr Gonsalveša Oliveiir and Pedro Solberg Salgad, completing their participation in the most important four-year sport forum.
Three teams of Latvian athletes won one victory, but the same was true of two others.
Three too small points were further counted, which was the most desirable of Latvia's data after the loss of this scale.
"In the first set we were in charge, but from 16:15 it was also left to 16 points," recalled Smedian.
I don't even know how the rest of the set remains without points.
It must not be played.
After that, it was all right and at the end of the set to win the game, and it had to be a good foundation for the third set.
We started it the same way, but after we moved to the parts, the results grew for only one team.
We had too many mistakes in the attack.
In the subgroup all teams were similar, almost all games had three sets, so small points were important.
"You should have played more like this, not multiplely give 3-4 points in order," said the athlete.
We knew Evandru could be observed.
"In the first seven to meet with them at the end, in the second sentence 1-2 points, but in the third at +4 he has already bought a game," Smeedins recalled.
We tried to show the best game.
It's time. It's time. It's time.
The co-assessment situation was not seen before the match, but it was known that there was a need for more small points where possible.
"If we lost, then I won evil," Samoilovs said.
From Evandr we expected a good service and with it at the end of the first set, but the third opened up a service and it was difficult to form an attack.
On the other hand, I took a lot of mistakes directly to the Pedru server, but it had to be done.
Samoilovs told me that the opposite was not the case for athletes today.
"We went, we played, we also had protection, but we needed better service," said the athlete.
"They played well and finally got to the Urea."
Prior to the tournament, we had just said that the exhibition was not as easy as it could have been.
We were able to fight for the first place, but we didn't even go out of the group.
"All of us were waiting for medals, and so were we, but then there is no more difference - 25th place or fourth place," said Samuel, who predicted that the present would continue to play together in the future as well.
I think there will be no question and we will continue to play together because this is just one tournament.
Samoilova Riodejaneiro was already in his third Olympic career, since in Beijing in 2008, he started with Martinus Płavín, but four years ago he played with Ruslan Sorokinu in London.
This was the second beginning of the Olympics.
"Latvenergo" also follows the process of opening the gas market from a potential trader's position.
State energy company Latvenergo followed the process of opening the gas market from both consumer and potential trader positions, said company press secretary Ivita Bidere.
"The decision whether "Latvenergo" will also join the gas market as a trader will determine which gas market model and legal regulation will be established."
"We are therefore actively involved in the creation and commentation of legislative acts on our part, and we are also submitting our proposals," said Bidere.
The Agency has already written that the Ministry of Economic Affairs (EM), in cooperation with the Commission for the Regulation of Public Services and the Energy Company "Latvijas Gaze", has developed a draft regulation of the Ministry's Office on "Trade and Use of Natural Gas" which will change the principles of the functioning of the existing natural gas market since 3 April 2017 by providing users with the right to freely choose a natural gas dealer.
By working on a new natural gas market regulation, the EM aims to make the natural gas trade process as simple as possible and understandable to the user.
Therefore, as the most efficient and user-friendly service solution is chosen as a "central model of the trader", in which all activities related to customer service are provided by a trader - one contract, one account and one information and one customer service place, by leaving technical issues of the natural gas distribution system for the distribution system operator.
A similar solution is currently being implemented in electricity trade.
It is recalled that the opening up of a gradual market for household users - also after 3 April 2017 for those household users who will not choose another natural gas trader, will continue to receive natural gas at the regulated price of the current trader, thus becoming related users.
"In this case, the obligation to supply natural gas related users at a regulated price has been laid down for a public trader," the Ministry reported.
However, traders will have to choose a natural gas trader to conclude a natural gas trade contract.
Until the conclusion of the natural gas trade agreement, the former natural gas trader will provide traders with a fixed price for certain periods of time.
The draft rules of the Ministerial Office detail the rights and obligations of the natural gas trader, system operator and users.
The rules shall lay down the arrangements for the provision and suspension of natural gas to users, the safe use requirements of the natural gas system, the trader, the public trader, the system operator, the user and the natural gas owner's rights and obligations in the supply and use of natural gas; the arrangements to be made for the provision of services received, the percentage of delays, the trader's change arrangements and the supply of natural gas to users; and the procedure for the provision of natural gas related users by the public trader.

Minister: The next week it is planned to discuss an increase in the remuneration of the Director-General of VID.
Minister of Finance Dana Reiznice-Ozola (Green and Lands Union (ZZS)) plans to discuss the increase in the remuneration of the Director-General of State Revenue (VID) with Minister Mári Kučinski (ZZS) and the government coalition partners.
On Friday, Journalists said that the issue of increasing the pay of the Director-General for VID must be addressed urgently in order to make this task more attractive to the renegotiators.
The next week we are talking about a change in the terms of the invitation to tender.
The Minister also stressed that she did not think of any specific candidate to plead for a holiday mission.
At the same time, Reiznice-Ozola expressed the view that the Head of State Environment Service Inga Kolígova would be a good VID Director-General.
On the other hand, with regard to the current VID leader Daci Peläko, who has expressed his willingness to object to this task, the Minister has repeatedly expressed the view that the new VID Director should be "see from the table" and should not come from the VID structure.
She also stressed that it is expected that Saeima will return from his leave to move as soon as possible to the amendments to the laws necessary for the reorganisation of the VID.

Collegiants also indicated that his candidature consultation has increased between the ruling coalition parties which are also unacceptable.
It has also been reported that the former Director General of VID Inar Petersson left office at the end of June.
Oil prices continue to rise; more beer indexes in the US and Europe, as well as the dollar value of the US.
Oil prices in the world continue to increase on Friday morning, with the positive impact of investors' savings on the Ministerial statements of South Arabia's Oil Affairs, which reinforce the hope that the largest oil-producing countries will take action at the upcoming OPEC meeting in September to stabilize the global oil market.
On Thursday, the three main U.S. beer index reached a record level that had not been observed since 1999.
The main positive factor in the market was the rise in oil prices and strong financial indicators for several large companies.
The rise in oil prices and the strong financial indicators of several companies were also a reason for the rise in the European beer index on Thursday.
The value of the US dollar increased on Thursday for the euro, for the British fleet and for Japan's yen.
In New York’s electronic market prices for the WTI brand oil supply increased by $1.78 U.S. to $43,49 per barrel on Thursday, September.

The turnover of the "Green Lavender" of the conservative producer is only 33.8%.
The turnover of the Green Lawmaker was only €4.202 million, which is 33.8% less than years ago, while the company’s losses decreased 5.7 times - up to €904.7 000, according to the annual financial report published on the Lursoft database.
The company’s management report stated that in 2015 the company had worked with losses caused for several reasons, including the lack of sustainable means of circulation caused by the withdrawal of Unicredit Bank from the Baltic market by interrupting the existing credit line and leaving the Green Law covenant with concluded contracts without the possibility of fulfilling them.
Therefore, the company did not have sufficient means to purchase cheaper raw materials in large quantities and receive a discount.
The creation of the relevant bank from the Latvian market also led the company to implement projects of support from the European Union Structural Funds which would allow the manufacturer to purchase new production equipment and modernise infrastructure.
Also, in the year in question, the financial producers of the company had a negative impact on the rise in the price of raw materials and on the unwillingness of customers to pay more than the goods produced by the company.
"Only on the second half of July 2016 did customers recognise price changes and were ready to buy goods for new – higher – prices," the company’s management said.
In 2015, the Green Lawn also started negotiations with potential investors, including the assessment of the company's foreign and non-exchangeable assets.
Investors have already been at the company's largest creditor "Unicredit Leasing", where the parties have identified and discussed possible investment plans.
At the same time, the activities and development of the company had a positive impact on the implementation of the restructuring and optimisation plan launched in 2014 and 2015.
This plan itself includes improving technological processes and optimisation, which enables greater productivity and capacity to be achieved.
"A number of equipment has been purchased to ensure greater production speed," the company's management said.
The management of the "Green Law" notes that the equipment purchased in 2016 will allow the company to carry out orders that were not so far possible.
The first batch of production to be produced on this equipment will be ready in August.
As the goods are already signed for the sale of the product, all the products produced will be sold in accordance with the goods' protocols.
The new product will increase turnover by around 300 000 euros a month," the company's management said.
In August 2016 the company plans to sign a cooperation agreement on supply of fish production to Iraq.
In 2016, the Green Law has sent the first experimental container to Israel, expanding the market to Cyprus and this year will sign a cooperation agreement with the new U.S.
As a result of all the above measures, the company plans to increase its turnover.
In 2014, Green Lawn worked with a turnover of EUR 6,347 million and losses of EUR 5,113 million.
"Green money" has been established in 1997 and its core capital is EUR 1,156 million.
The company belongs to two Latvian private persons - Mihailam Kaidanova (89.11%) and Igoram Shirshoon (10.89%).
Steps were invited by p. 15 to the museum to wait for the film show Záru Leanderi and to participate in the press conference.
Riga can be viewed as the city of the beginning of the zar Leander's career of the divine film.
The arrest of Záras Landeres at the Crossgate of Rutas, who was a Swedish ambassador in Latvia, was evaluated in 1924, as she immediately revealed to Záras Lender's wife an unusual low contract that she was trying to debate on the stage of the theatre in Riga in 1924.
Perhaps a feeling of unworthiness in Riga has become a legitimate passion for the world’s glory along the way of Sarah’s creation.
Riga Zárai Leandere was associated with warm memories, and she hoped to return to Riga in the neighborhoods, but unfortunately these hopes were not fulfilled because World War II began.
Using the form of the exhibition, this meeting will be possible at Riga's 2016 holidays and the great Ieva Kerévica will be in the role of Záras Leanderes.

The insurer shall pay compensation to passengers on the third day of departure from the airport.
If the insurance has paid a travel insurance fee to a family on Wednesday, a flight cancelled by Riga airport on August 10 which resulted in a refusal to visit the planned music festival.
On 11 August, an application for compensation was received from a customer in the If Insurance.
The family had planned to go to the music festival in Belgium, but since it was not possible on the third day because of air travel cancelled at the airport, the customer was calculated for a night-care reservation that could no longer be cancelled and for tickets bought for the festival of EUR 204.
On the other hand, customers who have spent money on airplane tickets have promised to pay the airline.
If the insurance of all travel insurance benefits has averaged 15% of the cases, compensation for termination or cancellation of the trip has been paid.
"In such cases expenses are paid for the purchase, return or exchange of tickets, as well as for the reservation of accommodation," says Dagnia Rutka, director of the insurance product.
As we know, on August 10th, due to the technical problems at Riga Airport, the private aircraft stopped, so only a number of departures were cancelled, but several incoming flights were moved to other airports.
As a result of family repair, a man is forced to leave his house with broken ribs.
In the case of LTV "4studija" Dmitry Sidijaševs, who was close to starting capital repairs in his apartment, and since then Dmitria has suffered from severe anxiety and is not convinced that staying in the apartment is safe.
The problem is that my neighbors took part in the construction work and my apartment was damaged.
Then I informed the building administration of Riga, household managers and other organizations.
The building government said we are not an operational service and we are not an expert.
"The owner of the apartment has to go to the Latvian Engineering Union and there will be an expert from the owner," says Dmitry.
The invited expert came out, confirmed what had happened, and realized that the surplus was in a condition of dissatisfied.
However, since the first Dmitria proposal in the building, months have passed, and by the beginning of this week no one has been able to answer whether there is no risk to life in the apartment.
In the building town said - this is legislation, wait if you are not satisfied, write to everyone in order.
"Then I wrote to the Riga area, but they sent the house manager, then the house manager back to the building, and then there's a street," says Dmitry.
After all, it is clear that construction has been stopped, at any rate it can be heard that someone is working there.
In another two months, an expert must be carried out and within six months the owner of the apartment who is doing repair work must avoid all these defects.
The independent expert has developed his opinion, but the building board considers it incomplete and superior.
The expert has not indicated whether there is damage to the metal regime in this adjacent construction until there is no assurance that the owner of the lower apartment is at risk.
"That is why we have asked for further clarification from this expert," says Ilze Züka, representative of the city of Riga.
Despite the ban on any repair work in the upper apartment, the owner is still hearing that construction will continue.
The court for temporary construction without a building permit is from 70 to 700 euros, but in particular the court may be stricter.
As the expert opinion is expected, the building government has decided that both apartments cannot be operated - both in which construction works and in which the Dmitria apartment is located.
"This is not a case in the construction practice where, because of this lack of knowledge or simply unwillingness, the inhabitants may have caused a threat not only to their own property but also to the owner of the underlying property as a result of which the owner cannot exploit his property," said the building representative.
Now Dmitria is still looking for another place to live - with relatives, friends, hotels or rent other apartments.
But the losses caused by Dmitry can be managed by a neighbor's civil law, which can take a lot of time.
Because of the normal construction, living in two apartments is now prohibited until the builder has his lock, and it can be expected for even three weeks.
The losses caused will have to be borne by the owner of the apartment in which repair has taken place.
The owner of this apartment is also at risk of being detained for up to six months because of not taking into account what the building said.
Take it!
How much do I eat in this picture?
The expected answer is five.
In the country of Demidova, five white cattle were born near Kiev.
All feel good and sometimes shout together, despite the fact that the joint is small.
The former Khmer Sanatorium will cost EUR 22 million for five-star hotels.
The former Kamer's sanatorium for the Park Hotel Çemeri Hotel will cost EUR 22 million, and the agency will be represented by the upcoming hotel manager SIA "Park Hotel Čemeri", Gita Želve.

However, the reconstruction was slow.
In the 2010 review, however, it was also claimed that "Ominasis" regularly communicated with the hotel operator "Kempinski", which continues to provide daily technical control at the "Chemeri" sanatorium, and has already been determined in 2011 to "complete the construction of the existing hotel "Cemeri" and immediately start the preparations for the opening of the Kempinski chain hotel.
In October 2014, a group of Chemeros sanatoriums belonging to Ominais Latvia, which was unable to pay, confirmed "Park Hotel Čemeri", but later, months later the island was recognized as uninitiated because the winner had not paid for the purchase at the time.
The sales price was determined according to the latest undisputed export price - EUR 2.86 million.
As the Agency informed the representative of the City Council of Ieva Aile, the municipality, by signing the Protocol, has confirmed that with the support of the European Union's Structural Funds, there will be an up-to-date infrastructure for the renewal of the historical Khmer Park, the establishment of an interactive nature tourism facility, the establishment of roads and parking spaces.

Former NATO Commander Bridlov emailed Russian hackers.
Hakeri, who interviewed U.S. National Democratic Committee (DNC) computers, may have carried out several other cyber attacks, also denounced former NATO European Commander Philip Brydlova e-mail and the services of the "Open Society" of George Sorosa Institute on Thursday was sent by the Business News Agency "Bloomberg".
Hacker's information was published on "DCLeaks.com".
Among other things, the list and reports on the work of the Soros Institute are also included.
The Hakerem Institute's computers were available for a full year.
According to Bloomberg, these cyber attacks were carried out by the same hackers associated with the Russian specialist, who violated the DNA e-mails.
The Wall Street Journal, on the other hand, reports that the administration of U.S. President Baraka Obama is currently looking at the issue of establishing new sanctions for Russia in response to DNA leaking.
In order to impose sanctions, the administration will have an official cyberattack to the Democratic Party's servers to be accused of hackers supported by Russia or the Russian authorities.
According to the report, the website WikiLeaks published about 20,000 e-mails received from the DNC computer system and of which it is clear that the leaders of the Democratic Party tried to harm party candidate Hilaria Klinton, former senior senator Vermont, Sonny Sandersa in the fight against democratic nominations for the start of the presidential election.
As reported by U.S. press sources, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, which conducts a survey of democracies, as well as other US specialists, believes that Russia’s commitment to cybercrime is undisputed.
Makartnij: The "The Beatles" was threatened by the presence of Joko Ono.
Paul Makartnijs acknowledged that Joko Ono's presence created a sense of the threat of the legendary group "The Beatles".
At 74 years of age, the roszwaigzna is currently enjoying "good" relations with the late John Lenona heritage, but while he was in his group when he was in the study, Makartniy was afraid because Ono was the only woman in the group - George Harrison, Ringo Star, Lenona and Makartnia.
When the speaker asked about both relationships, he said to Rolling Stone magazine, "It's really good."
We're still at risk.
As we entered, she sat on the strengthening floor.
Most groups could not bear it.
We were able to do it, but not all of us were successful because we were very upset.
We were not sexually active, but the girls usually didn’t come up with a record study, so she allowed us to work.
When John began to meet Joko, he did not sit in the control room, but in the middle of the four of us.
The author of the book Yellow Submarine also acknowledged that he now regularly contacted former group members Ringo, and at any time he approved the workplans of the "Apple" study, but otherwise "The Beatles" is "end of work".
The question is whether he still meets another member of the legendary rock group, Makartney said in Rolling Stone magazine: "Not at all."
We are involved in social activities and ballistics.
But at the meetings I don't go either way, I feel very limited about it.
I left Apple during a severe separation.
In my place at the meetings I sent to John Eestman and said, "Let me know what everyone says, because I can't bear sitting on his table."
It was too painful to see her pet die.
The company now works because I'll just listen to all the records.
I am part of the approval process.
NASA climate model: Venus has ever been inhabited on the planet
Based on NASA's latest climate models, Venezuela has once lived on the planet.
Scientists at the NASA Godard Space Research Institute have developed models to study the history of Venezuela using tools and algorithms that also use climate scientists.
The model was designed to determine whether the surface of Venus is hot, where there is no water and where the atmosphere consists almost exclusively of carbon, which once had similar conditions on Earth.
Scientists have already mentioned that the slow pace of the evaporation of Venus is clear with the bloated atmosphere.
But recent simulations show that Venetian once had a plan, an atmosphere similar to Earth, and it turned slowly.
The model also looks at Venezuela's oldest topography.
The planet had a more dry area than on Earth, but it had plenty of water and geographical diversity so that life could be created and water would not be taken away.
In early Venezuela, Saule was 30 percent more relaxed.
In the GISS model simulation, the Venetian heating model reveals that the light part of the day lasts for 2 months, the press religion explained to GISS scientist Antonijs Del Genio.
This process warms the planet’s surface and causes a case that, in turn, produces frequent tears of tears that act as a relief by protecting the planet from Saul’s wrath.
As a result, there is a moderate climate temperature, which is actually some degrees lower than the temperature on Earth today.
The model depicts Veera's history, which is similar to the theory of evolution developed by scientists in their hypothesis.
Although it was once alive, for several billion years Venezuela had been subjected to too much heat and ultraviolet radiation.
Its oceans were burned, and ultraviolet stars were burned.
When the water is completely depleted, the rest of the planet's carbon dioxide atmosphere is left with a deadly greenhouse gas - Venera, which we know today.
Scientists published the results of the new Venezuelan climate model in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Rojs withdrew from "Avalanche" trainer's office
On Thursday, the coach of Colorado "Avalanche" and the vice-president of the hockey operations, Patrick Rojs, presented an explanation as to why there was insufficient impact on the team's decision-making process.
The vice-president of Colorado and general manager Joe Sakiks confirmed this information and informed that the club would immediately start looking for new trainers.
"For the past three years, I have fulfilled my duties in an energetic, demanding and objective manner as the main coach and vice-president of the Kolorado club's hockey operation," said 50-year-old Paradise in his statement.
During this summer I've been thinking a lot about how I could improve the team's delivery to give it the necessary flexibility and achieve the highest level results.
To achieve this, the vice-president's vision of the main trainer and hockey operations must be fully aligned with the organisation's vision.
He should also have the opportunity to influence decisions relating to the provision of the team.
At present these conditions are not met.
The statement, which reached Paradise on 23 May 2013, thanked Roja for her contribution to her team.
The speaker said that Patrick had informed him of his decision today.
We appreciate all that he has done for the good of the organization and want him to do the best he can.
In its first season with the Avalanche team in 2013-2014, Rojs was recognized as the best trainer in the league and received Jack Adams' prize.
He helped the club reach 112 points and the first place in Central Division, but in the first round of the closing game Colorado team won the Minesot hockeyist. Since then, the club has not been involved in the closing games for two years.
"Avalanche" concluded the 2015-2016 season with a result of 39-39-4 and left five points behind the "Wild" team without obtaining a second special invitation from the organizers of the Western Conference.
In his career, Rajs graduated from four Stentilia courses - two with Montreal "Canadiens" and two with "Avalanche".
North Sea oil platform workers start negotiations and leave the line
Staff strands on the remuneration of employees at the North Sea Oil Platforms have been suspended as both parties to the dispute have resumed negotiations, the leaders of the communication negotiations.
Periodically, the Wood Group works on North Sea oil platforms where the Royal Dutch Shell works.
The Joint Notice states that Wood Group and Unit and RMT have agreed to resume the dispute settlement negotiations.
A number of full-day meetings are scheduled for the next week, starting at the beginning of next week with the aim of re-examination of the issue.
The companies reported that their recent measures, which have been organised after more than 25 years, are aimed at a 30 per cent reduction in the planned wages.
The negative market pressure of the Wood Group reduced wages to 9 per cent of North Sea workers this year.
In 2014, the company reduced the wages of land workers by 10 per cent.
The company explains that additional wage reductions would allow the company to survive market collapse.
On the other hand, Shell has already reduced wages for thousands of people and has announced plans to stop oil and natural gas operations in 10 countries in order to optimise its work by preparing a large-scale merger with the British Energy Group.
Energy companies feel pressure due to rising oil prices, and the situation is increasingly difficult for the UK to make the decision to leave the European Union.
At the beginning of the week, Scottish Parliament Member Devis Anderson met with staff representatives to discuss one of the most important issues - North Sea strike plans.
He said that North Sea is vital to the economy of the region.
In his report he explained that the North Sea and the country in general need the economy from which all are benefited, not individuals.
In 2016, the new North Sea projects are intended to invest almost $1.4 billion, compared with $7 billion invested in the last five years.
Keplers measured the speed of the star movement in Plejades.
The most recent Kepler telescope mission has helped astronomers to collect the most complete catalogue of the speed of the constellations in the Pleiades.
New data helps astronomers to understand why stars are at different speeds of this star, as well as how the speed of rotation of stars is related to the formation of planets.
"We hope that by comparing our results with other stars, we will obtain more information on the link between the weight of stars, age and even the history of their solar system," said the release of the Pasadenas Caltech Infrasarkan Process and the Analytical Centre scientist Luisa Rebula.
The moon is 445 light years away from Earth.
Many stars on this planet are only beginning to grow at about 125 million years of age.
They shall be speeded at maximum speed.
With maximum speed, these rising stars emit a large amount of star air.
When the stars enter the magnetic field, they're breaking the stars.
As the stars get older, their rotation rate decreases.
Keplers measure the speed of rotation of each star by setting the time between the known area of stars, e.g. the sun's plane.
The most recent constellation speed catalogue shows that larger stars are slower than smaller stars.
Rebul compares stars with dancers, larger growers make pirates less than small growth dancers.
Rebuls says that the Pleiades "ballet" is seen as the slowest and most massive objects are larger and larger, while the faster ones are very small stars.
Thanks to the proximity of the Pleiades star, it serves as a great space laboratory where stars can be compared to the speeds of rotation.
Rebuls says that the Pleiades star helps to create theoretical models for the rotation of stars in both directions to both older and younger stars.
We still have much to learn, like when and why the speed of the rising stars and their complete stopping process are slowed down.
The Rebuls and his colleagues were thoroughly familiar with the speed analysis of the Pleiades stars in three new publications that will soon be published in the Astronomy Journal.
