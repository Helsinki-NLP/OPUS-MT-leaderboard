I heard you talk to Tom.
Where's your father?
Show me that.
What cheese do you want?
What are Tom's chances?
I hope that's enough.
I saw Tom before he saw me.
Can anyone pick up the phone?
Why isn't Tom happy?
I promise I'll bring her back.
What's in the folder?
We enjoyed playing baseball.
I drank coffee.
Are they for food?
That's a stupid question.
Health and pleasure are good for beauty.
Come with us.

Can you read French?
I think that's true.
Tom took the wrong bus.
Am I wrong?
Our theme of the week is: . . . .
Even wise people are sometimes disappointed.
"This is my first flight, I'm nervous," said Hiroshi.
I guess you're hungry.
Let's have tea at 3:00.
I've read this book.
You've always been a little weird.
Go practice outside.
I can't fix the fridge.
Where's your father?
This book isn't Tom's.
Be very careful with this.
I just want to be able to speak French a little bit better.
What would you do if you were 10 years younger?
Yommy's gonna be a teacher.
I heard Tom and Mary talk about it.
Why don't you put your clothes on?
How do you view his attitude toward us these days?
Is there any more free places?
I think you've done enough.
Tom's taking off his jacket.
Mary threw Tom's eye on him.
There's something important I need to discuss with you.
Let's leave him for another time.
What's the time tomorrow?
I'll clean it up.
She gave me a nice doll.
I haven't seen you since we were students.
You know, it's funny.
Thank you so much!
I don't care what you think.
These bastards don't leave when they're drunk.
I was sentenced.
She kept crying.

I got my room in the hotel and I went to bed right away.
There's something in Tom that I don't like.
I barely understood it.
I'm looking for Tom.
Tom didn't kiss anybody.
Tom's got a card.
I bought it.
I've learned a lot.
I've been working with Tom for three years.
She was tempted to buy the beer.
I don't like anything Tom does.
He doesn't have much to live for.
Tom wanted Mary to learn French.
What did Tom bring with him?
Are we leaving soon?
A man must fulfill his duties.
It's never been on the island.
I think it'll be best.
I'm glad to hear it.
The idea we discussed in class yesterday really attracted my attention.
What would happen if an impenetrable force hit an impenetrable object?
Let's play.
Why did you decide to take care of French?
She's gone from school for five days.
He wants me to continue with the French.
We graduate tomorrow.
Let's hope.
He looked back at me and walked away.
Go get ready to lie down.
It's not a weapon.
It's underpaid with skin.
I didn't know what I was giving up.
Speaking French is a big party.
Have you actually tried?
Hey.
These are Tom's dogs.
I'll give it to you free.
You better not go.
This year's late.
If you don't speak English, the probability of taking a good position is much smaller.
You didn't give me as much rest as you should.
I can find time to help you.
Tom found it.
Tom wasn't very busy.
I've been under five days.
His clothes always smell bad.
I've got a lot of things I need to do.
She's born a boy.
All flowers are beautiful on the day of their wedding.

What's their purpose?
A wonderful idea came to my mind.
My dream is to become a teacher.
Happy Christmas!
Tom didn't want me to leave Mary.
Let's ask her something else.
Ken's good at swimming.
There you are.
The army grabbed the bag from his hand.
Please leave immediately.
Did you smell me sweet?
She was worried she might be late for the train.
Tom and Mary looked at each other and became.
Get in there.
How many is this guy?
Tom locked the door.
I need to get back to work.
Looks like Tom likes his new job.
Trier is the oldest city in Germany.
They're always missing school.

Have you ever been to Nara?
I'm really tired.
I only have ten books.
I'm Tom's new secretary.
Tom speaks French perfectly.
I'm sorry, how much is this?
It's time to judge your past.
Will you be back?
I'm starting to understand it's gonna be impossible.
I've been waiting three days.
He didn't have any idea when he started.
Wet clothes are wrapped around the body.
I'm pretty busy.
Get out of this chair and when you get to the elevator, turn left.
Tom knows I'm home.
Don't let this chance go!
Looks like she's got a lot of friends.
Be careful not to fall.
You're my best friend.
How old is the Eiffel Tower?
We'll settle the matter.
The boy's getting his parents.
If I had a choice, I wouldn't have done that.
Can you meet me with a lawyer who speaks French?
We printed 50 numbers from the invitation.

He's very angry with you.
Can anyone answer my question?
I don't know where yours is.
Does anyone here know French?
He called me a cab.
You're leaving for London next week, aren't you?
He also speaks French.
Tom loves horses.
Why did you decide to take care of French?
You'll need it again.
I'm glad to see her company.
Did you pay your phone bill?
We've done our job, so we can go.
Give your home!
Nothing interesting happens in this little town.
I know someone who speaks French very well.
Happy birthday!
Oh, now I understand.
He was wrong with someone else.
Tom went to see a doctor.
I don't care why.
My shirt's getting worse.
Karen's my heart.
They're not that bad.
There was a little confusion in the room.
Tom sent Kate home.
The rice has to be hungry.
Tom won't be here in time.
What's he doing today?
He's about to be killed.
One glass of water, please.
You scared me.
I have to decide what to do.
I think Tom's doing well.
You don't understand.
I used to get my parents to ignore me.
I'm extremely busy.
I don't speak French well.
He had a picture in his letter.
What are you wearing in your suitcase?
Tom died yesterday.
We're going to Edio and school too.
He'd give me a hand.
I'd like you to translate this document into French.
I think you were right.
Tom was disappointed that he couldn't get into Harvard.
What's your favorite hot drink?
I'm following music at a university in Boston.
Can I get your coat?
I made a plan on our route.
I drank coffee.
He can drive a car.
I thought we could go to the museum together.
Tom's on the wrong bus.
He's reached his goal.
Is that a good French?
You deserve the prize.
Will you teach me some French phrases that I might need?
Are these conditions acceptable to you?
Tom's thirty years old and over.
I paid $30 for that.
Can I get your knife back?
A beautiful woman was born in front of me.
Tom and Mary got married three years after they met.
I don't want him to give up.
Don't say anything to anyone.
I saw you play tennis.
Looks like they got caught up in this again.
I mean it.
Just close your eyes.
She kept her secret for herself.
Is that your chemical?
He disappeared unexpectedly.
I'm sure you're very busy.
I think that should be expected.
This book is in easy French.
I gotta go now.
His wish is finally fulfilled.
Do you want to become a trusted user?
I'm confused.
Why should we help you?
I don't want to go out tonight.
This is where they're serving great food.
Tom, where are you?
I'll learn French this afternoon.
I had difficulties solving this problem.
How long are we gonna take?
They look so much like I don't know who they are.
We've done a lot of bad luck.
Please be patient.
Tom speaks French better than Mary.
Can you recommend any other hotels?
My rain prevented me from coming.
Ken called me every day.
Our departure was delayed.
I don't want Tom to see me naked.
I don't deserve compassion.
Can't you?
They're too small.
He gave me what I needed.
I missed you so much!
As I grew up, I'm gonna marry Tom.
It'll be a start.
How much sugar do you put on?
She seems to have a lot of friends.
It wasn't serious.
Tom threw something on Mary's ear.
You can't speak English, can you?
The trees began to cover with the list.
Look at my fingers.
She speaks English well, but not as much as her brother.
I was really confused.
You didn't eat of the cake I made; your sister ate.
I'd like to ask you a few more questions.
I don't speak French today.
I think this is yours.
Stand up if you like.
Who told you my name was Tom?
That's Tomovo.
I'll come too.
Can I open the window?
Let's ask him.
She's on the diet.
Speak aloud so everyone can hear you.
It's not our fault.
Will you go back to the beach this afternoon?
She's three years older than me.
I don't want to tell Tom I was in Boston.
I admire the culture and fertility of the Germans.
My friends call me Ken.
Tom couldn't find a job.
I don't want Tom to ruin things anymore.
He was the master of the situation.
I've got to read this book.
He's married to the Stuartes.
Everybody's waiting for you.
What he loves is desire.
Tom left his family and became an illegal.
Let's talk in English.
Honestly, honey, I don't care!
When's the last time you go to the beach?
Don't give up.
Because we didn't go to the picnic.
I want Tom to be here with us today.
I'm home.
Should I open the window?
Are you sure you don't want to do this?
I have to get to the hospital.
Let me see that.
The news got us into it.
Are you cold?
I've never been king of anything from Tom.
I need you.
I like listening to classical music.
I agree with his opinion.
Tom can speak French a little bit.
I'm sure Tom won't want to work late.
I was motivated.
I'll find a job.
Do I have the right to join you?
I couldn't find out what you were looking for.
He rarely goes to church.
They understand each other well with their neighbors.
Tom didn't say anything about that?
France is not so hard to learn.
I think you've done enough.
When did you start studying French?
I'll come to you.
No one else suggests to help.
Take your coat.
It was hard for him to breathe.
I'll make you happy.
Let's play something.
What are your goals?
If we just stopped trying to be happy, we'd spend a lot of time together.
I forgot his name.
We're not speeding up.
She's more shy than social.
I got to the garage after the train left.
I've never seen kit alive.
You want to wear my jacket?
I don't want to ask him.
Be brief, please.
That's all Tom's got to do.
I think you should be crazy not to leave.
I've been doing a lot for these people.
I waited so long.
You obviously don't want to do this for me.
Fresh fruits are good for you.
He has a good sense of humor.
He graduated from Tokyo University.
I'm obviously agreeing that you have to move forward in life with your own efforts.
I saw them around.
Tom's a nice man.
It's so expensive.
Christopher Colum's endless achievements are a threat to Google, who doesn't know how to index the infinite when someone's looking for Christopher Columbus.
Please answer in French.
Because of his hard work, he did it.
I've been waiting too long.
Do your kids know French?
I bought a couple of Romanian books for the students.
Are you sure you want to quit?
It's perfect.
I can't afford to buy it.
Where are we going?
I think we need to figure out where Tom is.
I'd like to thank my parents, Tom and Mary.
Are you still happy?
I think you've been here too long.
Did I not interrupt something important?
The patient was getting a little bit better.
I gotta go see Tom.
Tom asked Mary about her family.
Just through my body!
What's the minimum payment in Morocco?
We should've already arrived.
You're hurting me.
Let's go talk in the other room.
I have to go there.
I heard Tom was married.
Tom didn't even know a word in French when he first arrived in France.
Your flight has been cancelled.
I heard you talk to Tom.
Are you sisters?
I thought there was something weird.
Are you living here?
I can't find Tim.
I don't feel left foot.
What's in the kitchen?
I've got a warrant.
I'll come with you.
Please sign here.
My father visited my uncle in the hospital.
That's it.
The soldiers refused to submit to the order.
I heard what happened to Tom.
You must know you're right before the crisis.
I don't have a ticket.
There are no English words in Tatoeba that contain the word "Lego".
Where's your school?
He's got no less than a hundred coins.
I have to find another one.
He's got a test.
Am I invited?
I don't have any evidence for that.
I love the coasters.
He doesn't have children.
The young girl blew her tears.
Are you John?
Your shoes are broken.
I'm lying late at night.
You decided that.
I think you're perfect.
The primary school will be mandatory.
In case of fire, use the stairs.
Are you satisfied, Tom?
I have faith in you.
Mary likes to watch TV.
She's her friend.
We'll be together soon.
She's talking to you.
Why don't you follow me?
Tom and Mary had a medieval wedding.
We always wait patiently for Tom's annual visit.
There's no time.
You love children, don't you?
I thought you didn't like Tom.
I think we need to figure out who Tom's planning to give it to.
Incredible!
That's all you can really do.
It's time for us to get a "dating."
France borders with Italy.
The simple numbers are like life, they're completely logical, but the rules for them can't be discovered, even if you're spending all your time thinking about them.
Her father made her tell him everything.
I worked all the time this week.
It's happening today.
I haven't seen Tom in a month.
Can you recommend any other hotels?
All you have to do is pull the floor.
Have you seen my camera?
I haven't seen Tom for a while.
Show us.
He's got nothing on his plan.
Do good to those who hate you.
I think I'm gonna finish this project.
I'm just looking.
The teacher made him stay after school.
The students didn't remember what they read in this book.
As the last precautionary measure I've filled up and fangs in the front.
I've never had such problems before.
His car's two years old.
I don't think Tom knows French.
It won't be so hard to convince Tom.
Tom bought a gift for his son.
If it were up to me, I wouldn't be interested in it.
I'm not jealous.
I've got some problems with my back.
They're gonna make a party for Sam.
Jane's the secretary of the president.
The doctor took it over the sick boy.
My French knowledge isn't who knows what.
Who owns this car?
You need to be careful.
Look back.
I'm not a traitor.
Tom was accused of Mary's death.
The moon is made of cheese.
Their way of life is different from ours.
I don't want to keep you.
This meat is chicken.
I'm three years older than him.
I think it's okay.
What else is in your pocket?
There was nowhere else I could go.
The man threw her away.
A little too much of you will make me happy.
I can't believe you still trust Tom.
I'm sorry.
We've been waiting for a bad time.
I hear Boston was happy at this time of year.
What's your point?
Neither Tom nor Mary is in the kitchen.
The growing prices feed the consumer's concerns.
I think you'll like it in Boston.
I heard every word.
Tom wore his pajamas and climbed into his bed.
He's not going to make any progress.
I don't like the taste of tomatoes.
The girls from the province like to cut the pink flowers out of the red paper and dress them up on doors and windows.

I had so many things to do that I felt depressed.
We thanked him for his good work.
The airport was closed because of the fog.
Tom's house was damaged by the flooding.
Don't look at me with those sad eyes.
She wants to know who sent the flowers.
You don't deserve much to discuss.
Tom said you'd come.
Honestly, honey, I don't care!
He himself refused to talk to her.
This drawing is beautiful.
He didn't say anything that upset her.
That's too little.
I haven't seen you here before.
Their coming here was wrong.
He was hit by a disaster.
The question now is how.
I like to speak French.
There was a wide range of hearings about the defeat.
It's too short.
Stop coming back to your glorious days or you'll stay there.
I'm not tired at all.
What's the point of coming in time if everyone else is late?
The wind smelled rain directly in my face.
I want eternal life.
Are you sure you want to hear it?
I think you'll stay enough.
It's not a problem.
Did you leave a kiss?
Looks like there's no one at home.
I'm gonna have to give up this request.
So you're just gonna do nothing, right?
What time is it?
Every time Mary smiles at him, Tom feels happy.
He has full trust in traders.
These are the worst shoes I've ever seen.
I want some cheese.
He learns French every day.
I delayed the event.
Your coming here was wrong.
I have one question for you.
Tom's in absolutely safe place.
I have a date with a student.
The flag is China's national treasure.
If you don't, you're dead.
Tom's impulsive.
They won't bother you anymore.

Tom's probably gonna be out of the hospital tomorrow.
So the number of serious and unexpected victims among C++'s programmers each year are caused by segmentation errors.

You've parked in my place.
Mary and Alice are sisters.
I think it was right.
His uncle's gonna take responsibility for him.
What's Tom's address?
Those two rice are made of the same material.
I'm sure that won't happen.
Did you write your home?
I have to decide what my priorities are.
What's your father's name?
Tom didn't recognize Mary.
He's mad at you.
Tell Tom he can't go.
The Christmas is coming.
I'm going to win.
Many of the kids were almost naked.
Tom, I think we should help Mary.
They hired a Hamal Company to transfer things to the new address.
Will you tell me the way to the garage?
Tom wasn't drunk.
This passenger may be of benefit to you on your journey.
Is your watch true?
Give me another chance.
Ken wants a bike.
I like to be interested in gardening.
They've been drinking coffee for more than two hours.
It's an honor to be here.
Anyone here speaking French?
I think Tom should start dating other people, except Mary.
Mary just dropped the train.
Did you see Tom?
I made the first step.
Watch where you're going.
He thinks he's gone.
Tom took off his back and started digging his rice.
Mary is young and beautiful.
What about you?
It's not that simple.
I've never seen you here before.
Tom feels uncomfortable with strangers.
Number to ten.
Tutter's account stopped because of my sleep.
The girls are turned face-to-face.
Please don't.
Start now.
In addition, many groups have been formed so that adults can socialise themselves and remain active participants in American life.
How are you?
What are my other options?
I love hard-fashioned eggs.
I knew what was going on.
Don't forget me.
I heard you were looking for me.
I think I'm going to get to the end despite her inconsistencies.
Not all news can be bad.
We need help.
Don't they speak French?
You both look very young.
I was forced to lie.
This is Tom's favorite camera.
Tom stole my wallet.
Tom didn't have much time.
She herself read all my books.
Tom doesn't make mistakes often.
I'm seeing how confusing this is for you.
She despised him.
You're the boss!
Tom can also speak a little French.
I've got to admit I've been out of my mind.
You don't look so happy to see me.
Can I open a condom?
Learning a foreign language is an interesting thing.
Tom's a believer.
This book is yours.
Sounds interesting.
I've prepared a list.
I don't care anymore.
It's my brother's.
This dress costs money.
Tom's buried his rice.
I don't remember sending the letter.
Why does he look angry?
Tom speaks French.
How hungry are you?
We made them keep quiet.
We're here a little late.
Even if I lose my job, I can stay out of my savings.
It's ours. It's ours.
I have the same number of books as he has.
Yesterday's the fucking rain.
I want to love you forever!
I think you should choose Tom.
I'll give you five bucks.
I think Tom's doing really well.
I'm a teacher.
I'm talking to you as a friend.
They were scared by the news.
My nose's on fire.
I'm as strong as you.
Get in there.
Tom says he's hungry.
I'm an old friend.
Is that your shirt?
Is it possible to fix the bridge?
People lived in the village before.
I want to be a teacher.
You're crazy to buy such a expensive car.
I'm so lonely.
I waited a month.
Please explain the rules to me in the football.
It's a really stupid idea.
It was fun last night.
Are you happy?
Is there any water on Mars?
It's okay.
Tom won't be in the bank at this time.
I don't think you really want to do it.
You seem to have achieved a great success since the last time I saw you.
The garage's in the center of town.
You're not even doing your best to come.
Both are unpredictable and impatient.
So do I.
I don't like how you behave.
What are we doing here?
The object is outside the direction of this investigation.
You've been sitting in my seat.
You're totally right.
You're impossible.
Tom said you were coming.
You need to be careful.
I think we're gonna need Tom's help.
What did you like?
It's gonna be okay.
I almost don't have French books.
Even though I'm old, you're still young.
Let's not forget Tom doesn't understand French.
I'm planning on going there.
A beautiful red coat on my room's front.
I bet you're gonna be a great dad.
Good night!
Someone's got to go to help.
They say you play well on the band.
Are you a hero?
The prices have fallen lately.
When we were talking about travel, were you ever in Australia?
Tom speaks French relatively well.
I thought it was fun.
I've seen other people do it.
There were thirty witnesses.
He cursed her fate.
I found a key under the trigger.
As long as I understand it, they'll agree with us.
You don't have to figure out why if you don't want to come with us.
I saw her clean the room.
How are you today?
I'm really interested.
It's your book.
I heard you talk to Tom.
That's one less problem.
Tom asked Mary to take a toothpaste and a toilet paper from the top.
You have to work hard.
I don't care about this hat.
What's the minimum payment in UAR?
He's on the diet because he's having a mild excess weight.
Are we sure we want to appoint Tom?
You're taking something to drink, you're going on your way with milk to the Swedish table and you're eating like a pig!
These technical terms are from Greek origin.
That's not Tom's problem.
Keep the rockets safe.
When I went home, I saw it again.
Her hair is long.
I put it in your room.
I thought you were serious with Tom.
They won't bother you anymore.
I don't hate it.
I'm not giving lessons.
It's your turn now.
Do you love your mother?
I think you need some rest.
Tom's upset.
I think what Tom did was very stupid.
I wish I could speak French as a language carrier.
I'd like to find my account.
I heard you talk.
We became friends right away.
Tom spent the weekend in his beach house.
Your black one's gone.
You know everything about me.
Let me think a little bit and I'll get in touch with you.
They're interesting people.
Please, call me from time to time.
Tom checked his pants' pockets.
Stick to the facts.
I wanted to talk to you about your evaluations.
No one was hurt.
It's not a literal translation, it's really wrong.
I forgot your number.
How much wheat does this field produce?
I haven't seen you in three years.
Are you sure you want to know?
You can't stop him from drinking.
You're doing very well.
You're right. It's your fault.
Will you give me a fire?
He's drinking his coffee every time.
I don't have any information about Tom.
She found a job as a mechanic.
Leave me alone.
They lied to you.
I have to go ask Tom.
You should've worked harder.
Her powder's sour.
Now that I'm registered, what am I supposed to do?
Clearly, Americans can't even solve their own problems, so how do they at all imagine themselves capable of dealing with the problems of the rest of the world?
Speak clearly so that everyone can hear you.
I've got a needle.
From now on, I'm going to learn French more seriously.
Do you have any other questions?
He was really cold yesterday.
I forgot to give him the message.
I finished American literature in college.
Fuck, I forgot my camera!
We were worried.
I think you'll be happy.
The teenagers left.
I want to be rich.
I'm just starting.
If you need anything, just call me.
Don't forget it's Tom's birthday tomorrow.
I've learned a lot.
She bought a kid's toys.
I didn't get an answer from you.
She cut her hair in front of the mirror.
Tom tried to take his keys with his fingers on his leg.
His teaching method is good and bad.
I heard Tom's version about what happened.

They'll meet at the hotel tomorrow.
I'm sorry, how many are these?
Please do it again.
I think so.
A lot of museums don't work on Monday.
They got Tom in the hospital to wash his stomach because he ate something poison.
Don't make me do it.
You're sitting in my place.
Oh, my God!
Your green one's gone.
I bet you know French.
For dinner Tom took Mary to a restaurant on the shore of the sea.
You don't have to pay for the apartment in advance.
Let's play tennis tonight.
No matter how old you are, you can always learn.
Do you live in Sashayama?
Everything Tom told me would be a lie.
What's the time tomorrow?
Do you have any children?
Don't open those windows.
I always enjoy listening to you sing.
Can you come tomorrow?
The killer could have been stopped.
Don't you think all our politicians are too old?
There's no way we can hide this fact from her.
I don't think you understand the most important thing.
Some say that French is one of the most beautiful languages in the world.
I like making pictures.
I'll pay you.
Do you have a car?
Do you like French wines?
You have to keep your promises.
Tom's sitting on a doll.
The girls were dancing in the living room.
She's convinced her son's still alive.
Do you have any books in French?
I finally stopped in front of the old house and saw another town.
You won't see anything without a fan.
My dad's a little old-fashioned.
I laughed at his joke.
Your answer is correct.
She wrote a letter.
There are many ways to do one thing.
Anyway, where's Tom?
I have to admit I'm crying.
We've been using this insecticide for 2 years.
Come help me.
Are you sure you don't want anything?
My sister lives near Yokohama.
Oh, very bad!
The bus has arrived empty.
We need to continue to help Tom.
My mother's got a good scar.
What day are you usually free?
Tom decided to cancel the meeting.
Tom buried his rice and then put it back.
It's very cold today, isn't it?
You won't be able to help us.
She's popular, but not because she's beautiful, because she's good at everything.
Ken plays football every day.
Tell me again at any time.

What are you asking?
I was convicted.
The train was 500 miles an hour.
She gave me this compact disc.
The director thought about the possibility of releasing Tom, but he decided not to do it.
He's got to wear it.
Tom's sitting in the window.
I don't think you really want to do it.
Most of the students were from the West Coast.
Is it possible that this is love?
I'll get him out of here.
Tom has two kids.
The police don't have to take bribes.
I was on the mountain.
That's what I said.
You're lying, aren't you?
Travelers in southern Germany will see farms with sun panels everywhere and turn their gaze.
Don't look in the box.
You're running.
I heard the phone call.
That's why I can't believe it.
He was angry that no one said anything.
Tom's the only student in our class who can speak French.
I'm sorry I failed your plans.
I'll ask you to translate this report into French.
No one's confused.
They all jumped.
Many merchants were robbed during the holidays.
Why should I learn French?
She's not tall.
It's true!
We thank you for your help.
Since we wear clothes, we don't know each other.
Let's get started.
He visited his uncle yesterday.
Tom's lower than the average growth.
I found the key.
I know that's important.
My grandmother, who lives in Tokyo, sent me a beautiful blouse.
It's delicious.
You have a lot of friends who are worried about you.
I don't have any prayers.
Nathan Tom, I don't know him so well.
Now I'll tell you the truth.
You're drunk.
That part is true.
He's been living here for the last ten years.
I have shoes, but I don't have shoes.
Fuck.
Her name is Kenji.
I got the information you wanted.

This camera is Tom's.
I'm sorry.
I really appreciate your help.
I bought a red tie.
Do you want me to cut it a little bit?
It's a book.
I have to do everything Tom tells me.
You can do it. Come on, I'm with you.
Did Mike stop drinking?
Aren't you glad to see me?
I really couldn't have done without you.
I'm not mad at you. I'm just very disappointed.
Are you sure you don't want me to take you home?
With my younger sister at the same time?
The game was delayed for an unknown time.
His brother taught him a lot.

Did you see Tom?
I want to be taller.

The thieves stole the museum.
He's crazy about you.
He's coming inside to speak French.
Tom helped Mary wear her coat.
That book about caboki can be expensive.
I'm sorry.
Is this book yours?
I've always wanted to learn French.
Are you gonna call Tom, or do you want me to do it?
Don't be afraid of Tom.
He hung on his laps.
What's the minimum wage in England?
Maybe we should tell Tom he's opposed.
What's the minimum payment in New Zealand?
I'm saving him for the price.
You can speak French, right?
My father smokes rarely.
His empty attempts to humiliate her showed him that he had broken his address; she was the mother of two children.
I lost it.
She made the doll for me.
What's in the bottle?
I heard everything he just told you.
We're relatives.
The boss is very upset.
It doesn't change anything.
I have a date with him for lunch.
In the invitation, he said there'd be crackers and no alcohol.
Tom looks pale.
Let this help.
What did you find?
I think we should get out of here.
I've been working with Tom for a long time.
He's much older than Ken.
Where are the souls?
Mike's running very fast yesterday.
Do you have a European health insurance card?
Not one of the balls is yellow.
I know a man you need to meet.
I was rude.
Kuala Lumpur is worth a visit.
I couldn't make them understand me.
And you speak French?
I've just started to learn French, so I'm not very good.
These gloves belong to Tom.
Where's the entrance?
Tom's trying to get an answer from Mary.
One boy, not more than five years old, asked Tom how to get to the post office.

Sometimes we meet them.

I can't take Tom to the bridge.
If I were you, I'd ask you to do this.
The patient was prescribed by the hospital.
My Internet connection's slow.
We have to keep working.
We're gonna be late.
How long do you have to wait?
I'm smarter than you.
I was surprised by her opera song.
You'll find him.
Don't love me.
Who's Tom now?
His concert was very good.
There's another crowd of tourists.
The door's broken and closed.
I'm hungry!
It's easy to talk to Tom.
The brothers around them look completely alike.
Don't argue with Tom.
I didn't understand the smile.
I'm hunting that you know.
It's cold.
Are you sure you don't want us to come with you?
Keep your mouth shut.
Would you repeat that if you loved it?
How much money do you have?
And I was sick.
I got a lot of bad news.
Have you seen the uncensored version?
Given how much time I've been learning French, I should be able to speak it better.
Let me introduce you to Tom.
I have to admit I'm a little nervous.
You want to buy rice?
I think you have the right not to let Tom go.
Tom accepted the invitation to visit Mary's holiday.
You're not the only ones there.
I heard what they said.
This story ends with happiness.
I'm sorry. I'm on my own.
It's done by Tom himself.
You won't believe what people throw away.
I stopped smoking for a year.
You don't wear a lot of luggage when you're traveling.
I got Tom's picture here.
I didn't tell you everything.
It works both.
Tom didn't come here well.
He accused her of lying.
It doesn't make any sense you're crazy, you know she's playing games with you.
George's very excited about his new job.
It was fun.
He gave his camera to his friend.
He has to be given advantage before the others.
I noticed you.
Take it with you.
Wait a minute.
I swim once a week.
I've been waiting for an hour and a half.
He's playing for me in public.
The hole's burning.
Tom worked very hard.
How much money do you need?
And I was sick.
We're in position.
Put it down.
What do you say we have dinner together?
I think he lied to me.
That's amazing.
Where's the bus terminal?
If it wasn't for me, Tom wouldn't be here.
That's the picture I made at Tom's house.
That's not our problem.
I've never spoken French to Tom.
We all agreed that Tom could speak French.
Tom came back inside.
Who's Tom talking to?
I'd like to learn more about museums.
This rice needs to be sent.
You won't believe it.
I'm looking for my house.
I don't feel good.
Why are you early?
He decided to go abroad.
I don't blame you.
I'm a night bird.
I'm glad you think so.
Mary looks like her mother.
You agree with Tom, right?
Do what you want, but I'll stop him if I can.
Maybe you should tell Tom.
I need to trust Tom.
I'm thinking about learning to swim through the vacation.
Where's the beach?
Janets play tonight?
I have the feeling that he won't let me get away so easily.
It'll be 5:30 in a minute.
The school starts at eight and a half.
Tom's home.
The beach's not far from here.
Ken's crossing the wall.
The top of the mountain is covered with snow.
A little too much of you will make me happy.
When are you going?
I'm right behind him.
My best friend is a book.
Right up to the beach there's a really good restaurant that I think you'll like.
What makes you think that?
I'm coming.
He's lost his last train.
I looked at the picture.
You had no choice but to wait for her.
I totally wiped you out of my memory.
I haven't said no yet.
It's not that deep.
I'm not a patient.
Do you mean French?
I've never seen you so nervous.
What's the minimum payment in Lithuania?
Here's the hospital I was born in.
Whoever sees the wind, it'll blow up.
According to the latest census, the country's total population is about 7 million people.
Timely measures will have no effect on drug addiction.
I don't know where I left my keys.
By the way, did you last hear from him?
A death sentence.
I want to talk to you about something else.
Tom can't speak French, can he?
I don't have anything.
At least once he thinks about his head.
I decided you could be hungry.
That's the beginning of a new era.
I need to put my shoes on.
I've been thinking about it a couple times.
You got nothing else?
I think you're amazing.
Why don't you get up?
I'm not the only one who likes Tom.
I finally won his heart.
We should have submitted to their request.
Choose the one you like.
We'll know soon enough.
You look tired, so you're bed early.
That was really stupid.
We'll be together soon.
I don't have anything to offer.
I'm talking to my French staff.
This is my sister's picture.
Tom finds it hard to deal with people like Mary.
I tried them all.
He gave her one advice.
The room was so threatened that I could hardly breathe.
Mary and Jane are cousins.
He must love you.
I lost my wife last year.
Looks like she's a little off of feeling good.
Did the bed go too?
I promise to bring him back.
I have relatives in Boston.
Get out of here!
Tom wears a scarf.
Don't look at me!
Don't be disappointed.
I have to go talk to Tom.
What would you say we study together in the library?
I have a job I have to do.
The proposal for work is still in force.
You miss a button on your rice.
I need to get out for a while.
Your green one's gone.
Press your fingers.
I'd like to buy the car you're selling, but I don't have enough money right now.
Can I see this one?
My uncle gave me this watch.
True friendship is always.
Tom used to work on the open.
Tom pressed down.
Tom and Mary are drunk.
Is he playing tennis yesterday?
You're kidding!
Let's go back.
I'm on my bus.
Tom learns French every day.
They're dealing with kitchen facilities in this store.
I think you made the right choice.
Tom didn't answer it right away.
You're expected to do a good job.
How old is your son?
The girl who works in that bakery is sympathetic.
Please, give me another cup of coffee.
Alice might be coming.
How are you doing?
I've had a good time.
I'll stay until Tuesday.
I don't like artificial flowers.
It's not my fault.
Does any of your team speak French?
Looks like it's gonna start to snow.
I've never seen anything like that before.
Come as soon as you can.
I've never been on top of Fuzzie.
You're not playing golf, are you?
Tom's not working anymore.
It probably doesn't matter.
The lion is the king of the jungle.
Tom jumps.
What's the minimum payment in France?
I forgot her name.
This political problem is causing heated debates.
Eat a live apple every morning and the rest of the day will be nothing worse for you.
Tom won't like to see you.
The unemployment is growing.
I couldn't move last night.
Russia lost 20 million people during World War II.
I didn't want to hurt anyone's feelings.
Nancy smiles.
If you're going to France, you have to warn French.
I understand what you're saying.
I've never had any confidence in Tom.
We're learning French at school.
He himself said so.
I'm sure you're very busy.
Do it now.
I can't tell you what happened.
I think you should give up.
Please be patient.
Your jacket's getting too far.
I've been through a lot today.
Christopher Columbus was drinking unfiltered sea water.
I want to be a French teacher.
I'm glad I don't need that.
Everybody's hungry.
The Japanese have black eyes.
Tom's a professional baseballist.
Tom wanted to be out of line.
I have three children.
Let me sleep another ten minutes.
My uncle gave me a watch.
All horses are animal, but not all animals are horses.
I'm sure Tom doesn't hate you.
Last week I ate pizza every day.
I promise I'll bring him back.
I sent Tom home.
Do you have any dolls?
You're obviously wrong.
His daughter became a good woman.
Are you sure you don't want to come?
Fill it up.
Tom's on his desk, he's writing something.
Do you want some coffee?
I'll call you Tom.
I opened my check account.
He was here at the time.
I put my shoes right away.
He feels uncomfortable with his father's presence.
Your shoes are tied up.
Tom doesn't have to be here.
He took his coat off.
I can swim in the river.
Do you care about French every day?
Don't raise that noise, please.
You're pretty good in French, aren't you?
I'm extremely busy.
No one considered his words important.
That's a strange problem.
I don't understand that.
What place are you living in?
I didn't know what to do.
It's time to eat.
I'm so happy you came.
I haven't made a mistake yet.
Tom's got six.
I did it for you.
I've seen you somewhere.
They're gonna play basketball after school.
Those clothes are good for you.
There was no way I could give up.
That's amazing.
I heard someone coming in.
Are you sure you don't want to come tonight?
Did they go by the bus to the museum?
I need to discuss something personally with you.
He was transported to the helicopter hospital.
When Tom woke up, he found out Mary was gone.
She's the rice.
Are you coming?
Don't interrupt me!
I played with Tony yesterday.
Jill's agreed for Jack.
I wish you luck.
He was home alone.
In the experiential, they end up with "o." A multiple number is formed by adding "j".
Tom wants to become a doctor when he grows up.
Won't I get a hug?
I'm older than any other student of my class.
I'm buying tapes.
We'll need Tom's help.
How high is your brother?
Come to our guests.
Will you tell me something about yourself?
Jane's got serious troubles.
It was a perfect day.
I haven't had a soul in three days.
The triangles don't have four angles.
Are you sure you want to know?
I accept your offer.
What's the minimum payment in Romania?
Brian left the door open.
Tom, wake up.
How are you going to get back?
I'm washing my clothes.
I heard French is a hard language.
I haven't eaten at all.
You'll soon stop thinking about her.
Let me see.
I've seen you do amazing things.
Tom's working for a big firm.
Say hello to your friends.
Let's ask.
Get up and lie down.
Come on, touch it.
That's my job.
Don't touch the ball on the door.
How many years did you learn French?
Carol came back to her hotel.
Do you like that color?
Please, be brief.
I haven't seen him yet.
The mountain is covered with snow.
Let's go.
Damn it, I forgot my camera!
Get off the train.
Mary went out with two at the same time.
There's no memory of Tom.
Give it to me.
Did you manage to finish everything you wanted?
You'll have to wait and see.
I was awake at five o'clock.
I was afraid I might be late.
Tom says he can contact the dead.
Can you stay?
What do you want?
Tom's got too much sugar in his tea.
Don't talk to me now.
What do you want to tell me?
I'm looking for something not so expensive.
Tom's much easier to speak English than French.
I think you'll be surprised.
I'll put more effort next time.
I've done my job already.
He's a hero.
I don't have any requirements.
Her charm is a mixture of joy and goodness.
I should've listened to you.
I've got chestnut hair.
I'll see you in the park.
I've never won before.
There's a little left.
I like this color.
My grandmother was operated in Germany.
I think you should buy this.
I've seen you and Tom.
I don't think it's true.
I got three cameras.
Ask them to call Tom.
We're all sorry about Tom.
I hope I have a chance to get your service back.
Tom stopped the spell to see if there was any chemicals he could use.
This requires careful discussion.
Tom won't believe it.
I have to learn the truth.
I think you should meet Tom.
We got out after the cat.
I'll leave if Tom goes.
I want to be young.
Be more accurate.
Tom's French is really good.
Isn't it time great?
I don't like that.
I don't want to belong to the elite at all.
I've seen you on TV.
You have to learn hard.
I'll be back soon.
I'm asking Tom.
Tom explained things in detail.
Don't let him talk to Tom.
He was playing football with an empty condom.
I think you'll really like it.
Just close your eyes.
I'm a holiday this week.
My French teacher is my age.
You better put a gun under your jacket.
Are you sure you don't want to ask Tom for help?
The new production process has had good results.
That's what his ignorance is about.
You're absolutely right.
Everyone knows his name.
My French is not good at all.
I would never hurt them.
Are those criminals?
Can you take out six out of ten?
I'm too busy to help him.
You can see her in the morning.
Have fun.
We'll get him an apology party.
What club do you belong to?
Asushi may have been sick.
Tom didn't get on the bus.
Some books are worth reading again and again.
We're working together now.
Go back to your place.
He's finished Cambridge in a different way.
I need to get her back tonight.
I have to start getting ready.
Did Tom learn French at school?
What shoes do they make?
We definitely tried to be healthy.
I'll postpone my trip to Scotland until it's warm.
He started justifying himself.
How old are you?
It's okay.
Where did it happen?
Why is he hiding under the table?
Don't make me do it.
How big are your kids?
I'll stay until tomorrow.
Please call the doctor!
I think Tom can share your feelings.
I gave up.
You and half don't know.
That's the picture I made at Tom's house.
She gave him something to eat.
I'm starving!
I'll help you get better at this.
My dad's going to run every morning.
I saw Tom walk through the beach.
My brother became an engineer.
How much money do you want?
Don't get up too fast.
She sold all her chickens.
I didn't say anything.
What are you gonna do?
I really appreciate it.
I knew you'd be busy.
Go on.
It's a big city.
Tom couldn't help Mary.
Kim's dressed very attractive.
Don't want my money.
Tom hates school.
It's okay to create a website, just be careful not to break someone's copyright.
Tom protected his wife.
She's got a beautiful scarf.
The fingers of the hand are five: a thumb, a indicator, a middle finger, a nameless one and a quarter.
The film is made of polyethylene.
I've solved the problem with the cure.
Has anyone noticed this?
She's a little shy.
Are you sure you don't want me to call Tom?
You're young, but I'm very old.
I haven't started yet.
Up-down how much did a taxi get out of there?
You both look very young.
You're totally right.
Is that yours, Tom?
I don't have a lot of English books.
We have time till tomorrow morning.
I like your rice.
Enthusiast began his worthy act of respect.
I saw you on TV.
We went to the museum.
Who cares about me?
At first, his local cowboys laughed at him.
He looks like he's in the hole.
I think you should come and see him.
Tom doesn't speak French as well as Mary.
Be more accurate.
I'm a holiday this week.
You're wearing your hats.
I promise I won't do that again.
I just gave you blood.
He doesn't know French or German.
I'm not a traitor.
Are you sure you don't want to keep it?
I don't doubt his honesty.
Please open the package.
I'm kidding.
I have no idea who he is.
Would you tell me your name if you loved it?
This kind of mistake is inevitable.
I don't speak French at all.
Do you see the game?
This is your home.
The losses were heavy for both sides.
I'll follow your instructions.
He told us a lie.
God gives me happiness.
I want something hot to drink.
Tom tried to convince Mary that it was time for them to leave.
She gets angry every morning.
Don't forget the holiday tonight.
Do you prefer to speak French?
Hey, that's great.
Don't make me look nice.
I don't have any money.
It's nice to eat bread.
I have other plans for Tom.
I couldn't do this without you.
Tom didn't get used to living in town.
Keep Tom under your eye.
Jane's out shopping.
This cake is nice.
I told Tom why I can't go.
The long fields are democracies now.
He's doing very well with the kids.
Come in, please.
We were really having fun.
Tom hates it.
It's true she's dead.
Don't get used to it.
Finally, I stopped fighting snow and time got hot.
She wasn't doing particularly medical stuff she wanted for Christmas.
The students didn't remember what they read in this book.
He's studying French every day.
I heard every word.
Where'd you get your coffee?
Let's go to the movies.
Looks like Tom decided to stay.
Tom won't give up.
Some drugs used properly are useful.
What are we gonna get?
Take care of him in secret.
You make me feel so guilty.
I'm mad at you.
Let's do it.
She gave me permission to use her dictionary.
He's three years older than she is.
Don't hope too much.
What's the price of this card?
Mom, will you give me the toilet paper?
How'd it go?
I think you'll find him.
I was expecting you last night.
Looks like you've changed the whole room.
I'd like to buy the car you're selling, but I don't have enough money right now.
Tom showed Mary several effective ways to learn French.
I'm not good at sports.
The judge sentenced him to death.
That tall man is Mr. Smith.
That was pretty good.
I really didn't expect Tom to succeed.
I found out he's a chemical genius.
It can't be like you're walking around on your own, starting to abuse people.
I had a meeting at 2:30, but I fell in shock and couldn't get to time.
They went to the sea Museum.
Tom makes a lot of effort to improve his French.
It's been a long time since it was empty.
They didn't talk.
I didn't call you a fool.
I speak French today.
Will you tell me what to do?
Are you sure you don't want me to buy you a ticket?
They're not that bad.
I'm careful.
Don't take it inside.
We're all connected.
One word of support when you fall apart is worth more than an hour of praise when you succeed.
Are you sure you don't want me to take you home?
It was over.
His rice was mixed with salt.
Tom found Mary's story interesting.
Mary Tom won't get any help.
You're not gonna be protected anywhere.
She wore a leather coat.
I promise I won't do it anymore.
I made Ankkla.
What are you done, Tom?
I thought you'd be tired.
The story is very interesting to me.
I've read this book.
That was a good year for you.
He was clean.
I can't do this.
I'm a French teacher.
I want to buy Tom a present.
One thing is certain, no one can stop me!
She can speak French.
He's a friendly man.
I was sentenced.
Tom's been told he's got cancer.
Tom got back on the bus.
For me a meeting last night is a better option.
What are you gonna do?
Tom learned French three hours ago.
Raise your hand.
What's this?
It was too easy.
I've been traveling a lot.
Here's the hospital I was born in.
I've never loved biology.
I owe you so much for your kindness.
Let's divide the prize by fifty-five.
Hold my hand.
I'd like to buy the car you're selling, but I don't have enough money right now.
Tell me about Tom.
I think it's better if you go to bed.
I haven't seen Tom since he was born here.
I need to know.
Do you like to travel?
Your plan is broken.
Tom made a big party in his house while his parents were on vacation.
I was forced to leave school.
I just finished my lunch.
I have to go and help Tom.
It happened once.
How long will you have to wait?
Tom's the man who told me when the meeting was going to be.
I appreciate your cooperation.
The soldiers started coming home.
I have a problem, I need your help.
Let's get on the bus.
Are you coming, or are you not?
Tom didn't want Mary to play with his kids.
I forgot to tell him.
Nancy looks so tired.
I really appreciate the offer.
Don't talk about people behind their back.
She's grown up.
Come with me to take a walk.
I'll be glad to see the movie.
Whoever's well prepared, there's no need to worry.
I was having fun watching TV yesterday.
Do you have a hobby, Tom?
These are the trees on which the buried bees live.
Who speaks French better, Tom or Mary?
I got news about Tom.
Are you sure Tom's behind all this?
Please don't let this happen again.
Put me in pain.
I tried everything I knew.
Why are people afraid of her?
He's been fighting hepatitis for six months, but it looks like he's been back soon.
The universe is a waste.
I'm back in Boston.
Where's your father?
How much is the account?
A man came to see me yesterday.
I'll be in the lab.
Can you tell me your room number?
I suspect Tom has no idea what Mary did.
Patients often die simply because they are exposed to their diseases.
I wouldn't think the tofu was so delicious.
Are you jealous?
Who's planning this trip?
What time is it now?
Then what does it mean?
I haven't had my college yet.
He asked you to help him.
I was in Boston only once.
I don't know where yours is.
He could change his mind.
Do you feel guilty?
You think so?
He learned to swim.
Can't you really swim?
New York is a big city.
I'm too weak.
I was hoping I could go back to the beach the next weekend.
I'm running mad at the vendettas.
I can't do it on my own.
Soon you'll be right.
If you tell her about it, then she will tell her best friends, then her best friends will tell her best friends and finally everyone will understand.
She was cold to her.
Tom's talking with the French accent.
I've never seen the rain.
Ken can swim, right?
Tom and Mary went to the moonlight.
I decided it's best not to say anything about it.
I'm not a student.
Are you watching carefully?
A few minutes later, the phone rang.
She wasn't even there.
Jane's from Australia.
Close the door if you like.
Tom finally left.
Tom assumed Mary wouldn't come to the party.
It's the sweetest thing I've ever seen.
I'm not bad.
In this restaurant, food's good.
I don't care about it.
Are they wrong?
You've parked in my place.
I don't know where he is.
They're creating it.
I need to get my son at 2:30.
Sugar is sweet.
Where are you going?
It's a big deal.
The prices have finally fallen.
Tom's an interesting man.
Are you trying to pull me off?
If you're late for the transfer of control, it won't be accepted.
I'm a little busy right now.
Are you worried?
Calm down.
Tom wants more money.
Is this your family?
That was a terrible day.
I don't live with Tom.
Do you still love Tom?
I can't take Tom from the other side of the bridge.
Where are we going?
You can't bother me about that.
I grabbed the cat for the door.
Looks like he'll win.
I think you need a vacation.
It can't be what it looks like.
I think I found something better.
There's been a lot of teeth in this lake.
I understand it very well.
Depends on the context.
Did something change?
I'm not that brave.
He prefers French to German.
You can read French, right?
Fred's often late in an hour.
Don't cry.
Who's hungry?
The girl eats bread.
I like buyers.
I don't know what it is.
I can't buy you this dress.
I heard him down the stairs.
A friend will come to the guest tomorrow.
I hope that's what's gonna happen.
Mrs. Satou may have sent the flowers.
Get us to the center.
The sea was calm.
She's an atheist.
Tom was impatient and nervous.
I need a new USB cable.
You're driving too fast.
Can I trust you?
It's hard to please Tom.
How long are you gonna kiss me?
I think Tom's scared of you.
Why does he run away?
Who's your favorite bird?
You can learn here.
Let me help you.
It'll happen to you!
I'm afraid I touched you.
There's nothing to worry about.
This is my house.
He's lost his life.
I didn't know you were cooking.
Tom didn't pay any attention to Mary.
Put those glasses on if you like.
I heard it was good.
Tom doesn't like that color.
I feel safer here.
I want to be young again.
Tom refused to go.
He's with the Russian hair.
I don't know when he'll be here.
Mary told John the secret.
I'll learn French in the next semester.
Tom won't say a word today.
I'll see you tonight!
I'm done with my money.
I got him some coffee.
Where's your baby girl?
Nothing happens as you thought.
Why don't you want to wear a ring?
Children should be subject to their parents.
Are there any mistakes in this exercise?
Can you come in on Sunday night?
I remember we met before.
I look at him as my best friend.
No one's answered the phone.
I've seen you somewhere before.
You're learning Spanish.
My new bike costs 50,000 yen.
I think you're crazy.
Keep it until later.
They're best friends.
You're a problem.
You're so superficial.
I have wonderful news.
Looks like it's snowing, doesn't it?
That's a long story.
We solved the problem.
Tom knows where Mary was born?
He decided to go there.
I hate her, but I don't know why.
Tom looks objective.
The tunnel fell because of the landslide of the previous day.
I need to talk to you about Tom.
Mary spoke Japanese slowly.
What are you doing all this time?
My uncle never writes letters.
Close the damn door!
We've been playing for him.
John came a week ago.
He rejected the offer.
Oh, I forgot my keys.
I'm sorry, I have a request.
The brusher is a man who sucks the beards and shakes men's hair.
Do you like Mozart's music?
That's my problem.
Is that yours, Tom?
Not all of us are so stupid.
Any problem can be solved if you are patient and patient.
Tom started studying French three years ago.
You have a phone.
How old are you?
Tom's working there.
I'm not her guy.
Are you free tomorrow night?
He lives somewhere.
Tom liked to sing, but no one wanted to hear him sing.
Tom didn't sleep on the ground.
I think we can handle it better.
I think you should think.
I'm not wrong.
I'm the most common office worker.
He was in France.
Don't let this bother you.
Have you ever seen the kangaroo?
Tom can't figure out how to open the box.
I think Tom's serious.
I'll tell them I'm not coming in time.
He often walks to school.
The rats are dying.
When are you gonna get married?
It's phased.
He got off the train.
You're cruel.
How many episodes have you seen?
Her name is known to everyone.
I think you're perfect.
Is that a big difference?
You can make photos outside the museum, but not inside.
Let me go.
You're both cute and cute.
My sister lives in Yokohama.
I think you should do the deal.
It wasn't my intention.
I need to get out of here for a while.
She loves the colors of her technique.
Hey, man, I'm begging you a lot.
She told me I didn't answer the letter.
I'm tired.
Your English is getting better.
It's your turn.
Put another cup of coffee in the bag.
Soon after that, I started to fight.
I have to go back to Boston tomorrow.
They don't want permission.
Tom sent Mary a message written in French.
I'm glad you're satisfied.
When the conversation's over, he says a friendly greeting and wants me to have a nice evening.
Let's check it out.
So far he's doing a good job.
I prepared dinner last night.
Tom can't fix it.
It's hard for me to concentrate today.
Thank you very much for your cooperation.
Who told you my name was that?
Aren't you impressed?
Tom's not here today.
I need to buy one of these.
She herself helped him.
I got a job for Tom.
Where did you throw them?
As usual, the physics teacher is late for an hour.
Let me explain what's right and what's wrong.
I forgot to turn off the lights.
Can I take a picture of you?
"Can I park here?" "No, you can't."
I saw you somewhere.
You've been sitting in my place.
I've already tried this way.
You don't speak French, do you?
I'm ready to order.
Students don't have to use this toilet.
You went into a winning series.
I want to drink something.
I'm afraid that's not possible.
She doesn't have time for another, except to take care of the baby.
It's nice to meet you, too.
The film wasn't as interesting as the book.
Let's go!
I don't want to be worried.
I don't think Tom's number is in the indicator.
Can you do it on your own?
Thank you very much for the detailed explanation.
I'm the only one who knows them.
I'll be there after dinner.
These containers are hermetically closed.
He's the best player in our team.
I've seen you before.
There's none.
I want more information.
Are you carrying a gun?
He says he escaped the danger by repatriating the dead.
Are you home?
Can you tell me what to do?
Watch out for her.
Don't shoot.
Isn't that surprising?
He's friends with everyone he meets.
You need to learn more.
I'm sorry, but I don't believe it.
I just don't understand that.
He's stuck in a house.
I got here later than usual.
We're not disappointed.
She was scared.
I was your mother's first friend.
The quarantine broke our unity.
How much money do I take with me?
Tom's with the French.
I'm falling for such a story.
I'm used to it.
Welcome to Japan.
She's just selling.
Don't forget it's Tom's birthday tomorrow.
"Who are these bastards?" "To my sister."
I think you should call Tom.
She was a high-powered blonde.
I gave Mary a book.
The doctor told him not to eat between the main meals.
Is there any survivors?
The police are stuck at her feet.
We've chosen Jack as president.
This is my friend Tom.
They got along.
Tom's a French teacher.
We're going down to the next garage.
Tom asked Mary to meet him in his office tomorrow.
I've seen you do amazing things.
Tom's with a light skin.
Thank you. That's all.
The engine doesn't want to burn.
I've got it.
Let's go to the secret.
Jessie just accepted the invitation.
Jack Niklson grew up in New Jersey.
Is there a free will?
I'll be there.
I think this is Tom's motorcycle.
I have to go see Tom.
I've spent so much time with my last good surprise.
Let's play Canadian.
I think we've got enough time.
Junko's a nice girl.
Let's have dinner.
I've been waiting so long.
Aren't they cute?
I can't change these plans.
I'll be home soon.
He was on his way to work.
I had a little temperature this morning.
The medicine works.
I can't go anymore.
Tom has a very big nose.
Is that the right direction for the museum?
The school starts at eight and a half.
It happens twice.
Deep breath is healthy.
When was the last time you went to the beach?
We've been wrong about you.
He can't read.
You're doing all right.
The arguments won't solve anything.
Maybe it's a mistake.
I hope this will make it easier to understand the meaning and remember the new words.
I think they know us.
I don't intend to hurt you.
Can you meet me with a doctor who speaks French?
Are you asleep?
Our team was with red flanges.
How about a beach trip?
These dogs are big.
All of you say siren.
Tom won't pay for it.
The rain stopped me from coming out.
When I was your age, we had to walk up the stairs to school, and in both directions.
He'll be busy tomorrow.
I have no idea what I'm doing here.
Nothing more, thank you.
I've already tried.
I think you're working too hard.
He drank a lot yesterday.
That won't help.
Just do what Tom says.
The prisoners were released.
Be careful about this.
I can't see anything.
The meeting was canceled.
You don't have to go.
It was a great day.
How old was he?
That's off!
Tom doesn't see you.
I wrote to my French teacher.
Aren't you coming?
I'll stay for dinner.
I forgot his name.
I think you'll be happy.
Let's not talk about this anymore.
Then where's the problem?
It wasn't that hard.
It's business.
Please close the safe.
She interrupted me.
They're both alive.
I'm too low.
Tom went abroad to learn French.
Tom gave Mary his visit.
I think it's better to stay with Tom.
Tom didn't do it.
That's the job I chose.
I think our gas is over.
Let me tell you something about myself.
We hit the car.
What's the minimum payment in Germany?
We got something for you.
It was hard for him to breathe.
I don't eat pig.
Your coming here was a mistake.
The journalist publishes a profile of his new editor.
The start was broken from the very beginning.
Why don't we get him a bottle of wine?
Five days after she finished, my daughter flew from Osaka airport to Germany.
The boy laughed at the girl.
Please don't touch me.
I saw Tom around here.
I need to get in touch with Tom.
I haven't slept in three days.
Just close your eyes.
Let's make friends.
I just created a new text-processing program with which words can come up again.
I'm sure we need Tom's help.
Please, give me the hat and the suit.
Your love and your connection don't go.
I'll be as young as you.
I was amazed at how well Tom spoke French.
Tom lives a little below the same street where Mary lives.
The new teacher's in the classroom.
Hurry up, or you'll lose your bus.
I think I told you never to go there alone.
I think you'll be impressed.
He's in jail.
I think your answer is right.
I don't speak French as freely as Tom.
It's Mother's Day tomorrow.
Choose the one you like.
At a clear time from here, a man can see Mount Fuji.
Kate felt it.
You're a dreamer.
He told me he was going to France in June.
The company became public and went to the fund exchange in 1990.
Please keep him secret.
They crossed the river.
Tom hit his knee.
They were under heavy taxes.
He learns French every day after dinner.
He agreed for my cousin.
What's in this box?
How much do you owe us?
It's almost Christmas.
The fat red is about five feet long.
Who wants to be a millionaire?
Tom's stuck to his dog.
Can't anything be done?
I have some information.
I love French.
He was our leader.
I'll get it.
The ship transports raw materials from Indonesia.
Here's my sister.
You'll be sorry.
No one in her school is a better dancer than her.
Is there a big house?
He's drinking too much beer.
She's very nervous and she's worried when she's at a party somewhere.
I think Tom's a good name.
As long as I'm alive, you're not gonna be lost by anything.
I heard what happened.
I like your drawing.
I'm telling you, she looks like her mother.
You have to apologize.
How do you know him?
Tom may be offended.
I'll call you tomorrow morning.
I think it's better if you give up.
Parents often make sacrifices to provide good education for their children.
Where are you from?
Looks like your dog's hungry.
You're leaving for London next week, aren't you?
I have plans for tonight.
I wouldn't mind that.
You don't look too surprised.
He's obviously working.
I need to teach Tom about this.
That's a good sign.
Tom jumps through the window.
Let me tell you, it's my fault.
Let me call you.
I gave them some clothes and some food.
You've hit your shoes in the opposite direction.
I'll be early tomorrow.
You like French, don't you?
You can't just break her car.
Tom's not like them.
I left my credit card at home.
It's too hot.
You're running blood.
I just want to be with you.
I want to learn French.
She eats apples.
I think you should check under the couch.
My car was stolen last night.
Tom wasn't at the shop.
Are you good enough?
Why don't you take a cup for every case?
I really want it.
Maybe I'm not right.
Are you done with the breakfast already?
It wasn't my fault.
Read it again.
He arrived earlier than usual.
I talked to him about it on the phone.
I think you're very talented.
The lines were moving almost empty.
They need more research.
That's your responsibility.
Come to our guests.
I have to break my car because one of the tires has fallen.
This rice is a standard size.
Don't play with me.
I put my hand on her shoulder.
From the store to the house, I carried a heavy bag and got myself a ho-o-op-hop.
What languages are they speaking in America?
That's amazing.
When she heard the news, she belonged.
Don't be disappointed.
He did it in the morning.
If you're not satisfied with your service, don't leave your pants behind.
I'll remember tonight.
They don't pay me enough.
I got here early yesterday.
In the last two months, Tom's been permanently moving from place to place.
I think you should go out.
He comes here twice a week.
This school has a strong football team.
How can Tom not like you?
Hetomi seemed very happy.
Are you a subscriber to some magazines?
I'm afraid I won't be able to make the dinner we agreed on.
That's right!
This is probably the key Tom's looking for.
I had to walk there because my car broke.
It's going on.
I have a lot of friends who speak French well.
I felt isolated.
Breathing deep is healthy.
Their house is right against the bus stop.
That's not a bad idea.
The difference in our years is not big.
The box is too heavy for the nose.
Let's vote.
The wounded were brought with a line.
Don't move!
He's crossing his dog Poppy.
There are people I need to talk to.
Tom speaks French a little.
I think you're missing something.
You always sing.
I forgot it in the garage.
I owe him 1,000.
How can I find you?
Nick owes me ten bucks.
I don't want to work under those conditions.
Don't punish Tom for this.
I've never seen you so scared.
Tom noticed three points.
Do you like to walk across the beach?
When are you leaving?
Is there anyone with you?
Tom can't believe what's going on.
Does he have fun last night?
It's right, he's wrong.
They're already here.
You're sitting alone in the kitchen.
I'm bringing her back.
When do I close the art museum?
I was busy this week.
You're from Sweden.
I thought we'd have dinner together.
Overheating him.
Tom teaches sports psychology.
What do you want?
Looks like you've changed the whole room.
They were playing at Jack's story.
The problem is I don't have much money.
I miss you so much.
Car sales suffered deterioration at the end of the financial year.
Whatever I do, she always says she can do better.
He's a football player.
I'm too opposed.
The plane killed the romance on its way.
I'd rather speak French.
I have no idea how it works.
Can you make me laugh at these clothes?
You're so attractive.
I think you're perfect.
The army was supposed to leave.
Your success depends on whether you're going to take the STEP test or not.
I've always wondered if you're coming back.
Tom never talks about his feelings.
He raised his hands.
One coffee if you like.
I haven't heard from Jane since she moved to Tokyo.
He was walking like a hero.
I think you'll be impressed.
He thanked me for coming.
He's less than Tom.
Can you drive?
I can't speak English. I can't speak Spanish.
Someone must have stolen your watch.
Tom grew up speaking French and English.
What are you doing now?
The museum deserves to be visited.
Tom's gonna be missing for a week.
I'm looking for a present for my father.
The problem doesn't deserve a discussion.
It was quite cold.
"For here or for home?" "For here, thank you."
Bob came back too late.
Assassins don't work.
He wants you to do something like that.
Don't worry, you'll be fine.
I invited her to the city.
Anyway, you'll never understand.
Believe it or not, dust and badem are from one family.
Do you want to hear something funny?
There's not enough chairs in the conference room.
I have no idea.
Tom wasn't perfect.
When I was a student at the university, I never slept the night before I tried.
I really want that.
I've learned a lot of Spanish words today and now I know how to say "buza", "bradica" and "cool".
In the winter he sleeps with two rats.
Let's split it up.
I'll turn around.
You can go.
I haven't seen those pictures before.
Tom finds it difficult to deal with such situations.
He doesn't like her.
He's got a strong body.
Are you scared?
Everyone knew Tom could speak French well.
It's Sunday morning.
Tom doesn't see without his glasses.
Are these hungry?
Something's moving down there.
I wouldn't blame you.
Maybe Tom wasn't wrong.
It was over.
I'd like a copy of this report.
Tom's gone crazy.
Sentenced to death.
She spent a lot of days crying for him.
Was he driving with an express train soon?
See if you're not late.
Are you involved?
I heard Tom was hurt.
How many episodes have you seen on One pizza?
I heard they caught Tom's killer.
I've really been doing great.
It's time to go.
Just thinking about the incident I'm running.
I've seen them before.
Why is Tom so angry?
He speaks Japanese well.
The director thinks he doesn't fire Tom.
I'll be with Tom.
"How many holy spirits on your birthday?" "Fifty-six."
The scarves are hand-cuffed.
It's been three days.
Read it again.
The word expresses my feelings.
Tom's got bad news.
Where did Tom say we should go?
Go wake up, Tom.
I just finished doing my home in French.
I'm looking for my chemical.
Let's have dinner.
I'll visit him tomorrow.
This guy was a jerk.
Tom likes to wear white shoes with his sandwiches.
That's in line with my principles.
I don't know why Tom's so angry.
What are the facts?
He asked me to get out.
I'm the one who saved Tom.
I've seen you somewhere.
She translated the letter from Japanese to French.
Am I fired?
Did anyone see you?
The village is far away.
What's wrong with you?
How do you know him?
I forgot.
He's in a pandemic.
I don't know what to do next.
There's no electricity from the morning.
There's a hole in my teeth.
Tom's doing great.
He's really saying good.
I think you're making a mistake.
I've never heard Tom complain before.
They're probably drunk.
I'll show you where you're going.
I don't have personal space.
We got something for you.
I just finished my home in French.
Tom just made it.
I didn't expect Tom to be there.
How old are your cousins?
Your French has improved significantly.
What's in your suitcase?
We'll get married by the end of March.
He raised his hands.
Can I ask you a personal question?
I wish you luck.
I think Tom was trying to warn us about something.
He's married to a nice girl.
I took care of it.
Aren't you interested?
That's something quite different.
His brothers, his sisters, or he himself would go to the garage to meet his father.
I gave up Tom.
He disappeared without a trace.
You were so brave.
When it came to travel, were you ever in Kobe?
I have to go to the market; it'll be in an hour.
Mary's high.
Are you sure you don't want to come?
Can the account be if you like it?
Let's ask her.
I'm changing the train on the other side.
I heard you bothering me.
I'll give you this book.
I don't remember that.
Where'd you get the flowers?
I'm not gonna work here for a long time.
We want our own house.
I have to say it.
The theory should be done.
And Tom and Mary can speak French.
It's personal.
I didn't talk to Tom.
Tom was playing his bike.
Tom wakes up with headaches.
You better not go.
Mike's gonna kiss baby Richard.
I'm planning on studying abroad for a year.
Can you count to one hundred French?
I think you owe me an explanation.
I need to find another one.
You have to leave now.
Snow was on the train.
I feel bad today.
It's so sad to see Tom asking for money on the street after he lost all his money on gambling.
I've never seen anything like that before.
You're not gonna be the only ones there.
Do you understand me?
Do you speak Turkish?
I put it in your room.
No one's home.
He still wants to come.
We need to slow down.
Tom looks great.
What could Tom do there?
I think it's Tom.
That's exactly what I said that could happen.
I was trained in this school.
Good day.
I think that's gonna be interesting.
How long does the switch reach the airport?
Tom thought Mary was unconnected, but she wasn't quite sure.
Go to the park.
She hated him.
Tom's not busy.
Ask an expert.
His behavior was lost because of lack of funds.
I'm sure Tom can't speak French.
Mike was elected president.
Tom's playing football.
She believes her son is still alive.
He'll play baseball tomorrow.
I forgot the PIN code.
I'd like to thank my parents, Tom and Mary.
I wish I had learned French more seriously when I was young.
The aristocracy adheres to the glory of its past.
How many times a day do you fly to Tokyo?
I'm not going to be able to take Tom from the other side of the bridge.
I don't do that.
I've seen this before.
He's in the kitchen.
Is there any questions?
The old man hit Tom's house.
Miracles are called miracles because they don't happen!
It's too big.
What is the minimum wage in Australia?
I just love it.

Who likes you more, the cockroach or the pepsy?

Let's go?
He'll be back soon.

I think Tom's gonna win.
I used to be a nice Ken.
Are you going or not?
I think we should wait.
My parents would have finished eating before I got home.
I forgot the book.
We're eating inside.
Tom couldn't believe what was happening.
My favorite team lost yesterday.
I got drunk.
I'm wearing important news.
They all knew Tom.
Tom and Mary speak French.
I made coffee.
Tom didn't say what he was planning to do.
Tom's over thirty years old.
I heard you talk to Tom.
I'm just a little jealous.
Give it to me!
Tom's always been taken away.
I wouldn't blame you.
That's completely absurd.
How did you figure this out?
Shut up and listen.
The doctors discovered some shocking facts.
I'm glad I met you.
We had no choice but to wait for her.

I didn't even get a letter from her.
I think you need some help.
I think Tom was born in Boston.
Why'd you get out?
Tom told me he knew where Mary lived.
I think you need a dream.
Will you sing?
I don't care what's going to happen.
I need to help my mother.
Tom thinks I'm right.
He learns French in three hours every day.
Do you know him at all?
"I'm not gonna let you hurt my friends!" "I didn't dare hurt your friends."
I slept with two rats in the winter.
Many English words come from Latin.
We met them in the youth community.
I like to write in French.
Tom thought Mary was free, but she wasn't quite sure.
Is she still here?
That's how I knew her personally.
What could have happened to Tom?
It's all right, just like Tom predicted.
Can I sit next to you?
You can walk.
I think what Tom did was very brave.
I'm not gonna be able to take Tom through the bridge.
Why don't they come?

I saw Tom play guitar with his group.
All their efforts were empty.
Oh, my God, I'm late for lessons.
I made a healthy breakfast.

Did you actually try?
We heard from Tom earlier.
I met Tom yesterday.

All the delegates knew they should discuss it.
Thank you again.
I left the door open.
Tom told me good things about you.
This country is Tom's property.
Isn't that your rice?
I think you should listen to Tom.
I don't think anybody's reading me a blog.
Do you still think you're gonna like work?
Let's get it.
I love instrument music.
I barely kept it.
You just dropped the train, didn't you?
I've already written my home.

It's not from me.
I lost my last train.
Aren't you having fun?
I think you're in danger.
I've never been liked because I'm not beautiful.
Which side are you born?
Every time I look for you, you don't.
Of the twenty students only one read the book.
I'll call you back later.
I'm afraid I'm wearing bad news.
Aren't you nervous?
Let's sing some French songs together.
One of his hats was up against him.
I hope it's all over.
The birds sang.
At least it made you happy to see me.
What is the minimum wage in Iceland?
I'm better than you.
You won't believe what I found.
Don't!
Before starting this type of therapy, the patient's wishes should be taken into account.
I think you should call Tom.
Are you sure you want to burn these documents?
I found a note on my desk, but I don't know who it is.
You've got time till midnight.
Your file is with me.
No one's ever telling me anything here.
I gave every single gift.
The museum doesn't work on Sunday.
Your answer is wrong.
She remembers Mr. Black's car.
They put Tom in jail.
My mother feels better.
Tom just got home.
Don't expose him to rain.
They're talking very fast.
What time is it now?
Can I eat this protocol?
Mary loves romantic comedies.
What are they drinking?
Let's get friends.
As far as I know, he must be born in Italy.
"But really?" "Yes, really."
Don't tell anyone.
I'm surprised this building is still standing.
I need to meet Tom.
Although Tom's English sometimes seems pretty good, he doesn't have a clue where his options are being simplified and it's impossible to convince him that he's wrong when he makes a mistake.
Are you John?
America needs you.
You have to decide.
I've seen a lot of tourists on the beach.
I heard you fight Tom.
Are you gonna call me back?
What's your home address?
Outside the dog, the book is man's best friend, inside the dog is too dark to read.
It's not happening.
My mother made me a very sympathetic part.
You need to start now.
It's an old letter.
Are you taking part in some useful public activity?
Do you care?
Apparently Tom was known before he published this album.
The Romans would have had no opportunity to rule the world if they were first required to learn Latin.
I paid $50.
Don't drink that.
I think it's best to get out of here.
Aren't you married?
That's what you always wanted.
I'd like you to translate this document into French.
Tom was fired.
Clear the table now!
Mary's interested in politics.
She won't believe it.
Do you speak Turkish?
Don't hesitate to ask questions.
The bees make honey.
Tom doesn't want to admit he doesn't know how to do it.
Only I know them.
There's a 350-year-old train in this town.
I'm playing a television game.
He was in Japan.
Let's split up with one expense.
Are you still collecting post marks?
My name is Ichiro Tanaka.
Last year, the imports were exported.
You don't have a temperature.
Did someone say that to you?
I'm not afraid of death. I just don't want to be there when it happened.
Don't let him do it.
She wants to know who sent the flowers.
I put my coat on the table.
This is the place.
A woman in a wheelchair is hiding in a supermarket.
This is your last chance to spend some time with Tom.
Can you speak French well?
What would you do for a man like that?
I don't like snow.
Jane was waiting. She washed her back in the tree.
We'll give our best.
Let's get up and talk.
Tom didn't call me.
Tom doesn't like chess.
Those clothes are good for you.
I've learned French for three years.
I think you should get out now.
Please, go.
I thought you didn't like Tom.
Tom looks really happy.
Until yesterday I've never heard Tom speak French.
She's French.
The soldiers are familiar with the dangers.
I know a little French.
Please write your contact address here.
A nice appetite!
I knew you'd find Tom.
We arrived first.
Are you gonna make it?
The police found a body thrown on the coast right away from here.
We all speak French.
The Lord knows best the value of his own life.
I appreciate that you're here to take me.
Check if you've turned off the TV before you're asleep.
And my hands were shaking.
From now on, be more careful.
Tom jumps into cold water.
Are you registered?
If there's no life after death, you better do something about your life.
It's time for you to make things right, Tom.
Let me help you.
Don't let yourself be used.
I think you're the ones who need help.
Corridor's a liar, watch out.
Languages such as Russian, Polish, Czech and Bulgarian have common Slavian roots.
Tom has to do this now.
You don't have to say this to your parents.
Let's say things honestly!
She's the woman I gave her a present.
Let me go alone.
I don't understand what he said.
This is a funny situation.
This country is Tom's.
I think you should meet Tom.
Don't add notes.
No one's got it yet.
You're gonna be my soul!
Many of my friends can speak French.
He played well on the guitar.
Did you play Maincraft?
Nancy's afraid of dogs.
You'll be surprised what people think.
Are you taking any medicines right now?
The tree's burning.
I heard every word you said.
I haven't agreed yet.
I have to admit I'm sorry.
Jack speaks English.
I want to see you.
I'm not jealous.
We arranged to drive.
Can I get your coat?
My dad's gonna make me a delicious goose tomorrow morning.
My TV is broken.
Tom just shut down the phone.
Are you ready?
I won't believe it until I hear from Tom.
Tom can't see you.
I'm hunting for you.
Come see us.
You seem to have had a hard day.
Tom doesn't give up.
But I want you to understand what I'm saying.
I need to talk to you.
I don't believe that at all.
I haven't talked to Tom yet.
Are you involved?
What did you do with the camera?
I kept on filming.
They're working less and less teenagers today.
Why am I still listening to this?
Please don't.
Tom's hair isn't very beautiful, but it's pretty.
Shoichi's face tomorrow.
An electric current can generate magnetic field.
Will he stop you if he includes the radio?
I'm gonna do a lot of things tomorrow.
The bullet was broken by dust and dust.
America is very big.
I heard him stop the car.
Follow her my greetings.
Is your wife a blonde, or is she a blonde?
I'm out. I'm driving my car.
The men took the boy to the hospital.
They were talking too fast to understand what they were saying.
Tom's hurt!
Are you sure Tom knows what to do?
Can we trust her?
That's the camera Tom made the photos with.
Let's watch TV.
He killed that man.
Do good to those who hate you.
I gotta go.
What's the whole story?
Don't beat me.
What are your Christmas plans?
Another bottle of wine, please.
It's time to go to work.
You were given a chance.
Would you put your hands in your pocket?
We found out where he lives.
It's not that deep.
He's a great student.
She wants a divorce.
My new magazine was very interesting.
Maybe we can help Tom.
We went on a journey full of hope.
I'll be here.
Don't touch me.
I think you're really amazing.
I think Tom's hurt.
Tom helped Mary move the hat.
Tell Tom to explain it to you.
What's your relationship with him?
I'm Tom Hunter.
That's a little weird.
Can you do it on your own?
In spring the days are getting longer.
Mary let Tom kiss her.
I've never seen you cry.
Sometimes I hear my father sing in the bathroom.
In Singapore, English is spoken.
I'm eating bread.
That request was rejected.
It was right.
He was tired, and yet he went to help them.
Tom's not going to school next week.
Do what I tell you.
The kids are already dead.
You want to watch a French movie, don't you?
We've been playing for victory.
What's in the coffee?
The hole's burned.
I need to get Tom's money back.
As many books as he has, so do I.
They didn't find Tom.
Are you sure you don't want to wait till tomorrow?
I'll always remember your good.
This smell and I've felt it another time.
Everyone's dying.
I didn't get it.
Give me a kiss.
He hates selling.
I think you're gonna stay enough.
I didn't tell him everything.
I don't want her to give up.
Mary's a booked red.
I think you're capable of everything.
He's against her plan.
I don't think we should.
You're not gonna be alone.
Looks like the dog wants to eat something.
This box is a little harder than it needs.
It's a known mountain.
I could make you happy.
He told me how to get to the museum.
He likes to go fishing.
Is Tom still at school?
Texas is almost twice as large as Japan.
Either you or you!
I hope it's not too late.
His clothes always smell evil.
I think you should listen to me.
I forgot your number.
I was there only once.
Put your jacket on the locker to the door.
Tom lives on three cuts from the beach.
He's a little famous.
I love pizza.
I'll try it again.
Just answer the question.
Leave him for another man.
Tom admitted he was scared.
If you listen a little bit more carefully to what the teacher says, you'll probably understand.
I think you should check under the bed.
The film wasn't as fun as the book.
The job didn't get me.
I think you're perfect.
Every human being is part of the whole, called by us Universe - part limited in time and space. It takes its own thoughts and feelings as something separate from the rest - a sort of optical illusion for its consciousness. This illusion is a proper prison for us, limiting us within our personal desires and attachment to our closest people. Our task must be to be freed from this prison, expanding the circle of our cooperation so as to cover all living creatures and nature throughout the universe and beauty.
No doubt he'll come.
I know it.
Aren't you going?
He arrived in Tokyo yesterday.
Should I complete this form in French?
This local newspaper is published once a week.
I don't know who it is.
It's almost three hours.
I want to know more about you, Tom.
He just became the director.
We're studying French.
I think Tom and Mary like it.
What's this?
Never give your cat a dog's food.
I have problems with French grammar.
I put it through his face.
I'll love you.
You won't believe it.
Do I have to open it all up?
Now it's totally different.
You're always late.
Let's keep going.
The walls were decorated with light coffee.
Betty killed him.
Did you start learning French?
You can't read French, can you?
Your bluzza is very good with this half.
Can't you do something?
Lucy's from America.
Do you really want to work in Boston?
Tom's not lying down.
Are you involved?
It's so big.
Tom just got back from Boston.
Ask me again later.
He's my older brother.
She became famous.
She rejected his invitation.
We pray for peace.
I think you'll be very interested.
I didn't hit you on a stupid one.
He and I are friends.
Our best friend is a doctor.
There's something in Tom that upsets me.
And Tom's two parents were teachers.
Don't play baseball here.
Is Tom living away from here?
Bad time didn't let me go.
She's a nice girl.
Bob's a nice man.
Looks like he's happy.
They got my legs on my feet.
Why is that so funny?
Follow my example and take a glass of wine.
Are you John?
I forbid smoking in my room.
I need to figure out when Tom wants to go.
She's reading the letter.
I've never stolen anything in my life.
He's shooting at me.
Dogs are allowed.
Everyone thinks about changing the world, but no one thinks about changing the world itself.
She wants to get divorced.
You have to learn hard.
Did you accept his invitation?
If you don't want to be alone, I can make you a company.
I heard the shots.
I didn't mean to put you in a bad situation.
Who brought this to you?
When there's a desire, there's a way.
I think Tom made a big mistake.
If you relax and relax, you'll feel a lot better.
Did you finish your lunch?
I have a few old computers.
Tom wondered where she had spent her childhood.
Are you coming, or are you not?
Do you speak Georgian?
And Tom and Mary took out their weapons.
Do cats dream?
Do you know this girl?
I'll call you tomorrow morning.
This is the hotel where Tom usually sits.
Tom got tired.
You better not go.
I know what I want.
Let's go ask her.
We usually speak French.
I'd like a blouse that's coming up on this couch.
I have no idea what Tom said.
He's a kind of star.
I thought Tom might be your boyfriend.
You always complain.
The milk's frozen.
The second lesson is very easy.
I love your name.
We have to protect our children.
I'll stay home.
Take one of these.
What's your relationship with him?
The devil's habit must be forgotten.
My brother told me he wasn't afraid of the dark.
Tom, I really hate him.
The problem was I didn't have anything to tell him.
I think Tom was really having fun.
I wouldn't.
Why don't you take off your coat?
Let's talk seriously about your future.
And I have to make a few calls.
Whatever happens, we'll make them talk.
Would you be so kind to close that window?
The old couple went on a trip around the world.
When I woke up, there was no one at home, and I was left all day long.
My math is my favorite object.
What day do you usually sleep?
Tom came back to take his coat.
I'd better go see what Tom discovered.
Tom's back home. The whole thing is covered with dust.
Did you actually try?
Burya stopped the plane from coming out.
Tell me you have good news.
What browser are you using?
I remember what he said.
What's the minimum payment in your country?
I think you should think about it again.
I missed you so much.
What reader are you going to take - Kindle, Nook or Kobo?
Is this your book, Mike?
I'm basically running every urtician.
The call's been in eight hours.
Mr. Smith is accused of a breach of the contract.
Ken's running faster than you are.
They talked.
Did you sleep, dear?
She's giving birth to twins.
Five glasses are normal, if you like.
I haven't been here a lot.
Be careful.
That's very big.
I think you'll be surprised.
Are you speaking German?
Put on your jacket.
I bought some books from the library.
Get used to it.
Yesterday it became a terrible crime.
He answered the questions correctly.
Put your tourist shoes on and don't waste your time.
Why are you here so early?
If you're judging on your great shadow, you've probably missed most of your beach vacation.
It'll probably be snow tomorrow.
I have no idea who Tom is.
Laura might have been sick.
Tom knows what's really going on.
Tom can resist.
She was perfect.
I have to keep trying.
There was a museum of art in this area before.
I thought your feelings might have changed.
His luck will end sooner or later.
Looks like it's gonna rain tonight.
Ann doesn't have any sisters.
Is it really so hard to speak French?
When was the last time he was traveling by train?
Tom saw it, too.
I'm not trying to pressure you.
You're running.
Don't stay in bed unless you can't spend money on the bed.
Tom has to do this now.
I could make you happy.
Honey, if the food isn't ready by seven o'clock, I'll go to the restaurant.
He let me wait a long time.
I'll be right back.
They made us work all night.
He likes English.
I understand about your party.
They need to change their attitude.
Do you want me to ask you again?
The book is interesting.
She was young.
They're hiding in the garage.
What's the minimum payment in Russia?
He loves me.
Try to figure out when the train's leaving.
You have to deal with French more seriously.
I want to go there again.
It's so stupid of you to say something like that.
They have to pay first.
Do you like music?
He was born and grew up in Tokyo.
I think I'm working.
She waits until the water closes before she makes tea with her.
I think Tom speaks French well.
Tom has to go.
He was very patient.
It's not likely they'll come in this late hour.
The teacher said that in three months, it would make us all speak French without interference.
I caught three fish yesterday.
He goes there every day.
It's been a disaster.
Have you ever heard anyone speak French?
And no one's talking about what I told you.
We want to rent an apartment in town.
I think you should come down here.
We arrived at the train last night.
Tom left, but Mary's still here.
Pick your favorite rocket.
I'll kiss you with tears.
Let's do it for today.
My brother says he's not afraid of the dark.
Save the man, eat the cannibal.
Everything looks fine.
Are you sure you don't want me to help you?
Tom speaks French awfully.
Don't you take credit cards?
Tom's drinking water.
Did he offer you?
Do you want me to help you?
You don't have to go.
Please give me one.
What's Tom afraid of?
You always sing.
I totally forgot about Tom.
I wouldn't be so sure.
My father was on his way to leave when he called.
He asked about you.
Ken never went to Kyoto.
His brain stopped seeing him far away.
Ann's a major.
I'm trying to learn English.
Tom went to the post office to send a letter.
Look carefully at the map of the wall.
Maybe it's not enough.
Don't send me any more notes.
Are you sure you don't want to drive?
I think you'll be very interested.
I haven't seen you for nearly three years.
I haven't had a soul in three days.
I've lost shape.
Bring me one table, please.
It wasn't a stupid idea.
Maybe you'll be happier at another job.
I like your drawing.
That's very important.
Thank you for your work.
You go straight on the road and you're there.
Do as you please.
Some people would probably ask, why don't we just pick up things and get out of Afghanistan?
Eat your coffee if you love it.
I don't have any ammo.
I'd like to get your picture.
Please, get it back.
"What brand is your car?" "Ford is."
I tried to be your friend.
The second cousin of his wife was a member of the Jewish governing body.
Would you help me translate this?
America has enemies.
Did you see Tom?
We'll be back.
Give it back to me!
Say hello to Jimmy from me.
I haven't talked to Tom for three weeks.
Stop sneezing.
I know what Tom's doing here.
I know a man who speaks French well.
I think you've been wrong.
He didn't stop standing awake all night.
You probably already know about our company.
I think you asked enough questions.
Tom doesn't need to know that.
Some people are too impatient to travel by sea.
My plane's gone in six hours.
I don't even know any of the guys.
We're ready to go.
It's a street.
It's really delicious.
As long as I'm alive, you're not gonna be lost by anything.
Maria showed us their home.
I heard steps, but I didn't see anyone.
Is that our problem?
He gave her a letter.
Uncle gave me his car.
I really appreciate that.
Tom put his helmet on.
I've never seen anything like that before.
I have an idea.
I did it myself.
My name is Emily.
There's nothing else to do.
I need to get dressed.
I don't think you understand the most important thing.
I haven't figured that out yet.
I need to talk to Tom.
Last night, the game was exciting.
The broad jackets are the last piece of fashion.
Don't lose.
With little good will from both sides our problems should be allowed.
I don't have much money.
She jumped out of the stairs fast.
The house we used to live in was demolished.
I'll be married next week.
The prices will continue to rise.
We learn French together.
In the gym my French was my favorite subject.
Would you call Tom?
No one knows if he loves her or not.
Get me off this side of the world if you love me.
I think Tom's hiding from Mary.
And I was sick.
Show us.
Why don't you laugh?
Have you ever greeted PfrsichbÃ¤umchen in German?
It's an event.
I'd never hurt them.
I know about this investigation.
Isn't it gonna be good?
I don't know French, but Greek is entirely.
He let himself know it's against the plan.
She can jump high.
Why do I sleep so much?
She answered through tears.
When are you going?
Hanako grew up higher than her mother.
That's quite different.
The elephant is gray.
He's studying French homes.
Don't raise that noise, please.
Did any of you ever see Tom?
I'll go alone.
He's stronger than you.
I'm dangerous.
Show me this list.
That's all Tom has to do.
Our son is married, and we want to fix our heads.
Don't go to that building.
Why isn't Tom at school?
Will you eat this cake?
I worked hard in the last month.
I knew he'd take it.
Don't leave town.
I heard Tom and Mary talk.
We met in London.
Do you have any wine?
This could be a little embarrassing.
Looks like our water's over.
Take what you like.
I have to tell Tom.
That was very personal.
Do they both understand French?
Something was taken.
The green comes to Alice.
We've got three times a week.
They've got the slipper in the cap.
You've been pushed.
You love children, don't you?
I felt isolated.
What do you want?
I'm sorry.
They're late for the storm.
I guess it won't be a problem.
Speak slowly, if you like.
"Where do you live?" "I live in Tokyo."
I'm busy right now.
I feel so bad.
We were soldiers.
Work is not only a necessity but also a pleasure.
We need to be careful.
It's already a dozen.
I run every day.
I think that's Tom.
How was the last weekend, Nancy?
Are you studying French?
I'll call you tomorrow morning.
I'm not crazy.
I need to report this.
I've never been so proud of Tom.
You need to use a deodorant.
When I make up for you, you're the world.
Actually, I'm not sure who Tom is.
There are some things I need to take care of.
I never doubt his honesty.
Don't look at me like that.
I'm not going to get involved in this.
You don't look too surprised.
That's a warning we need to take seriously.
What's the tape saying?
We'd like to eat.
Let's get my jackets.
Tell me a joke.
Tom is used to speaking French whenever possible.
I've seen Tom do amazing things.
The apples are red.
You have good hands.
People as a whole are fighting the war.
Your hair needs to be amputated.
I'm better.
Tom hasn't met me before.
Can I see your driver's book?
This will never end.
Tom teaches me French twice a week.
Why don't you just tell us what's bothering you?
Maybe they have something.
I could make you happy.
Who's hurting you?
We're learning French.
What makes you think that?
You're sitting at my place.
We know who you are.
Do you like black cats?
In school we learn French every day.
Do you believe in miracles?
I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.
Tom looks lonely.
Let me tell you something about myself.
I haven't seen Tom since I was thirty years old.
Her hobby is to collect postmarks.
I don't have anything.
Have you ever thought about this house?
If we were expected to speak more than we were to listen, they would be given two mouths and one ear.
Don't play baseball here.
I'm holding your coat.
Last night we had a great time.
I'll drive to Detroit.
You won't believe how popular Tom became.
Did you do it?
My father used to lead me to baseball games.
Are you brothers?
I felt very uncomfortable because I didn't speak French.
Tom's friend threatened to leave him.
Don't you fear something?
He didn't know anything about him since he left for America.
Now I'm gonna have to deal with this.
I had to wash my hands in my pockets.
I'd never hurt them.
What's your son's name?
I've never seen you so nervous.
He's become a great musician.
I'm counting on you.
Aren't you nervous?
Have you ever heard of your sister?
Everybody's hungry.
She's down the stairs.
I was alone, I learned.
I didn't tell Tom.
I think you're still in love with Tom.
I think it's better to sit down.
Our sales are falling.
I saw Bob this morning.
Bring me something to eat.
If you haven't paid for your neglect, please send the debt and let us get rid of the problem immediately.
It smells like a toilet here.
I'm here for a break.
Looks like you're alone.
The matter is under consideration.
Tom was saved by an accident passer.
The farm's in the center of town.
They're not hungry.
Call me if you need me.
Let's change the subject.
The bar is full of people.
I'm really hungry.
It's very nice of you to get out of your way to help me.
Tom decided Mary's story was interesting.
How about we stop the car and get some rest?
Tom lives in the same part of the city where Mary lives.
Now it's a little after eleven without four.
And the two performances are right.
I haven't seen the darkness yet.
We need to call the police.
I got information about Tom.
I'm sure this book has never been translated into French.
I'll see you again.
I'll try it again.
No one could sleep that night.
Runda's been around five minutes.
He was walking around the country.
The sum of all angles in the triangle is 180 degrees.
I've been working with Tom for a long time.
Mary can speak Japanese.
I need to call Tom.
It's a little cold today.
I'll judge you.
I'm sure you're very busy.
Who let the dogs go?
I don't feel sick.
I can't even read French, and I can't talk about it.
I'll give it all to myself.
I'll come with Tom.
Mike's swimming very well.
Be careful!
I want a boat that will take me away from here.
Let's talk.
Diamonds are the best friends of the girl.
When he was young, his parents died, so his uncle took him.
I saw Tom do the impossible.
I need to warn him.
Where's the garage?
Don't throw anything away.
What's going on up there?
The dog couldn't swim.
Is it safe?
He sleeps like a baby.
You never mentioned how beautiful your sister is.
I'll follow your instructions.
I've got a sharp knife.
You scared the walls, didn't you?
My mother teaches me to arrange flowers.
What a wonderful time!
Don't waste your youth, otherwise you'll regret it.
I think you'll be interested.
But isn't he above the law?
A modern factory is fully automated.
Don't let Tom scare you.
It's hard to get English.
I think you should join us.
Can I open a condom?
I didn't do it on purpose.
I haven't seen Tom lately.
I think Tom's leg is broken.
Tom told me he wanted to live on a lonely beach.
Why did Tom want to learn French?
This is where Tom was born.
Where were you born?
I asked him to send us the book.
I don't know what's going on.
You're all stupid.
They exchange gifts.
I have nothing against myself.
Mr. Cock's Japanese food began to like him.
I put the money in the safe.
Let's go.
Tom heard something.
I hope that's enough.
You have to note this fact.
That's okay.
I was your mother's first boyfriend.
Tom taught me to speak French.
Would you tell me something about yourself?
I think this is very unlikely.
I want to find my account.
I'm sure Tom knows enough French to fix it.
I went to swim in the river.
Mary is Tom's older sister.
I don't know either one or the other guy.
Guests have to start coming soon.
I'm crazy about football.
Looks like it's gonna rain.
It was so nice!
This isn't your house.
I haven't seen anything.
Hey, I just got here.
I'm a hero.
Damn you!
Tom kissed Mary from the edge of the rock.
I hope Tom's right.
Aren't you happy?
Get ready for the worst.
Let's get the heat under the sun.
She's always late for school.
Tom made some mistakes on the control.
It's time for me.
Aren't you happy?
We can take some time.
I thought you might notice.
Let me help you put your coat on.
Watch out, there's a car coming!
She speaks three languages.
What do you think of this powder?
Take it with you.
Now I remember, you don't have to smoke in her car.
Nancy smiles happy.
He's only four minutes from here by train.
What's Tom trying to achieve?
Can anyone believe you?
It's a little fat.
It's better if we go.
Tom said we probably won't take too much time.
What's the real reason you don't want to do it?
Can you keep a secret?
Hey, guys, keep quiet tomorrow!
I would never hurt them.
I learned French.
Can't you stay a little longer?
We stayed in Dorchester.
Are you depressed?
While we were on vacation, a neighbor took care of the cat.
Both Tom's parents were teachers.
The children must listen to their parents.
It's dark today.
Are you living in this neighborhood?
They made us work all day.
I think you're capable of everything.
He returned home after he had been away for ten months.
We'll be in Boston next week.
I've never met Tom before.
I called him yesterday.
Let's start here.
I need to see Tom.
I think you should leave.
I think we were interested in Tom.
I'll get the next bus.
Tom's two times older than Mary.
Mary has two boyfriends.
Kate speaks English very fast.
I'm not so tired.
You have a vein infection.
He started writing a novel.
He's satisfied with the result.
Hurry up and you can get your train.
You won't need that anymore.
Get him back where you got him.
Let's get started.
I fucked you up.
Tom found out Mary was stealing money from the cash in the case.
Give me a drink, please.
Where was this?
I got a little hurt.
We're not sure what happened.
I want something to eat.
So I'm still successful.
Can you do it on your own?
She's exhausted.
Are you so stupid about me?
If you give someone 20 dollars and you never see him again, it's probably worth it.
That's Jane's bag.
Tom always smiles.
Tom doesn't believe in evolution.
Do you think Mary's attractive?
What's the minimum payment in India?
Don't make this decision today.
She didn't have much money.
You've been sitting in my seat.
When did Tom die?
These two rice are made of the same material.
Are you a French teacher?
You don't have to give up English.
It was unfair.
You're wasting your time.
I haven't seen you in a few days.
What's Ken eating?
I went to the hospital.
He did it himself.
Next year we'll be studying in college.
What are you eating, fish or meat?
I made my check.
I thought Tom had a rest day.
Why isn't Tom here?
What does Ken do now?
There's a lot of DNA claims, but there's nothing about DNA.
One of my parents has to go to the meeting.
Thank you for turning your attention to this.
Don't make a mistake in your nose.
The wind was blowing in the rain.
I want something sweet.
I told Tom the truth.
Her great daughter is married.
Tom speaks French much better than any of his fellow students.
Of the twenty students only one read the book.
I got a job on Wednesday.
Where's my grandpa?
The Japanese have the will to trust confirmed authorities.
I went home by train.
I think I can do it in my free time.
Shall we go out?
They call me Bob.
What situation would you do?
What was the name of the one who came out before Tom?
Try it again.
I'd like you to translate this letter into French.
I'm really tired and I want to go to bed early.
Tom's French is very good.
I'm not a philosopher.
She lives in New York.
He's supposed to be the school director.
I bet I'll get there before you.
He was supposed to be a clone.
I don't care about her.
She bought him a dog, but he had an allergy to the dogs and they had to give it to others.
I haven't told you yet, have I?
There was no television or radio in those days.
She went to the cab museum.
Look at your job!
He wrote a letter.
I can't agree with Tom.
These bastards have holes on the fifth.
Tom likes to dance.
You're a good doctor.
You didn't repeat that word any more.
I saw him stop.
She felt that her knees were shaking.
Edison discovered the electric lamp.
Tom asked Mary if she could speak French.
I'll meet him some other time.
He wasn't so strong.
What a strong wind!
This is my CD, isn't it?
I told you not to look for me, Tom.
That's why we're here.
He's out with the group of kids he doesn't need.
It'll be fine if you don't get involved in your personal affairs.
Do you need to go to the mail?
My veins are bleeding every time I use the end of my teeth.
We got here fast because the move wasn't done.
You need to be careful.
What do you miss?
He's back soon from France.
Molly has a big watch.
Tom doesn't help me.
I haven't been in touch with him for a long time.
Those eyes are going away.
What's missing?
Tom opened the box and looked inside.
You don't eat until your understanding goes.
I would never lie to you.
Kate's looking at the dog.
I don't know everything.
I'm never gonna do that again.
Tom won't help us tomorrow.
His friend is an ex-sanator.
Is French harder than English?
I don't care about this pair of shoes.
Are you scared of something?
I have two cousins.
The lists fall through the elevator.
Aren't you gonna do something?
I'm sure Tom doesn't hate you.
We can't slow down the meeting.
Since when did Tom learn French?
He was completely exhausted.
Thank you for coming!
Hi, I'm a little bad.
I'm so embarrassed.
It looks like there's already more than two thousand words of egg in Tatoeb!
Tom's in a hurry.
We can't slow down the collection.
It's a shame I acted like this.
Let's cut through here.
I know it's hard.
Are you the exchange student?
If you need help, ask.
You were always a little weird.
You think you're going to Tokyo tomorrow?
It's time for you to do it.
Don't give Tom your number.
Is it true that Tom and Mary were arrested?
If mankind does not care about the environment, the environment will destroy mankind.
No, thank you.
I felt rejected among these people.
I think you're gonna have a good time tonight.
Don't pick it up yet.
I'm sorry to interrupt you.
The fact that he's too generous is his biggest weakness.
Press the Shift button.
You understand, right?
Jane was always acting like she's very rich.
Tom wasn't the youngest.
I think he's innocent.
Yeah, I know.
I wonder what Tom meant.
It's nothing.
I don't have anything against the hot weather.
I think you need someone to talk to.
I want new visits.
I'm hungry.
Flowers smell like water.
Do you know why I'm here?
Tom wanted to understand why Mary doesn't like him.
See, I told you Tom couldn't swim.
I forgot.
The account, please.
Does the price include breakfast?
Know what he told me.
Salt's over.
She forgot to feed her dog.
This isn't the problem.
Go meet him and temporarily leave this letter.
This cock lately didn't even make any eggs.
I hear Tom stole his car.
We weren't hungry.
The dolphins are very intelligent.
Did I disappoint you?
Wait for me to finish, please.
Tom can't help Mary.
He's very happy that his school life is going well.
Mrs. Young had nothing to do with visiting her unexpectedly.
You have a good mouth.
A lot of people will lose their job because of the collapse of the car industry.
He's coming to my aid.
We're going to start the landing down in Honolulu.
I heard you were looking for me.
Our food's over.
The moment of praise for Hanshin didn't last long, they were soon moved from the first place.
Is there a big house?
Isn't that going to lead to problems?
He's surprised he's called a fool.
Their condition is getting worse.
Do you really want it?
Will he fall into trial?
I can't understand why he didn't tell the truth.
I'm not a student.
What kind of output did they get?
Here we are, finally!
I'm higher than you.
I think it's lucky.
Tom could've lied.
I feel good.
She pressed the button.
I didn't feel well, but I went to work.
Are you really happy?
I know what I want.
I have to move.
He's a famous composer.
Tom put a drink on the kitchen window to get it out.
Happy is the man who gets married for a good wife.
Tom gave me good advice.
He always tells the truth.
I can't live that way anymore.
Oh, how sorry!
Hey, Jimmy.
Is it good for a taste?
Are you going?
I heard what happened.
Of course, she's right.
Don't force me to shoot you.
The equator divides the Earth into two spheres.
It was personal.
Don't you mind?
It's a great pleasure for us to watch baseball games.
I think it's good to get some rest.
When did you start learning French?
She cut her hair in front of the mirror.
I've already done my job.
It wasn't easy.
Do you think it's gonna work today?
You're very brave.
There's a bag at the office.
Where did you throw them?
Tom, how's he gonna deal with the problem?
The thief got out of the money.
I haven't talked to you before, have I?
Tom was late for dinner.
This is the picture of my new house.
I want to sleep.
This camera is Tom's, right?
I sent her a bullet.
I'm smarter than her.
Uncle gave me my watch.
Please, excuse me for the delay.
I felt isolated.
I'm busy.
They're very important.
Are you Japanese?
Nancy looks like my sister.
My friend doesn't know.
I know a man who can speak French well.
Move this powder.
I'd better stay home.
It's not very fun.
The phone's something you can't do without.
A few days ago I contacted them, but I couldn't get an answer.
Why is your mouth open?
My dad's driving very well.
We need to protect our children.
I'll see you later.
I'm completely exhausted.
I'm just looking at things realistic.
I heard you surrounding them.
We know you're not stupid.
Tom didn't like his name.
You never mentioned how beautiful your sister is.
In the summer I think I'm going to France.
Please disassemble the cards carefully.
Get on the bus for Badstrasse and get down to Zetstrasse.
The smile is good for your health!
That's not a mistake.
I guess you're the one Tom they all told me about.
Add this site to "Preced".
When the sun of culture is low, even the jewellery throws a big shadow.
When was the museum opened?
I saw you somewhere.
He's sitting on his dog.
We just cleaned the toilets.
Tom and I have a meeting in the mud.
I'm not going to face the threats.
You're better than me.
Do you have any?
I hope it works.
He's the one who tried it.
I'm from the FBI.
Tom's working for me.
He's getting up late.
Tom's okay.
I'm walking like a penguin.
Don't change the channel.
Watch where you're going.
Can I get your knife?
You have to report by the end of this week.
I haven't seen you for nearly three years.
Are you armed?
I want you to tell me earlier.
Don't look in the camera.
Okay, but we're gonna go anyway.
Tom and Mary didn't speak French.
I did it once.
He didn't listen to my advice.
There were a lot of people on both sides of the street.
Don't make me feel sorry for this.
I thought Tom was gonna pay off.
She's her friend.
His clothes always smell.
I want something to eat.
You never mentioned how beautiful your sister is.
We're like brothers.
I can't even put the water in the bucket, anywhere to store the chicken.
What's the name of this river?
Are you free tonight?
I thought Tom was in love with Mary.
They're covered with ice in the winter.
We're almost out of time for dinner.
I don't want to be your enemy.
I'm a teenager.
I want to go.
Get her back!
I'm not telling you to go alone.
I want a Portuguese juice.
I would never lie to you.
I won't be surprised if Tom left early.
Tom speaks French like French.
I think we should agree.
I'm just buying a soft toilet paper.
I don't have a problem with that.
Where's the ticket case?
I'm really busy.
I think you should go back.
Give me your opinion, please.
I think you'll need this.
I hate flying.
What are the other options?
Bring me something to drink.
Will I die?
I got a little drunk while I was dancing, and I got up on the table.
I believe you.
How many brothers do you have?
I think you'll remember that.
Please turn this into pounds.
I think Tom's lying to us.
Tom's gonna smile more often.
I just want to sit on the beach and die for a week.
I'm hungry.
The bus broke down the wrong way.
Tom has the right to know.
Your wind.
She took a test.
I'll study in the library tomorrow.
I told Tom the truth.
Can't you?
I've met him before.
Tom didn't give up.
Tom didn't give up.
I've made a few mistakes in the test.
This book is not Tom's property.
Where was that?
I need to get him out of here.
Can I do something to help Tom?
You took off your glasses.
You're wasting your time trying to convince him.
She wants to work at the hospital.
Tom's already grown a man.
Let's not lie.
I'm fine.
It's not art, it's vagina with teeth.
I didn't see you.
There's nothing to be ashamed of.
Take one of these.
You're so excited.
Did you hear about him?
She sent the blouse fast.
Is there anyone with you?
The museum is open for visitors.
Do Tom really want to win?
My grandfather loves to read.
Did you know you were wearing different shoes?
He's making a copy.
What color is Tom's car?
You deserve to be happy, honey.
Tom had a single wish.
Please tell the truth.
Tom went out with Mary on Friday night and Alice on Saturday night.
Looks like it's gonna rain.
Tom doesn't speak French as well as Mary.
You can't read French, can you?
That's exactly what I want.
A letter card.
Some of Tom's students speak French very well.
I don't hear anything.
I'd better be sure.
I can't help you.
He got out of the car.
He's been writing to his mother from time to time.
The men are in shape, riding a bike.
It's not the end of history yet.
Don't hurry up.
Tom took the wrong bus.
Let's get some rest under the tree.
You can improve your English if you want.
Bring me a dry cake.
Jim's name is James.
Is there any other hotels you can recommend?
This bike belongs to me.
You're kidding!
There's more research needed.
Are you sure Tom's alone?
You'll never be alone.
Is there a similar expression in French?
Are you talking to me?
You're my best friend.
Anna's a little girl.
Just press your fingers.
I went to the park.
I like playing basketball.
The train arrived in ten minutes late.
She lives in the deep province.
I'm sorry.
I don't like ammo.
You're my best friend.
I organized a meeting.
I didn't tell anyone about us.
It was just stupid.
Are you sure?
Have you ever read any French texts?
Ken wasn't running.
I paid the video for five inputs.
I just want to move with you.
She became twenty-one.
I heard it coming out.
My stomach hurts, Doctor.
You don't understand.
What does that mean?
They're from Sweden.
Watch out when you cross a built-in street!
A man has to work.
That's exciting.
What's your nationality?
That part is good.
Merry Christmas!
Come down.
Mary's in touch.
They're starving for city life.
I'm glad you did it.
The dog was walking around the table.
I'll be in my office.
I think we should call Tom.
It's been between eight and ten hours.
Tom wasn't fat.
We're all friends here.
Are you sure you don't want one?
Tom came with a letter from Judy.
I heard Tom kissed Mary.
I think Tom's gone too easily.
I heard Tom and Mary discuss it.
Let's eat dry.
Throw those hats out if you like.
Please pay more attention to the future.
Tom was caught up in panic access.
Can I open a condom?
He was a baseballist.
Don't say things like that.
He came after you left.
Have you had a meal?
The room's completely covered.
I'm proud of you as a whore.
I'll check on the upstairs floor.
Tom's on his way to first grade.
Don't stay out too late.
I'm taking my rest day tomorrow.
I didn't even say that.
It's better to give than to take.
Can you take this if you like?
Jane wrote the letter himself.
Can you solve this problem?
I think you're getting so much.
You told me that another time.
It's been six years since I started learning English.
I can't buy you that dress.
I'm working like a bee.
Brian got Kate to wait for him.
I forbid you to smoke.
I noticed that Tom usually doesn't lock his door.
Would you help me translate this?
Tom doesn't even understand anything from French.
It's the same hospital where Tom works.
Tom's not that smart.
Why do you want to become a nurse?
Carl seemed very happy.
Linda loves chocolate.
This climate consumes a lot of electricity.
Don't connect to this hunting propaganda.
Tom thought the death penalty should be lifted.
God created man for the first time, and then He made the woman; then He relented towards her, and gave her a cup of water.
I forgot to lock the door.
Do you like it?
Guys, don't raise any noise.
Don't look at them in your eyes.
I'll be back in an hour or something.
Does that look familiar to you?
Take your coat.
What money do you have?
It won't change anything.
The building's almost over.
I thought they were unemployed.
I'd better get busy.
Aoey dances.
Today machines can do a lot of things for people.
He went for a walk.
Please, start now.
I saw your driver's book.
Where's my room?
Tom's suffering from seizures.
Keep digging.
Where's the museum?
"Human folly is endless," I say, and because of this self-criticalness, I think it's an exception.
The storm didn't stop, but it was getting stronger.
Tom made Mary translate the letter into French.
The unemployment is still high.
Tom thought Mary wouldn't come to the party.
I wasn't talking about him.
Is that what Tom would want?
The whole chair's going uphill.
Isn't it embarrassing for you?
I think you should send Tom to Boston.
Ask Tom again.
I want things to be as they were.
Show me.
Tom got his teeth out last week.
The more you run, the more you get tired.
Don't hide how you feel about it.
Is there anything for me?
Can you open my door?
The girl's Irish.
It'll be a challenge.
I'm sure that won't be necessary.
Tom often gets sick.
The key doesn't enter the key.
What's the minimum payment in Italy?
Tom turned on the lamp again.
This is my bike.
I'm not used to eating hot.
Choose what you like.
Go over there and talk to her.
We met at a flight camp.
Don't talk in the classroom.
That's not from me.
When my father found out I was dating Nimrod Nick, he was very angry.
Our teacher made us repeat the word.
Tom died yesterday.
I thought we'd have dinner together.
I think Tom forgot his camera.
I think you'll find out Tom's fault.
She's putting herself in the pool.
Sometimes my money's over.
Don't worry, Mr. President: with so much bad luck, she's barely even IMA teeth.
I haven't seen you here before.
I think Tom's gonna die.
He lives in a quiet little house.
Go back to bed.
Why don't you try your clothes before you buy it?
Tom killed himself by jumping out of a rock.
Where were you born?
These clothes are good for you.
They went straight to their destination.
The boy came in through the window.
I haven't started anything yet.
The account, please.
I thought you'd be happy.
Have you finished your dinner?
I heard Tom gave you your grandpa's cigarette.
Do what you think is right.
Don't you love Tom?
The state pays off.
They're here separately.
Speaking French is fun.
Tom won't succeed.
Get ready for the worst.
I believe the Earth is being watched by foreign intelligence.
Let's go to the beach.
I think it's been a mistake.
My dad's going to the park.
You're not that old.
He gave each of them a prayer.
Don't argue with me.
I think you should let your beard go.
Do you like French?
Looks like they're ignoring us.
What's going on here?
Are you sure you don't want another drink?
Many people share my view on the matter.
The bluzza is clean.
A little tea, please.
I have a stupid question.
He's finished his big beginning at last.
I have to stay here.
He doesn't need to work.
I just dropped the train, didn't I?
The child is not a court that must be completed, but a fire that must be burned.
I think you should see this.
Don't you speak French?
Put the words in the alphabet order.
Tom can speak French much more hungry than I do.
I'll hide in here.
She was worried about her sick husband.
He was playing while he was walking.
I blew the girl out of the crowd.
I could make you happy.
I can't speak English, but I can't speak German.
I don't have insurance.
He finished Yail with honor in 1921.
I think I have a way to save you some time.
My name is Roberto.
I opened the door and kept it open for Mary.
From milk we make cheese and milk.
How many episodes have you seen on One Pice?
I didn't mean it seriously.
I'm a holiday this week.
If a sick woman has thousands of paper wounds, her wish will come true.
I'm surprised this building is still standing.
I don't owe you anything!
The bus driver didn't see the driver.
Why did you leave?
I want my rice back.
I spent my vacation in Hacone.
Look at these documents.
I'd like to translate this into French.
He didn't say a word.
They're drinking tea in the hall.
Tom burned the engine.
What the hell is wrong with you?
Looks like he was a very good athlete.
Give me some milk.
Take 300 grams of rice.
Isn't that what you're doing?
By the way, did you last hear from him?
Your bike is better than mine.
I didn't give you permission to leave.
Are you sure you don't want me to come with you?
Be careful.
How am I supposed to get to the airport?
Who took it?
Money doesn't buy happiness.
We're the guys.
Bad times prevented us from leaving.
Now he's learning French.
Because I didn't know where to go, I asked the bus driver.
Did you get what I sent you?
I'm so busy.
How did you learn to speak French?
Stay there tonight.
You got into a winning series.
I can't comfort you for that.
The distribution of television has left us a great deal of time to read.
I'm gonna need a whole lifetime to explain everything.
Don't get me in the basement.
The new crown virus is very infected.
Every time I look for you, you don't.
You're coming down to the next stop.
Wait a minute.
I'm officially here.
Don't look at Tom directly.
Are you sure Tom's not coming by 2:30?
Tom taught me to serve.
He doesn't believe in God.
All I want is a cup of coffee and a cup of coffee.
I need to fix this.
I'm ready for breakfast.
He's following English literature.
The knife's stupid.
She looked at me a lot.
It's forbidden to smoke in school buildings.
I'm really tired and I want to go to bed early.
We love you more than anything.
Why are you here so early?
Some people can dig well, others are good listeners.
I didn't get the last word.
As rich as she is, she's not happy.
Go see me.
Have you seen my glasses somewhere?
You can meet him.
Close your textbooks.
I hear someone's coming in.
Tom went his father's way.
I've never stolen anything in my life.
Tom turned to me in French.
He can also speak Russian.
Japan has a lot of great paintings.
Do you believe there is a God?
I'm hanging out with the dog tonight.
What's your blood group?
Ten houses were burned.
I shouldn't have let you do it on your own.
Sentenced to death.
I've been waiting for five minutes.
Will you show me your photo album, please?
Tom's house burned.
The greatest happiness in life is to love and be loved.
How heavy is your daughter?
Tom shouldn't have done that.
I'm an atheist.
I never write the words "borch" and "schi" in German!
I went to the market.
Tom was hit by his knees.
I'll come with you back to the hotel.
Give me some milk.
I think she's over forty years old.
Are you wearing the driver's book?
I don't need your help.
He's in front of the door.
My business is getting worse again.
The keys are on the table.
I went to the park.
He reported the police's disaster.
I don't see him.
Do your parents speak French?
I'm afraid we can't talk about promotion now.
You've always been a little weird.
Aren't you scared?
I didn't talk to anyone today except Tom.
I almost can't hear you.
You don't have to go out.
Can you get the light down?
He's drinking on average a lot of coffee.
I'm disappointed he's gone.
You've got your shoes on the contrary.
We just got some information from Kansas about your brother.
I thought I could trust Tom.
I'm studying French.
Does this new model have it on the market?
Do you know Mr. Brown?
Don't expect everyone to like you.
What's going on?
Take care of Tom.
We can't live with 150,000 women a month.
Read it.

Are you sure you don't want to study in my house?
Go back to your bed.

My dog's watching TV too.
Let's go to work.
Are you sure you don't want to come with me?
I'm not wrong.
He's sometimes watching TV.
I have to respect Tom's wishes.
That's pretty extreme.
It's only 30 minutes before the train leaves.
The participants are preparing for the final round of the competition.

I saw his father hit him.

You can't hide from me.
I don't want to be different.
Look how I do it.
We're going to the movies.
He used to go to a movie with her.
You can't smoke in this room.
I heard Tom's membership was over.
I'll be with you if you go do it.

Be more accurate.

No one's gonna understand.
Tom went out to drink every night.
The museum is closed today.
She gave me a rice.
Tom didn't put his neck on.
You think you're funny?
That's how you decided.
Where's the library?
The boy hit all his clothes in his bag.
Bring me the magazines.
She tied it to the table.
I'm young.
The city is big.
He promises me he won't tell anyone.
Are you already in charge?
Will you teach me to speak French?
You're cruel.
Tom's staying tight.
The problem seems much more complicated.
Drinking water.
Don't worry.
Tom's not good at last.
First I have to tell you something.
One coffee, please.
I'm a widow.
Did I have another choice?
He's alone.
In China we lay before the family first and after the name.
Give it to him.
The boy's blodo reminded his father of his outside appearance.
He always gets to write to his mother at least once a week.
He looked right in my eyes.
Don't stop for me.
How are you different?
It's time for us.
Do you love your mother?
They've improved their results.
Don't touch them so much.
Where's the boss?
When can I say that a man has problems with alcohol?
Is there anyone in the garage going to meet me?
I haven't heard that in a few months.

Tom is the man who gave me this bike.
We're not going to fire under the pressure of Tiranina.

I'm giving up.
My eyes are tired.

The staphides are dried up stems.
I was in India.
Coffee break is a tradition in America.
I told you what I know.
They have another plan.
Life is full of opportunities.
We were driving when we changed.
If you want something, don't hesitate to tell me.
Tom wasn't that bad.
I can't find my glasses.
Are you sure you don't want me to wait here with Tom?
You look tired.
He's playing baseball after school.
The sound of a terrible note made him stumble.

That's for Tom.

Don't you speak English?
Tom won't let you pay.
Clear your roots before they're stuck.
I'll be there.
Don't stand too fast.
Why do you know that?
You're a panda.
I just don't want to see you disappointed.
The investment brought him 6%.
Let's have dinner.

This book was easy.
I fixed his radio.
I went to Magistral 58.
I think Tom's scared of you.
Don't let me die here.
I've never seen you so nervous.
I think we should go.
Cut your blouse, please.
I almost forgot it.
Tom can't forget the first time he and Mary got serious.
You're in danger here.
I'll say I did it.
I don't have anything.
If you need help, don't worry about looking for me.
We've managed to get some foreign brands.
I laughed.
It's hard to explain.
We were on our way to Shindjuk.
The police are investigating the case.
You've been drinking since my time.
It was cheaper than I thought.
How's the job going?
I wrote a few songs in French.
Nancy loves music.
The phone's a relief.
Are you selling French newspapers?
Now the service is yours.
I'll be absent tomorrow.
I want something hot to drink.
Tom went there to learn French.
I haven't said yes yet.
I barely got along with the candlelights.
Don't talk to me.
What did you do with your camera?
Tom's very modest.
Thank you for that.
But the baby's nica, the Turkish pancake, go to Vancho, our captain.
I'll contact you as soon as I can.
I want to go to the same school that Tom intends to write.
The condition of the wounded improves.
We've got a lot of lotus lists.
We are firmly convinced that when making statements, the author must avoid subjecting himself to valuable habits, given the use of too many unnecessary words that are, in fact, absolutely out of the light of purpose.
Tom didn't see you.
Tom said, "Get moving," he made a trip and sat down.
I forgot what his name was.
Is Bob right?
I need to know.
When does it end?
I've been seeing blood every time I see it.
Don't!
I thought we'd make it by 2:30.
Tom doesn't think Mary looks like her mother.
I've seen Tom do some pretty remarkable things.
He couldn't pass the test.
Almost all students love English.
God knows what can happen in an hour!
I slept while I was reading a book.
She's late again.
He wasn't so strong.
I'm not a king.
They walked through the crowd.
Bring him in.
I doubt Tom's gonna stay.
It's too expensive!
Good-bye.
I think Tom wants to kill himself.
I don't want to sell my soul.
Tom, I have something to tell you.
The police searched the house and found two kilograms of heroin.
What color is Tom's dog?
Is that close to your house?
Jane's filled one.
I could make you happy.
Why is your French so good?
The fools run where the angels are afraid to walk.
Tom doesn't know anything about Mary.
I've been taking care of sports all my life.
I'll eat here.
I love tennis.
Do you allow me to come in?
Is it hard to learn French?
I've been waiting so long for this to happen.
Come on!
Do you know if Tom can speak French?
I'm very happy.
You don't have to say such things when there's kids around.
He's making it easy.
I want to improve my French appearance.
You won't believe what I've heard.
I'll teach Tom.
Today's train's ten minutes late.
It's been quiet.
Are you completely sure you want to do this?
She didn't like it.
You're teaching French, aren't you?
I have to go see you.
I hope we find Tom.
Even though I know a little French, I think we need to speak English.
She's getting better.
What are you doing on the weekend?
Aren't you nervous?
I need to talk to Tom now.
The shirt doesn't open.
Try to calm down.
We need to conduct an investigation on the date of the test.
Maybe he'll run away from us.
Everyone's dying.
Tom's a monk.
I have faith in you.
I'll listen to your advice.
A few days ago my computer stopped working.
In Japan, almost every family has a living room.
We'll be in Boston next week.
The caravan's flying away.
Will you marry me?
Close your books.
What you're dealing with is the scope of your study, your main interest.
You're cheating.
I'm a little busy.
I thought I'd go say hello to Tom.
I think Tom may be drunk.
I've had a lot of headaches.
Why don't you sleep?
Mark Zuckerberg is an atheist who doesn't believe in it.
There's a little chance I can't get to the meeting.
She always greeted me with a present.
How do I know?
You wouldn't go?
I think you should see this.
He can read very well.
Tom's okay, right?
She's been up for a while in the newspaper.
J.F. Kennedy is buried in the cemetery in Arlington.
I don't give up.
What are you interested in?
I could make you happy.
Carlos jumped the mountain.
He added some sugar to the coffee.
Give me your rice.
I'm not taking any medication.
You'll never be alone.
Does he have a big house?
I'm sorry, I don't have much time.
I couldn't understand his ideas.
He knows how to fill his audience.
He'll get to Hakodate tonight.
I'm not a tourist.
A man has to work.
Hey!
They eat apples.
I got her letter yesterday.
I'm finally very explosive. My favorite football team is the West.
It was easy for me to contact him with the sweet stories.
Tom didn't know what was wrong.
I know you're right.
I need to know what I saw that night.
I learned French for three years with a language carrier.
That's not my car.
If we don't leave soon, we won't get there until there's light.
Tom got hurt.
His room's a mess.
They're part of their free time to take care of the sick.
Are you sure you don't want us to come with you?
I really don't think Tom's planning to go.
Ask Tom.
Let go of the radio.
There'll be three more days left.
We postponed our departure by tomorrow.
Nature doesn't know the limits.
I'm very happy in Georgia.
I'm busy with different things.
I hear you think I'm crazy.
I'm a musician.
I need to know what the truth is.
If John had come, he wouldn't have forced me to come.
You'd better wear a sweater under your jacket.
I thought you'd be tired.
I think you're an idiot.
How hard is it?
I heard you laugh.
I totally wiped it out of my memory.
How can I go?
You can't go into the museum right now.
He insisted on his own, even though I told him not to.
I didn't want to hurt Tom's feelings.
Tom's swimming too fast.
Add this site to "Preced".
That's what I've got to say.
I love my enemies.
I have no idea why.
That's what matters to you.
The worst thing is it wasn't always like that.
All the doctor's efforts were futile and the man almost died.
I noticed you weren't there last night.
The threats threatened us.
You want to buy this half.
He's a great brain surgeon.
I got out last month.
He can speak French too.
Are you leaving?
Let's change the subject.
It was very interesting at school.
They took the library with new books.
I couldn't speak French.
Can I leave now?
Whatever you say, I won't give up.
I've been living in France for the last three years.
I'm much bigger than you.
He only eats fruit.
It wasn't that funny.
Either he or I'm wrong.
You're learning French, aren't you?
The girl used to play alone.
I'm playing in a group.
The birds are asleep.
Tom's done work at 5:00.
Although Tom left home early today, he's late for work.
I'd rather not speak French.
It was terrible, wasn't it?
He looks strong.
That's how you feel.
It'll be time when she'll regret what she said.
Think about it, please.
The best way to predict the future is to discover it.
Did they get to the museum by bus?
Is he your teacher?
Watch out for him.
Be accurate.
What else do you want to read?
There's a golden rule: who has gold, he's setting the rules.
The house is surrounded by spirits.
Tom's going to town.
Everything that isn't forever is always old.
You got hurt again.
Tom got married when he was 30.
I helped Tom do his homework.
Can I help you?
You don't always agree with your boss .
I bought it for $10.
You don't have to go.
Tom lives alone in a big house.
Did you go to the beach with Tom?
I'm sorry.
Did you hear Tom speak French?
It's a nice ride, isn't it?
You really speak French quite well.
Hey, Jimmy.
I heard what you said.
Tom didn't try to hide the truth.
I think you should choose Tom.
Something's going on.
Am I clear?
Many parents worry that their children do not get basic knowledge of the number.
I graduated from philosophy at my university.
Which beach do you like to go to?
You can always share in the work of younger servants.
Maybe that's the problem.
She's a very beautiful girl.
Tom can't do it.
Whatever you do, you can't force a person to believe in something, even less yourself.
I don't feel very good.
The climate doesn't work.
You're sitting on my spot.
Why don't he scare you?
They all agree with you.
Tom encouraged me to learn French.
I want a MP3 player!
Where's Tom hiding?
I'm upset when I think about it.
I paid two dollars of tax.
I think you should check under the bed.
That won't happen again.
Because I did it for you.
Stop or I'll let you know.
We need Tom's help.
She's an atheist.
There's nothing to worry about.
There's something I need to take care of.
I can't accept the invitation because I have another commitment.
When I first met Tom, he couldn't speak French.
I saw Tom do the impossible.
What the hell is this?
Is there anything else I can help you with?
I don't have any intention of leaving that clock for a while, and not talking about breaking up with him at all.
He couldn't get the job.
I think you're gonna be doing great.
Tom wanted to leave, but Mary wanted to stay a little longer.
I think we've got enough food.
I'll be on the next bus.
Mary made eggs sandwiches.
What did you see?
I dug in the summer every morning.
Cover your rice.
Read it again.
I wouldn't be so sure about you.
I think you're crazy.
Unfortunately, I didn't have time for his word.
I prefer the grapefruits before the oranges.
This place deserves a visit at least once.
He kept reading the book.
Are you sure you don't want one?
I like that color.
Just take it.
Her sister laughed at her blouse.
I told you another time, didn't I?
Why do you keep repeating that there's too much time?
I'll visit you tomorrow.
I don't want any gold or silver.
I forgot to close the door.
I'd like a Portuguese juice.
Since I took your book until I left it, I've always been over the joke, and I think I'll start reading it one day.
I tried to argue with Tom.
The fighter's on the round.
And that's what I saw.
The dolphin is a sort of gambler.
What color are these?
He searched his son's frame.
Tom heard something and wondered what it might be.
Tom asked me to stay.
I don't want to be caught.
I don't take drugs.
I'm dying to see Paris.
On Mother's Day, I gave my mother nine flowers.
I think you're absolutely right.
If peace cannot be maintained with honor, he ceases to be peace.
She rented the room with beautiful furniture.
The pocket calculators can buy at the price of chimps, and they need thousands of British children in school, not less than molluscs and rubber.
This is the hospital where Tom was born.
You don't have to wait here.
And Tom and Mary covered their eyes.
That's my baby.
I'll give you all the information you need.
Stop sneezing.
You can't just walk away and commit crimes against people.
Don't open those windows.
I'm not insured.
I'm taking the money back.
She's ready for college.
I think you're really amazing.
Looks like everything Tom wants is money.
I'm not coming with you.
For the cold time when you want to drink something hot, I recommend this type of thermos.
Tom's looking around like a chicken without his head.
Greece is an ancient side.
A few people visited the meeting.
He wore his coat and walked out of the house.
Tatoeba's new site will use a home "hiper" database of data, "founded by the base" search engine, and will go to the Tatoebux-OS server with a tattoo CPU made entirely by the tattoo.
The old man stopped her.
She hated being called a coward.
I like it very much.
I've never voted.
Where's the toilet?
Just go to your room.
I'll be back in time for dinner.
I've completely forgotten.
She gave me a nice present.
Are you coming?
Let's meet at 2:30.
The crown is the symbol of the kings.
I don't intend to apologize to Tom.
What are you doing?
During my vacation I read all Milton's work.
What are you gonna recommend?
I'm sure Tom hasn't even noticed that you're late.
I'll meet him at the bus stop.
Each student was asked one question.
Are you sure you want me to sell it?
I'm really worried about your future.
Tom wasn't asleep.
I haven't seen you around here before.
It's very hot today.
Don't be quick to protect me.
Who's the capital of Greece?
Tom can't speak French, and Mary can't speak French either.
I first met her in London.
Can Tom come tomorrow?
Look where you're going.
They described the girl as a little bit.
Tom didn't get used to urban life.
Keep your promise.
I forgot about that.
I think you're making too much sugar.
Do you like Mexican food?
I'll take you home.
Man is the only animal using fire.
All the flowers in the garden got stuck.
They made us work all day.
We've chosen him as president.
Without a mask?
I've seen these pictures.
If I hadn't noticed, I'd have told you.
What's the minimum payment in Luxembourg?
His judgment is predetermined.
Are these the candles?
If you have to choose between a drink and a cigarette, what would you choose?
The answer's true.
I think that's great.
Did he pass the test?
Don't get out of the bus.
Be careful not to break Tom's heart.
We went there in a week.
It's all right.
This kind of thing is scary.
I think it's better to sleep.
I like you very much.
I called the phone.
The waves are moving to the gluten.
Do you have any medical insurance?
Watch out, Tom!
The museum is closed on Sunday.
I've been teaching Russian for three years.
We're married to each other.
Tom won't quit.
It'll cost about 10,000.
Tom speaks French as well as Mary.
How hungry are you?
That guy's stable.
I didn't make it for a while.
That wasn't my fault.
Did you cut the paper?
I don't care what's going to happen.
I saw you with Tom.
Tom's my friend.
You're coming to this wrong way.
Something's going on.
Fill it up.
We have a little chance of success.
Let's go ask her.
I can only wonder if this is the same for everyone else.
Are you sure you want to throw it away?
Tom speaks French.
The situation has improved, and we feel better about what it was.
I've played you.
His hat was great.
The police will investigate the crime.
The stories you will read in this book are dealing with some of the many problems young people have faced.
We finally saw each other. I've been waiting a long time for this moment.
Can you explain in a little bit more detail?
Is it wrong?
Tom didn't want Mary to hold his hand.
I think we should study things.
So we all agree.
If time allows, I'll go to the museum.
That connection is really good for you.
I think you're gonna be a great father.
There's no way you can get in touch with him.
Never give up, never give up.
Would you show me that bag?
That's my computer.
Bern is the capital of Switzerland.
You won't believe me.
Can you come at nine?
Let's sync the clocks.
I'm shopping every morning.
I wish I could speak French like you.
Please don't do it.
Is this a safe store?
I'm looking for a gift for my friend.
And if I told you, please.
That's the camera Tom made the photos with.
Make sure you don't lose.
I'm forced to change my plans every time you decide you want something else.
It looks like a man far away.
We worked well to connect the two ends.
Good morning.
John's grandmother died after a long illness.
I need to rest.
She said she wasn't going to freeze and push, no matter who she says.
I don't even know how old Tom is.
The defendant was given the right to appeal.
Let's not hurry.
My father went for a fish.
They didn't offer me anything to eat.
You don't have to make quick outputs.
Don't worry.
He gave up.
The wine is the milk of the adults.
Tom opens the windows every morning as soon as he gets into his office.
I can't work with you if you don't trust me.
That was years ago.
I'm dreaming nightmares.
When Tom woke up, he found out Mary was gone.
I've seen these pictures.
I'm as strong as you.
I've never been to Europe.
I'm unemployed.
Why don't we get a cab?
I hope I'm not late.
I came home with the train.
Why are you always so bad?
Hey!
That's why you didn't want to come with me?
Did you decide what you wanted to order?
I locked up the boy's deep sleep.
She called him as if he didn't.
Are we able to do this?
My sister's name is Patricia.
I should've opened my suitcase.
We discussed whether we should cancel the reservation.
The kids thought their parents were made of money.
The plumbers were caught in the cold.
It's allowed for dogs.
