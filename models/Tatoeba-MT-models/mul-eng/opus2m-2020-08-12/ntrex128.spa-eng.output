Members of the Assembly (AM, by their signs) of Wales are concerned about "the appearance of muppets"
Some Members of the Assembly are disappointed by the suggestion that their title should be changed to Members of the Gales Parliament (MWP).
This confusion arises from plans to change the name of the Assembly to the House of Gales.
Members of the Assembly of all political spectrum are concerned that this can be ridiculous.
A member of the Labour Party Assembly stated that his group was concerned "that Twp and Pwp remain."
For outside Gales readers: In Galese, twp means tonto and pwp means cat.
A member of the Gales Party Assembly commented that the entire group was "disgruntled" and suggested alternatives.
A member of the Gales Conservative Party stated that his group was "open" to the change of name, but noted that the MWP speech jump to muppet was small.
In this context, the wording of the letter w in Gale is similar to that of the letter or in the English of Yorkshire.
The Committee of the Assembly, which is currently preparing legislation to introduce the change of name, declares: "Of course, the final decision on any descriptive element of the name of the members of the Assembly will be subject to the members themselves."
The Law of 2017 of the Government of Wales granted the Assembly of Wales the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals which revealed broad support for calling the Gales Parliament to the Assembly.
On the issue of the title of members of the Assembly, the Commission preferred Members of the Wales Parliament (or WMP), but the MWP option received most support in a public consultation.
It appears that the members of the Assembly are proposing alternative options, but the struggle to reach consensus could lead to the President of the Assembly, Elin Jones, who should send the draft law on changes in a few weeks.
The reform legislation will include other changes related to the functioning of the Assembly, such as rules on the incapacity of members of the Assembly and the design of the system of committees.
Members of the Assembly will have the last word on the question of how they should be called when deliberating on legislation.
Macedonians call on the Urs to vote for a referendum on the change in country name
The voters will vote on Sunday about whether the name of their country will be changed to "Northern Republic of Macedonia".
The popular vote was called upon in an attempt to resolve a decades-old conflict with the neighbouring country, Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has always insisted that the name of its northern neighbour is a claim from its territory and has repeatedly opposed its application for EU and NATO membership.
The President of Macedonia, Gjorge Ivanov, who is opposed to the plebiscite on the change of name, has stated that it will take place without the vote.
However, the parties to the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, maintain that the change of name is simply the price to be paid to join the EU and NATO.
San Martín's campaigns keep quiet because of the difficulties of Harlem's churches
" Historically, the older people I've talked to say there was a bar and a church in every corner," commented Mr. Adams.
"Today, there's nothing else."
He noted that the disappearance of the bars was understandable.
"Now socialize people in another way," he says.
"The bars are no longer the rooms to be from the neighborhoods to which the neighbors regularly go."
With regard to the churches, he is concerned that the money obtained from the sale of goods will not last as long as the leaders expect and that "before or after, they will return to the starting point".
The churches, he added, could be replaced by apartments full of people who will not help the saints who are in the neighborhood.
"The vast majority of people buying apartments in these buildings will be white people," he said, "and, therefore, will speed up the closure of these churches, since it is unlikely that most people who move to these apartments will end up being members of these churches."
The two churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis: the Metropolitan Community in 1870 and San Martin a decade later.
The original white-medium congregation was in the 30th century.
A black congregation that rendered worship near the hall purchased the building.
A black congregation took San Martín's rents under the direction of Reverent John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott to street merchants 125, a main shopping street in Harlem, who refused to hire or promote black people.
In 1939, a fire left the building severely damaged and while Father Johnson's lucky men planned for his reconstruction, they also carried the trailer.
The King David Johnson, son and successor of Father Johnson in San Martin, proudly named him "the campaigns of the poor".
In July, the expert who played the chariot called "a cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
In addition, the expert, Tiffany Ng, of Michigan University, noted that it was the world's first carillon used by a black musician, Dionysio A. Lind, who was to play the major Riverside Church carillon 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather commented that San Martin did not replace it.
What has happened in San Martín in recent months has been a complicated history of architects and contractors, some brought by the lay church leaders and others by the Episcopal Diocese.
The parishionerial board, the leading body of the parish, composed of lay leaders, wrote to the diocese in July, expressing its concern that the diocese "will attempt to pass costs" to the council, although it had not participated in the recruitment of architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some happy people complained about the lack of transparency by diocese.
Tiburón goes to a 13-year-old boy who's been looking for toys in California
A tiger attacked and raped a 13-year-old boy on Saturday while he was in search of nests in California on the day the nesting season was opened, according to the authorities.
The attack took place shortly before the 7th of the morning near Beacon's Beach, in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel informed San Diego's KSWB-TV channel that he had been having lunch with friends for half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the child asking for help, so he approached a group to get him out of the water.
Hammel commented that at first he thought he was so excited that he had caught a nest, but then he noticed that "it was crying that they had killed him.
%s, Free space: %s,
I had the broken key," Hammel observed when he came to the child.
"I cried to everyone who came out of the water because there was a tiger," Hammel added.
The child was transported by helicopter to Rady Children's Hospital, where he is in critical condition.
The type of tuberculosis responsible for the attack is unknown.
The co-rapporteur, Captain Larry Giles, commented in a press show that a tiger had been warned in the area a few weeks ago, but that it had not been considered a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim showed traumatic injuries in the upper torso area.
The authorities closed access to the beach from Ponto Beach, Casablad, to Swami Beach, Encinitas, for 48 hours to investigate and for security reasons.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 tiger species in the area, but that most are not considered dangerous.
Saninsbury's plans promote the United Kingdom beauty market
Saninsbury's acquires Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams, which have many employees specializing in their style and beauty facilities.
In order to significantly promote the United Kingdom's beauty market, estimated at 2800 billion pounds and with an increase that is increasing compared to the decline in sales in fashion and household management, the largest beauty passports will be tested in 11 shops throughout the country and, if they are successful, the same will be done in larger shops next year.
The investment in beauty comes at the same time as this chain of supermarkets seeks ways to use space in stalls that are used to televisions, microns and home management.
Sanisbury's stated that he would double his offer of beauty with up to 3000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
In addition, there will be more space for the existing ranges of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees, with areas similar to those of other facilities, such as Boots.
The chain will also launch its Boutique makeup range with a majority of respectable products with animals, something more demanding by younger customers.
In the perfumery The Fragrance Shop will also prove its concessions in two Saninsbury's establishments, the first recently opened in Croydon, south of London, last week. The second will open in Selly Oak, in Birmingham, later this year.
Online shops and the change to the daily purchase of small quantities of food in local stores force supermarkets to strive to convince people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, executive director of Saninsbury's, has said that shops will increasingly look like shopping centers while the supermarket chain tries to fight Aldi and Lidl discounts by offering more services and products that are not food.
Saninsbury's has integrated points of sale of Argos discounts into hundreds of establishments and has introduced several Habitats since their purchase of these chains two years ago. This has been considered to have prompted sales of food and has made these purchases more profitable.
The previous attempt by the supermarket chain to renew its beauty and pharmaceutical departments was a failure.
Saninsbury's failed a joint operation with Boots in early 2000, but collaboration ended after a discussion on how to divide the incomes from pharmaceutical sales points into their supermarkets.
The new strategy is based on the sale of 281 plants for pharmaceutical products from Sanisbury to Celesio, owned by the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for 125 million pounds three years ago.
It is noted that Lloyds will participate in the plan by adding an extended range of luxury brands for skin care, such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four shops.
As Paul Mills-Hicks, trade director of Sanisbury's, commented: "We have transformed the aspect and environment of our beauty passports so that they can enhance the environment for our customers.
In addition, we have invested in a specialized staff that will be available to provide advice.
Our brand offer is designed to adapt to all needs. On the other hand, an attractive environment and a comfortable location makes us an irresistable destination of beauty products, challenging the old way to buy."
Peter Jones is "heavy" after Holly Willoughby broke an agreement of 11 million pounds
Peter Jones, the Dragon's Den star, was "heavy" after the television presenter Holly Willoughby broke an agreement of 11 million pounds with its life-style business line to focus on their new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time to dedicate to the fashion brand and Truly plugins.
This business had compared to the Goop brand of Gwyneth Paltrow.
This morning's representative, 37 years old, announced that he had left the business in Instagram.
Holly Willoughby has forced Peter Jones, the star of Dragon's Den, by leaving his lucrative life-style business in the last minute to focus on his extraordinary new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to the sources, Jones was "heavy" when the gold girl on television admitted that her new agreements, valued at up to 1.5 million pounds, did not allow time for her to dedicate herself to Truly, her fashion brand and supplements, during a tender meeting held on Tuesday at the headquarters of her business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire.
The business had been compared to the Goop brand of Gwyneth Paltrow and was described as a favorite to double Willoughby's fortune of about 11 million pounds.
While Willoughby, 37 years old, announced that he had left the business in Instagram, Jones left Britain to go to one of his holiday homes.
As one consulted source commented: "Truly was, by contrast, Holly's main priority.
It will be its long-term future, which will last for the next two decades.
His decision to leave was left to all those who were fully involved.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, so close to the launch.
There is a warehouse full of goods at Marlow's headquarters, ready products for sale."
Experts believe that the outcome of this morning's presentation, one of the most profitable stars in Great Britain, could cost millions to the company due to the important investment in products that come from coins and clothes, and possibly further delay its launch.
It could also mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby and his husband, Dan Baldwin, are parents of three children and ten years ago who maintain a close relationship with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp.
Willoughby established Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52 years old, joined as president in March.
Couples went on vacation together and Jones has a 40% share in Baldwin's television producer.
Willoughby is going to become a brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as a representative of the I'm A Celebrity program on the ITV channel.
A source near Jones said last night "no business topics were discussed".
A hard conversation "and then we fall in love"
She spoke about the criticisms received by the media for making a comment that some would consider "a little presidential" and for being so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so many things?
Trump commented with his tone of "reporter of news".
"I didn't give up anything."
He noted that Kim is interested in meeting with him again after Trump commended the first meeting held in June in Singapore, which he considered to be a great step towards the denuclearization of North Korea.
However, negotiations for denuclearization have been halted.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's main diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, told the world leaders gathered at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday that his country did not see an "appropriate response" from the United States to the first steps for North Korea's disarmament.
On the contrary, he pointed out that the U.S. continues to apply sanctions in order to maintain pressure.
Trump's perspective was much more optimistic in the speech he gave during his myth.
"We're going great with North Korea," he said.
"We were going to war with North Korea.
They would have killed millions of people.
Now we have a fantastic relationship."
He said his efforts to improve Kim's relationship have produced positive results: the end of missile tests, help release hostages and bring back the deaths of U.S. soldiers back home.
In addition, he defended his unusual approach to talking about relationships with Kim.
"It's very easy to be president, but so, instead of 10,000 people there were trying to get into this whole stadium, we'd have about 200 people right here," Trump commented, pointing to the people who were right in front of him.
A tsunami and an earthquake in Indonesia destroy an island, leaving hundreds of falls
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, non-governmental organizations were informed that their assistance was not needed.
Although more than 10 per cent of the population of Lombok had had to move, there was no national emergency, a prior requirement for catalytic international aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases they have left it very clear that they do not ask for international assistance, which is a little complicated," said Mrs. Sumbung.
Although Save the Children is preparing a team that will send to Palu, they are not sure if foreign staff can work on the ground.
Mr. Sutopo, a spokesman for the national emergency agency, explained that the authorities were assessing the situation in Palu to see if international organizations were allowed to provide assistance.
Given that the land is constantly moving in Indonesia, the country is still incredibly poorly prepared when nature is slowing down its anger.
Although refugees have been built for tsunamis in Aceh, they are not seen in many other coastal areas.
It is likely that the apparent lack of tsunami alert sirens in Palu, even though there was a previous warning, has contributed to the loss of life.
In the best case, traveling from one island to another from Indonesia is a challenge.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complex.
A hospital ship located in Lombok to meet the victims of the earthquake is headed to Palu, but it will be at least three days after arriving at the new disaster.
President Joko Vidodo turned the improvement of Indonesia's waste infrastructure into the central axis of its electoral campaign, and has devoted much money to roads and rail lines.
However, the lack of funding has affected Mr Joko's administration, which is faced with a reelection next year.
In addition, there must be pressure from persistent sectoral tensions in Indonesia, where members of the majority of Muslims have adopted a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people fell and tens of thousands had to leave their homes while Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the streets using machetes, bows and arrows, and other handguns.
See this: Daniel Sturridge from Liverpool, the marker before Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a defeat in the First League in front of Chelsea with a bullet in the 89th minute of the London Stamford Bridge.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri to something more than 27 metres from the Chelsea port when the marker was 1-0.
He put the balloon on his left foot with a touch before he throws it to the second floor.
The action was sent up the area and directed towards the top right corner of the network.
Finally, the balloon passed over Kepa Arrizabalaga who tried to stop him with a jump and fell into the net.
"I was trying to put myself in that position to do with the ball and the players like Shaq always play very forward, so I tried to give me all the time possible," said Sturridge to LiverpoolFC.com.
"I see Kante approached and gave him a touch. I didn't think too much of it, I just shot him."
Chelsea was winning 1-0 in the first half after the Belgian star Eden Hazard marked a goal at 25 minutes.
The middle point of the Blues made a tacoon pass to Matthew Kovacic in that game, before turning around making a rule near the middle of the field and entering the Liverpool field.
Kovacic quickly passed the balloon and ran out in the middle of the field.
Then he made a beautiful passage to the space he took Hazard to the area.
Hazard sat in front of the defense and finished launching the balloon to the second post network with a foot with the left foot that Alison Becker, of Liverpool, could not stop.
On Wednesday at 15:00, Liverpool plays against Naples in the team phase of the League Championships. The meeting will be held at St. Paolo Stadium, Naples, Italy.
On its part, Chelsea faces Videoton in UEFA Europe League on Thursday at 15:00 in London.
Indonesia's number of victims increased to 832
The number of victims by earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has increased to 832, as reported by the country's emergency agency on Sunday.
Many people were trapped between the roofs of the buildings that collapsed during the 7.5 magnitude earthquake that occurred on Friday and dissipated waves of up to six metres, according to the agency's spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho reported during a press tour.
The city of Palu, with more than 380,000 inhabitants, was covered by remains of destroyed buildings.
The police arrested a 32-year-old man as a suspect of murder after a woman was tortured to death
A murder investigation has been opened after the body of a woman was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside, this morning.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55 in Grayson Mews, John Street, who was arrested by a 32-year-old man as a suspect of murder.
The police have called on people in the area who have seen or heard something they've been looking for.
Inspector Brian O'Hagan commented: "The investigation is in the initial stages, but it would encourage anyone who was standing near Jonh Street, in Birkenhead, and who has seen or heard something suspicious to contact us.
In addition, I would recommend that any person, especially taxi drivers, have been able to catch something in Damascus to contact us, since they can have vital information for our investigation."
A police spokesman has confirmed that the woman whose body has been found is from Birkenhead and that it has fallen within a property.
This afternoon some people who think they know women came to the crime scene to know where they found her this morning.
The investigation is under way and the police have reported that they are in the process of informing the victims' families.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews has tried to get back into his room, but the police tell him no one can come in or get out of the building.
He was shocked when he discovered what had happened.
The residents are now informed that they will be allowed to enter again within hours.
Someone heard an agent tell a man that the whole area was being treated as a crime scene.
A woman appeared in the place in tears.
Don't stop repeating "the terrible."
At two o'clock in the afternoon, there were two police vans inside and out.
Several agents were standing within the cord controlling the block of floors.
Any person who has information that sends an email to DM @MerPolCC, calls 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously at number 0800 555 111, register 247 of 30 September.
Parliament's Cromwell Statute becomes the last Memorial success by "rewriting history"
Its prohibition would be a poetic justice act for this style Taliban destruction of many cultural and religious objects in England carried out by its fanatic Puritan followers.
However, the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick's suggestions as a "place" and a " trying to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, commented: "In the current debate on the elimination of statues, it was inevitable that the figure of Oliver Cromwell of the Westminster Palace would become an objective.
The icononicia of the English civil wars was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
It may be sacrificed to Cromwell mistakenly by the actions of his predecessor, Thomas, during the previous century.
The magnificent representation of Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft of Cromwell is a proof of the opinion of the 19th century and part of the history of a figure that many consider worthy of celebrating.
As Mr Goldsmith pointed out at The Sunday Telegraph: "Many consider Cromwell, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than at present, a parliamentary defender against external pressure, in this case, is clear, the monarchy.
If this is a very precise description, it is a matter of continuing with the historical debate.
What is true is that the Middle Ages conflict has shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognized figure that represents a face of that division.
Their achievements as Lord Protector are also worthy of celebrating and celebrating."
A serial killer attacks a Chinese winner
A hero attacked and killed a winner in a market in the southwestern China, according to local media.
The man, identified only by his address "Yuan", was found dead with a cut and covered blood artery near a pit of the Liupanshui market in the province of Guizhou, as the newspaper South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
On May 30, 2005, a surgeon was preparing to inject vaccines into the cervix of a pacifist in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
Apparently, he traveled with his cousin from Yunnan's province on Wednesday to sell 15 beer on the market.
The next morning his cousin found him dead and discovered that the door of a nearby village was open.
He said there was a big bull with blood in his mouth in his pocket.
The Forensic Review confirmed that nearly 250 kilograms of iron had been attacked by the winner until death, according to the report.
"My cousin's legs were frozen and destroyed," said the prince, to whom they are directed by his address, "Wu", to The Guiyang Evening News.
The pictures of the security camera showed Yuan entering the market on Thursday at 4:40 to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong either to Yuan or to his firstborn.
A market manager told The Happening News that the jury was closed to prevent any more attacks, while the police collected evidence at the site.
It seems that Yuan's family and market authorities are negotiating compensation for his death.
Although they're rare, it's not the first time a hero attacks a person.
In 2016, a priest attacked a woman and her husband in their Massachusetts farm, leaving the injured man pregnant.
Ten years ago, a nearly 295 pounds [295 kg] of beer accompanied a winner in his tractor until his wife threatened the animal.
After a winner of Oregón was launched in 2012, a winner of Manitoba told CBC News that the heroes are not often aggressive, but that the taste of blood can act as "smoker".
"They're just playing.
They're like kids, very curious... their intention is not to hurt.
What you need to do is have proper respect for them," he said.
The rest of the Rosa hurricane will leave strong generalised rains in the western United States.
As predicted, the Rosa hurricane is weakening as it moves over the coldest waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will leave torrential rains throughout north and west Mexico in the United States in the next days.
Rosa caused wind raids over 136 km/h, a category 1 hurricane from Sunday to Friday morning (East Time) and was located almost 620 kilometers west of Punta Eugenia (Mexico).
It is expected that Rosa will move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, in the Pacific Ocean they are starting to generate low pressures, which are moving towards the West Coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the low California peninsula on Monday, a tropical storm will begin to push the intense tropical rain in the north, towards the southwestern United States.
Rosa will leave more than 25 centimetres of rain in some areas of Mexico on the moon.
Finally, when the tropical rain shocks with the low pressure approaching, there will be strong generalised precipitations in the West over the next few days.
Locally, between 2 and 10 centimetres of rain will cause dangerous floods, floods and possible deforestation in the desert.
The intense tropical rains will cause precipitation almost 5 to 8 cm per hour in concrete areas, especially in parts south of Nevada and Arizona.
Between 5 and 10 centimetres of rain are expected in parts of the south-west, especially in most parts of Arizona.
Due to the widespread nature of tropical rain, it is possible that sudden floods may occur under conditions that rapidly worsen.
Because of this threat of tropical torrential rain, it is not recommended that you never venture into the desert by foot.
Heavy rains could turn cannons into frozen rivers and torrents will cause floods and floods locally.
The pressures approaching will leave heavy rains in concrete parts on the southern coast of California.
The torrential rains may leave up to nearly two inches [2 cm] of water, which could cause small torrents of foam and make the roads rebalancing.
This would be the first torrential rain in the region during the wet season.
Some scattered tropical chaparons will begin to approach Arizona at the last hour of the Sunday and the first hour of the moon, before the rain is generalised at the end of the moon and Tuesday.
The mighty rains will extend to the Four Eskines in the morning and during the whole Wednesday.
In October some intense changes in the U.S. temperature can be observed by the freezing of the Arctic and the quality of tropicals.
Sometimes this involves drastic changes in temperature in short distances.
A good example of these temperature differences is what will happen in the entire U.S. center on Sunday.
There will be a difference of almost 7 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha (Nebraska), and between St. Louis and Des Moines (Iowa).
Over the next few days, the prolonged summer heat will try to recover and expand again.
In a large part of the center and east of the U.S., a hot start is expected, with generalised temperatures ranging from 26 degrees south to north.
On Tuesday, in New York, temperatures could be up to 26 degrees Fahrenheit [- 26 ° C], about 12 degrees [- 12 ° C] above the average.
Our long-term forecast shows high probability of temperatures higher than the average for the U.S. East during the first half of October.
More than 20 million people saw Brett Kavanaugh's comparability
More than 20 million people were following the scandalous testimony that Brett Kavanaugh, a candidate for the Supreme Court, and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of alleged sexual aggression in the 1980s, gave the Thursday on six television lines.
In the meantime, the policy continued at a dead end and the media interrupted its usual programming to transmit the latest news of the Friday: an agreement designed by Senator Jeff Blake to conduct an investigation into the charges for a week.
Ford informed the Trial Committee of the Senate that he was absolutely sure that Kavanaugh had touched her in a state of pregnancy and that he was trying to get her out of an institute party.
During his passionate testimony, Kavanaugh said he was absolutely sure that didn't happen.
It is likely that over 20.4 million people who commented on Nielsen have seen it on Friday.
The company counted the average audience in CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not immediately available for other channels that forwarded it, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
In addition, Nielsen often has some problems to calculate how many people see something in the office.
To put it in perspective, it is an audience similar to an American football game of the playsoffs or Oscar Awards.
Fox News Channel, whose patulians have strongly supported the designation of Kavanaugh, was the lead channel, with an average of 5.69 million spectators during a comparison that lasted all day, noted Nielsen.
ABC occupied the second place, with 3.26 million spectators.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million and CNN had 2.52 million, Nielsen commented.
After the comparison, he continued to show great interest.
Flake was the central character of the Friday drama.
After the Office of the moderate Republican issued a communication informing that it would vote in favour of Kavanaugh, the CNN and CBS cameras in the morning saw how some protesters were shouting at him when they tried to raise an elevator to attend a comparison to the Judicial Commission.
While receiving these complaints, transmitted directly by the CNN, it was shown to be beaten.
"Looking at my face," said one woman.
"Do you think you're telling the truth to the country?"
And he continued: "You have power when there are many women who don't have it."
Flake said his office had issued a communication and, before the elevator doors were closed, he would tell more about his comparison with the Commission.
The cable and broadcasting television lines issued it all at the latest, when the Judicial Commission had to vote in order to propose Kavanaugh's candidacy to the Senate to vote for it.
However, Flake said he would only do it if the FBI investigated allegations against the candidate for the next week, which had been requesting some Democrats.
Fleke was convinced, in part by the conversations he had with his friend, democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and several senators later, Flake made his decision.
Flake's decision was fundamental, since it was clear that the Republicans would not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without that investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of "political" with Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of his plan to leave the European Union of "political" with the future of Great Britain and of raising national interest in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper.
The first British Minister, Theresa May, will be at the Congress of the Conservative Party to be held in Birmingham, Great Britain, on 29 September 2018.
In another interview published with her on the cover of the newspaper, her former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson insisted on his attack on the alleged Chechers plan for Brexit, stating that a proposal for Britain and the EU to cover the other's tariffs was "completely absurd".
Wayde assassination: The police arrest Dyteon Simpson as suspect of the death of the LSU player
The police have arrested a suspect for the death of Wade Sims, a 20-year-old LSU gambler, during a shooting.
Dyteon Simpson, 20 years old, has been arrested and imprisoned for a second-rate homicide charge, according to Baton Rouge Police Department.
The authorities made a video of the encounter between Sims and Simpson, and the police indicated that Sims lost his pockets during the war.
The police recovered the gafas in the crime scene and said they had found Simpson's DNA in them, according to WAFB, CBS's branch.
After asking Simpson, the police say he admitted he shot Wade.
A $350,000 loan has been established, according to the defence.
The Baton Rouge District Instruction Judge This published a preliminary report on Friday, which indicated that the cause of death had been a bullet wound in the neck that had reached the head.
The Department recognises the merits of the unit of refugees of the State Police of Louisiana, the State Police Crime Laboratory, the Southern University police and citizens for their assistance in the investigation that led to the arrest.
Joe Alleva, sports director of LSU, thanked the police forces in the area for their "diligence and search for justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The player, who weighed more than two meters, grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played ballistic in LSU.
He had obtained an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 rebotts in a match of the last season.
Tomorrow morning, Will Wade, LSU's ballistic coach, said his team is "damaged" and "in shock" because of Wade's death.
"These are the things people always care about," Wade commented.
A pink volcano in Mexico City
Ceniza from the Volcano Popocatepetl has come to the neighborhoods located south of the capital of Mexico.
The National Disaster Prevention Centre warned Mexicans to stay away from the volcano after the crater was active and 183 gas and censorship emissions were recorded in 24 hours.
The center recorded several stamps and scarves.
In social networks, images showed fine censorship layers covering the parachutes of vehicles in Mexico City neighborhoods, such as Xochimilco.
The geologists have observed a greater activity in the volcano, located 72 kilometres east of the capital, since a 7.1 magnitude earthquake hit the center of Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Police face Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the referendum on independence
Six persons were arrested on Saturday in Barcelona after independent protesters were faced with the anti-disturbation while thousands of people were involved in opposition demonstrations matching the first anniversary of the polarized referendum in Catalonia on the sect.
A group of separatists led by antidisturbians had cut the step by throwing eggs and paint into dust, creating dark clouds of dust on the streets, which are usually full of tourists.
There were also confrontations in later hours, and the police used bars to contain the war.
For several hours, independent groups, with messages such as "I forgot or forgive," faced demonstrators at the cry of "Viva Spain".
Forty people were treated with mild injuries suffered during protests, according to local media.
The tensions remain high in this region one year after the vote on 1 October, considered illegal by Madrid, but celebrated by separatist Catalans.
The voters chose for an overwhelming majority independence, although participation was low, since the people who were opposed to the secession greatly criticized the referendum.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured last year after the police tried to prevent the vote at electoral tables throughout the region, where violent confrontations were taking place.
Independent groups camped on Friday night to avoid a demonstration of support to the National Police.
The demonstration continued, but was forced to take a different path.
Narcis Termes, 68, a 68-year-old electricist who attended the separatist protest with his wife said he no longer had any hope that Catalunia would be independent.
"Last year we lived one of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying with joy for the power to vote, but now we're busy," he commented.
Despite achieving a vital victory, although close, in the regional elections last December, the Protestant parties have fought to keep the momentum this year, since many of their most well-known leaders, whether in self-taxed or detained exile, are awaiting trial for their role in the organization of the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic, who recorded the protest in support of the police on his phone, said that the conflict had been triggered by politicians on both sides.
"It's getting more and more tense," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders in pre-trial detention since the end of last year, announced that he would participate in the elections to the European Parliament next year.
"Being a candidate for European elections is the best way to denounce the repression in the democratic values and the repression we have seen from the Spanish Government," he said.
Londonderry: men arrested for wearing a house with a car
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, have been arrested once again after crossing a house in Londonderry with a car.
The incident took place on Thursday at 19:30 in Ballynagard Crescent.
Inspector Bob Blemmings commented that damage to access and building itself was caused.
At some point, it may have been shot in the car with a ballast.
Menga attack gives 1-0 victory to Livingston against the Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston gave the victory
A promoted Livingston impressed the Rangers when he won the second victory for Steven Gerard in 18 parties as the coach of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's attack marked the difference. Gary Holt's men took a position, with the Hibernian in second position.
At this time, Gerard's people have not yet won any win outside the house and the next Sunday they face Hearts, top leader with eight points of advantage.
Earlier, the Rangers received the Quick Vienna Thursday in the European Union.
Meanwhile, Livingston expanded its race of victorys in the division of six matches. Holt, master coach, has not tasted the defeat since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston lets you pass opportunities to a contented visitor
Holt's team had to have taken a step ahead long before marking, causing all kinds of problems to the Rangers for their direct game.
Scott Robinson won the defense, but his attempt failed in front of the portal. Later, Alan Lithgow pulled out the fired shot after entering to finish Craig Halkett's head centre in front of the portal.
The host team agreed to let the Rangers play before them, knowing that they could cause problems for visitors with football players.
That's how the decisive goal came.
The Rangers gave them a free shot and Livingston searched for an entry, with a combination game from Declan Gallagher and Robinson to Menga, which hit the balloon and marked from the center of the area.
At the time, the Rangers dominated the possession, but they could not pass through the host and porter Liam Kelly was quite quiet.
That game continued until the second part, although Alfredo Morelos forced a stop by Kelly.
Allan McGregor, the Ranger porter refused a shot by Scott Pittman of a battalion, and Lithgow stayed away from another game in Livingston.
In the Livingston area they entered long passages constantly, but they were always dismissed. Two petitions were rejected, one after one of Halkett's entry on the alternate Glenn Middleton and the other by one hand.
Livingston's "Fenomenal" (analyses)
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland at Tony Macaroni Stadium
An act and a phenomenal result for Livingston.
The unanimity is that they made an excellent game that continued to overcome the expectations of an ascending trajectory.
Your game style and pattern have only experienced changes since your height, but this is due mostly to Holt in the way you have strengthened the team since your arrival.
I was counting on a lot of heroes.
Halkett, the captain of the team, was enormous and directed a magnificently organized defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall alert at all times.
However, the Rangers lacked inspiration.
Although they had very good moments with Gerard, they were short.
They failed to materialize the games, as they were only able to enter the field at once, which is a call for attention to the Rangers, which are in the middle of the table.
Erdogan has received an ambigu invitation in Colonia
On Saturday, 29 September there were blue smiles and sky during the afternoon of the leaders of Turkey and Germany in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany with a view to restoring relations between NATO allies.
They have discussed issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Later, Erdogan went to Colonia to open a huge new mix.
The city welcomes the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police chose security reasons to prevent 25,000 people from meeting in front of the mosque, but many sympathizers were on the scene to see their president.
Hundreds of Erdogan opponents were also heard, many of them Kurds, who condemned both Erdogan's policies and the German Government's decision to receive them in the country.
These demonstrations reflect the divisive nature of this visitor, received as a hero by some German Turks and considered an autocratic by others.
Traffic accident in Deptford: a cyclist fails after collision with a vehicle
A cyclist died in a car accident in London.
The accident occurred near the Bestwood Street crossing and Evelyn Street, a competition road from Deptford, on the east side of the city, at 10:15.
The car driver stopped and the cyclist was treated by the paramedics, but he fell right there.
The accident occurs after another cyclist dies after being hit by a vehicle that fled to Childers Street, nearly two kilometers from the scene of the Saturday accident.
The Metropolitan Police said the agents were working to identify the man and inform his family.
Roads have been cut off and buses have been avoided, and drivers are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six injured agents after some disturbances
Six prison officials have been injured in an alternative resulting from a high-security prison for men, according to the Office of the Prison Centre.
The disturbances began in Long Lartin prison, in Worcestershire, at 9:30 a.m. on Sunday and still continued.
Specialists of an elite team (called "Back") are responsible for controlling the altercats, in which eight internal participants are involved and affecting a butterfly.
The agents were assisted by mild injuries on the face in the area.
A spokesman for the prison service commented: "It has been deployed to specialized prison personnel to deal with the incident in the course of Long Lartin prison.
Six members of staff have received health assistance for injuries.
In our prisons violence is not tolerated and we make it clear that the responsible will be placed in the hands of the police and may spend more time between governments."
Long Lartin prison is host to more than 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June it was reported that the prison director had received hospital medical assistance after a prisoner had been attacked.
In addition, in October last year, anti-disturbing agents were asked to attend prison to face a serious altercator in which he attacked the prison staff with billiard balls.
The Rosa hurricane threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with sudden floods (arid areas may be seen)
It is not uncommon for a tropical depression to reach Arizona, but that is exactly what could happen at the beginning of the week that comes when the last collections of the Rosa hurricane crossed the south of the desert, with the risk of sudden floods.
The National Weather Service has already issued warnings of sudden floods for the moon and Tuesday in western Arizona, southern and eastern Nevada and eastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It is expected that Rosa will head directly to Phoenix on Tuesday, leaving rain at the end of the moon.
Phoenix National Weather Service commented on a tweet that "ten hurricanes had preserved their state of tropical storms or depression on a 321-kilometre radius of Phoenix since 1950.
In 1967, Hurricane Katrina approached about 65 kilometers from the Arizona border."
The latest models of the Huracanes National Centre range between 5 and 10 centimetres of torrential rain, which can reach the 15 centimetres in isolated areas of the Mogollón Escarpe in Arizona.
They are likely to fall between 2 and 5 cm in rain, with the possibility of reaching 10 in isolated areas, in other southwestern areas of the desert, including the Rocky Mountains and the Great Cuenca.
In areas where there is no risk of sudden floods, the rain in Rosa can be seen as a blessing because the region is affected by drought.
Although flooding is a very serious matter, it is likely that part of these torrential rains are beneficial because of the dry conditions currently being experienced in the south-west.
According to the U.S. Sequia Monitor, more than 40% of Arizona is suffering from extreme drought, the second highest category, as reported in weather.com.
First of all, the Rosa hurricane will absorb the peninsula of Baja California from Mexico.
Rosa, who will still have a hurricane force of 136 kilometers per hour, is 619 kilometers south of Punta Eugenia (Mexico) and moves north to 19 kilometers per hour.
The storm is finding colder waters in the Pacific, so it's losing force.
Thus, it is expected to refuel in Mexico with the intensity of a tropical storm over the afternoon of the moon.
Strong torrential rains could fall in some parts of Mexico, which run a considerable risk of flooding.
"A torrential rain is expected between 7 and 15 cm from the Baja California to the northwest of Sonora, with the possibility of reaching 25 cm," as reported in weather.com.
Later, Rosa will head north of Mexico as a tropical storm, before arriving at the Arizona border in the first hours of the morning as a tropical depression. Thereafter, she will be moved by Arizona to the south of Utah at the last hour of March.
"The main danger of Rosa or her remains is the strong torrential rain in Baja California, the northwest of Sonora and the southwestern of the U.S. desert."
These floods are expected to cause dangerous floods and floods in the deserts, as well as land degradation in mountain areas.
Attack on Midsomer Norton: four arrests for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old boy have been arrested as suspects of an attempted murder after they met another 16-year-old with white weapons wounds in Somerset.
The teenager was injured in the area of Excelsior Terrace, in Midsomer Norton, at 4:00 a.m. on Saturday.
He was transferred to a hospital where he remains stable.
A 17-year-old boy, two of 18 and one of 20 were arrested that same night in Radstock area, Avon, according to Somerset Police.
The agents have made an appeal to anyone who may have recorded what happened on the mobile phone.
Trump says that Kavanaugh "has suffered the mixture and anger" of the Democratic Party.
"voting in favour of Judge Kavanaugh is voting to reject the rejected and angry tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump said in a myth held in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh "has suffered from the mix and anger" of the Democratic Party throughout the process of appointment.
Kavanaugh witnessed before the Congress on Thursdays, strongly and emotionally denying Christine Blasey Ford's charge that she had abused her sexually decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at the meeting on this charge.
On Saturday, the president said that on that day, "the United States saw Kavanaugh's assution, quality and bravery."
"Vowing to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is voting to confirm to one of the most successful legalists of our day, a jurist with an amazing history at the service of the public," West Virginia told its followers.
The President made indirect references to the candidateship of Kavanaugh to the importance of the Republican participation in the elections at the mid-term mandate.
"There are five weeks for one of the most important elections in our lives.
I'm not presenting myself, but it's a career," he said.
"That's why I'm going from one place to another fighting to get big candidates."
Trump claimed that Democrats are aboard a "resistance and obstruction" mission.
It is expected that the first key procedural vote in the Senate on the appointment of Kavanaugh will be held no later than Friday, and a high-ranking position of the Republican Party has been reported to CNN.
Hundreds of falls in an earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, the figure is increasing
At least 384 people have died and many have been dragged by the massive waves that caused the beaches to melt after a strong earthquake and tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, as reported on Saturday by the authorities.
Hundreds of people had gathered to celebrate a festival on the beach of the city of Palu on Friday when waves of up to six metres came to the coast at night, dragging many to death and destroying everything at its feet.
The tsunami occurred after a 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
"When yesterday it was announced that there could be a tsunami, people were still on the beach and didn't run away immediately, so they were victims," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the National Disaster Management Agency (BNPB) for its Indonesian signals, in a press street in Yakarta.
"The tsunami didn't come alone, dragged cars, trucks, houses, took everything that was on the ground," commented Nugroho. The tsunami had moved by the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h before reaching the coast.
He also added that some people had gone up to the trees to escape the tsunami and survived.
Some 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
The aerial photographs published by the agency showed the destruction of many buildings and shops, bridges broken down and broken down, and a watery mix.
The Replica continued to hit the coastal city on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes was felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPPT) reported in a communication that the energy released by the great winter earthquake was 200 times higher than the atomic bomb that fell on Hiroshima during World War II.
He added that the geography of the city, which sits at the very end of a long and narrow bay, could have magnified the size of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as "important" and said that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels had collapsed.
According to him, bodies of some victims were found under the roofs of destroyed buildings. In addition, 540 people were injured and 29 disappeared.
Nugroho pointed out that the number of victims and damages could be larger along the 300 km north of Palu, a zone called Doghea, which is closer to the earthquake epicenter.
The communications "were completely paralyzed and there was no information" from Doghea, Nugroho commented.
"More than 300,000 people live there," said the Red Cross in a communiqué, adding that its staff and volunteers are on their way to the affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy of itself, but it could be much worse," he said.
On Saturday, the agency received many criticisms because it did not report that a tsunami had hit Palu, although the authorities claim that the waves had already reached the coast when the alert was issued.
In a recording captured by a loved one and shared in social networks, a man who was at the last floor of a building warning people on the street of tsunami was approached.
In the matter of minutes, a water wall hits the coast, taking it forward buildings and cars.
Reuters could not validate the immediate material.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a great deal of tension that cut communication around Palu, making it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue work.
The army began to send cargo aircraft with aid from Yakarta and other cities, stating the authorities, but evacuated persons still need food and other basic products.
The city airport has been reopened only for relief tasks and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Vidodo has a scheduled visit to Paul's evacuation centres on Sunday.
The number of victims by Indonesia's tsunami is over 800.
It's something very bad.
Although World Vision staff have come to the city of Palu, where employees are staying under some of the schools installed in the garden of their offices, they have seen a devastating panorama on their way, said Mr. Doseba.
"They told me they had seen many destroyed houses," he commented.
It's something very bad.
Even while relief groups were putting in place disaster relief efforts, some people complained that there was no way to move to Palu of co-operatives with extensive experience.
According to Indonesian legislation, funding, supplies and provision of foreign personnel can only be used if the affected site is declared a national disaster zone.
And that hasn't happened yet.
"It's still a provincial disaster," commented Aulia Ariani, a spokesman for Red Cross in Indonesia.
"As the Government says it is considered a national disaster, we may begin to provide international assistance, but it has not yet happened."
On the second night in Palu after the earthquake and the tsunami of the Fridays, friends and family of the people who were still missing were still hoping that their loved ones would be the miracles that bring some light to the dissolute stories that record natural disasters.
The Sabbath was taken out of a small child from an alcantar.
On Sunday, rescuers released a woman who had been trapped under the shoulder for two days along with her mother’s body.
Gedon Subbandon, instructor of the Indonesian national parapente team, had trained two of the missing parapenists for the Asian Games, who had concluded earlier that month in Indonesia.
Others who were arrested at the Roa Roa Roa Hotel, Mr Mandji included, were students.
"For my experience in the parapet field, I carry my own emotional burden," he commented.
Mr. Gedon recalled how, in the hours following the announcement that the Roa Roa Roa Hotel had collapsed in the parapante community, he had sent disappointed messages from WhatsApp to the Palu competitors, who participated in the beach festival.
However, their messages showed only a grey check mark, not two in blue.
"I think that means that the messages haven't been delivered," he said.
Ladrones takes 26 750 USD during an automatic reloading at Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, some robbers attacked a Brink's employee who was recharged for an automatic case at Newport on the Levee, carrying 26,750 dollars, according to a press note from the Department of Police of Newport.
The driver of the vehicle had emptied an automatic casserole located in the centre of the ocean and was prepared to recharge it with more money, wrote Detective Dennis McCarthy in the note.
While he was busy, another man "proceeded to run behind Brink's employee" and stole a bag of money for the recharge.
According to the note, there were witnesses who came to several suspects from the area, but the police did not specify the number of persons involved in the incident.
Any person who has information on his or her identity should contact the Newport Police in No. 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper changes its name to Ye
The Kanye West rapper will start calling Ye.
He announced the change on Twitter on Saturday: "The person formerly known as Kanye West".
Some time ago West, 41 years old, was introduced to Ye, a name that he used as title for his eighth album, released in June.
The change comes before your appearance on Saturday Night Live, where you are expected to present your new album, Yandhi.
It replaces the singer Ariana Grande, who had to cancel his action for "emotional reasons", as the programme creator commented.
In addition to being abbreviation of his current professional name, West had previously said that the word had a religious significance for him.
"I think it's the most used word in the Bible, which means 'tu'," said West at the beginning of this year while talking about the title of the album with the Big Boy radio speaker.
"I am you, I am us, it means us.
It turned out to be Kanye, which means 'the only one', to Ye, a reflection of our good, bad and confused things, everything.
The album is more a reflection of who we are."
It's one of the many famous rappers who have changed the name.
Sean Combs has been known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he would prefer the names Love and Brother Love.
An old West co-laborator, JAY-Z, has used his name in upper or lower case, with or without guilon.
Mexican AMLO promises not to use the army against the civilian population
Andrés Manuel López Obrador, an elected president of Mexico, has promised never to use the army against the civilian population, now about 50 years of a blood transfusion against students in the country.
On Saturday, López Obrador promised in Plaza Tlatelolco that "he would never use the army to force the people of Mexico".
On October 2, 1968, the troops fired against a peaceful demonstration on the platform, killing 300 people at a time when the student movements of the left were growing in all Latin America.
López Obrador has committed himself to providing support to young Mexicans by providing monthly grants to those who study and open up more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities led young people to become involved in criminal gangs.
The U.S. should double the funding of I.A.
Now that China is more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double its investment in research in this field, says Kai-Fu Lee, I.A. investors and professionals who have worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Comments arise after the announcements on I.A. by several parts of the United States Government, even when there is a lack of official I.A. strategy in general.
In the meantime, China presented its plan last year: its goal is to become number 1 in innovation in I A. for 2030.
"Dublining the budget for I.A. research would be a good start, since all other countries are far behind the U.S.. We have the view that the next step in the field of I.A.", notes Lee.
The double funding means twice the possibilities for the next major achievement in I.A. to be achieved in the U.S., as Lee said in an interview with the CNC this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by the editorial Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the executive director of Sinovation Ventures, who has invested in one of the most important companies of China, Face+.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an I.A. system that won the best US player in Othello. Later, he was executive in Microsoft Research and president of the Google branch in China.
Lee gave thanks to the previous United States Government technological competitions, such as DARPA Robotics Challenge, and asked when it would be next, which would allow the next generation of viewers to be identified.
In the United States, researchers often have to work hard to get government subsidies, Lee commented.
"It's not China that's taking the academic leaders; it's the corporations," said Lee.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired prominent people from universities to work at I.A.
Lee commented that some changes in migration policy could also help the U.S. to intensify its initiatives in I.A.
"I think doctors in I.A. should have permanent residence cards automatically," he said.
The Council of State of China presented its Plan for the Development of the Next Generation of Artificial Intelligence in July 2017.
The National Foundation of Natural Sciences of China finances people from academic institutions such as the National Foundation for Science and other government organizations finance US researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower, Lee commented.
At the beginning of this year, the U.S. Department of Defence established a Joint Centre for Artificial Intelligence, which aims to attract partners in industrial and academic fields. The White House announced the formation of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
In addition, this month DARPA announced a US$ 2000 million investment in an initiative called AI Next.
With regard to the National Science Foundation, it currently invests more than US$100 million a year in I.A.
Meanwhile, the United States legislation that tried to create a National Committee on Artificial Intelligence has not carried out any action within months.
Macedonians decided in a referendum on whether they would change their country's name
The people of Macedonia decided in a referendum on whether their name would change to "Northern Republic of Macedonia", a gesture that would resolve a decade-long conflict with Greece, which had blocked their candidate for accession to the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, maintains that its neighbour's name is a claim from its territory and has extended its entry into NATO and the EU.
In June, both Governments reached an agreement on the new name proposed, but nationalists argued that the change would reduce the ethnic identity of the slave population, most in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign doubted whether participation would be at least 50% required for the referendum to be considered valid.
The referendum paper raised the following question: "Is it in favour of joining NATO and the EU with accepting the agreement with Greece?"
The parties to the change of name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a price worth paying for Macedonia, one of the countries emerging from Yugoslavia's deintegration, to try to access bodies such as the EU and NATO.
"Today I have come to vote for the future of the country, for Macedonia's young people, so that they can live freely on the European Union's defence, because this means a safer life for all," said 79-year-old Olivera Georgievska in Skopje.
Although it will not be legally binding, many Members of Parliament have said that they will respect the outcome of the vote in order to make it decisive.
The change of name requires a majority of two-thirds in Parliament.
The State Electoral Commission stated that no irregularities had been reported one afternoon.
However, participation was only 16%, compared with 34% of the last elections to Parliament held in 2016, when 66% of the registered voters recorded their vote.
"I have come to vote for my children, our place is in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62 years old, who voted in the capital, Skopje.
Zoran Zaev, Prime Minister of Macedonia, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko recorded their vote at the Macedonian referendum on a change in country name which would open the way to join NATO and the European Union in Strumica (Macedonia) on 30 September 2018.
In front of Parliament, in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54 years old, prepared a small scenario and removed chairs from the campaign shops planted by those who were going to book the referendum.
"We are willing to enter NATO and the EU, but we want to do it with our very high head, not through the back door," Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they do not want us to join Macedonia, we can establish relations with other countries, such as China and Russia, and form part of Euro-Asian integration."
First Minister Zaev said accession to NATO would contribute to the investment that Macedonia so much needs, whose unemployment rate is above 20%.
"I believe the great majority will be in favour, as more than 80% of citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," Zaev said after his vote.
He said that a positive outcome would be a "confirmation of our future".
In a survey published last month by the Policy Research Institute, it was ensured that between 30 and 43 per cent of the voters would participate in the referendum, which meant less participation than required.
Another survey conducted by Telma TV in Macedonia revealed that 57% of respondents had decided to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70% said he would vote in favour.
For the referendum to be considered a success, participation must be more than 50% more than one vote.
If it failed, it would be the first serious blow to the policy of the pro West Government since it came to power in May last year.
Look at this: Sergio Aguiro, from Manchester City, misses all the defense of Brighton to mark a gol
Sergio Aguiro and Raheem Sterling reviewed Brighton's defense in the 2-0 victory that Manchester City won on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
For Aguro, it was ridiculously easy to mark a hole in the minute 65.
The Argentinian midpoint received a pass in the middle field at the beginning of the game.
He ran between three Brighton defenses before entering an open field.
Once there, I saw around four green shirts.
He failed to defend himself before overcoming several more on the edge of the Brighton area.
He took a walk to the left, where he was Sterling.
The English front used his first touch in the area to return the balloon to Aguiro, who hit him with his right foot to avoid the porter Matthew Ryan with a shot that came to the right side of the network.
"Ageiro has some problems on his feet," said Pep Guardiola, a city trainer, to journalists.
"We talked about playing between 55 and 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky there was a hole at that time."
However, it was Sterling that gave Sky Blues the initial advantage in the content of the First League.
The bullet came at 29 o'clock.
In that game, Aguro received the balloon very much inside the Brighton territory.
He made a beautiful balloon pass on the left side of Leroy Sane.
Sane gave him some touch before he went to Sterling to the second floor.
Sky Blues front launched the balloon on the network just before it got out of its limits.
The City faces Hopeneheim in a Campeones League team on Tuesday at 12:55 in the Rhine-Neckar-Arena de Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to celebrate the festival to the Rockies
With the Nationals removed from the content by the playoffs, there was no reason to force another opening.
Even so, the always competitive Scherzer expects to beat the mountain on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if they are, they won before Los Angeles Dodgers in the Western Division of the National League, they still have opportunities in the playoffs.
The Rockies ensured at least a wildcard post thanks to the victory 5-2 on the Nationals Friday night, but they still pursue their first division title.
"Although we don't play anything, at least we can play the game with the conviction that the Denver public will be encouraged and that the other team will probably play at the highest level than I've faced this year.
Why didn't you want to participate?"
The Nationals still have to announce an opening for Sunday, but it seems like they're inclined to let Scherzer go in that situation.
Scherzer, who would open his number 34, has held a practice session on Thursday and will return to his normal rest on Sunday.
The history of the Washington registry is 18 wins and 7 wins, with an ERA of 2,53 and 300 strikeouts with 2/3 in 220 entries.
Blowing down a morning in West Virginia
The President made indirect references to the situation around Brett Kavanaugh, his election to the Supreme Court, when he spoke of the importance of the Republican participation in the elections at half a term of office.
"In November everything we've done is in play.
Five weeks are needed for one of the most important elections in our lives.
It's one of the most important things. I don't know, but it's a career, so I'm going from one place to another fighting for great candidates," he said.
And he continued: "We have this terrible radical group of Democrats, it's happening right now.
And they are determined to regain power through all necessary means, see mixing, evil.
They don't care who they hurt or who they have to pass on to get power and control, that's what they want, power and control, and we're not going to give it to them."
Democrats, he said, are aboard a "resistance and obstruction" mission.
"We've seen him these last four days," he said, saying that the Democrats "were angry, mean, terrible and false."
He referred to the Senate's Judicial Commission by appointing the Democratic Senator Diane Feinstein, who received public posters.
"Do you remember your answer?
Filter the document?
Mmm, mmm, what?
No, no mmm, I hope a response. His body language was terrible, the worst I've ever seen."
The Labour Party already covers a wide range of opinions.
It's intolerant with people who say what they think
When the Momentum activists from my local party voted to censor me, I was just surprised.
After all, I am the last of a series of members of the Parliament of the Labour Party who are told that he is not welcome, and just to say what we think.
My colleague, Joan Ryan, received a treatment that seemed to be categorically against anti-Semitism.
In my case, the motion of censorship criticized me for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
It was inconsistencies with the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe.
As was expressed in the notice of the meeting of the Nottingham East Labour Party on Friday, "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive".
During most of the eight years in which I have been a member of the Parliament of the local Labour Party, that is exactly what the evening meetings of the General Committee have been.
Unfortunately, this is not the current tone of many meetings and the promise of a "more kind and kind" policy is already more forgotten if it really applied at some point.
It is increasingly clear that discrepancies are not tolerated in the Labour Party and that each opinion is judged on whether the party's leaders consider it acceptable or not.
This began shortly after Jeremy became leader, when colleagues who previously thought he shared a similar political vision began to look forward to radically changing opinions and adopting positions with which he would never have agreed, whether on national security or on the EU's single market.
Whenever I speak in public, regardless of what I say, there is a range of abuses on social networks demanding my withdrawal, disclosing the central policies, saying that I should not be in the Labour Party.
I'm not the only one who has experienced it.
In fact, I know I am happier than some of my colleagues, because comments about me tend to be political.
I am amazed by the professionality and determination of colleagues who face a torrent of gender or racist abuses every day, but never run.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is the normalization of abuses.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn said that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we no longer have that wide range of opinions and, with each "censorship" motion or any change in the rules of selection, the party becomes closer.
In the last two years, I have received many advice that recommended keeping my head down and not making me hear so much and that this would "be good".
But I didn't get involved in politics to do that.
Since 32 years ago I joined the Labour Party as a student of secondary school, motivated by the neglect of the government of Thatcher that left my entire school literally in ruins, I have tried to support the improvement of public services for those who need them most, whether as a councillor or as a minister of the government.
I've never hidden my political ideas, nor in the last elections.
It is impossible for anyone in Nottingham East to know my political positions or areas where I did not agree with the current leaders.
The only thing I would say to those who promoted the movement of Friday is that I do not understand these attempts to waste time and energy with questions about my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party when the country goes head to a Brexit that will affect homes, businesses and public services.
The real message is not for Nottingham Momentum, but for the voters, whether of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve them and I promise that no threat of withdrawal or any political opportunity will prevent me from acting according to what I think is best for all of you.

Ayr 38 - Melrose 17: An Invited Air Up
Two tests at the end of the game may have decided to a certain extent the final result, but, of course, Ayr deserved the victory in this interesting game of the day of Tennent's Premiership.
They now head the table and are the only invital team of the ten who participate.
In the end, it was the superiorness of its defence, as well as its ability to make better use of opportunities, which gave victory to the local team, so that trainer Peter Murchie had all the right to be happy.
"We've been tested at all parties and we've followed inquisitively, so I have to rejoice," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose commented: "Ayr deserves recognition, they took advantage of better opportunities than us."
Grant Anderson's test at the 14th minute, converted by Frazier Climo, was in front of Ayr; but a yellow card to the Scottish Captain Rory Hughes, loan from the Warriors for the game, enabled Melrose to take advantage of this disadvantage of the contestant and Jason Baggot obtained an unconverted test.
Climo expanded Ayr's advantage with a penalty. Before, just in the middle of the day, he marked and turned a solo exam, which left the marker in 17-5 for Ayr in favor of rest.
However, Melrose began well the second part and Patrick Anderson's test, converted by Baggot, reduced this difference to five points.
Then there was a long interruption by a serious injury by Ruarahh Knott, to which they had to get out of the camel, and when the game resumed, Ayr progressed with a trial by Stafford McDowell converted by Climo.
The yellow card to Blair Macpherson, Captain of Ayr, allowed Melrose to take advantage of another man with an unconverted experiment by Bruce Colvine at the end of a period of great pressure.
However, the locals recovered and, when the yellow card was shown to Struan Hutchinson to put on air without the balloon, from the penal line, MacPherson did a test when he was on the back of the lead that was moving forward.
Climo turned it, as he had been doing almost since the game was resumed, after Kyle Rowe received the balloon sent by David Armstrong from a battalion and sent it to Gregor Henry at the bottom to do with the fifth local test.
Still Game's protagonist wants to guide his career towards the restoration sector
Ford Kieran, founder of Still Game, seems to be determined to pass on to the restaurant sector after discovering that he has been appointed director of a restaurant chain.
The 56-year-old actor is Jack Jarvis in the famous BBC program, who writes and co-protagonizes with his many years-old comedy partner, Greg Hemphil.
The second announced that the ninth season would be the last of the series, and Kiernan seems to be making plans for his life after Craiglang.
According to the official register, he is the director of Aposymorn Limited.
The actor did not want to comment on the issue, although a source of Scottish Sun pointed out that Kiernan wanted to become involved in the "floating market for the restoration" of Glasgow.
"The sea belongs to us": a Bilateral Bolivia has the hope that the court will reopen its path to the Pacific
Marines are watching a general patrol in La Paz.
In public buildings there are blue flags on the sea.
From the Lake Titicaca to the Amazons, the bases show the theme: "The sea belongs to us by law,
It's a duty to get it back."
In all Bolivia, a land without sea, they still vividly remember the cost lost before Chile in a bloody conflict by the resources that took place in the 19th century, in addition to the hope of re-shipping by the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes may be the biggest in decades, as Bolivia expects a resolution of the International Court of Justice for one October, following five years of deliberations.
"Bolivia has the impulse, a spirit of unity and serenity and, of course, is waiting for the result with a positive vision," commented Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will note the case of the International Court of Justice on large screens distributed throughout the country, with the hope that the Hague Court will be pronounced in favour of Bolivia's claim that, after decades of intermittent discussions, Chile has an obligation to negotiate for Bolivia to grant a sovereign exit to the sea.
Here Morales, the original charismatic president of Bolivia, who frees a controversial battle by the elections next year, also has much to say about the resolution of the moon.
"We are very close to going back to the Pacific Ocean," he promised at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that it is unlikely that the court would decide in favour of Bolivia and that the situation would change very little if it did.
The United Nations agency based in the Netherlands has no power to assist the Chilean territory and has provided that it will not determine the outcome of possible discussions.
The fact that the resolution of the International Court of Justice reached only six months after the final allegations indicated that the case was "not complicated", said Paz Zárate, an expert in international law.
Far from promoting the cause of Bolivia, it may have been buried in the last four years.
"The problem of sea access has been stolen by the current Bolivian administration," Zárate said.
In addition, he suggested that the prolific rhetoric of Morales has undermined any good remaining Chilean will.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to speak at some point, but it will be extremely difficult to keep conversations after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
The representative, Eduardo Rodríguez Veltze, representative of Bolivia in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision-making was unusually rapid.
The moon will be offered to Bolivia "an extraordinary opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile" and the possibility "to end 139 years of mutual benefit disputes", he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who is still one of the most popular presidents of Latin America, would use the maritime theme as a political mullet.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to have access to the Pacific Ocean," he added.
"The resolution is an opportunity to see that we have to leave behind the past."
North Korea says there will be no nuclear disarmament unless it can be trusted in the United States.
Ri Yong Ho, North Korean Foreign Minister, says that his nation will never be the first to end nuclear disarmament if he cannot trust Washington.
Ri spoke on Saturday to the General Assembly of the United Nations.
He urged the United States to fulfill the promises made during a summit held in Singapore among rival leaders.
Their comments come at the time when Mike Pompeo, U.S. Secretary of State, seems to be about to resume diplomatic talks on nuclear matters that have been paralysed more than three months after this summit with the North Korean leader Kim Jong U.
Ri points out that the continuation of the continued sanctions and the US opposition to a declaration ending with the Korean War to submit to the North is a "climate".
Washington is eager to accept the statement without Pyongyang prior to any significant disarmament movement.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want to celebrate another summit.
However, there is a generalized specicism on Pyongyang's serious rejection of an arsenal that the country may consider to be the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare another summit among the mandate holders.
Paris' fashion lines reveal the last line of huge shadows they're about to land on a street store near you
If you want to increase your collection of shades or totally protect yourself from the sun, don't look any more.
The designers of Valentino and Thom Browne presented a set of large-scale extraordinary shadows for their spring spring collection in the spring of 2019, revealing the style of the Paris Fashion Week.
The impossible shadows have flooded Instagram this summer and these designers have brought their spectacular creations to the pass.
The most outstanding piece of Valentino was a beige hat with a wide alara decorated with feathers that covered the heads of the models.
Other large-size supplements were sandwiches with jewelry, a brown hat and even a pineapple, but they are not designed to keep the hot head.
Thom Browne also presented a selection of masked extraterrestrials, just in time for Halloween.
Many of the masked masks had cosy lips and reminded Hannibal Lecter of the high design.
One creation reminded a complete butchering team, snorkel and gafas included, while the other seemed to be a cut-off ice cone.
If you like the size fashion, you're lucky.
Style hunters predict that huge shadows could begin to appear on store streets.
The big shadows come strong with "La Bomba", with a sea hat of more than 60 centimetres used by everyone, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The brand of worship behind this so little practical shade that inspired social networks presented another great creation in the past: a beach bag as large as the bathroom model that was carrying it.
The black naranja raffia bag, decorated with rags and a white leather ring, was the main part of the collection La Riviera de Jacquemus for the spring- summer season 2019 in the Paris Fashion Week.
As well as the famous stylelist Luke Armitage commented to FEMAIL: "The next summer, I hope to see huge shadows and beach bags in the commercial streets. Since the designer has had a great impact, it would be difficult to ignore the demand for large-scale supplements."
John Edward: Language competencies are fundamental to citizens of the world
The independent educational centres in Scotland have a academic excellence trajectory that has continued in 2018 with another set of extraordinary results in the examinations that are strengthened by individual and collective achievements in the areas of sport, art, music and other Community projects.
With more than 30,000 students throughout Scotland, these centres represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Colleges (SCIS) are working to provide the best level of service to students and progenitors.
Independent colleges are designed to prepare their students to continue their higher education studies, for the career they choose and for the place they occupy as citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that can design and implement an adjusted study plan, it is noted that modern languages continue to be a popular and desired assignment in the centres.
As Nelson Mandela said: "If you speak to a man in a language that he understands, the message comes to his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, he comes to his heart."
This is a powerful reminder that if relations are to be established and to generate confidence in people from other countries, it cannot depend solely on English.
If we take into account the recent results of this year's exams, we can see that languages are higher than the classification tables, being higher approval rates in independent colleges.
In total, 68% of students studying foreign languages received an A, the highest note.
Data collected from 74 centres that form part of SCIS showed that 72% of students obtained an A in mandarin, while 72% of those who studied German, 69% of those who studied French and 63% of those who studied Spanish also obtained an A.
This shows that the independent colleagues of Scotland support foreign languages by considering them a fundamental competence that both children and young people will need in the future without any doubt.
At present, languages are considered to be at the same level as the CTIM allocations (scientific, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the study plans of independent colleges and everywhere.
A survey conducted in 2014 by the Commission on Employment and Skills of the United Kingdom revealed that 17 % of the reasons given to businesses on the difficulties encountered at the time of employment were attributed to lack of linguistic skills.
Therefore, language skills are increasingly necessary to prepare young people for their future careers.
The potential job opportunities that require languages are increasing, so these competencies are essential in a globalised world.
Regardless of the career someone has chosen, if he has learned a second language, he will have a real advantage in the future thanks to a competition like this, which will last for the rest of his life.
The fact that you are able to communicate directly with persons from foreign countries will allow that person to move on automatically to competition.
According to a survey conducted by YouGov among more than 4,000 adults in the United Kingdom in 2013, 75% of them did not speak any foreign language enough to keep a conversation. It was also established that the only language spoken by a two-digit percentage, 15%, was French.
For this reason, investing in language learning is now important for today's children.
If they know several languages, especially those of developing economies, children will be equipped to have better access to quality employment.
In Scotland, each college will teach different languages.
Some centres will focus on the most classical modern languages, while others will teach the most important languages for the United Kingdom in the face of 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of the interests of a child, in independent colleges you can always choose between several languages learned by trained staff specialized in this matter.
Independent education centres in Scotland devote all their efforts to provide a learning environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills needed to succeed, whatever their future.
At these times, it is inevitable that, in a global business environment, languages remain vital for the country's future, so this must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should be considered as "competences for international communication".
Independent colleagues will continue to offer these options, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
You have to do it.

LeBron starts with Lakers Sunday in San Diego
Waiting for fans to see LeBron James start in his first game with Los Angeles Lakers is about to finish.
Luke Walton, coach of the Lakers, has announced that James will play the opening game of the pre-emergency which will be held on Sunday against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
However, it is still due to determine how many minutes it will play.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," said Walton on the official Lakers website.
Lakers' reporter Mike Trudell published in a tweet that was probably James's play for a few minutes.
After a training session at the beginning of this week, James was asked by his plans for the pre-emergency programme of six Lakers parties.
"In this stage of my career I don't need premature parties to prepare me," he said.
Time of the trumpet in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump started a series of campaign shares tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is the first of the five programmings of Trump for the next week, including stops at parties such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the vote of confirmation of its candidate to cover the vacancy in the Supreme Court pending, Trump intends to receive support for the next half-term elections, as the Republicans are at risk of losing control of the Congress when the votes are deposited in November.
What time is Trump's mitten in West Virginia tonight and how can you see online?
Trump's myth in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 19:00 tonight, Saturday 29 September 2018.
You can see it online via a direct transmission on YouTube.
It is likely that Trump commented on the comparisons of this week of candidate to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, who were detained on account of allegations of improper sexual conduct and had waited for an advance vote of confirmation of the Senate for a week while the FBI investigated them.
However, the main objective of this series of summits is to help the Republicans face the November elections to take action.
Thus, President Trump's campaign indicated that the next week's five-minute rounds are "inviting volunteers and participants while the Republicans are trying to protect and expand the majority that they keep in the Senate and the House of Representatives", according to Reuters.
"The control of Congress is so crucial for its agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible as possible while we go into the campaign," said a spokesman for the Trump campaign who did not want to give his name.
Planned at the Wesbanco Arena of Wheeling this night's myth could attract sympathizers of "Ohio and Pennsylvania, as well as having coverage in Pittsburgh's media," as West Virginia Metro News reported.
The Saturday will be the second time in a month that Trump visits West Virginia, the state in which he won over 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Patrick Morrisey, a Republican candidate at the West Virginia Senate, who is still on trial.
"For Morrisey it is not a good sign that the president has to come and give him a push in the investigations," said Simon Haeder, a politician at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: the U.S. team shows that it is struggling to keep the hope alive in front of the individual Sunday parties.
After three individual sessions, it may be that Saturday morning's forums are what this Ryder Cup needed.
The oscillating pendulum is a fully invented sport concept, but players really believe in it, more in competitions like these.
So where would they say that the impulse is now?
"We were taking six points of advantage and now four are taking us, so I guess that can be considered a little push," Jordan Spieth commented at the end of the day.
Europe has an advantage, of course: four points ahead with twelve more points in the game.
Like Spieth, the United States feels that they have some wind in favor and reasons to be encouraged, among other things by the couple formed by Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and got three points of four each.
Spieth has been fatal for tea to green and preaching with the example.
The loud beats of the celebration rose from volume to volume as their round progressed, introducing a vital putt to carry the fourth party when he and Thomas went down two after two holes.
The poll he gave them in 15 was received with a similar cry from those who transmit that they believe the U.S. team hasn't been out yet.
"What needs to be done to redouble efforts and concentrate on the game," Spieth commented.
That's what these players did.
18 eggs to leave her alone.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the indisputable story of Ryder Cup.
The strange and devout couple in Europe takes four and nothing can hurt them.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who didn't make a bogey on Saturday afternoon, but also avoided the bogeys on Saturday mornings, Fridays on Friday evenings and on the last nine Fridays on Friday mornings.
This race and the way it flows with its energy to the public public public makes it clear that these are players to be won on Sunday, and that there will be no other popular players such as Fleetwood and Molinari to celebrate a possible European victory when the sun puts on Le Golf National.
preferable, both at the same time on different leaves.
Nevertheless, it is still premature to talk about European glory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson fired Sergio García, the hero of the four balls in the morning, after forming a match with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles in the first nine leaves buried in the Spanish and Swedish in a cave where they could not leave.
But on Sunday there will be no kind of help to get out of the caves.
The forums and forums are fascinating to see about them because they appreciate the interactions between couples, the advice they give and those they don't give, and the way in which a strategy can change at once.
So far, Europe has played better as a team and has taken a great advantage over the last day, but this forum also proved that the U.S. team is struggling, something that some, especially the United States, doubted.
Europe moves by 10-6 on the last day of Ryder Cup
Europe shares a good advantage on the last day of Ryder Cup, after finishing its four-balls and forsoms with a 10-6 score on the United States.
The two motive composed by Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the content with two victories over a Tiger Woods that was seen in the suburbs, moving forward four points in the classification of Le Golf National.
European Thomas Bjorn, trying to preserve the trophie they lost in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated an American team that made many mistakes during the morning's fourballs, which ended 3-1.
The U.S. offered more resistance in the forums, winning two parties, but it was not able to cut distances.
U.S. Jim Furyk needs to get eight points from the 12 individual Sunday parties to keep the trophie.
Fleetwood is the first new European winning four consecutive points. In addition, he and Molinari, who received the "Molliwood" app after a week of sesension, are the second pair in winning four points in their first four matches in the history of Ryder Cup.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in the Fourballs, his great union served to win a disenchanted Woods and the new U.S. Bryson Decahmbeau for a round 5-4.
Woods, which in the two parties of the Saturday had not gone too far, had occasional moments of brightness, but now he has lost 19 of his 29 parties of fourballs and foursomes, and seven consecutive.
Justin Rose, who was retired for the morning's fourballs, returned to be Henrik Stenson's partner in the matches, defeating Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, number one and number three of the world, respectively, with a 2-1 result.
Although the day was pleasant and quiet in the southeastern part of Paris, Europe did not have all of it.
The third winner, Jordan Spieth, and Justin Thomas served as a reference to the United States, getting two points on Saturday.
They won a great victory 2-1 in front of Ian Poulter and Spanish Jon Rahm in the Fourballs and then beat Poulter and Rory McIllroy by 4-3 in the Fours after losing the two initials.
In the history of Ryder Cup, which a team recovers from a difference of four points in individual parties only occurred on two occasions, although Furyk, as the owner of the trophie, only needs an empathy to preserve it.
Although it has been the best seconds for two days, it seems that carrying out a counterattack on Sunday is beyond its possibilities.
North Korea says "there is no possibility" that they will first be shot unilaterally if they don't trust
On Saturday, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of North Korea informed the United Nations that the continuation of sanctions had deepened its confidence in the United States and that there was no possibility that its country would abandon nuclear weapons unilaterally under those circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho stated before the annual General Assembly of the international body that North Korea had adopted " important measures of good will" over the past year, such as ending nuclear and missile testing, dismanding nuclear testing facilities and committed itself to the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we received no similar response from the United States," he said.
"If we do not trust the United States, we cannot trust our national security, and in these circumstances there is no possibility that we will first unilaterally disarm ourselves."
Although Ri repeated the well-known complaints of North Korea by Washington's resistance to a "by phase" denuclearization formula that rewards the country as it takes gradual steps, its declaration is important, since it has no longer rejected unilateral denuclearization, as Pyongyang has done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong One and Donald Trump after the first summit between an active US president and a North Korean leader on 12 June in Singapore, when Kim committed himself to working for the "denuclearization of the Korean peninsula" and Trump guaranteed the security of North Korea.
North Korea has been pursuing the official end of the Korean War of 1950-53, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must give up his nuclear weapons.
Washington has also responded to calls for mitigation of international sanctions in North Korea.
"The United States has insisted on denuclearization in the first place and has increased pressure through sanctions in order to achieve its objective in a coherent manner, including by making objections to a declaration of end-of-war," Ri said.
"The idea that sanctions can make us fall on our knees is a treasure of people who don't know us.
The problem is that the continuation of sanctions deepens our mistrust."
Ri did not mention any of the plans of a second summit between Kim and Trump, announced by the U.S. leader at the beginning of the week.
Instead, the Minister highlighted three meetings held between Kim and Moon Jae, South Korea's leader in the last five months, and added: "If South Korea had been an interest in denuclearization rather than the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have been in a similar stagnation."
Even so, the tone of Ri's speech was radically different from last year's speech, when he told the General Assembly of the United Nations that it was impossible to direct North Korea's missions to the US ground after the "evil president" Trump, on a suicide mission, was called Kim "cohet man".
This year in the United Nations, Trump, which last year threatened with "total destruction" of North Korea, commended Kim for her courage in the face of disarmament, but said that there was still much to do and that it was necessary to continue applying sanctions until North Korea was denuclearized.
Wednesday, Trump said there was no time set for this: "We can delay two years, three years or five months, no matter."
China and Russia argue that the United Nations Security Council should reward Pyongyang for its progress.
However, as U.S. State Secretary Mike Pompeo told the United Nations Security Council on Thursday: "The imposition of sanctions on the Security Council must continue in force and without failure until we actually make final and fully verified denuclearization."
The Security Council has unanimously imposed sanctions on North Korea since 2006, in an attempt to cut funding for the ballistic and nuclear missiles programmes in Pyongyang.
Pompeo spoke with Ri outside the General Assembly of the United Nations and later commented that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare a second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip was not well.
He was from Pyongyang in July saying that progress had been made, but, a few hours later, North Korea complained that its "needs were the ones of a mafia".
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea committed itself to demilitarizing a mission location and a nuclear complex if the United States applied the "relevant measures".
He said Kim had informed him that the "relevant measures" he was looking for were the security guarantees that Trump had promised in Singapore and steps towards normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on how to relax enough
Thanks to a new course that takes place this year at Harvard University, all university students spend more time in an attempt to fight the growing machinist culture to study all night drinking caffeine.
One professor found that students at the university number one in the world do not often have any idea of the basic care of the same person.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School, and a Brigham and Women's Hospital specialist designed the course, it is believed that the first of his class in the U.S.
Their motivation to launch the course arose after giving a talk on how sleep deprivation affects learning.
"At the end of the course, a girl approached me and asked me why she had just been buried from this now, in her last year.
He said that no one had ever talked to him about the importance of the dream, which surprised me," he commented to The Telegraph.
The course, which took place for the first time this year, explains to students the basic concepts of how good sleep habits contribute to academic and sports performance, in addition to improving general well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of university health services, noted that the university decided to introduce the course after discovering that students only sleep during the week.
The course of a duration includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one section, there is an image of a bedroom, where students click on coffee cups, cortinas, sports soap operas and books that inform them of the effects of caffeine and light, as well as the impact of lack of sleep on sports performance and the importance of establishing a routine to go to sleep.
In another section, participants are told how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart failure, embolism, depression and cancer.
Then, a field icon with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily routines.
"We know that students' behaviour is not going to change immediately.
However, we believe they have the right to know it, just as anyone has the right to know the effects on tobacco health," Professor Czeisler added.
He said that the culture of pride by "passing through the night on the street" was still there and added that modern technology and the increasing pressure that students were subjected to meant that sleep deprivation was a growing problem.
Sleeping enough time and a good quality dream should be "the secret weapon" of the students to combat stress, fatigue and anxiety; even to avoid losing weight, since sleep deprivation makes the brain feel hungry, so they want to eat all the time.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californiaian studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course after attending one of his classes last year in Harvard.
He pointed out that the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to extend it all over the campus.
It is hoped that the next step will be to ask all postgraduate students to complete a similar study program before joining the competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler's recommendation is that students consider setting up an alarm to go to bed and another to wake up, and that they be aware of the harmful effects of the "blue light" that emits the screens of electrical devices and LEDs, which can change circular rhythms, so they would end up having problems in order to stay asleep.
Livingston 1 - Rangers 0: Menga's bullet grave to Gerrard's men
The Rangers suffered another out-of-house depression episode when Dolly Menga's attack destroyed Steven Gerard's disarmed team at a 1-0 battle in Livingston.
The Ibrox wanted to win their first win out of home from the 4-1 February triumph in St. Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team won Gerard for the second time in 18 matches as a coach, leaving his team with eight Hearts, fired leaders of the Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga's attack occurred six minutes before the middle time and the little inspired alignment of the Rangers was not at all.
Now, the Rangers are down to the sixth position, Livingston is up to the third, behind the Hibernia by the difference of waves.
The Rangers may have more problems, as the Calum Spence line judge had to receive medical assistance for an injury on his head after someone apparently launched an object from the visiting fund.
Gerard changed to eight of the owners who won the game against the Ayr, entering the semifinals of the Scotland League Cup.
For his part, Holt drew out the 11 players from Livingston who started a point with Hearts last week and would have been happy about the way his organizational team has been trying to get the opponents at all times.
The Rangers may have had more possession, but Livingston took better advantage of the balloon when I had it.
They should have marked the two minutes from the start, when Menga made a walk into space for Scott Pittman who passed through the defense, leaving him alone before Allan McGregor, but the midcommist sent her out.
Keaghan Jacobs was missing in depth for Captain Craig Halket, but his defense partner, Alan Lithgow, could only send her out for the long line.
The Rangers recovered control, but there seemed to be more hope than conviction about their game in the last third.
There is no doubt that Alfredo Morelos felt that he had been punished at the 15th minute of the party, when he and Steven Lawless were shocked, but Judge Steven Thomson had heard of the Colombian petition.
The Rangers got two shots at the first half, but the old porter of Ibrox, Liam Kelly, just saw difficulties in fighting with Lassana Coulibary's head and the boring launch of Ovie Ejaria.
Although the goal marked at 34 minutes by Livingston came against all prognostics, no one can deny that they deserved it by their dedicated effort.
Again, the Rangers were unable to face a deep-fashioned football game by Jacobs.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher hit the ball for Scott Robinson, who kept calm and passed Menga to mark the ball.
In the rest, Gerard replaced Coulibally by Ryan Kent, which had an almost immediate impact, since the flight passed to Morelos, but the impressive Kelly went out of his line to block it.
Even so, Livingston continued to take the visitors exactly to the type of game he liked, with Lithgow and Halkett throwing a long walk behind each other.
The Holts could have taken more advantage in the final stages, but McGregor remained firm to reject Jacobs before Lithgow finished a head horn that didn't come in.
The replacement of the Rangers, Glen Middleton, claimed a penalty towards the end of the game after a meeting with Jacobs, but again, Thomson looked on the other side.
Almanac: The inventor of the Geiger accountant
And now, a page from the Almanac section of "Sunday Morning": September 30, 1882, today 136 years ago, and CONTANDO... was born in Germany the physical future of Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger.
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity, an invention that culminated with the device known as the Geiger counter.
Count Geiger, who has since become a pillar of science, has also become a pillar of pop culture, as in the 1950 film "The Coronado Campaigns", with the actors Roy Rogers and Dale Evans in the apparently incompatible papers of vacuum scientists:
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, used to locate radioactive minerals such as uranium.
You can hear the effect of the waves emitted by the radioactivity of the minerals."

A new vaccine against cancer can teach the immune system to "see" bad cells
A new vaccine against cancer can teach the immune system to "see" bad cells and kill them.
As part of the treatment, the vaccine teaches the immunological system to recognize malignant cells.
The method requires the extraction of immune cells to a patient and alter them in the laboratory.
So they can "see" a common protein to many cancers and re-inject them.
A vaccine test is producing promising results in patients with different cancers.
A woman treated with the vaccine, who teaches the immunological system to recognize the malignant cells, saw as her ovary cancer disappeared for more than 18 months.
The method requires the extraction of immune cells to a patient and alter them in the laboratory so that they can "see" a common protein to many cancers called HER2 and then re-inject the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, commented: "Our results suggest we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "promoting the growth of different types of cancer", such as mother, ovary, lung or colorectal cancer, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A trend similar to taking immune cells from patients and "instructing them" to attack cancer cells has worked in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West sailed in a Diaribo for Trump with a MAGA gor after its appearance in SNL.
It didn't work out.
Kanye West was interviewed in the Saturday Night Live study after an erroneous action in which he commended U.S. president Donald Trump, and said he would present himself to the elections in 2020.
After the third night's song, called Ghost Town, during which he used the gorilla with the message Make America Great Again, he began to deport the democracies and reiterated his support to Trump.
"Many times I talk to someone white and she asks me how I can like Trump if she's racist.
Well, if I were worried about racism, I would have gone from the United States a long time ago," she said.
SNL launched Matt Damon's program with sketches in which Hollywood star was inspired by Brett Kavanaugh's statement to the Senate's Judicial Committee on sexual assault charges made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it has not been retransmitted, comedy Chris Rock has increased the recording of the West bridge on social networks.
It's not clear if Rock was trying to rediscover West with the publication.
In addition, West told the public that it had happened badly among the hostages to carry that gorilla.
"They set me up.
They told me not to go out with the gorilla.
They're stuck with me!
And then they tell me I'm asleep," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued: "Do you want to see the sleeping that I am?" and he added that "I'm going to put his hat on a superman, because that meant that nobody could tell him what to do. Do you want the world to move forward?
Try it with love."
His comments were received by the public on at least two occasions and SNL members seemed embarrassed, according to Variety reported. One person said to the magazine: "The study remained completely silent".
West had been invited to replace singer Ariana Grande, whose novelty, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days ago.
West disappointed many when he went out to the stage to sing I Love it dressed as a Perrier bottle.
West received support from the leader of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who said: "To one of the most valid spirits: GRAYS FOR REESTING THE MUCHEDUMBRE."
Karen Hunter, who was presenting an interview program, noticed that West was simply "being himself and that is absolutely wonderful".
"But I decided NOT to award someone (by understanding his music or his clothing, or by supporting his art) who I think is spreading and spreading a dangerous ideology to my community.
He's free.
We too," he added.
Before the program, the rapper announced on Twitter that the name had changed, saying that it was now "the person formerly known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name, following the steps of Didy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Didy.
His colleague, Snoop Dogg has also been called Snoop Lion, without forgetting the missing legend of music, Prince, who changed his name to a symbol and then to the artist previously known as Prince.
Charge of attempted murder by arrest at a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was arrested at a restaurant in East Belfast on Friday.
The incident happened in Ballyhackmore, according to the police.
The defendant is expected to compare the moon to the first instance of Belfast Court of First Instance.
Taxation will review the charges.
Kit Harington, Tronos game star, attacks toxic masculinity
Kit Harrington is famous for his role as Jon Nieve in the violent series of medieval fantasy by the HBO, Tronos game.
The 31-year-old actor has attacked the stereotype of male hero, saying that these papers on screen often transmitted to young boys who had to be hard to be respected.
In an interview given to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit commented that he believes that "something has gone wrong" and wondered how to address the problem of toxic masculinity in the era of #MeToo.
Kit, who recently married his partner in Tronos's game department, Rose Leslie, also for 31 years, admitted that she seemed "very important" to address this issue.
"Personally, I feel quite important right now, where have we been wrong with masculinity?" he commented.
"What have we been teaching men as they grew up, thinking about the problems they now face?"
Kit believes that television can be part of responsibility for growing toxic masculinity because of its so-called male personality.
And he continued: "What is it that he is born, and what is it that he is taught?
What is taught on television, and on the street, that makes young people feel that they must be this concrete form of man?
I think that's one of the great questions of our time. How do we change it?
Because it's clear that something has gone wrong in the education of young people."
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not participate in any Trons game race or school when the series ends next summer, claiming he's "carte of battle fields and horses".
From November, Kit will mark True West, Sam Shepard's theatre work that tells the story of a movie producer and his brother, who is a thief.
Not long ago, the actor revealed that he believes that knowing his wife Rose is the best thing he's ever taken out of Tronos Game.
"I knew my wife in the series, so in that sense she has given me my future family and my life from now on," he said.
Rose represented Ygrintte, the loving interest of Kit's character, Jon Nieve, in the fantastic series Galardonated with Emmy prizes.
The couple opposed marriage in June 2018 in a family fine in Leslie, Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reported 14% more of new cases
China has announced an increase in 14% of the population living with HIV and AIDS.
There are more than 820,000 affected persons in the country, according to the health authorities.
About 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
The vast majority of these were sexually infected, which is a change in the past.
Traditionally, HIV was spread rapidly by some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people who have contracted HIV in this way has been reduced in practice, and the Chinese health authorities have declared it at a convention held in Yunnan province.
Each year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China increases by some 100,000.
The transmission of HIV sexually is a serious problem in the Chinese LGTB community.
Homosexuality was eradicated in China in 1997, but the LGTB collective suffered a lot of discrimination.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies have calculated that between 70% and 90% of men who have sexual relations with other men will end up marrying women.
Many of the transmissions of diseases are due to failure to use adequate protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Government of China has promised universal access to HIV drugs as part of an attempt to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that a member of his staff will filter data from the Republican Party's senators and warns that it is "hazardous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
The representative of Maxine Waters criticized Saturday the allegations that a member of his staff had published the personal data of three U.S. senators of the Republican Party on Wikipedia pages on legislators.
The Democrat of Los Angeles stated that these charges were motivated by commentators and websites of "extra right".
"Miracles, lies and more cities lies," Waters commented in a post on Twitter.
Apparently, the information published included the addresses and telephone numbers of Utah US senators Lindsey Graham, South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch.
On Thursday, an unknown person from the Chapter published information on the Internet during a session of the Senate panel on sexual misconduct charges against Brett Kavanaugh, a candidate for the Supreme Court.
The filtering took place at some point after the three senators had asked Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, reported that the IP address identifying the source of publications was associated with the Waters Office and made data available to the public by a member of Waters staff, according to the Chapter.
"This groundless charge is completely false and absolutely false," Waters continued.
"The member of my staff, whose identity, personal data and security have been affected as a result of these fraudulent and false accusations, was not responsible for the filtering of this information.
This claim without foundation is completely false and absolutely false."
The Waters statement raised immediate criticisms on the Internet, including those of the former press secretary of the White House, Ari Fleischer.
"Release this information with enthusiasm," Fleisher wrote.
"This suggests that it is not the time needed to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something he hasn't done, he doesn't have to get angry.
You don't have to rebel.
The prosecutor's reasons should not be questioned.
It must maintain peace and seriousness."
It seems Fleisher wanted to compare Waters' reaction with the criticisms of the Democrats to Judge Kavanaugh, to whom the tractors accused of being too angry during the day's comparability.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who seeks to disband Waters in the mid-term elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
"If it's true, it's very serious," he cried.
In his statement, Waters said that his office had warned "the relevant authorities and entities responsible for the enforcement of these fraudulent charges".
"We will ensure that the authors are discovered," he continued, "and that they are considered legally responsible for all these destructive and dangerous actions for all members of my staff."
Johnny English criticism: Again in action. Rowan Atkinson's spy parody is short
Now it has become a tradition to look for songs to Brexit in any new film with a British approach. It seems that this is what it is appropriate to do with this new delivery of the parallel franchise of action and comedy Johnny English, which started in 2003 with Johnny English and returned to life in 2011 with Johnny English Returns.
Will this self-defense ironic on the clearly fired that we are the new opportunity to export the nation?
In any case, incompetence Johnny English, with his inexplicable eyes and face, has renewed his license to put the pata for a second time. Only his name already gives clues that, more than anything, is a comical creation thought for non-English-speaking areas.
Of course, it is the secret agent who, despite his foreign claims to defeat glamur, has a bit of Clouseau, a touch by Mr. Bean and a piece of that kind that touched a single note on the theme of Fire Cars that was played at the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympic Games.
In addition, it was based on the mysterious traveling and international man represented by Atkinson years ago in the already forgotten Barclaycard television ads, which seemed to fall behind him.
In this last delivery, there's one or two good moments.
I liked to see Johnny English approaching a helicopter dressed in a middle suit while the helicopters were shooting at the helmet.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy jumps to the view, but humor is quite short and is extremely superfluous, especially now that "serious" film franchises like 007 and Mission are impossible to add comical ingredients without problems.
Humor seems more directed to children than adults and, to me, the absurd adventures of Johnny English are not as clever and astute as the silent Atkinson chips in Mr. Bean's role.
Now, the repeated argument of today is that Britain is in serious trouble.
A computer pirate has been infiltrated into the supersecret network of British spies, revealing the identity of all its agents active in front of the employee's harassment, a unfortunately small role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the drop that lifts the vase for the first minister, a pumped and accelerated character who is seeing how his political popularity declines: Emma Thompson gives the best of himself in this character that is almost like Theresa May, but the guion doesn't leave much to work.
Your intelligence advisers inform you that, as all spies are at risk, you will have to resort to something that is withdrawn.
This must be the Johnny English torpedoes, which now teaches in a play college, although from extra-official classes about how to be a secret agent: there are some good chips, since it's a spying academy similar to the Rock School.
English is transferred to Whitehall for an emergency meeting and meets with its former Bough compenche, represented again by Ben Miller.
Now, Bough is a married man with a submarine captain, a nice paper for whom Vicki Pepperdine doesn't use enough.
Thus, Batman and Robin who do terrible things in His Majesty's Secret Service return to action, with the beautiful dead woman Ophelia Bulletova, represented by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the first minister is falling into the dangerous struggles of a multimillionaire charismatic of the world of technology that says it can solve the computer problems of Great Britain: Sister Jason Volta, interpreted by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough start their idea of absurd situations: they break out of their bedrooms, fire at an elegant French restaurant, drop the chaos hiding in the luxurious Yate of Volta; in addition, English becomes pure anarchy when they try to use a virtual reality case to familiarize themselves with the inside of the Volta house.
Finally, they were deeply employed in that last sequence, but, very grateful and estreptuous that is, the whole continues to convey a sense of so much childishness.
A pretty regular product.
Like Johnny English's other films, I couldn't help wondering if the British film industry could not give Rowan Atkinson a role that would make true justice to his talent.
The Labour Party denies that it is developing a plan for the British to work four days a week, but they cover five
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is going to think of a radical plan with which the British would work four days a week, but they would cover five.
Naturally, the party wants the owners of companies to target the savings obtained through the revolution in artificial intelligence (IA) to workers, giving them an additional day free.
In this way, employees would enjoy a three-day weekend for the same pay.
According to sources, the idea would "incajar" in the plans and the economic agenda of the party to attract the country to the benefit of workers.
This change to a four-day week has received the support of the Trade Union Congress, as it is a way for workers to take part in the changing economy.
As a senior member of the Labour Party commented on The Sunday Times: The announcement of a revision of the directive is expected before the end of the year.
"It will not be achieved from one day to another, but the working week of four days is definitely a question which the party expects to incorporate in order to rebalance the economy for the worker as well as in the general industrial strategy of the party."
The Labour Party would not be the first to support this kind of idea, since the Green Party has already promised a working week of four days in its campaign for general elections in 2017.
However, at the moment, not all the Labour Party supports this decision.
A spokesman for the workers said: "The working week of four days is not part of the party's policy and is not going to be discussed at this time."
Hacienda's shadow minister, John McDonnell, used the Labour Party conference last week to expose his idea of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was willing to recover powers from "anonymous directors" and "used" by companies providing public services.
The Minister's shadow plans also include the idea that current water companies shareholders do not recover their full participation, as a labouring government could apply deductions corresponding to perceived irregularities.
It also confirmed its intention to include workers in corporate management councils and to create property funds including those for which 10 % of the private sector companies should be allocated to employees, which would provide them with annual dividends of up to £500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy talk at "60 Minutes" about FBI research around Kavanaugh and if they could change their opinion
The investigation by the FBI on allegations made against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has taken at least one week's final vote for its confirmation as Judge of the Supreme Court and also raises the question of whether the results that are to be concluded could affect any Republican senator who finally decides to withdraw his support.
In an interview to be delivered on Sunday, journalist "60 Minutes", Scott Pelley asked Republican senators. John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham are talking about whether the FBI could get the information that would change their opinion.
Kennedy was more open than his South Carolina colleague.
"Of course," said Kennedy.
"I was pleased to proceed with the hearing, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
After all this happened, I called him out and asked him, 'Did you do it?'
It was shown to the firm, to be resolved, to be silent."
Graham's vote, however, seems irrevocable.
"I already have a decision taken around Brett Kavanaugh and I would make the charge very high," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett secretly denied it," said Graham, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And none of the people she named have been able to confirm.
36 years ago.
It's always the same, I don't see anything new in this case."
What is the Global Citizen Festival? Has it been able to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music festival, where an impressive star map for a mission is also impressive: ending poverty in the world.
This year, in its seventh edition, the Global Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people move to the Great Lawn of Central Park to enjoy events such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to realize the real goal of the event: ending with extreme poverty in 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international awareness group that looks forward to ending poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
If you want to receive a free entry for the event (unless you can pay a VIP entry), the concerters have had to complete a series of tasks or "actions", as volunteers, send e-mails to a world leader, make a phone call or anything else that is useful to raise awareness about their goal of ending poverty.
However, what has Global Citizen achieved for 12 years to achieve its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding with a free concert a genuine way to persuade people to take action or not more than a form of what is called "clivism", which is called the position we adopt when we think we are doing something really useful by signing an online request or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has claimed to have recorded more than 19 million "actions" of its partners in favour of a large number of different objectives.
As a result of these actions, they claim that world leaders have been able to announce commitments and policies for a value of more than $37,000 million, which will affect the lives of over 2250 million people in 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group referred to 390 commitments and announcements arising from its actions, of which at least $10,000 has already been disbursed or recovered.
The group estimates that the guaranteed funds have directly affected nearly 649 million people around the world.
Among the most important commitments are "The Power of Nutrition", a partnership of investors and executives based in the United Kingdom with the common commitment to "help children grow up and develop with all their potential." To this end, Rwanda has been offered $35 million to help end the country's malnutrition after receiving more than 4700 tweets from Global Citizens' colleagues.
"With the support of the Government of the United Kingdom, donors, national governments and global citizens as you, we can mark a small trend in the history of social injustice of malnutrition," said Tracey Ullman, Ambassador of "The Power of Nutrition", to the crowd during a concert in London in April 2018.
The Group also stated that after more than 5,000 actions were taken to improve nutrition in the United Kingdom for mothers and children, the Government announced the financing of a project, Power of Nutrition, with which 5 million women and children would benefit from food-related interventions.
In response to one of the frequent questions raised on its website about what we believe can be done to address extreme poverty,
a Global Citizen collaborator replied: "It will be a long and hard way and, on many occasions, we will get tired and fall.
But as we have already achieved the human rights movements and against apartheid, we will achieve our goals, because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monée are some of the events we will count on in New York this year, which will be presented by Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The U.S. could use the Armament to implement the blockade on Russia's energy exports - Secretariat of the Interior
"If necessary", Washington could resort to its Army to prevent Russian energy from damaging markets, including the Middle East, revealed the Secretary of the United States Interior, Ryan Zinke, as published in the Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russia's alliance with Syria, in particular where it operates in the interests of the legitimate government, is no longer a prerequisite for expansion in new markets.
"I am convinced that they are in the Middle East to negotiate with energy, as they do with Eastern Europe, becoming the supplier most south of Europe," he said.
In addition, official information indicates that there are ways and means to address this issue.
"The United States, with its Army, has the ability to ensure that maritime roads remain open and, when the case comes, could even block them to ensure that energy does not end in the market," he said.
Zinke addressed those who attended an event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that is defined as "the voice of energy consumer" in the United States.
In it, he compared the approaches that keep Washington in its negotiations with Russia and Iran, and warned that they were, in fact, the same.
"The economic alternative in Iran and Russia consists mainly of the use and replacement of fuels," he warned as he indicated that Russia only knows what to do, which is based on its economy on fossil fuels.
These claims are made when the Trump administration has been trying to push its exports of natural gas to Europe and to highlight its role in Russia, which is the cheapest option for European consumers.
To that end, the members of the Trump administration, including the Donald Trump himself, are trying to persuade Germany to abandon the "inappropriate" project of North Stream 2, which, according to Trump, will turn Berlin into Moscow.
Moscow has insisted at all times that the North Stream 2 gas pipeline project, which achieves a value of $11,000 million and is expected to double the current gas pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic metres, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's fierce opposition to the project only responds to economic reasons and is a further demonstration of unfair competition.
"I believe that we all share the idea that energy cannot become a pressure tool and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers," said Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak, after a meeting with Rick Perry, Secretary of Energy of the United States, last September in Moscow.
The U.S. position has, however, been found with Germany's rejection, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The organisation leading the industry in Germany, the German Federation of Industries (BDI), has asked the United States not to intervene in EU energy policy or bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"There is a big problem when a third state interferes with our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, director of the German Industry Federation (BDI) after a recent meeting between the German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will carefully analyze the possibility of being presented as a candidate to the president in 2020, says Senator of Massachusetts.
The Senator for Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that he would study the possibility of joining the presidential career after the elections at half a term of office.
During a comparation at the Holyoke Assembly, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that this challenge was under way.
"It is time for women to get to Washington to change our broken government and to finally have women among the leaders," he said, according to The Hill.
"After 6 November, I will seriously consider the possibility of presenting myself as a candidate to the presidency."
Warren expressed his opinion on President Donald Trump during a meeting in the Union and said that he was "leading to the country for the wrong way".
"I really care about the damage Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," he said.
Warren spoke without charge about Trump and his candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet last Friday, Warren said that "it is absolutely necessary that the FBI investigate what happened before the vote".
The Thursday was published in which, however, most of Warren's own voters do not believe that they should be presented for the 2020 elections.
An 58% of the "possible" voters from Massachusetts said that the senator should not be present, according to the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe survey.
However, 32% of respondents supported their application.
The survey showed increased support for former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38% support for a possible candidate and 48% against.
Other recognized members of the Democratic Party discussed the possible candidate for 2020 by former Vice-President Joe Biden and Senator Vermont, Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would decide it officially in January, according to the Associated Press report.
Sarah Palin talks about the post-raumatic stress disorder of Track Palin in a myth of Donald Trump
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after he was released in September.
Last night, the moon was arrested and charged with domestic violence.
"The situation that is going through my son, for all that has happened since he returned, is well known by other families who suffer the effects of TEPT and other injuries with which our soldiers return," Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma, told the public that he gathered in a myth in favor of the public.
Palin referred to this arrest as the great taboo no one wants to talk about, and commented on his son and other war veterans who "come back with a different, strengthened attitude, wondering if there really is such respect for what his fellow soldiers and planes, as well as all the other members of the army, have given to his country".
The moon was arrested in Wasilla, Alaska, accused of an episode of domestic violence against a woman, which interferes with a complaint of domestic violence and possession of weapons under the effects of drugs or alcohol, according to Dan Bennettt, a spokesman from the police department of Wasilla.
18 states, D.C. support the challenge to achieve a new asylum policy
18 states and the District of Colombia support a judicial remedy for the new U.S. policy that denies asylum for victims of domestic or pandemic violence.
The representatives of the 18 states and the district presented a "friendly" letter on Friday in Washington to show their support for an asylum applicant facing the current directive, NBC News reported.
The full name of the applicant has not been revealed in the case "Grace v. Sessions" which the U.S. Civil Liberties Union (ACLU, American Civil Liberties Union) submitted in August against federal policy.
He said that his partner "and his children, who are members of a violent gang," abused her, but U.S. officials rejected her asylum application on 20 July.
He was arrested in Texas.
Lawyers representing these states that defend Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which generate a large number of asylum applications in the United States, as countries facing generalized problems related to domestic violence and pandemics.
The new U.S. asylum policy revoked a 2014 decision by the Migration Appeals Board (BIA) that undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence could apply for asylum in this country.
The Attorney-General of the District of Colombia, Karl Racine, made a statement on Friday, which stated that the new policy "ignores decades of international, federal and state law".
"According to federal law, all claims for asylum must be made due to the particular facts and circumstances of the claim and, in turn, this exception violates that principle," says the curiae friend.
Lawyers also indicated in writing that policies that deny income to immigrants damage the U.S. economy by claiming that they often become more frequent entrepreneurs and "subsisting a necessary labour force".
The General Criminal Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges not to grant asylum to victims fleeing from domestic abuse and gang violence in June.
"People who leave their countries of origin for persecution or threats of race, religion, nationality or belonging to a particular social group or political opinion may apply for asylum," said Sessions when this Directive was announced on 11 June.
The asylum has never been created as a measure to deal with all problems, not even all serious problems, which face daily people all over the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu while increasing the number of deaths in a career to find survivors
For survivors, the situation was getting worse.
"The situation is very tense," said Risa Kusumuma, a 35-year-old mother, while trying to console her baby with fever at an evacuation centre in the devastated city of Palu.
"Every minute there are ambulances with more bodies.
And clean water is scarce."
Some residents have returned to their destroyed homes to find among the few agreed property that they remain in an effort to recover as much as they can.
There are hundreds of people injured and hospitals, also damaged by 7.5 magnitude earthquake, are depleted.
Some of the wounded; among them, Dwi Haris, who has a broken back and a broken shoulder, rested on the outside of the Palu Army Hospital, where patients were treated outside the building because of continued relapses, as well as very strong.
He couldn't avoid crying when he reported to us the violent earthquake he lived while he was on the 5th floor of the hotel with his wife and daughter.
"We didn't have time to save ourselves.
I was caught in the remains of the ruined wall, I believe," reported Haris to Associated Press. He and his family were in the city to celebrate a wedding.
"I listened to my wife ask for help and then a terrible silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my daughter.
I hope they're okay."
U.S. Ambassador charges China to "bullying" with "propagandistic ads"
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page notice in a U.S. newspaper promoting mutual benefits of trade between the United States and China, the US ambassador in China accused Beijing of using the North American press to spread its propaganda.
Last Wednesday, U.S. President Donald Trump referred to China's Dayly payment supplement in the Moines Register, the most sold newspaper in Iowa, after accusing China of wanting to interfere in the elections at the United States Congress on 6 November, something that China is reluctantly denying.
The accusation that Trump launched on Beijing's attempt to influence US elections marked what U.S. officials pointed to Reuters as a new phase in a growing campaign launched by Washington to pressure China.
While it is common for foreign governments to publish ads to promote their commercial activities, Beijing and Washington are currently blocked in a growing trade war that has led them to increase tariff levels in imports by both parties.
China's countervailing tariffs applied at the beginning of the trade war were thought to relocate to exporting States such as Iowa, which supported the Republican Party of Trump, according to Chinese and US experts.
Terry Branstad, U.S. Ambassador in China and the former governor of Iowa, who is one of China's main exporters of agricultural products, said Beijing had damaged North American workers, farmers and businesses.
According to Branstad in an opinion article in the Des Moines Register of Sunday, China "is still intensifying that pressure with advertising publications in our free press".
"To try to spread its propaganda, the government of China applies to the noble North American tradition of freedom of expression and prints free when trying to publish a payment notice in the Des Moines Register," writes Branstad.
"On the other hand, in the corner of the street where we are here in Beijing, there are only a few shocking voices and no real reflection of the disillusionment that people in China can have about the worrying trajectory that is taking over the economy of their country, as the media are controlled by the strong pressure of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of the most relevant newspapers in China has praised the offer to publish" its article, although it did not specify what paper was being dealt with.
Analysts point out that the Republicans are distanced from women before the vote to half of the legislation with the Kavanaugh debache
As many prominent Republicans are closing ranks in favour of the candidate to the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh against the various allegations of sexual aggression, analysts have warned that a retrocessment, especially by women, may occur in the next ballots held in mid-legislator.
The emotions surrounding this event have been very intense and are many Republicans who have expressed their desire to proceed with the vote.
"In this kind of case it is impossible to go back," said Grant Reeher, a professor of Political Science at the Maxwell School of the University of Syracuse, to The Hill in an article published on Saturday.
Reeher expressed doubts that the last attempt by Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arisona) to position itself in favour of the FBI's investigation would be sufficient to calm down the votes cast on this issue.
"Women won't forget what happened yesterday; they won't forget it tomorrow or November," said Dr. Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior consultant and national spokesman of the progressive group MoveOn, according to the Washington, D.C.
On Friday morning, the demonstrators gathered at the doors of the Senate were singing "November is eating!" (November will soon!) at the time when the Republicans who controlled the Judicial Committee decided to proceed with the candidacy of Kavanaugh, despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, told the Mick.
"The enthusiasm and motivation of the democracies comes from everything predictable," said Stu Rothenberg, a non-partist political analyst at the news site.
"People say the impact is already very relevant and, in fact, it is.
But it could be even more, especially among women undecided from the neighborhoods of abortions and younger voters between the ages of 18 and 29, who do not often vote although they do not like the president."
Even prior to Ford's public testimony in which he had detailed allegations of sexual abuse against the candidate of the Supreme Court, analysts indicated that a delay could be made if the Republicans continued with the confirmation.
"This issue has become a major issue for the Republican Party," said Michael Steele, former president of the National Committee of the Republican Republican, at the beginning of last week, according to NBC News.
"It is not just a matter of the Committee's vote or the final vote, nor of whether they sit in the balcony in Kavanaugh; it is also the way the Republicans have handled all this and how they have dealt with it," said the news channel Guy Cecil, director of US Priorities (a group that helps in the democratic election).
However, the Americans seem to be divided; they do not know who they should believe after Ford and Kavanaugh's testimony, although they are a few more than that.
In a new YouGov survey, 41% of respondents believe in a definitive or probable Ford witness, while 35% claim to believe in a definitive or probable way in Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38% said that he thought that Kavanaugh had lied during his testimony, while 30% said the same thing about Ford.
Following Flake's campaign, the FBI is currently investigating Ford's statements, as well as at least the other complainant's statements, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Ford testified under oath before the Senate's Judicial Commission last week and indicated that Kavanaugh had raped her at the age of 17.
Ramirez, for his part, claimed that the candidate at the Supreme Court showed his genitals at a party when he studied in Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web is planning to launch a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a new company that is trying to rival Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Inrupt is the last project of the technology legend. A company based on the Open Code Platform of Berners-Lee.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and which people will have access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intention behind Inrupt is "to dominate the world".
"It has to be now," he said about the startup.
"It's a historic moment."
The application uses Solid technology so that users can create their own "online personal data storage" or a POD.
It can contain lists, lists of pending tasks, calendar, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available in a browser at the same time.
The only thing that is exclusive in the personal data storage is that the user is who decides who can fully access what type of information.
The company calls it "personal training through data".
The idea of Inrupt, according to company director general John Bruce, is to incorporate the resources, processes and skills needed to enable Solid to reach the world.
Currently, the company is formed by Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform that bought IBM, some of the developers included in the template that were hired to work on the project and a community of volunteer programmers.
From this week, technological developers around the world could create their own decentralised apps with the tools available on Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are not talking with "Facebook and Google about whether or not a radical change will be introduced where all their business models are completely modified from one day to another.
"We're not going to ask for permission."
In a medium publication on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote about Inrupt that "his mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web created in Solid".
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) was founded at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has played a very influential role in the debate on network neutrality.
Despite being launching Inrupt, Berners-Lee will continue to be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am incredibly optimistic about this next time of the web," added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: The clergyman who won a Cross Victoria in World War I
The only clergyman of the Church of England who won a Cross Victoria during World War I as a fighter has been honored in his hometown 100 years later.
Colonel Lord Bernard Vann received this decoration on September 29, 1918 at the attack of Bellenglish and Lehacourt.
However, a francutor killed him four days later, and I never thought they had given him the greatest British military honor.
On Saturday, their two grandsons discovered a monumental stone in a crash in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of them, Michael Vann, said it was "of a special symbolism" that would discover the stone exactly 100 years after the battle that made him deserve the decoration of his grandmother.
According to London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Colonel Vann led his battalion through the Canal of Saint-Quentin "through a black and under the intense fire of mortars and cannons".
Then he ran up to the fire line and, with the "great bravery", advanced the line before reaching a cannon with one hand and landing three of the highlight.
Colonel Vann killed him on 4 October 1918, only one month after the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said that the actions he carried out his grandfather were "so great that I could never reach his height, but they were very exciting".
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also deposited a crown of flowers after the show, which included the participation of the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that "it was all a privilege for him to be part of the disfile" and added that "the value of an authentic hero is patented when he is shown a lot of support".
The MMA's followers were awake all night for the Bellator 206, but they only saw Peppa Pig
Imagine that you stay all night awake to see all the Bellator 206 so that you will not finally let him see the main event.
San José's cartel had 13 matches, six included in the main card, and in the United Kingdom was going to transmit directly by night to Canal 5.
At 6 p.m., just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to face, the United Kingdom's spectators remained anonymous when the program changed to Peppa Pig.
To some he didn't surprise after having had to stay awake until the first hour of the morning just to see the war.
A follower on Twitter described the change to animated drawings as "a heavy joke".
"There is a government rule that regulates the content issued from 6 a.m. and this was not appropriate, so they had to change the programming of children," said Dave Schwartz, senior marketing and communication vice-president of Bellator, when we asked him about the transmission.
"Peep the chain," yes.
The president of Bellator, Scott Cooker, said that the programme would be modified to include British spectators in the next issues.
"When I think about the transmission option, I think it can work," said Cooker.
"But it's at 6:00 a.m. on Sunday, so we couldn't do it until Sunday at our hour, which would already be Monday for them.
We're seeing how to do it.
I believe that when the programming changed, a large number of messages were received and not all were kind, exactly.
We tried to fix it, because at first we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't like that. It was a government problem.
I can promise it won't happen next time.
We're going to reduce it to five wars instead of six, which are the ones we've usually done. We're trying to offer more than usual so that the fans were happy and we're going through.
It's a very unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt lower because of his sexuality
Olympic skipper Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to the rest because of his sexuality, although this was, in turn, what motivated him to become a triunfator.
At the age of 24, he told us that he didn't care until the second came that "they weren't all like me."
In the first program of Desert Island Discs from Radio 4, presented by Lauren Laverne, he said his intention in talking about gay rights was to transmit "hope" to others.
He also told us that becoming a father made it necessary to begin to be important in winning the Olympics.
The usual representative of this mythical program, Kirsty Young, will be absent for a few months by disease.
In Laverne's first program, Daley, which was shown himself as a marginalized, commented that he felt "lower" than the rest of his childhood, because "he was socially not accepted that you would like children and girls".
He said: "To this day, that feeling of inferiority and differentness has been what has really given me power and strength to triumph."
I wanted to prove that he was "something," he said, so he didn't give up when he finally discovered his sexuality.
The winner of two bronze medals in the Olympics has become a prominent profile of the LGBT movement and his image has been used in the Games of the Commonwealth this year held in Australia to claim that more countries deplore homosexuality.
He said he told him because he felt lucky to live in freedom, without repressions, and wanted to pass that "hope" on to others.
The third time the world champion said that for him it was also a surprise to fall in love with a man, the US filmer Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013.
Daley married last year to the winner of an Oscar, who was 20 years old, although he specified that the age difference had never been a problem.
"When you live so young" (he was at his first 14-year-old Olympic Games and his father died of cancer three years later), it is difficult to find someone of the same age that has passed by the same high and low ones you have.
The couple had a son in June who was called Robert Ray Black-Daley and Daley said his "global perspective" had changed.
"If I had been asked last year, all the answers would have turned around 'I have to get a gold medal'," he said.
"But he knows what, there are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is no doubt Robbie."
His son is called his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after diagnosed with a brain cancer.
Daley said his father didn't accept that he was going to die and, in fact, one of the last things he asked was whether they had the steps to London 2012, because he wanted to be in the first row.
"I couldn't tell him I couldn't be in the first row," he said.
"I had his hand between me and him when he stopped breathing and was not until that very moment when he stopped breathing and died that I realized he was not invincible," he commented.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze medal.
"At that time I knew that that was what I had dreamed of all my life: to compete in the pool before mine in some Olympic Games, there was nothing better," he said.
This fact was also what inspired him at the time of choosing his first song, Proud de Heather Small, who accompanied him in the preparation phase of the Olympic Games. He was still put on Gallin's skin.
Desert Island Discs is released on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson, in low shape, stayed in the bathroom at Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will set up a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th game at Ryder Cup, but he will have to turn his way if he wants to avoid becoming a sad hero.
Mickelson, who played at the event every two years to get a record for 12th time, was dismissed by Captain Furyk for the Fourballs and Foursomes of the Sabbath.
Instead of being at the centre of action, as many times it has done for the United States, the five times major tournaments had to comply with animation at some point and, others, try to perfect their game in the field and thus correct what hurts him.
Never the directest drivers, not even at the highest moment of their career, the 48-year-old player is not in his best form for the Le Golf National field, where the long race continues to beat with wrong blows.
And, if the field is no longer encouraging enough, Mickelson, at the ninth game of Sunday, faces the brilliant British Open, Francesco Molinari champion, who has joined the beginner Tommy Fleetwood to win the four matches that have played this week.
If the Americans, who were four points below the start of the 12 individual parties, started in an impressive way, the Mickelson party might have been decisive.
Furyk showed trust in his companion, and I couldn't say much more.
"He fully understood the role he had today, gave me a palm in his back and, surrounding me with his arm, said he would be ready tomorrow," said Furyk.
"He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He's in the Fama Hall and has contributed a lot to these teams before this week.
I probably didn't imagine it playing two games.
I thought they'd be more, but that's how he went out and that's how we thought he should be.
He wants to be there, like the rest."
On Sunday, Mickelson will overcome Nick Faldo's brand of most games played by Ryder Cup.
It could be the last of any Ryder Cups trajectory that had never been so clearly equal to the levels of its individual brand.
Mickelson has 18 gains, 20 losses and 7 equals, although Furyk said his presence has brought many more intangible values to the team.
"It's fun, sarcastic, intelligent, you like to get used to others; it's great to have it on the team," he explained.
"I think younger players like to have it as support, too this week; it was fun.
It's much more than just a game."
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that leadership can disappear very soon
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows very well that, even if you have a substantial advantage in the last days of Ryder Cup, you can easily turn into an uncomfortable tournament.
The Danish did his debut at the 1997 game in Valderama, where a band captained by Seven Ballesteros held a five-point advantage over the Americans, but eventually they only managed to finish with the other pistalls by a minimum margin, winning 1411⁄2-131/2.
"Don't stop remembering that we did a big tournament in Valderram; we also did it in Brooklyn and lost it, we did it in Valderram and won it but very little," said Bjorn, retired, after seeing the 2018 generation win 5-3 Friday and tomorrow lead it with a 10-6 in Le Golf National.
History will teach me and the whole world that this team is not over.
You have to give it every morning.
Get out there and do what you have to do.
This doesn't end until the points are in the marker.
We have a goal to achieve, that is to win this trophie, and that's the only thing we have to think about.
I say it all the time, I focus on the 12 players of our team, but we are very aware of what is on the other side where they are, neither more nor less, than the world's best players."
proud of what his players have done in a very hard golf field, Bjorn added: "I don't want to go on.
Tomorrow is a different challenge.
What prevails tomorrow is individual actions and this is different.
It's great to share what's going on with a fellow when things are going well, but when they're just there, you're trying to prove all your ability as a golfer.
That's the message you have to send to players, get the best out of the same morning.
Now you need to leave one side to your partner, go and get the best out of one."
In front of Bjorn, his homologous Jim Furyk will try to make his players do it better individually than they did as partners, being the exceptions Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who sum up three points of four.
The same Furyk has been on both ends in the last days of those great tournaments and has become part of the team that won in Brooklyn and then ended up losing when Europe carried out the "Midnah Miracle".
"I remember every word," he told us when we asked him how Ben Crenshaw, Captain in 1999, managed to motivate his players on the last day.
"We have 12 super important parties tomorrow, but we have to start as well as we did in Brooklyn, as you saw in Medinah.
When we all move forward in a direction, all pressure comes into those intermediate parties.
We defined our strategy and made them come out with the feeling that we were going to try to do something magical tomorrow."
Thomas was assigned the task of trying to lead the war and facing Rory McIllroy at the main party, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, the other Europeans on the second half of the list.
"I went with this group of boys in this order because I think they're covering the whole race," Bjorn said about his individual selections.
The new German warship, next again
The new flagship of the German Navy should have been charged in 2014 to replace the old vessels of the Cold War era, but it will not be carried out until at least the year due to defective systems and the progressive increase in costs, local media reported.
The delivery of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the ship headed by the new Baden-Württemberg class, has now been filed by the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit.
The ship should have joined the Armament in 2014, but the problems arising after delivery intensified the conclusion of the ambitious project.
The four ships of the Baden-Wuertemberg class that requested the Navy in 2007 will replace the old Bremen class fleets.
We know that they will include a powerful cannon, a set of anti-air and anti-ships missiles, as well as some invisibility technologies, such as radar signals, infrared signals and very low acoustics.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods so that they can be deployed up to two years away from the ports of origin.
However, the continued delays have caused ships (which were supposed to allow Germany to design its power further) to be too early when they begin to serve, says Die Zeit.
The unfortunate F125 fragrant took possession last year, when the German Navy officially refused to put the ship in operation and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shooter in Hamburg.
It's been the first time Marina returned a ship to an asterisk after her delivery.
Little was known about the reasons behind the return, but the German media cited a number of crucial "software and hardware defects" that left the ship practically useless if sent to a combat mission.
The software deficits were particularly important, as Baden-Wuertemberg ships will be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors: half of the staff who were in the old Bremen-class fractures.
It was also found that the ship has excessive overload, which reduces its performance and limits the capacity of the marine to add future updates.
It is believed that the 7,000-tonnes "Rheinland-Pfalz" is twice the weight of other similar class ships used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to defective hardware, the price of the whole project, including training of the crew, has also been a problem.
It is believed that it has reached €3300 million (3600 million), instead of €2200 million initials.
The problems contributing to the new fleets are of particular importance in the light of recent warnings about the reduction of Germany's shippower.
At the beginning of this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament's defence committee, acknowledged that the Army is "dwelling without ships capable of being deployed".
The officer said the problem was getting worse over time, because the old ships were given down, but they have not been replaced with others.
He regretted that none of the Baden-Wuertemberg class fractures could have joined the Navy.
The National Trust Spiezes the Secret Life of Murderers
This new research, which has been carried out in a state of Scottish Highlands, tries to find out how the ants use the landscape in their search for food.
It is expected that everything you experience will shed more light on the behaviour of the only flying mammals and help guide the next conservation activities.
The study, carried out by the National Trust for Scotland, will follow the common and supranational murciellas, as well as the daubenton Riveral murciellas and long earmarks of Inverwe gardens in Western Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in strategic property locations to track the activities of the mackerel during the period.
The NHS template and volunteers will also carry out mobile research with portable detectors.
Experts will analyze the sounds collected in recordings to find out the frequency of the calls of the mucous membranes and what species they do.
A report and a map of the habitat will then be produced to create a detailed picture of the environment and its behavior.
Rob Dewar, nature conservation consultant for NTS, hopes that the results reveal which habitat areas are more important for the ants and how they use each species.
This information will determine the benefits of the housing management work, such as the creation of floors and how forests should be maintained for mulciélaga and other associated species.
In Scotland and the United Kingdom, the populations of muciélagas have been considerably reduced in the last century.
They are under threat of construction and development affecting their kidneys and loss of their habitat.
Wind turbines and electric cable can also pose a risk for them, such as insecticide paper and other chemical treatments of construction materials or domestic cat attacks.
The bullets aren't really blind,
but because of their night hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes to achieve their goal.
They use a sophisticated eco-location technique that locates hormones and obstacles in their flight route.
The NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historical buildings, 38 major gardens and 76,000 hectares of land throughout the country, takes the topic of the most serious massacres.
It has ten trained experts on the subject, who are dedicated to carrying out regular investigations, kidney inspections and, at times, rescues.
The organization has even opened up the first and only reserve dedicated to Scottish mammoths in the state of Drave in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of the ten species of Scotland.
Property director David Thompson says it's the ideal territory for them.
"Here, in Thrave, we have a fantastic area for murder," he said.
"We have old buildings, many Veteran trees and all the adequate housing.
However, there are still many things unknown about the musculoskeletals, so the work we do here and in other properties will help us better understand what they need to develop."
Stresses the importance of verifying whether there are massacres before carrying out maintenance tasks within the property, since a colony of cattle can be destroyed in an involuntary manner and could be killed by 400 women and children, which would suggest that the entire local population be animating.
The bullets are protected and it is illegal to kill them, kill them or disturb them, as well as destroy their colonies.
Elizabeth Ferrell, the Scottish official responsible for Bat Conservation Trust, has encouraged the public to cooperate.
He said, "We still have much to learn about mammals and many other species that we don't know how their populations evolve."
Ronaldo rejects the allegations of rape while his lawyers follow the German magazine
Christian Ronaldo has categorized rape complaints as "fake news", and says that people "want to get to know" at the cost of his name.
Their lawyers have received instructions to report to the German newspaper Der Spiegel, which was where the statements were published.
In front of Portugal and the Juventus he is accused of violating a U.S. woman named Kathryn Mayorga at a Las Vegas hotel in 2009.
He is accused of paying $375 000 for hiding the incident, reports Der Spiegel on Friday.
With an Instagram Live video that has already accumulated 142 million followers an hour after the news was published, Ronaldo, 33 years old, addressed the report as "fake news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is false," says the fifth winner of the Golden Balloon looking at the camera.
"They only want publicity at the expense of my name.
It's the same story forever.
They want to be famous just to mention me, but that's how I can't avoid it.
I'm a happy man and everything's fine," added the player, smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing a request to Der Spiegel for allegations that appear in what they have called "an unacceptable report of suspects in the field of privacy", reports Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said that the player will try to get compensation for "the moral damage due to a quantity corresponding to the severity of the injury, which is probably one of the most serious violations of his personal rights in recent years".
It seems that the alleged incident took place in June 2009 in a suite of Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a night club, Ronaldo and Majorga were reportedly in the player's room and there he reportedly violated her anonymously, according to the documents recorded in the Clark County District Court Tribunal in Nevada.
Majorga stated that Ronaldo was surrounded after the alleged incident and told him that he was in a "99 per cent" a "good boy" and that he had defrosted that "one per cent" remaining.
The documents state that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex but that he had been consented.
Majorga also claimed that she was a police officer and that they had photographed the injuries in the hospital, but later she agreed to come to an extrajudicial settlement because she had "terrorous repressions" and worried about "be humiliated in public".
The 34-year-old woman says she's trying to cancel the agreement, since she's still traumatized by the facts.
When the alleged aggression occurred, Ronaldo was about to join the Royal Madrid from Manchester United and this summer he changed to Juve, a large Italian football for a 100 million € contract.
Brexit: The United Kingdom would always regret losing car manufacturers
The United Kingdom would "repent all life" if it lost its position as world leader in car manufacturing after Brexit, said the Secretary of Industry, Greg Clark.
He added that it was "anxious" that Toyota UK reported to the BBC that if Britain had left the EU without an agreement, production would be temporarily stopped in its Burnaston factory near Derby.
"We need an agreement," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese manufacturer stated that the impact of delays in customs in the case of a Brexit without agreement could result in loss of work.
Burnaston plant, which manufactures models Auris and Aventis from Toyota, produced some 150 000 cars last year, of which 90 % were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My opinion is that if Britain breaks with the EU at the end of March there will be production patterns in our factory," said Marvin Cooke, director general of Toyota in Burnaston.
Other UK car manufacturers have shown their fears about EU exit without agreement, especially in relation to cross-border trade, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says he'll close his Mini plant in Oxford a month after Brexit.
The main concerns of car manufacturers are the problems that could arise in the assembly chains in the case of an unaccompanied Brexit.
The Toyota production line is based on the adjusted production mode ("just in time") where the parts arrive every 37 minutes from United Kingdom and EU suppliers to manufacture cars for use.
If the United Kingdom leaves the European Union without an agreement on 29 March, an interruption could occur at the border which, according to the sector, could lead to delays and loss of stocks.
For Toyota it would be impossible to accommodate the amount of materials equivalent to more than one day of inventory on its Derbyshire farm, the company said and, in that case, production would be stopped.
Mr. Clark said that the Chess Plan of Theresa May, where future relations with the EU are established, is "ally calibrated to avoid such controls in border steps".
"We need an agreement. We want to have the best agreement that not only allows us to get out of the way right now but we have to take advantage of the opportunity," said BBC Radio 4.
"The evidence of Toyota, among many other manufacturers, is that we must be able to continue with what has so far been a set of supply chains very successful."
Toyota has not been able to say how long production would take place, but warned that, in the long term, the added costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and, ultimately, the costs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working in Burnaston for 24 years and is responsible for the United Union union on the farm, said that its members are increasingly concerned: "My experience, once these jobs are lost, they will never be recovered."
A government spokesman said: "We have launched a precise and convincing plan that limits our future relations with the EU."
The Trump meeting with Rosenstein could be rescinded, according to the White House
The high-risk meeting of Donald Trump with the Deputy Prosecutor General Rod Rosenstein could "bet another week", as he continued the debate on the candidate to the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh, said the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Adviser Robert Mueller, who is investigating interventions in the Russian elections, links between the assistance of Trump and Russia, and a possible obstacle to justice by the President.
The expectation before Trump decides to send the general vice-president or not and thus compromises Mueller's independence has fed Washington's cocktails for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had recorded the conversations he had with Trump with a microphone that he himself had taken to try to hand over to the President through the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein refused to be right.
However, last month he went to the White House, among other things, where it was said that he was about to give up.
A meeting with Trump (at the time he was in the United Nations in New York) was announced for Thursday.
Trump said that "I would not" to send Rosenstein, but the meeting had to be put in place to avoid a conflict with the hearing of the U.S. Senate judicial committee in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual aggression, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, testified.
On Friday, Trump asked the FBI to investigate the charges against Kavanaugh for a week, although this might delay the full vote of the Senate.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News Sunday.
When asked about the meeting of Rosenstein, he said: "No date has been defined, it could be this week or it could be postponed, considering all that is happening with the Supreme Court.
We're going to decide on the move and I'm going to inform the press, like I'm going to do."
Some journalists would deny this statement: Sanders has not been doing any press tour in the White House since 10 September.
The rapporteur, Chris Wallace, asked what the reasons were.
Sanders said that the lack of press wheels was not due to an advert to TV journalists who act with generosity, although he said, "I will not be disappointed by the fact that they fanfaron."
Then she suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press be increased.
"The President held more questions and answers than any other President had previously said," he said, as he quoted without proof: "We have answered those numbers."
Press wheels will continue to be carried out, Sanders said, but "if the press has the option to ask the President of the United States directly, I think it's much better than you would have done me.
We tried to do it many times and you've seen us do it many times in the last few weeks, so this would replace a press wheel when you could talk to the president of the United States."
Trump often answers questions when it comes to the White House or when he attends public meetings or press shows with the dignitaries who visit him.
Press conferences with him only take place on very rare occasions.
In fact, this week, in New York, the president demonstrated why he was like this, where he made a rash appearance and, at strange times, before the journalists who were gathered there.
The State Secretary of Health writes to EU workers from NHS Scotland about their fear of Brexit
The Secretary of State of Health has written to the EU template working on Scotland's HHS to express the country's gratitude and wish to continue with them after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman MSP sent a letter only six months before the United Kingdom withdrew from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed itself to covering the cost of requests for citizenship for EU members working in public services that do not depend on central power.
In her letter, Mrs Freeman wrote: "During the summer, negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union on the exit to which she was chosen for taking the expected decisions this autumn.
However, the United Kingdom Government has also intensified preparations around a possible scenario in which there was no agreement.
I know all this must be very disagreeable for you.
And it is, therefore, that I would like to reiterate now how valuable the contribution of each of the staff members is regardless of their nationality.
Professionals from all over the EU and other countries contribute valuable experience and many skills to strengthen and improve the work of the health service, which benefits patients and communities to which we serve.
Listen is, without any doubt, your home and we would like to keep telling you."
Christion Abercrombie is operating suddenly after suffering a headache
Christion Abercrombie, a player from Tennessee State Tigers, was surgically involved after suffering an injury on his head last Saturday, when they lost 31-27 against Vanderbilt Commodores, told Mike Organ of Tennessee.
The trainer of Tennessee State, Rod Reed, told reporters that the injury occurred shortly before rest.
"I came to the band and dropped out right there," Reed said.
Both trainers and medical personnel administered oxygen to Abercrombie on the band line before placing it in a camilla and taking it into consideration in depth.
A member of the Tennessee State template told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had been out of surgery at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there was no details about the type of injury yet or the damage caused" and Tennessee State is trying to figure out when it happened.
Abercrombie, redshirt sophomore, is playing in its first season with Tennessee State after being transferred from Illinois.
He made five thanks on Saturday before leaving the camp, with which he took a total of 18 throughout the season.
Foreigners will be subject to higher fines tax when they buy a property in the United Kingdom
Foreigners will be subject to a higher fine transfer tax when they buy a property in the United Kingdom and the extra money recovered by this measure will be used to cover "uncovered", according to the new conservation plans of the conservators.
The change will neutralize the success achieved by Corbyn's offensive to attract young voters
The increase in fines tax will be imposed on those persons who are not paying taxes in the United Kingdom
The Treasury expects to recover up to £120 million a year to be allocated to "uncovered"
The additional money paid by increasing the transfer tax of fines to foreign buyers of properties in the United Kingdom will be for aid to "uncovered", announced Theresa May today.
The measure is understood as an attempt to neutralize the success being achieved by Jeremy Corbyn with his promises to provide more affordable housing to attract younger voters and to attract those who have higher incomes.
The increase in fines tax will be recorded to persons and businesses who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom and that money will be aimed at encouraging government policy to combat the problem of fraud on the streets.
The recharge, which is an addition to the current transmission tax, including the increase in levels introduced two years ago on second-hand housing and the "buy-to-let" system, could be up to 3 %.
The Treasure expected to recover up to £120 million a year with this change.
It is estimated that about 13% of London's new construction properties are purchased by people who do not live in the United Kingdom, resulting in increased prices and difficulties that purchasers may first have access to affordable housing.
Many of the most advanced areas of the country (especially in capital) have become "fantama cities" due to the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson claims a reduction in the transmission tax in order to help young people buy their first home.
He urged the great builders to keep very high prices in the properties when purchasing land with no intention of using it and urged Mrs. May to remove the quotas applicable to affordable housing to solve the "dignified housing problem" in Great Britain.
Mr. Corbyn has announced a series of very attractive reforms for housing, including rental controls and the end of unreasonably leaving.
It also proposes to grant the most powerful local authorities to build new houses.
Ms. May said: " Last year I said I would dedicate my role as Prime Minister to restoring the British dream to improve the life of each new generation.
And that means solving the housing market, which is so destructive.
Great Britain will always be open to those who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, those who do not live in the United Kingdom, as well as foreign companies, can buy housing with greater ease than the British working class.
The dream of having a house has become something too difficult to reach for many people and the humiliation of having to sleep on the street is still too real."
Jack Ross: "My primary goal is to direct Scotland"
Sunderland trainer says his "primordial objective" is to become a trainer from Scotland at some point.
The 42-year-old Scoces is illustrated before the possibility of revitalizing the North-East Club, which currently occupys the third position in the League One (the third division of links from England), to three points from the first.
It went to the Stadium of Light this summer after taking to St. Mirren again to the Scottish Prime Minister the last season.
"I wanted to play for my country when I was a player.
But I just got a B gor," Ross said in Sports Sound at BBC Scotland.
"But I grew up to see Scotland in Hampden with my father when he was a child and it's something he has always done that he wants to come back.
This opportunity will only turn into reality, however, if I succeed in leading a club."
Among the presidents of Ross as head of Sunderland are Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardice, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former director of the Athletic Alloa said he felt no fear when he went through so many names set up in such a large club, after rejecting Barnsley and Ipswich Town's proposals.
"At this point, success for me is measured by whether I can return to this club to the First League,
because the structure and facilities of this club undoubtedly correspond to those of the First League," he said.
"It's not easy to get it, but I could only think I've achieved my goal here when I can go back to the club where I should be."
Ross only spends three years practicing as a coach, after being a time assistant in Dumbarton and a 15-month period in the heart's technical body.
Then he helped Alloa recover from the decline to the third division and made St. Mirren pass on the edge of the decline to win the championship at the next season.
In fact, Ross says he feels more comfortable now than ever before during his career as a player in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"Probably it was an intrusion authentic," he recalled in reference when he was charged with the Alloa.
"I always thought the direction was what was best for me, much more than playing.
It can sound strange, because it was good, I could get a very good life with it and enjoy some epic moments.
But playing can be very hard.
You have to face a lot of things every week.
I still suffer the stress and pressure of this work; however, I feel good in the direction.
I always wanted to train and now I've been able to do it, is the age of my adult life in which I have felt better, without any doubt."

According to one survey, the perfect time for a painting is 5.30 a.m. on Saturday morning
The summer’s heat wave has inspired the gains in British pubs who struggle to survive, but focused all the pressure on restaurants chains.
Pubs and bars saw how they increased their sales by 2.7% in July, while restaurants' profits fell by 4.8%, according to figures.
Peter Martin, from CGA's consultation, who was responsible for collecting the figures, commented: "The warmth of these days and the fact that England continues to be in the world have still made it possible to maintain the pattern of the previous month of June, in which the pubs increased their profits by 2.8%, although restaurants have fallen even more.
The fall of 1.8% in the market activity of restaurants in June was even worse in July.
Pubs and bars serving mainly drinks had their strongest month, in front of most restaurants, in which they reduced profits.
Pubs serving mainly food also suffered with heat, although not as drastic as restaurant operators.
Looks like people just want to get out for a drink.
In managed bars and pubs, the sales of drinks increased by up to 6.6% during the month, while the meals fell by 3%.
Paul Newman, of RSM's hostel analysts and host, said: "These results follow the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The time and impact of very important social events or sports events remains the most relevant factors in terms of sales in the non-home business market.
It is not surprising that restaurants continue to fight, although the decline of 4.8% in sales compared to last year will be particularly painful in view of the continued cost pressures.
The long and hot summer could not have arrived at a better time for gastronomic operators and the time will tell if the most moderate temperatures we had in August will provide the relief they need.
The total increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, including the new ones that opened, was 2.7% in July, reflecting the slow decline in brand implants.
In Coffer Peach Tracker, which supervises sales in the UK restaurants, bars and pubs, the performance data of 47 operating groups are collected and analysed, with a combined invoice of more than $9000 million and is the market reference value.
One out of every five children has secret accounts on social networks in support of their parents
One out of five children (some even 11 years of age) have secret accounts on social networks in support of their parents and teachers, according to a survey
The survey, conducted to 20,000 secondary students, revealed an increase in Instagram’s false pages
News has aroused the fears that sexual content has been published
About 20% of students said they had a "primary" account showing their parents
One out of five children (some even 11 years of age) create social networks that hide adults.
A survey of 20,000 secondary students revealed the rapid growth experienced in Instagram’s false accounts, a reference site for sharing photos.
News has voiced the fears that sexual content has been published.
About 20 per cent of students said they had a healthy "principal" account that they showed to their parents, while others were private.
A mother who occasionally met with her 13-year-old daughter's secret site saw how a teenager encouraged others to "violar me".
The research carried out by the Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters" and Headmasters" Conference of Independent Colleges (HMC) found that about 40% of children between the ages of 11 and 18 had two profiles, and half of them admitted to having private accounts.
Mike Buchanan, director of HMC, said: "It's alarming that so many teenagers are trying to create Internet spaces where their parents and teachers can't find them."
Eilh Doyle will be the "voice of athletes" in the directive of Scotland's Federation of Athletics
Eilh Doyle has been elected to form part of the directive of the Scotland Athletic Federation as non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the administrative body.
Doyle is the most prized athlete in the course and field of Scotland and its president, Ian Beattie, described the change as a great opportunity for those who claim to benefit from their great international experience in the past decade.
"Eilh is recognized and respected in all the communities of Scotland, the United Kingdom and the whole world, and we are sure that athleticism in Scotland will benefit greatly from counting with it in its directive," Beattie said.
Doyle said, "I like to be the voice of athletes and I hope I can bring things and help develop sports in Scotland."
The American, who won 200 metres and 400 meters in the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta between the four gold he won and is now an ordinary expert in the BBC, suffered a transitional ischemic attack that left him unable to walk.
He wrote on Twitter: "A month ago, I suffered a cerebrovascular accident.
I couldn't walk.
According to the doctors, only time would determine whether I would recover or how much time I would do it.
It was overwhelming, but I was able to recover completely, I had to learn to walk again and now I'm doing agility exercises.
Thank you for the messages and words of encouragement!"
The announcement of sacalches where compared to mothers with cows divides the opinion on the Internet
A sawmill company has shared public opinion on the Internet with an ad where it compares to mothers who shut up with cows they order.
To mark the launch of what is in theory is the "first silent sacals of the world", the technology company for consumer Elvie published an inspired announcement in a video with some ironic music showing to mothers who enjoy the freedom that the new milk extractor gives them.
Four real women dance in a garden full of hen in dance track mode, along with some cows, with letters like, "Yes, I order myself, but I don't have a doll" and "Because if you didn't notice it, they're not blind, they're my breasts."
The heart continues: "Organise them, order them, I'm feeding their babies, order them, order them, I'm ordering my women."
However, the announcement, published on the company's Facebook page, has created a great controversy.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received reactions from all sorts of people who have seen it, where many say it is possible to focus on the "horrors" of the dairy sector.
"A very unfortunate decision to put cows to announce this product.
Like us, they must be pregnant before they can light up to produce milk, except that they leave them to their babies days after they are married," wrote one person.
The milk extractor Elvie is deliberately adapted to a lactating subjecter (Elvie/Mother).
Another person commented: "Tramatic for the mother and the baby.
But, yes, why don't you use them to announce a milk extractor for mothers who really stay with their babies?"
Another comment was: "Look at a more unchallenged announcement."
However, other people defended the announcement, like a woman who admitted that the song was "distinct".
"I think it's a great idea.
If it still says Mom, I'm sure she'd have one.
When I used the bomb, I felt totally like a cow.
The ad is a little rented, but I don't give you any more back to it.
It's a product genius," said a woman.
Another person commented: "It's a kind announcement to mothers who use a lactan bomb (on occasions at work or in public places), which makes them feel like cows.
The announcement does not praise or condemn the dairy sector."
At the end of the video, the group of women shows that they have been dancing with the discrepancies placed within the subject.
The concept of the campaign is based on the perception that many women who take milk with the bomb say they feel like cows.
However, Elvie Pump is completely silent, has no cables or tubes, and is discreetly attached inside the lactating subject, which enables its users to move, subject their babies and even go out the street with the bomb in operation.
Ana Balarin, mother's company and ECD, comments: "The Elvie Pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a shocking and provocative launch.
By showing parallelism between expressive women and cows, what we intended was to draw attention to the use of lactating bombs and their challenges, as we demonstrated in a manner that was both pleasant and close to the incredible sense of freedom that the new bomb offers.
This is not the first time Elvie bomb appears in the headlines.
During the London Fashion Week, a mother of two children jumped over the corridor for designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of minor immigrants discreetly displaced to a camp on the Texas border
The number of minors detained has experienced a significant increase, although the monthly influence on the border has been practically maintained at the usual levels. In part, this is due to the rhetorical burden and policies introduced by the Trup administration are hampering the possibility of
Traditionally, most of the patriarchs, who were also undocumented immigrants at their time, feared that the fact of proposing to accommodate a child at risk was their own stay in the country.
This risk increased in June when the federal authorities announced that potential parents and other adult members of their families should present their fingerprints and that data would be shared with the immigration government entities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a high-ranking post of the Immigration and Customs Office, witnessed before the Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had asked to be looked after by unaccompanied minors.
The agency confirmed after it confirmed that about 70 per cent of the detainees had no previous criminal activity.
"About 80 per cent of sponsors or their families are illegal in the country, and a large part of them are criminal immigrants.
Therefore, we continue to pursue these people," said Albence.
In its commitment to process the smaller businesses, officials have introduced new rules requiring some of them to appear before the court within a maximum period of one month from the detention, instead of 60 days, which was the previous standard, according to the staff of the reception centres.
Many of them will testify by video conference, rather than by person, to defend their legal status before a judge for immigration matters.
Those who are not considered suitable for defence shall be deported as soon as possible.
According to the staff of the reception centres and the reports of the system that have emerged in recent months, the longer they remain under custody, the more likely they are to suffer anxiety or depression, which could lead to violent fights or refugee attempts.
According to the defenders, these concerns are increasing even more in larger facilities, such as the Tournillo, where it is more likely that due to its size, there are high rates of maltreatment in these children.
In addition, moving to the camp without having given them enough time to prepare them emotionally or to avoid their friends could cause them a trauma that many are already suffering.
Syria calls on the United States, France and Turkey to withdraw immediately
In a speech before the General Assembly of the United Nations, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also asked Syrian refugees to return to their homes, despite the fact that the country's war was in its eighth year.
Moualem, who is also the Deputy Prime Minister, said that foreign forces were illegally located in Syrian territory under the pretext of the fight against terrorism and that the theme "will be dealt with accordingly".
"They must be withdrawn immediately and without conditions," said the Assembly.
Moulalem insisted that the "war against terrorism has virtually ended" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions have seen their homes disintegrated.
He said that Damascus would continue "to fight in this sacred battle until we clear all Syrian territories" both from terrorist groups and from "any illegal foreign presence".
The United States has some 2,000 soldiers in Syria, mainly providing training and advice to the Kurdish and Arab forces of Syria that are opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 land soldiers in this country destroyed by the war.
On the issue of refugees, Moualem stated that the conditions were given for their return and blamed "some Western countries" for "severe irrational fears" that made refugees decide to stay out of the country.
"We have asked the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns," he said.
"They are politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian problem."
The United States and the European Union have already warned that they will not help with Syria's reconstruction until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats claim that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a containment area in Idlib's last major rebellion has created an opportunity to strengthen political talks.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey avoided a large-scale rise in the Syrian and Russian forces in the province, where three million people live.
However, Moualem has made it clear that the agreement had a "clear deadlines" and has expressed the hope that military action will focus on the Yihadists, including the fighters of the Nusra Front (connected to Al-Qaeda), who "will be eradicated".
Staffan de Mistura, a special envoy of the United Nations, hopes to convene soon the first meetings of a new committee composed of government members and opposition to drafting a post-war constitution for Syria and to pave the way for elections.
Moualem established conditions for the participation of the Syrian Government in the Committee, arguing that the work of the panel should be restricted to "review articles of the current constitution" and warned against any interference.
Why Trump's gonna get a second mandate
According to that logic, Trump would win the reelection in 2020 unless, as many liberal spectators will surely expect, a dictatorship or a scandal would precipitately end its presidency.
This would be without any doubt "The most dramatic end of a presidency ever seen!"
At the moment, no sign of fatigue is seen in the spectators.
Since 2014, the maximum audit time rates have doubled to 1.05 million for CNN and have virtually tripled to 1.6 million for MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million spectators in maximum hearing hours, compared to 1.7 million years ago, according to Nielsen, and "The Rachel Maddow Show" of MSNBC has exceeded the number of cable channels with 3.5 million spectators for the main night news programs.
"It's a strange attraction that we still cannot understand," comments Neal Baer, author of "Designed Survivor", a dramatic series of ABCs on a desk secretary who becomes president after an attack will destroy the Chapter.
In Scovell, a veteran comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club", has another theory.
Remember a taxi trip that took place in Boston before the 2016 elections.
The taxi driver told him he'd vote for Trump.
Why? He asked him.
"Because it makes me laugh," was the answer Scovell received.
The fall is always high in the entertainment world.
Of course, and unlike anything else seen on television, the arguments issued by Washington could determine the future of the Roe Case against Wade, the possibility that immigrant families can meet or the health of the global economy.
Disconnecting is a luxury that only the most privileged spectators can be allowed.
However, the information goes beyond the limits when you realize that you take six hours to see a panel of experts discussing the use of "deep background" sources that Bob Woodward used for his book "Fier", Paul Manafort's 15,000-knocking leather hunter ("a demeaned pride" in The Washington Post) and the implications of the extensive descriptions of Stormy Daniels of Trump's anatomy.
As far as I'm concerned, I'll never see Super Mario again the same way.
"By offering something new every night, it's part of what makes everything look like a reality show," says Brent Montgomery, executive director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of "Pown Stars", when we talk about the alternative department of Trump's show and its daily tour of the tram (whether entering into a fight against NFL or praising Kim Jong-un).
You can't let yourself lose an episode if you don't want to stay behind.
When I was talking to Mr. Fleiss this week, it was a sunny day of 27 degrees north coast of Kauai, but he was refugees inside the house when he saw MSNBC while he was writing CNN.
I couldn't get rid of the TV, not with Brett Kavanaugh ready to face the Senate's Court of Justice and with the future of the Supreme Court with a wire.
"I remember when in those days we did all these programme talks and people told us that this was the beginning of the end of Western civilization," Fleiss comments.
"I thought it was all a joke, but in the end it turned out they were right."

External money flows in the most adjusted half-mandate elections of the House of Representatives
It is not surprising that the money flow is reaching the 17th Pennsylvania district, thanks to the restructuring of a Congress district with two candidates seeking the reelection for the same stage.
This residential district of Pittsburgh, whose structure is recently redesigned, has the democratic representative Conor Lamb, who won his scene in another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb faces another candidate for re-election, Republican Keith Rothfus, who is currently represented by the old 12 district of Pennsylvania, a district that is largely sunny with the new 17.
The maps were redesigned after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania decided in January that the former districts had been constitutionally manipulated for the benefit of the Republicans.
The new 17 race has launched a funding content for the campaigns between the main financial arms of the parties, the National Democratic Campaign Committee (NCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NCRC).
Lamb's name became very familiar in Pennsylvania after a close victory in a special election held in March for the 18th Congress District of Pennsylvania.
This scandal had been occupied by a republican for over a decade and President Donald Trump won the district for 20 points.
Political experts have given democracies a slight advantage.
The United States considered penalizing El Salvador for its support in China, even after the exodus back
The diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with a slight rejection by Washington.
Trump had a close meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and hosted a hotel in Panama until the partners left the Trump administration team.
The officials of the Department of State decided to return to the heads of the United States diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of "the recent decisions to stop recognizing Taiwan", said Heather Nauert, the spokesman for the Department, in a communiqué this month.
But it was only decided to punish El Salvador, which had already received about $140 million in 2017 for, among other things, drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, which included cuts to financial assistance and restrictions to certain visas, would have been very painful for the Central American country and its high unemployment and crime rates.
As the internal meetings progressed, North American and Central American officials held a high-level conference on security and economic prosperity as a follow-up to a similar meeting held last year, which was seen as a step forward in efforts to avoid migration to the United States.
But in mid-September, the senior administration officials made it clear that their intention was to continue the conference, which would end any consideration of sanctions for El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence has planned to speak at the conference, which is now scheduled for mid-October and is viewed as a sign of the importance that administration has given to the meeting.
The three US emissaries peacefully returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without further threats or punishments by Washington.
A spokesman for the Bolton White House refused to comment on the details of the debate described by the three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to deal with internal discussions under the terms of anonymity.
His explanations were confirmed by an external analyst close to the administration, who also spoke under anonymity.
The Study of History
The next step could be the report of Special Lawyer Robert Mueller on the possible impediment to Trump's justice, of which there is already considerable evidence in the public record.
It is believed that Mueller is also taking this investigation into the possibility that the Trump campaign will work in parallel with Russia in its attack on our elections.
If the Congress changes its hands, Trump will see himself accountable to that camera, just as soon as he prepares to present himself again to the voters, and perhaps finally to a jury of his parents.
This is a number of conditions, and I therefore do not suggest that the fall of Trump is inevitable, not even its equivalent in Europe.
We will all have to make decisions on both sides of the Atlantic that will have an effect on the length of the continent.
In 1938, German officials were ready to give a state strike against Hitler. As soon as West would have resisted him and supported the Czechs in Munich.
We failed and lost the opportunity to avoid the years of carnage that followed.
The course of history revolves around these points of inflation, and the inevitable march of democracy is accelerated or delayed.
The North Americans are now faced with several of these inflation points.
What will we do if Trump asks the Deputy Prosecutor General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in good shape since this paper reported that last year he had suggested secretly writing to the President and had speculated about his inability to carry out his task.
Rosenstein says the explanation of The Times is not accurate.
"How will we respond if the new investigation requested by the F.B.I. on Brett Kavanaugh is incomplete or fair, or if its role in the Supreme Court is confirmed despite the credible allegations of sexual aggression and abuse of witness?
In addition to all this, will we vote in the mid-command elections a Congress that will account for Trump?
If we fail these exams, we will meet with a long winter for democracy.
But thanks to the lesson I learned in Prague, I don't think we'll fail.
My mother was a Czech Jew deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my ambassadorial home.
He managed to survive, emigrated to the United States and, 60 years later, sent me to burn the Sabbath candles at the same table with a swastika.
With that heritage, how can I not be optimistic about our future?"

Graham Dorrans de los Rangers, optimist before meeting with the Rapid Vienna
The Rangers will play Thursday at home against the Rapid Vienna, knowing that a victory over the Austrians, after the impressive impact in Spain against the Villareal at the beginning of the month, will place them in a strong position to be classified in Group G of the European Union.
An injury on the bike prevented mediocom champion Graham Dorrans from getting his first appearance from the season to the empathy of 2 to 2 against the Villareal, but he believes that Rangers can use this result as a trampoline for bigger things.
"We got a good point out, as Villareal is a good team," said the 31-year-old player.
"We started the game believing that we could get something and go out with a point.
Maybe we could have won the final victory, but, in general, empathy was perhaps a fair result.
They were better in the first half, but after the rest we went out for all and we were the best team.
We'll have another big European night tonight.
I hope we can achieve the three points, but it will be a difficult game because they have already achieved a good outcome in the previous game, but with all the public supporting us, I am sure that we can advance and achieve a positive outcome.
Last year was definitely hard with my injuries and changes in the club itself, but now a general environment is noted that everything will be fine.
The team is fine, the boys are enjoying a lot and we are having a good training.
I hope we can move forward, leave behind the past season and achieve success."
The fear of retirement savings is causing some women to lose their dream
Despite the fact that the participants had a clear idea of how they wanted to care for them, few people were talking about this with their families.
About half of the people who participated in the nationwide study said they were talking to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they were talking to their children on this subject.
"People want them to take care of a family member, but they are not taking steps to have this conversation," says Holly Snyder, vice-president of the Nationalwide life insurance company.
This is how to start.
Talk to your spouse and children: you will not be able to prepare your family for care if you do not express your wishes with sufficient advance.
Work with your consultant and your family to talk about where and how to get attention, as these options can be a determinant factor of cost.
Includes your financial adviser in the conversion, as it can also help him find a way to pay those costs.
Their long-term care funding options may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid life insurance policy with value in effect to help you cover your expenses or to make sure yourself with your own savings, provided you have money.
I negotiate your legal documents: advance to legal battles.
It is his duty to have a medical attention power to designate a trusted person who supervises his medical care and to ensure that professionals comply with their own wishes if he cannot communicate.
You can also prepare a notary power for your finances.
Select a trusted person to make financial decisions on behalf of him and ensure that his invoices are paid if he is incapacitated.
Do not forget the little details: Imagine your old father has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Describe all these details in a written plan so that it is always the point.
"It's not just the money that's in play: what doctors have to deal with?" Martin asks.
"What medicines are being taken?
Who's gonna take charge of the dog?
There must be everything planned."
Several times shoot a man with a carabin in Ilfracombe
Several times they shot a man with a carabine while he went home walking after going out in the night.
The victim, a man about 40 years old, was found in the area of Oxford Grove de Ilfracombe (Devon) when he received shots in his chest, abdomen and hand.
Police officers described the shooting, which took place about 02:30 (British time), as "an emergency act".
The victim didn't see his attacker.
Her injuries are not fatal and the police have made a call to possible witnesses.
Terremotos and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died because of a powerful earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palu last Friday, the authorities said. It is expected that the number of deaths will increase.
With blocked communications, assistance officers have not been able to obtain any information from the Regiment of Doghaa, a area in the north of Palu that is closer to the earthquake epicenter of magnitude 7.5.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here you can see some important details about Palu and Doghía on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of Sulawesi Central, which is located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 inhabitants in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when earthquakes and tsunamis occurred.
Donghura is a giant that extends over 300 km (180 miles) of the litoral in the northwest of the island of Sulawesi.
Regiance, which is a somewhat lower administrative region than the province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the pillars of the economy of the province of Sulawesi Central, particularly in the eastern region of Doghía.
Nikkel mines also have their importance in the province, but they focus mainly on Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Doghea have been affected by tsunamis several times in the past 100 years, according to the Indonesian Disaster Mitigation Agency.
In 1938 a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Doghía.
A tsunami also struck the west of Doghea in 1996, with nine fatal casualties.
Indonesia is located in the Cinturón de Fire del Pacífico, an area of great sysmic activity, and often suffers earthquakes with frequency.
We then sum up some of the main earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A large earthquake on the west coast of the province of Aceh of Indonesia, in northern Sumatra, caused a tsunami that affected 14 countries and took 26,000 lives on the Indian Ocean coast. More than half of the victims were killed in Aceh on December 26.
2005: A series of earthquakes hit the western coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
There were hundreds of dead victims on the island of Nias, on the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake hit southern Java, Indonesia's most popular island, and caused a tsunami that affected the southern coastal area, with nearly 700 deaths.

The eldest son of Sarah Palin arrested for domestic violence
Track Palin, the oldest son of the former governor of Alaska and candidate for Vice President Sarah Palin, has been arrested for assault charges.
Palin, a 29-year-old and a citizen of Wasilla (Alaska), was arrested under suspicion of domestic violence, interfering with a domestic violence report and resisting arrest, according to the report published on Saturday by the Alaska State Police.
According to that police report, when a well-known woman tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he removed his phone.
Palin has been sentenced to preventive prison in Mat-Su Pretreal Facility and is held with an unencumbered $500 loan, KTUU reported.
The Saturday was presented before the court, where it was declared "definitely innocent" when its statement was requested, the chain reported.
Palin is faced with three minor crimes of Class A, which means he could pass up to one year in prison and receive a fine of $250,000.
He has also been charged with a lower Class B crime, one day in prison and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time there are criminal charges against Palin.
In December 2017 he was charged with adding his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently before the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016 he was accused of domestic aggression, interfering in the charge of a crime of domestic violence and possession of a weapon in the state of pregnancy, in relation to the incident.
His girlfriend had said she gave him a kiss on her face.
Several groups of veterans criticized Sarah Palin in 2016 for linking her son's violent behavior with the post-raumatic stress disorder resulting from her service in Iraq.
Terreto and Tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds of deaths
At least 384 people died after an earthquake hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi last Friday.
The earthquake of a 7.5 magnitude caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
The electricity and communications networks have fallen and the number of deaths is expected to increase in the next few days.
The earthquake occurred just next to the center of Sulawesi, which is located north of Yakarta, the capital of Indonesia.
There are several videos that surround social networks and show the time of impact.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami reached the coast.
Federal prosecutors are extremely looking for the death penalty for suspected terrorist attack in New York
New York's federal prosecutors are seeking capital punishment for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect of the terrorist attack in New York City that killed eight people, an exceptional punishment that has not been executed in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, aged 30 years old, reportedly used a truck to rent Home Depot to carry out an attack on a bike on the West Side of the low Manhattan highway, through the pedestrians and cyclists he found on his way.
In order to justify a death penalty, the prosecutors should prove that Saipov had "intendedly" killed the eight victims and had "intendedly" serious bodily injuries, in accordance with the notice of the intention of the death penalty application presented in the South New York District.
The two charges bear a possible death penalty, according to the judicial document.
Several weeks after the attack, a major federal jury presented Saipov with 22 charges that included eight murder charges with organized crime, which often used federal taxes in these cases, and a charge of violence and destruction of motorized vehicles.
The attack required "a substantial planning and premeditation", according to the prosecutors, which described the way Saipov carried out it as "atrous, cruel and abusive".
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, injuries and losses to family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco," is specified in the notice of intention.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since the last time the South New York District has tried a death penalty case.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of killing two drug traffickers, but finally he was sentenced to eternal imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time a death penalty was executed in a New York federal case was in Julius and Ethel Rosenberg in 1953. This marriage was executed after they were convicted of conspiracy to commit spying on the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The two Rosenbergs were executed in the power plant on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, an immigrant from Uzbekistan, demonstrated his lack of retaliation for the days and months after the attack, according to judicial documents.
According to the police, he told the investigators that he felt good about what he had done.
According to the charge, Saipov told the authorities that for his attack he was inspired to see ISIS videos on his phone.
He also asked that the ISIS flag be placed in his hospital room, the police said.
It has been declared innocent of the charge of 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said they are "probably disappointed" with the decision of the prosecutor.
"We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty rather than accept a declaration of guilt with an everlasting chain sentence without the possibility of release will only prolong the trauma of these events for all involved," Patton said.
The Saipov defence team had previously applied for sanctions that would not require the death penalty.
Mr Tory says NIGEL FARGE should be responsible for Brexit's negotiations.
Nigel Farage promised "moving the popular army" today during a protest at the Tory conference.
The former head of the UKIP said politicians had to "feel the heat" of the Eurosceptics, while one of those Members of Theresa May suggested that he should be responsible for negotiations with the EU.
Conservative Peter Bone said at Birmingham concentration that the United Kingdom "would have gone out" if Farage had been Secretary of Brexit.
But the challenge faced by Prime Minister May to reconcile its split lines has been even more highlighted when a group of Tories in favour of the stay has joined in a protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is fighting to maintain the commitment plan signed in Chechers in the midst of attacks against Brexit, its opponents and the EU.
The allies insisted that they would continue to try to reach an agreement with Brussels, despite the violent reaction, and would force the Eurosceptics and the Labour Party to choose between their package and the "caos".
Mr. Bone said at the Leave Means Leave concentration in Solihull that he wanted to reject the Chechers plan.
He suggested that a position should have been given to Farage responsible for negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had been in charge, we would have gone out already," he said.
This Member of Parliament by Wellingborough added: "I'm going to defend Brexit, but we have to get rid of Chechers."
In his statement of opposition to the EU, he said: "We have not fought in world wars to be servants.
We want to make our own laws in our own country."
He welcomed the suggestion that the public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British have changed their opinion and we want to stay in the European Union is completely false".
The Tory Pro-Brexit Andrea Jenkyns was also in the concentration, where he told reporters: "I only say one thing: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The public generally does not like the Chechers plan, the opposition is not going to vote in favour and is not popular between our party and our activists, who are actually going out the streets and voting for us first.
Forget about Chequers and start listening."
In a message addressed to May, he added: First ministers keep their duties when they keep their promises."
Farage told the concentrates that they should "feel the heat" to politicians if it seemed that they were going to betray the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
"Now this is a matter of trust between us, people and our political class," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit and we're here today to tell them we won't let them out with theirs."
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: "I want you to make our political class, which is about to betray Brexit, feel the heat.
"We will mobilize the popular army of this country that won us with Brexit and will never give up until we have become an independent, autonomous and proud United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, the residents of the city traveled the streets of Birmingham two hours before the morning of the city center.
Some activists were looking for Tories Against Brexit posters after the group's presentation this weekend.
Labourer Lord Adonis was excommunicated by conservators for the security problems they had with a party application during the opening of the conference.
"These are the same people who tell us that they can implement computer systems and all technology for Canada Plus Plus, for the borders in harmony, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
"It's a total spell.
There is nothing that can be considered a good Brexit," he added.
Warren considers all the possibilities to be presented to the presidency
The U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says that "he will consider all possibilities to be presented for the presidency" after the November elections.
Boston Globe reports that Massachusetts's democracy spoke about its future during a municipal meeting held on Saturday in western Massachusetts.
Warren, a regular critic of President Donald Trump, will be presented to the re-election in November against Geoff Diehl, the Republican State Representative, who was co-chaired by the Marchausetts campaign in 2016.
There has been considerable speculation about the possibility that Warren was faced with Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was its thirty-sixth meeting with the voters using the municipal format since Trump took up the task.
An assistant asked him if he had planned to present himself to the presidency.
Warren replied that it was time for "the women to go to Washington to settle our irregular government, and that includes the fact that there is a woman at the highest".
An arrest for murder with LSU Sims's fire-fighting weapon
Baton Rouge's police announced this Saturday that he had been arrested by a suspect for the death of Wade Sims, LSU's football player last Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the 20-year-old Dayteon Simpson arrest at a press conference at 11 a.m.
They had published a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help to identify a man who sees in the video.
Sims, 20 years old, was killed by shots near the South University campus at the first hour of Friday.
"Wayde Sims suffered a shot at his head which eventually caused his fall," said police chief Murphy J. Paul to the media on Saturday, for 247 sports.
Wade was defending a friend and got a Simpson shot.
During the interrogation, Simpson admitted that he had been in the scene of the crime, had a gun and had shot Wade Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incidents and was arrested in the East Baton Rouge Parish police department.
Sims, an original player from Baton Rouge of 1.98 meters high, played in 32 games last season, titled in 10 of them, and had an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 reboots per game.
Russia's Grand Prize: Lewis Hamilton is about the world title after the team's orders will give him victory over Sebastian Vettel
Since Valtteri Bottas was classified in front of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it was evident that the orders of Mercedes team would play an important role in the race.
From the pool, Bottas had a good start and almost threw Hamilton away by defending his position on the first two rounds and inviting Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel was the first to get into boxes and let Hamilton run into the group's corner, something that should have been decisive.
Mercedes went out with force a later turn and moved behind Vettel, but Hamilton went on after an action with almost tied wheels that made Ferrari's pilot have to give up the inner-free risk of resisting after a double movement to defend himself in the third curve.
Max Verstappen, who is 21 years old that day, began from the last row of the pair and was placed in the seventh place at the end of the first round.
He then led a large part of the race while he stuck to his neumactics to achieve a rapid end and overcome Kimi Raikkonen for the fourth position.
Finally, he entered boxes at turn 44 but could not increase his rhythm at the remaining eight rounds when he recovered Raikkonen's fourth position.
It's been a hard day because Valtteri did a great job all weekend and was a real knight when he let me through.
The team has done an extraordinary job to get a perfect couple," Hamilton said.
That's been a really bad body language.
President Donald Trump woke up from Senator Diane Feinstein one morning by insisting that Christine Blasey Ford's letter did not filter out sexual aggression against Brett Kavanaugh, appointed for the Supreme Court.
Speaking in a debate in West Virginia, the President did not directly mention Ford's testimony to the Senate's Judicial Committee, but commented that what happened in the Senate showed that there are people who are "bad, rebellious and false".
"The only thing that could happen and the good thing that's happening in these last days in the Senate is when you see anger, when you see people who are bad, rebellious and false," he said.
"When you read publications and filtrations, then they say, "But if I didn't.
I didn't do it."
Do you remember that?
Diane Feinstein, did you filter it?
Remember your answer... did you filter the document?" "Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I won't filter."
Well, wait a minute.
No, we haven't.
The letter was sent to Feinstein, in which the charges against Kavanaugh were detailed by Ford in July and was filtered in early September, but Feinstein refused to come from his office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's accusations, I didn't filter her history," said Feinstein to the committee, as reported The Hill.
"She asked me to keep it confidential and so I did."
But his negative didn't seem good to the president, which during the morning of the Saturday night he commented: "I'll tell you something: that has been a really bad body language."
Maybe he didn't, but that's the worst body language I've ever seen."
Continuing with its defence to the appointment of the Supreme Court, which has been accused of sexual misconduct by three women, the President suggested that Democrats were using the charges for their own purposes.
"They are determined to regain power by any means possible.
You see evil and humiliation, no matter who harms, who has to struggle to gain power and control," said the President as mediaite reported.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer marked two bullets for the Giants against the Dundee
The Dundee Stars repaired the victory on Friday at the Elite League before the Belfast Giants after winning the game again on Saturday for 5-3 in Dundee.
The Giants achieved an initial advantage of two holes thanks to the attacks of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie got the local empathy before Dwyer restores the leadership of the Giants.
Francois Bouchard was equal to Dundee before the two bullets of Lukas Lundvald Nielsen guarantee their victory.
This has been the third victory of the season in the Elite League for the men of Adam Keefe, who came to win Dundee for 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth meeting of the season between the two teams, of which the Giants won the three previous parties.
Dwyer's first goal came in the fourth minute (3:35) thanks to Kendall McFaull's assistance, while David Rutherford provided assistance so that Beauvillier would double the advantage four minutes later.
In what can be considered a very encouraging initial period, Sullivan returned to the local team with a desire to play at 13:10 a.m. before Matt Marquartt attended Cownie to equal the game at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure that the Giants would take advantage before the first break when he recorded his second round of night at the end of the first part.
The local team regrouped and Bouchard once again equaled the game with a golilla at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined to help Nielsen to give Dundee the leader for the first time in the game when the end of the second part arrived and made sure he won with his team's fifth goal as the end drew near.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five parties, play at home before Milton Keynes in their next Friday party.
An air traffic controller dies so that hundreds of people can escape on landline aircraft
An Indonesian air traffic controller is being detained as a hero after he died after ensuring that a plane that carried hundreds of people managed to safely dispose of.
More than 800 people died and many disappeared after a large-scale earthquake hit the island of Sulawesi by Friday, causing a tsunami.
The Replica forces continue to absorb the area, and many are trapped between the caves in the city of Palu.
Although his companions fled to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthony Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post at the Mutiara Airport Control Tower Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu. This tower was being affected by a strong balance.
He remained firm in order to ensure that Batik Air, which was on the track at the time, could safely withdraw.
Then he jumped off the traffic control tower when he thought he was falling.
He died later in the hospital.
The spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, Johannes Sirait, said that the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, reported the Australian channel ABC News.
We've been preparing a helicopter from Balikipan in Kalimantan to take him to a bigger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he fell down this morning before the helicopter arrived in Palu.
"Our hearts break when we hear this," he added.
In the meantime, the authorities fear that the number of deaths can reach several thousand people. The National Disaster Mitigation Agency claims that access to the cities of Doghea, Sig and Butung is limited.
"It is believed that the number of victims will continue to increase, since there were still many corpses under the ruins and it has not been able to contact many people," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho comments, the agency's spokesman.
Some waves that reached up to six meters have destroyed Palu, which will celebrate a massive funeral on Sunday.
Aid and supplies are being carried on military and commercial aircraft.
Risa Kusumuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute an ambulance comes with more bodies.
The clean water is scarce.
The mini-markets are being taken everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, said to the CNN: "The Red Cross of Indonesia is trying to help survivors in everything, but we don't know what they'll find there.
This is already a tragedy, but it could have been much worse."
The President of Indonesia, Joko Vidodo, came to Palu on Sunday and told the country's army: "I ask everyone who works day and night to complete all the evacuation-related tasks.
Are you ready?" reported the CNN.
Indonesia had already been hit at the beginning of this year by earthquakes in Lombok where more than 550 people died.
Air accident in Micronesia: Air Niugini now says that a man has disappeared after the plane crash in a pond
The airline, which operated a flight that exploded into a Pacific lake in Micronesia, now says that a man has disappeared, after saying that the 47 passengers and crew had evacuated healthy and safe the plane that was flying.
Air Niugini said in a communiqué that since Saturday afternoon a male passenger could not be counted.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and researchers to try to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to further details on the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local ships were used to help rescue the other passengers and crew after the plane exploded against the water while trying to land at the airport of the island of Chuuk.
The authorities said on Friday that seven people had been transferred to a hospital.
The airline said that six passengers followed on Saturday at the hospital and that they were all in a stable condition.
The cause of the accident and the exact sequence of events remain unclear.
The U.S. Air Company and the U.S. Army said the plane landed in the lagoon before the track.
Some Witnesses thought that the plane had crossed the landing track.
The U.S. passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane came very low.
"That's something extremely good," said Jaynes.
Jaynes comments that he and other passengers were able to make progress through a water that reached their destination until the emergency exits of the plane began to sink.
He said the flight attendants went into panic and cried, and he suffered a slight injury on his head.
The U.S. Army said that mariners who had done some work to improve a mull also helped in the rescue by using an inflatable boat to transport people to the ground before the plane landed some 30 metres (100 feet) below water.
The aviation security network data indicate that 111 people have fallen into air traffic accidents registered in Papua New Guinea in the last two decades, but none with Air Niugini.
An analyst presents the time of the night when a woman was burned alive
The prosecutor concluded his arguments on Saturday in the new trial of a man charged with burning a woman in Mississippi in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
I explained to the jury how he used mobile phone records to record the motions of Quinton Tellis, the 29-year-old defendant, and Jessica Chambers, the 19-year-old victim, the night he died.
Rowlett said he received the location data from several mobile phones that showed that Tellis was with Chambers on the night of his death, thus contradicting his previous statements, reported The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his mobile phone had been with Chambers during the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police were talking to Sanford.
Sanford went up the street on Saturday and testified that he had not been in the city that day.
When the prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was "missing because my truck was in Nashville."
Another inconsistencies were that Tellis said he had met Chambers about two weeks before his death.
Mobile records indicated that they were known only a week ago.
Rowlett said that sometime after the death of Chambers, Tellis deleted the messages, calls and contact information of Chambers from his phone.
"She lost her life," said Hale.
The defence has scheduled to start its final allegations on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the judge to be in the hands of the jury on the same day.
The High Breed: What is the sensitive hip hop?
A hip hop third wants to fill your music with positive messages to hold the negative image of the gender.
The High Breed, of Bristol, says that hip hop broke apart from its political messages and addressed social issues.
They want to return to their roots and make the sensitive hip hop become popular again.
Interpreters like The Refugees and Common have seen a recent resurrection in the United Kingdom thanks to artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?
A New York girl asks a couple to send her away after a "racist" text
A New York girl is going to ask a discriminatory couple after she misbehaves a mother's text message and complains that she was "another black person".
The couple refuses to be racist and compares the demand with a case of "extortion".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two children, expressed her frustration when she found out that the new child nurse, Giselle Maurice, was black when she arrived at her first day of work in 2016.
"NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO OR NEGRA PERSON," wrote Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman to her husband in a text message.
However, rather than being sent to her husband, she was sent to Maurice twice.
After taking into account his footing method, a "inconsolable" Plasco-Flaxman asked Maurice to state that her former daughter, who was an Afro-American, had done a bad job and, in turn, was expecting a Philippines, according to the New York Post.
Maurice was paid for work one day and was sent home to Uber.
Maurice is now seeking compensation for the disbursement of $350 per day for the six-month internal work position for which she had been hired, even without a contract.
"I want to show you that things don't do that," he told The Post on Friday and added, "I know it's a case of discrimination."
The couple replied to the allegations that they were racist saying that the end of Maurice's employment was the most reasonable thing, as they feared they would not be able to trust her after she had been abused.
"My wife had sent her something she didn't mean.
She's not racist.
We're not racist," said husband Joel Plasco to Post.
"But would you leave your children in the hands of someone you've been rude to, though you've been wrong?
Your recent birth?
Come on!"
Comparing the demand as a "extortion", Plasco said his wife had given birth to the baby two months ago and was in a "very difficult situation".
"Are you going for someone like that?
That's not something very decent," added the investment banker.
Although the legal case is still under way, the court of public opinion has taken action to accuse the couple on social networks, criticizing them for their behavior and logic.
Paddington's editors feared readers would not identify with a talking bear, revealing a new letter
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said about the letter: "It was hard to place someone who had read it for the first time before his publication.
Thank you very much for knowing now what we know about the great success of Paddington."
After saying that his father, who had worked as a BBC camera before being inspired in a playbook to write the book for children, believed that his work would be rejected, he added that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the books was something "agridulce" after his fall last year.
Of Paddington, to whom she describes as "a very important member of our family", she added that her father was very proud of his final success.
"He was a very quiet man and he didn't like to be punished," he said.
"But as Paddington had been so real to him, it was almost like having a child that achieves something important: you're proud of him, though it's not really worth yours.
I think he saw Paddington's success that way.
Although it was his creation and product of his imagination, he always gave credit to Paddington himself."
My daughter was dying, and I had to quit on the phone.
On landing, his daughter was rushed to Niza Hospital Louis Pasteur 2, where the doctors worked in vain to save her life.
"There was no regular call to say that the situation was really bad, which was not expected to be achieved," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then I got Nad's call to tell me he was going to die in the next two minutes and I had to leave her.
And that's what I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you very much, dear.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The drugs that the doctors gave him to keep his heart pumping slowly and left his system.
She had died before, and everything was closing up.
I could just sit there and wait, knowing that this was happening.
I couldn't cry or cry or cry because I was in an environment surrounded by families and people.
I really had to keep myself firm."
Finally, Ms. Ednan-Laperouse, now suffering from the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers, following the terrible experience she was experiencing.
"No one knew it," he said.
"I reached my head and tears fell all the time.
It's hard to explain, but it was on the flight where I felt this overwhelming feeling of compassion for Nad.
That I needed all my love and understanding.
I knew how much I wanted it."
Women in battle put cards to avoid suicide is a bridge
Two women who lost loved ones because of suicide are working to prevent others from getting out of life.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have been putting cards on a Gale bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call for help.
Tyler, the son of Mrs. Davis, was 13 when he began to suffer from depression and committed suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't want no father to feel what I feel every day," he said.
Davis, 45 years old and living in Lydney, said his son was a promising boss with a contagious smile.
"Everyone knew her for her smile.
They always said that her smile lighted anywhere."
However, she left work before she died, since she was "in a really dark place".
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, who was 11 years old at the time, met him after his life was taken away.
Ms. Davis said, "I'm still concerned that it can have an impact."
Davis created the cards so people know there are people you can meet and who you can talk to, even if you're a friend.
Don't be quiet, you have to talk to him."
Mrs. Humphreys, who has been a friend of Davies for years, lost Mark, his partner with whom he was 15 years old, shortly after his mother's death.
"He didn't say he'd feel depressed or anything like that," he comments.
"A few days before Christmas we noticed their change of attitude.
The day of Christmas came to its lowest point: when the children opened their gifts, he did not even look at them."
He said his death was a great trauma to them, but they had to overcome it: "Let a vacuum in the whole family.
He's left us destroyed.
But we all have to keep fighting."

Brett Kavanaugh's future comes from a thread when the FBI starts research
"I thought if we could actually get something like what I was asking for (a limited investigation in time, in limited scope), maybe we could bring some unity," said Mr. Flake on Saturday, adding that he was afraid that the committee would be "eating a bit" in the midst of a party's parallelization.
Why did Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI investigation to be carried out?
Its negative is due entirely to chronology.
Only five weeks are required for the mid-term elections on 6 November. If, as expected, the Republicans have bad results, their efforts to achieve the election of the man who wants to serve the highest court in the country will be severely weakened.
George W. Bush has been calling the senators, pressing them to support Kavanaugh, who worked for him in the White House. Thanks to Bush, Kavanaugh met his wife Ashley, who was the Chairman's personal secretary.
What happens once the FBI publishes its report?
There will be a vote on the Senate, where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Kavanaugh will be able to obtain at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice-President Mike Pence to break the pact and confirm it to the Supreme Court.
North Korea's "caen" deserters figures with Kim
The number of North Korean deserters in South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, said a South Korean legislator.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the Ministry of Southern Unity, said that last year there were 1.127 deserts, compared with the 2.706 of 2011.
Park said that the strictest border controls between North Korea and China, and the high rates that cover traffickers have been key factors.
Pyongyang has not made public comments on this.
The vast majority of northern deserters are finally offered by South Korean citizenship.
It simply says that they have illegally crossed the border of over 30,000 North Koreans since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flights through China, which has the longer border with North Korea and which is easier to cross than the heavily protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China believes that deserters are illegal immigrants instead of refugees and are often repatriated.
The relations between the North and the South, which are still technically in war, have improved significantly in recent months.
At the beginning of the month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to hold talks focused on the denuclearization negotiations.
This took place after the historic meeting in June between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, who agreed in general terms to work for a nuclear-weapon-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korea's Foreign Minister, Ri Yong-ho, blamed the United States sanctions for lack of progress.
"Without the confidence of the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under these circumstances we will not be the first to be unilaterally disarmed," Ri said in a speech before the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "historic" and says it's not appropriate to serve at the Supreme Court
Nancy Pelosi, the leader of the minority of the House of Representatives, said that the appointed Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh was a "historic" and was not qualified to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribunal Festival of Austin (Texas).
"I can't stop thinking that if a woman had acted in that way, they would have said it was a story," Pelosi said about her reaction to the witness that Kavanaugh gave Thursday to the Senate's Judicial Committee.
Kavanaugh used the emotion to deny the allegations that he had sexually abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his initial statement, Kavanaugh was very excited, on almost crying and attracted while talking about his family and his years of secondary education.
In the Committee, he also explicitly condemned democracies , qualifying their allegations against "gross and clearly coordinated defamations" organized by angry liberals because Hillary Clinton lost the presidential elections in 2016.
Pelosi said that, in his opinion, Kavanaugh's testimony proved that it could not serve in the Supreme Court because it demonstrated its participation in the democratic process.
"I believe that these statements disqualify themselves with and the way he has persecuted the Clintons and the Democrats," he said.
Pelosi raised his objections when he was asked if he would oppose Kavanaugh if he was to be confirmed in charge and that the Democrats had obtained most of the House of Representatives.
"I'll just say one thing: if you're not telling the Congress or the FBI the truth, it won't be suitable not only to be in the Supreme Court, nor even to be in the court where it is now," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the Washington D.C. Appeals Tribunal.
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, he was concerned about the possible judgements of Kavanaugh against the Assetquiable Health Care Act or the Wade Roe Case, since it was considered to be a conservative judge.
In its confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh avoided questions about whether certain decisions of the Supreme Court would be annulled.
"This is not the time for a historical and impartial person to go to court and expect us to look like it's all right," Pelosi said.
And women have to force him.
It's a justified diet, it's months and years of anger getting out, and she can't leave it without crying.
"We cried when we got angry," Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think that's so rare, do I?"
He continued: "A woman who was executive in a company and who told me that she was also crying when she was angry, but that she had developed a technique for which when she got angry and began to cry, she told the person she was talking to: "Perhaps you think I'm sad because I'm crying.
So no, I'm angry."
And then I went on with what I was doing.
I thought it was great."
The tears are allowed as a way out for anger in part because they are basically misunderstood.
One of the clearest memories I have of one of my first jobs, in a man-dominated office, was once I met praising me with an unexpressable anger. A woman older, a serial manager who had always had a slight fear, touched me by the cogote and dragged me on a ladder.
"Don't let them never see you crying," he said.
"They have no idea you're angry.
They think you're sad and they'll be happy because they think you've got it."
Patricia Schroeder, who was then a Democratic Congressman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart in his presidential careers.
In 1987, when they took Hart on an extramarital adventure on board a ship called Monkey Business for which I had to withdraw from the presidential career, it happened to him that there was no reason for him not to explore the idea that he himself would present himself to the presidency.
"It wasn't a very premeditated decision," he told me between rice 30 years later.
"There were seven candidates on the street and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone referred to us as Blancanjeves and the seven orphans."
As the campaign had already been very advanced, it remained behind fund-raising, so it was promised that it would not go back into the race unless it would cost two million dollars.
It was a lost battle.
He discovered that some of his supporters who gave $1,000 to men, he only gave him $250.
"Do you think I have a discount?" he asked.
When he made his speech to announce that he would not have a formal campaign, he was so overwhelmed by emotions (thanks to the people who had supported him, frustrated by a system that made it difficult for him to draw funds and focused on the capture of voters instead of delegates, and angered against sex), which was attracted.
"The logic would have been to think he had had a nervous crisis," said Schroeder, recalling the reaction of the press.
"You might have thought Kleineex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking, what are they gonna put on my leg?
"Lloro"?
The United States and China trade war could benefit Beijing
The first survivors of the United States and China trade war were bitter, and although much remains to end the war, a break-up between the countries could benefit Beijing, experts say.
Donald Trump, president of the United States, launched the first warning at the beginning of the year by introducing tariffs to major Chinese exports such as solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most significant scale took place this week with new tariffs affecting $200,000 million ($150,000) in products, which is taxing half of the products entering the United States from China.
At all times, Beijing has taken equivalent repressions, recently applying some of the five to ten percent tariffs to North American products of $60,000 million.
China has committed itself to equalizing U.S. attacks, and it is unlikely that the second most powerful economy in the world will be going to collapse soon.
To achieve that Washington retreated would mean surrendering to demands, but public submission to the United States would be too embarrassing for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays its letters well, U.S. trade pressures could help China in the long term by reducing the interdependence between the two economies.
"The fact that a fast political decision in Washington or Beijing can be made under the conditions of starting an economic fall in any of the two countries is in fact much more dangerous than the spectators have recognized so far," said Abigail Grace, an associate researcher focused on Asia's issues for the strategic office Center for New American Security.
Syria is ready for refugees to return, says the Minister for Foreign Affairs
Syria claims it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and seeks help to rebuild a country devastated by a war that has already lasted more than seven years.
In a speech before the General Assembly of the United Nations, the Minister for Foreign Affairs Walid al-Moualem said the conditions of the country were improving.
"The situation on the ground is more stable today and secure thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The Government continues to rehabilitate the areas destroyed by terrorists to try to restore normality.
All conditions for voluntary return to the country of refugees who had to leave it because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures that affected their daily lives and their means of life are already being met.
The United Nations estimates that, since the war began in 2011, more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country.
There are six million others who still live in the country and need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moulem acknowledged that the Syrian regime would appreciate assistance in rebuilding the devastated country.
However, it also stressed that it would not accept conditional aid or assistance from countries that promoted insurgency.
Europe with Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team has won the 2018 Ryder Cup in defeating the North American team with a final marker from 16.5 to 10.5 in Le Golf National, in the suburbs of Paris (France).
The United States has now gained six consecutive losses on European soil since the last time it won a Ryder Cup in Europe in 1993.
Europe recovered the crown when the Danish Captain Thomas Bjorn team won the 14.5 points needed to win the United States.
The North American star Phil Mickelson, who had to fight during most of the tournament, launched his point of exit to the water on page 16 par 3, thus acknowledging his defeat before Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari highlighted in all its rounds, becoming one of the four players who have already won a 5-0-0 since the current tournament format began in 1979.
The U.S. Jordan Spieth was defeated by 5 and 4 before the player with the lowest rating of the European team, the Danish Thorbjorn Olesen.
The world's number one player, Dustin Johnson, fell 2 and 1 before Ian Poulter, who could have played his last Ryder Cup.
The Spanish Sergio García, a veteran who has already taken eight Ryder Cups, became European with more winnings of the tournament of all times, with 25.5 points in his career.
"I can't cry, but today I can't avoid it.
It's been a very hard year.
I am very grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm very, very happy to have been able to recover the cup.
It is a success of all the team and I am very glad that I was able to help," said an excited García after the victory of the European team.
Now he's got his partner John Rahm, who already defeated Sunday at the U.S. golf league Tiger Woods by 2 and 1 in an individual game.
"I feel an incredible pride when I've won Tiger Woods, since I've grown up to see this man," said 23-year-old golfer John Rahm.
Woods lost the four parties in France and now has a record of 13-21-3 in his career at Ryder Cup.
This is a statistical stranger for one of the best players of all times, who has won 14 great titles, leaving only behind Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team had to fight all weekend to find the streets, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played a large level golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. Captain Jim Furyk spoke after his team's disappointing performance: "I'm very proud of these guys, they've never stopped fighting.
There was a moment this morning when we heat up the situation in Europe.
But we missed him.
I want to congratulate Thomas.
He's a big captain.
Your 12 players have performed a very good game.
We will regroup, I will meet with the American PGA and our Ryder Cup Committee, and we will continue.
I love these 12 guys very much and I'm proud to be your captain.
Now it's gonna touch our head.
They've overcome us."

According to FWC, irregular flowering conditions are being reported in areas of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier County, suggesting a reduction of concentrations.
The flowering of the Red Sea extends about 130 miles of litoral length from Pineles County to the north to Lee County to the South.
Unregular particles can be found about 10 miles from the coast of Hillsborough County, but in fewer places if compared with last week.
Red sea has also been detected in Pasco County.
During the past week, average concentrations in the Pinellas County and its coast have been reported, low and high levels in the Hillsborough County County, high background concentrations in the Manatee County, high background concentrations in the Sarasota County and its coast, medium background concentrations in the Charlotte Candace, high levels in the Lee County and its coast, and low concentrations in the Collier County.
There are still reports of respiratory irritation problems in Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier County.
No respiratory irritation problems have been reported in the northwest of Florida last week.
