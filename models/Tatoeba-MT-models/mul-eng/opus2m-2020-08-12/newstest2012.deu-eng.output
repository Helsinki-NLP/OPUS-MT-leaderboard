No liberating news for Tymoshenko by Parliament
Today, the Ukrainian Parliament refused to grant the application for a novel of the Penal Code to the paragraphs on which the opposition leader Yulia Timoshenko was sentenced.
The new solution which could have opened up the way for the Minister of Foreign Affairs to be released by the arrested Prime Minister helped the members of the House to learn from the second reading of the application for a reduction in the penalties for economic debt.
In October, Timoshenko was sentenced to seven years' imprisonment due to the conclusion of a alleged infamous treaty with Russia on the purchase of Erdgas.
The judgment is not yet legally binding, and in December the appeal of the judges is to be brought before the Court.
Timoshenko himself refers to the judgment as the political right of the regime, and also in the West the process has raised the suspicion of the primacy of the Court.
The application, paragraph 365, on which the Minister of Foreign Affairs was sentenced to remove from the Penal Code was supported by 147 Members.
226 votes would have been necessary for his adoption.
Libbyscher victory
The history of the Libyan liberation struggle or the Libyan rebellion already knows its losers.
Muammar al-Gadafi is buried in an unknown place in the desert and without him the war is over.
Now only the winners are to be defined.
As is common in this region, in the Islamic elections, the question is only what - the right or the radicals.
The National Transitional Council was known as the customary law of Schařía, of which one has a certain idea with God now.
Libya would be in the country without crime, because it's about to cut off its hand.
Women should also quickly forget their thoughts about emancipation, and any religious dissidents should be corrected, and so on.
Instead of a single dictator, the company will be drawn from the Koran in the future of each other.
In short - in Libya, an order will rule which would hardly be feasible and, above all, would not be desirable.
Only - our lifestyle is not even the only one and objective seen now either the best and the difference would hardly fit the above-mentioned libraries.
It is more encouraging to see that the Muslim fighter has been helped by the faithless dogs at all.
It may only serve as the fact that NATO's air strikes were not directed by anyone from America, but by God himself, whose power was awarded after each successful event.
The winner in Libya?
We only took part in a committee exchange, which served the interests of Islam and our politicians emerged in the person of the dictator of a political alliance without having benefited from it.
After the fresh and bad experiences from Afghanistan and Iraq, we preferred to leave Libya's military occupation.
By doing so, the lifts are a concern - namely the movement of the cruisers.
Do the mining companies also receive the black gold at the spot price without any occupation?
Of course, the West can finally enjoy the right of its independence in matters of protection of human rights.
If they don't mind the Schařía-a-representatives.
Start a new crisis era
France and the rest of Europe in the focus of the investors.
On Tuesday a statistical storm swept across Europe.
The individual states published their data on their GDP for the third quarter.
The Czech economy was stagnant compared to the pre-quarters, Germany and France.
But today the bond market is full of records.
Not only Greece, but also Spain, France, Austria and other countries.
The statistical authorities of the European area, Germany, the Czech Republic and some other European countries published their provisional forecasts on economic development in the third quarter.
Germany's GDP is expected to grow by 0.5%, by 0.4% from France.
At the same time, both countries adjusted their data for the second quarter, in which Germany recorded a higher growth than originally expected (increased by 0.3% instead of expected 0.1%), while France increased by 0.1% (in the original data only spoke of stagnation).
In this year's third quarter, the Czech economy grew by 1.5 per cent.
However, compared to the previous quarter, the gross domestic product was stagnant and according to Tsch. Statistical Office thus confirmed the trend in the slowdown of economic performance.
The results are therefore worse than forecasting by analysts.
The most important events:
In this year's third quarter, however, the Czech economy grew by 1.5 per cent compared to the previous quarter.
As a result of provisional and seasonally calculated data, the German economy grew by 0.5 per cent in the third quarter.
In the whole eurozone and the EU, the economy between July and September recorded an increase of 0.2 per cent compared with the expectations of analysts.
The Greek economy dropped by 5.2 per cent compared to the previous year.
The income from their 10-year government loans decreased by 28.45%.
The income of the Italian and Spanish state loans rose to their critical limits.
Austria, the Netherlands, France, Belgium and other countries also start to experience problems...
The income in Czech State loans is below 4%, even if the situation in the region is worsening.
In Germany, votes are to be taken by the ECB to be the creditor of the last instance.
The Czechs qualified for EURO
In Montenegro they won 1:0 and now celebrate their qualification for 200 million
The football team has mastered the most difficult task of the entire season!
Thanks to a well-established tower Czech and a wonderful tower by Petr Jiráček she won in Montenegro 1:0.
With a great deal of luck, the Chechnya football was able to defend its luxurious origin from the home game and will not be missing again at European Championships.
IHNED.cz followed up in an executive report.
Few excitement in the first half of the year and a huge proportion of luck in the second.
The Czech election also won the victory due to the final weakness of the Homemanship, a brilliant Czech and the hero of the day Jiráček in Montenegro at 1:0 and has thus released its ticket for the football-EM.
Also because of the precise defense game of the Czech Mission, they put the Montenegriner in more pressure in the second half of the year.
The peach birds of the party were Damjanovic and Vucinic, who had two chances of shooting.
Also thanks to an excellent Petr Čech, the Czech election will be joined by the European Championships next year, and it is also pleased that the domestic football is awarded a premium of about 200 million.
In the first few minutes, a right fighter football was played.
Both teams have been combined long enough and have been especially played around the middle line.
In the second half of this period, the pressure of the Homemanship remained high, and the long delay before the trial was successful because of the Czech Revolution.
Iranian students are ready to die for their country's core program.
They were making a living painting.
Hundreds of high school students formed a living painting around a core object in Iran.
With this gesture they wanted to demonstrate their support for the country's country's core programme before any Israeli attack.
The students had prayed on Tuesday before the object and then announced death to the United States and Israel.
On Tuesday a few hundred students from the University of Iran in Isfahan formed a living picture around the nuclear technology centre in Isfahan, where the uranium is processed.
So they wanted to make sure they were ready to protect their country's core program if necessary with their own lives.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) recently stated in its report that Iran seems to have not reported a nuclear weapon in all its efforts.
In Israel, too, there is a possible attack on Iranian nuclear power plants.
On Wednesday before entering the complex, the students had prayed and then announced death to the United States and Israel.
In the case of an attack directed at the Iranian nuclear programme, the Israeli press from the centre in Isfahan would also be the nuclear power plant in Nathan's attack target.
The food card of a pregnant child: It's not breakfast and is for dinner bread
More than a third of the children from 9 to 13 have overweight problems, with 9 percent of all students and 5 percent of all children being overweight.
Show current questions - adipative children are mostly from families with unhealthy lifestyles.
This once again shows how important for the healthy development of a person is the environment in which he grows and the examples around him are.
On the tables of adipious children, wetware stands up to half the time on the table than in families where normal children live.
More than 19 per cent of the overweight children had an event under the motto "Adipositas is no accident" pommies for nightbreak.
In families with Dickerchen, sports is not just about love jobs, but it is also about the majority of today's students - only 15 percent replied that their parents are at least once a week on time for active movements.
Question of 900 children
The survey took place last year at the end of the school year, when nearly 900 children from primary schools were asked throughout the Czech Republic.
This was already the second year of the action "Adipotes is no accident" supported by the General Hospital and Unilever Society.
So far, more than 12 thousand students from 4 and 8 classes participated in the project.
Unhealthy costs and lack of movement in the family are crucial factors that are responsible for the growing number of children with overweight or even obesity.
"Only half of the children questioned, for example, led five times a day to eat breakfast-second breakfast-medium-vesper breakfast breakfast - one of the main conditions for healthy food," says one of the survey results.
No breakfast and no bread for dinner
Experts point out that relative minorities, such as the regular family breakfast, are also important for the healthy development of a child.
However, only 23 percent of the school's families attend breakfast in Czechia.
And in most families everyone breakfasts alone.
The worst was the finding, which will not be eaten in any 10-family at all.
The breakfast is used as a basis for healthy daily food.
The survey showed, among other things, that overweight children are consumed more frequently than healthy pumps in families.
And almost everyone - without looking at weight - drinks sweet lemonade every day (70 percent)
Although more than 40 percent of the children interviewed are active in sport, only less than half of their parents do so - only 15 percent.
Merge your custom menu
Another part of the survey enabled selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to combine their own food plan with the options offered for appetite and opinion.
"What Czech children prefer between 12 and 15 in points of food is far from the ideal of healthy food.
Among their favorite foods are many meals, meat dishes and, of course, sweet foods.
"Alarming is particularly the great popularity of sweet lemonades", is emphasized in the final report on this question.
During the afternoons, so the main court, teenagers won nearly before flying.
The children were almost not allowed to bear fruit, and the popularity of fish and vegetables as lunches was very low.
Health concerns
At the same time, the survey also showed that the children are ready to change their eating habits when they get the right information.
"In the case of the questionnaire group of respondents who completed the questionnaires following the conclusion of the "Adipotes is not an accident", it was noted that in many cases there was a significant shift in preferences to the principles of healthy food."
Suddenly this was the example of the sweet Limos, where many children began to give priority to common water.
In the questionnaire, the children also crossed a lot of open flights or fish as the main focus of the day and were ready to eat less nuts or sweet foods.
Profs claim - a stylist must also be a good psychologist
In the introduction article on how to learn about stylists, I had a little amusing that it was a little too much substance for the beginning.
I didn't know what else was coming.
Presentations by three professionals from the industry, the clothing of problem figures and a seminar on how the "on site" runs.
It's gonna get worse.
The closer we come back to the test, the more information and practical tasks are ahead of us.
But even if the course takes place every day and every Sunday, it is still full.
This time we discussed with Director Alena (at the course no single man participates), how to treat a woman who has no ideally proportioned figure.
And these are always most of us.
The one has a too short neck, the other one is too young without proper curves and the others are dark again.
It is the case of the stylist to dig wide shoulders optically, extend the neck or reproducing the necessary curves.
We also got tips like a woman-type like Jennifer Lopez - so with big buses, broad hills and smaller valleys - beautiful and figure bettont, without being quite provocative.
If, for example, the difference between rocks and hills is so large that the rock or the hole really does not fit, at least one piece should be cut to size.
This will certainly not be wasted because good seating clothes are easy to pay.
In such a sloppy rock, you feel much better than in one of the pillars that is always raised and raised in the ceiling, etc.
Young people can also be allowed to wear clothes with flakes, bushes, applications, stickers or rapping.
With this amount of information and figure types, I am glad that I have a whole week's time to let everything go rationally through my head.
And yet I'm afraid it's almost not to be created in view of the assignment.
Each of the participants was assigned a promi to remember their suitable expenses - day dress and afternoon dress.
In this respect, we should take into account the current appearance, fashion style of the respective star and its figure type.
I'm going to "carriage" Miranda times, which you may know from Victoria's Secret campaign.
In the interior I jubilee, because it is much better for me personally than to draw Britney Spears or Christina Aguilera, which has probably taken hundreds of kilos (no good, it's a bit overrated), or young Selena Gomez.
The clothing items should be cut off from journals or searched, printed and then processed on the Internet.
In "Moodboard", as the whole result is called, our entire personal style and our relationship to graphic design should be expressed.
It is very important to think about the graphic side of the styling.
The stylelist refers not only to the models but also to the so-called product page in the newspapers (by specific standards, for example trend handbags, coins, etc.).
The stylist and designer Mario Kameník told us about it.
But it's just Sunday.
That means a stylist must have a good overall view.
The Saturday morning presentation, which was filled with information about figure types, was shared by three visitors from the industry:
by Stylist Jan Pokorny, by fashion designer Jakub Polanka and by fashion photographer Ben Renč.
Jacub reminded us that fashion illusion is and that it should be a stylist state to use it.
And a skilled stylist is able to work with a single piece of clothing in a completely different way.
The word magic is variable.
For example, you can wear a trunchcoat as usual over the Jeans, so as a T-shirt or coat, but you can also wear it on the naked body, wear a piece of shoes and wear it as a dress.
It's enough to raise the earl or the arms and the whole look looks quite different.
"Played with that," he stressed.
But most of the time, I was told by the Council: "You must know the rules perfectly first."
"First you have to hurt her," said Jacub.
Finally, I understand why we need to pay attention to all these teachings, what you can combine with, and why even if you often see anything else in fashion journals.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Thanks to photographer Ben, I now know that a stylist must have prepared much more clothing options than he finally photographed.
So you have to be prepared for a Fashion Story with ten pages (spoken ten outfits) to style at least fifteen.
And also that the clothing on the photo in combination with other accessories looks completely different than in reality.
So you have to figure out all of this when you design the outfit.
The image and style in the middle of the success, which confirmed us also Jan Pokorny.
There you just need to look at Madonna, not just a brilliant singer, who made a world star from the image and marketing.
In Chechnya, the services of a slylist are rather reserved.
Famous personalities are also often considered to be out-of-charge money (the main thing is that I bring something like I look like it is secondary).
And if anyone is already able to style himself, then we should realize that he or she is going to force us to a completely different (smaller) size than he or she really needs.
It is then necessary to go further in order to make sure that the boulevard pressure, which has to be repeated or taken out of the relevant promi, etc.
Jan and Mario put us in the heart on Sunday, not to believe that a stylist only focuses on fashion and then needs the outfit "to build together".
In his work he must primarily communicate with the people he steals and he must be a heavy psychologist.
People appreciate it without offering themselves and thinking about it.
"If any manager orders us to look at her dress and finish beautiful pieces, then we can't take off the whole dress and say - my God, that's terrible."
"You have to find at least a few praiseworthy things you recommend for what you can do," says Mario.
He also showed us quite specific what such a so-called "platz bag" must contain.
So it's a bag that connects you to the roof and carries all the properties you need.
In addition to such clear things as shells, sprayers for hair removal or safety needles, they also contain tools such as a nylonpath (so the stylist helps to photograph products such as handbags or needles), special clips with which the clothes are attached to the back if they are too large (signs or other clothes are prohibited so that the substance is not captured) and of course close.
But in order not only to listen, but also to try something practical, we learned how to properly cover shoes.
Also, when photographing in the workshop where the floor is also located, you can damage the shoe solstice, pushing the outside.
We're dressed and we're wearing...
You can't even touch the shoes with the screw so you can't hurt them.
So you really have to go ahead.
Mario delighted me by praising my "Creation" without restrictions.
This is not just my strength.
All of this was only part of what we had to hear at the second week's follow-up course.
One thing has become clear to me - to dedicate myself to a professional level is not a child game.
V Need for Speed: "The Run" - the illegal race across America
Review
The original carefree drive will be completely preventable by a series of diplomatic errors for routine driving for breakfast.
It was possible to meet the ambitions for a large part, but what would benefit if no one apparently liked to do a little more?
Just before he came to the Ladentic, the new part with the title "The Run" gave rise to high expectations.
However, he promised to move the old "need for Speed" game series again into a new dimension and in the playable demonstration examples he did not really seem to be just one of many action games.
We were also curious as to how the adjusted passports, in which the main protagonist rises out of the car and continues to walk.
But as you're used to with NFS, there's a lot different in the end effect than you've expected.
Of course - it is likely that there are right-wing arcade races, but overall the game of some overflowing errors that have been present in this series for a few years or less.
So it's actually no longer a mistake, but rather a sign of an incomprehensible weakness of the game developers.
The adventure begins very well.
First one is introduced into history, whose main figure Jack has certain problems of personal character; the only solution seems to be to participate in an illegal dispute between America and America.
In San Francisco, on the west coast, you are seated on the left-hand side - with the task of being first in New York.
The basic idea includes a whole series of interesting elements.
The whole route is divided into ten stages and in more than fifty individual races.
This means that each race will be out on another route and that the individual stages will take place in a different, different and interesting environment.
You don't have a moment to feel that the game would always offer the same thing again.
Some environments are still quite good to look at, although the technical level of the graph does not go beyond the previous part of the series.
So there's nothing moving around the world.
But the journey through the desert, through fertile landscape or high up through deep split landscapes seems very pleasant.
Here and again, unique elements make a little difference in the individual races.
In the desert, for example, one is surprised by a desert storm that severely limits the view.
Once again in the mountains, you must be careful not to be protected from a lion.
In addition, the individual races are well built together.
Just a few, but they're enough.
A long time you try to keep the prescribed number of opponents (in principle a classic race), then you have time (classic races against the stopfire), then you expect another personal double with a single opponent.
And that's what the police are doing. One wants to get rid of the whole thing.
A news is passports where Jack leaves the car.
It's more about certain interactive animations where Jack is running to someone and where the player needs to help by pressing the right button at the right time.
So nothing complicated.
It is surprising, however, that there are much less such passports in the game than you would expect (in particular, only three).
Finally, this is of particular benefit because at least this element has no opportunity to be long-term - it is part of the above-mentioned elements that make the game more diverse.
The vehicle model is shown in the footsteps of the previous parts.
This means, from today's point of view, it doesn't make any trees out, on the other hand, you can't claim it would be bad.
Those looking for realistic simulations need to look different.
But an action-loaded race will also continue to be quite right despite the fact that you could find better in competition.
Until then, everything is in the best order.
Real problems occur only after some time.
In contrast to the vehicle model, the collition model is not entirely O.K.
From a game of this kind it is almost to be expected that it calculates complex deformations and collisions, but if you're practically not aware of something like the car is going on, then obviously it's not all right.
Typical example: When you drive or drive to a car that is not available, you "strike" the other car in some places only easily, in other, almost identical situations, but you get into holes and turn wild pirates.
Or the carre is going to break.
Thanks to the restart system, it doesn't matter anymore, it's all due respect.
The restarts are so solved: if you have total damage or land far away from the track, then one will return the game to the last point of the track.
Only - in each race you have only five restarts.
If you've created it, it's all going out of the way.
The restarts are therefore rather something like a means of helping, for if something doesn't work out, but you shouldn't leave yourself out.
Sometimes, however, it does not even help the restart, since nothing else helps learn the critical section from the head.
The same things often happen in the same places.
Some curves, for example, have to be passed in very specific ways and ways, otherwise you just don't fit through.
On the other hand, you will always like "civil" cars in the same configuration, whether you arrive as first or fifth, five seconds earlier or one minute later.
This is particularly embarrassing in situations where you see that the contradiction occurs in front of a player on two missing cars, but until you get there yourself, the cars are already in such a position that you have to turn them around or brake them.
And it doesn't matter when you get there, everything is so conceived that it's always close to your nose.
The contractors have further advantages.
In the whole game there are a few places where you will always survive at the same place by the same opponent and also here again without a look at the moment.
This is the end of the game at the long bridge that you're facing.
The opponent must obviously get out of here on the devil.
And if he's already in front of one, then he's taking a natural look, so he starts driving his own car a few times in a crowd.
Clear - you want to make the game more exciting and exciting, but this idea is so clear that it loses its joy in the game quickly.
And that's bad, because despite a simpler driving model, the game is generally fairly maintained and also partially loaded so that you don't even know where one of the heads is.
And in principle, it doesn't matter what's "debt" on it - the concept of fifty unique routes, the order of the races in a way that no long paths can arise, or something else...
An unusual idea is also the change in the vehicle during the race.
You can't ignore the tanks on the road, because right here you can change the car, although in most cases the car is enough that you just have.
Cars are divided into three categories.
The sports cars are well suited for the urban areas, the strong American limos for the right cars and exotic super sports cars for the technical vehicles, for example, the serpentines in the mountain.
Hand in hand with the game history mode is also the task mode (required challenges) - so the races in the individual localities you know from history.
Here there are not only medals but also points of experience for the own profile, which is common to the tasks (requirements) and history.
To achieve the highest level of driving, different objects must be closed: start from the car to the background for the profile.
This is also connected to the online Autolog function, which compares, among other things, the results achieved with other players and also provides for other collective functions.
One of the other incomprehensible cutters is a situation in the last race of history.
This is where you get in the car into an U-road tunnel (meineway), where you are slowly crawling in the dark on the rails (meineway).
On the tacho there are figures between 150 and 200 km/h (meineway), but there comes at once from behind an U-road and runs without compromise.
In our editor we may still be arguing whether it was a blackout of the player or whether the authors kept us so bloody.
The technical page is nothing overwhelming but at least the overall visual impression is quite appealing in most cases and even brilliant here and there.
It is therefore more noble that at some exciting moments the image revolving frequency will be slowed down and this is rather dramatic in the meantime.
In particular, this is the case with a higher number of participants where a continuous FPS is not useful.
The performance is as long as O.K. and the soundtrack is a taste case.
In an effort to reach as wide as possible a scale as possible for younger audiences, a soundtrack was created "from everyone" - but who is already buying such a game because of music?!
The overall impression of Need for Speed: The Run? The feelings are more mixed.
If the game hadn't been measured by the total unnecessary error mentioned above, we could have argued with the Brustton of the conviction that The Run is the best piece of NFS in recent years.
But that's how the game seems kind of unfathomable.
To enjoy a class, but you should be prepared to make this mistake with the power of airport lights.

EU Ambassador Vicenová:
The Czechs have the call of negatists and Eurosceptics
"The Treaty of Lisbon has brought the balance among the individual institutions to be sensitive to the fate."
I didn't expect such a hard war to end."
"It will take five, six years until the waves are cooled and everyone has become accustomed to their new role," Milena Vicenová, a Czech ambassador to the European Union, began his talk at the legal college.
As she seriously took the motto "Conscientific and open-minded over Europe", she already showed in the first part of her speech that she was able to describe the individual bodies of the EU and their relations with each other in such a transparent and understandable way that she could write down so many lecturers at the University of Karls University.
Ms Vicenová also praised the new President-in-Office of the European Council Herman Van Rompuy:
"At first criticism was heard that he was too immediate - a grey officer who had not been raised such a role, but I must say it has hit the soul as well as he has taken the matter.
"It is a person who has made it ready to listen patiently to seventy-seven Member States to communicate with them and, above all, has clear ideas on how to proceed with the EU.
The new position of the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy then explained as an answer to the question: Who really is the European Union? What number should I call for?" so as an important step towards consensus and greater readability of EU policies against countries such as China or India.
No one wants to ban us from our old-fashioned Quargel.
Mrs Vicenová also devoted herself to the agenda that the European Union was living and thinking about in the near future.
Two years ago, the Czech Presidency called it a success.
The Czechs had mastered the financial crisis and the gas crisis and also held the summit for Eastern Partnership.
The case of the government during the presidency was described as a great negative that had seriously damaged the image of the Czech Republic.
The Czech representation in the EU now has to do everything in its power.
With the words of the messenger, it went not only to the president but also to the next crisis that has not yet been overcome.
And then the EU's 7-year budget must be approved, which makes the matter much more complicated because of today's economic situation.
Whether it will be a flexible and savings budget, which economic priorities will take precedence, which countries will be supported more and less - all of this is now on the agenda.
The messenger also remembers its own slogans, with which she came to Brussels: "Continually about Europe".
"If I don't like anything, then there are ugly screams, foreign words and professional jargon that nobody understands.
How should I know as a citizen whether you really think of yourself as a citizen in Brussels or around the corner and various large bananas or if someone really wants to forbid us the quargel?
It would also like to use the EU soil to get more checks in European institutions.
Europe of two or different speeds
In the opinion of the EU envoy, the Czechs are in the process of becoming Eurosceptics more negative than the positive sides of the issue.
The weak representation of Chechnya in European institutions is therefore more generous.
There are many factors, including the retention of our candidates, whose inability to write motivation letters, and not least the weak support of the Czech side.
In addition to the successful Czech Presidency, it also stressed the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad Group, which is also the V4.
"Believe me when a Pole or Hungarian comes to me and a Slovakian is near me, then the French says to me: "Hey, what are you doing here together - is this your V4 again?" and then makes a pretty good mine.
As a result, Mrs Vicenové looks to the EU for strict rules for the budgetary policies of the Member States in the future.
As much more realistic than a "European Federation" it sees the concept of a Europe of two or even different speeds.
"We have the countries of the Eurozone and the countries outside the Eurozone.
"We have the Schengen area and we already have an institution of enhanced cooperation."
"It was first said that only countries should cooperate with those who want it and those who do not want it should be left alone."
"There will be more and more such institutions, which will ultimately lead to a strong "Europe of the Various Speeds"," Mrs Vicenová expects.
In this respect, it should also respect the role of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuyes in implementing the principle that all issues affecting the entire EU are to be discussed by all Member States and not just by the euro area countries.
Brand Story:
The IBM Innovator enters the second century of its existence
If you wanted to find a suitable word to describe IBM's strategy as precisely, then this would probably be the word "longevity".
For the broad public IBM is the Synonym for technological revolution, but it is known as modern companies, although it has been expanded for a century since its foundation.
The basis for this longevity has already been laid by her first head - visualist Thomas J. Watson.
He's already betrayed the slogan, which is free to solve world problems, if people were willing to think a little bit.
His slogan "Think!" was thus a sign of the life of the future giant (and at the same time the title of the business magazine that started to appear at IBM in 1935).
This was also the basis of the company culture which was basically prepared by Watsen.
"For us from IBM this long-term thinking means a continuous movement towards the future.
IBM survived and was therefore successful for a whole century because it has remained faithful to its principles and did not hesitate to change everything else round.
This allowed us to transform technology, business and society throughout our first century.
We hope that we will create more in the next hundred years," said Samuel J. Palmsano, today's director of the company on the basis of the Jubilee.
Covered System
Whatson has already worked on the social care of his employees in the thirty years - in a similar way as the entrepreneur Batáa in Czechoslovakia: IBM people had paid as one of the first American employees, insurance by the entrepreneur plus elegant uniforms as a work clothing and a well-known retirement system for the best novel and dealers.
The long-term relations of IBM with their customers are also also excluded.
The company was in general at first in the promotion of talent - as one of the first companies in the world's top IBM of all discrimination - and was able to look accordingly.
In line with this anti-discrimination strategy, the current plan is to replace Palmisan on the tip of IBM with a woman - by Virginia Rometty.
It has been 30 years with IBM until it took the position of the vetriebs, marketing and strategic chief.
In recent years IBM has made so-called online brandings, from which many future strategies and innovations have grown.
No wonder - there are enough ideas, almost half a million people are employed in the company.
An institution with a good reputation
Your unencumbered position in business guarantees the company a strong image and this one inside and outside.
"From the beginning IBM had rather the concept of an institution than a mere technology company," said the economist of Harvard Business School and the author of a book on IBM, Rosabeth Moss Kanter.
"The IBM is not a technology company, but a company that helps solve business problems with technology," added George Colony from Forrester Research's Consulting Company.
As the company itself points out, it is a difference only to be present on the market or to form it directly through this presence.
IBM - in the states of its logo because of family "Big Blue", has grown to one of the world's largest companies in one century.
It is one of the most diverse technology companies - IBM developed hardware and software, infrastructures, hosting and consulting services in an incredible product range - from servers to nanotechnology.
Of all American technology companies IBM owns most patents and already five of its employees have been awarded the Nobel Prize.
His most known inventions include banknotes, credit cards, financial swaps, strikecodes or even the discettes.
With some 220 billion dollars of money (market capitalisation) this year IBM was the second largest technology company (the same as Apple), where it was first over Microsoft since 1996.
Preview
Not all products and innovations affected the taste of customers today - unfortunately, for example, with their own OS/2 operating system, the online service Prody or also the IBM PC computer jr.
"Business is based on the forward movement, so you can't connect emotionally to the past," says Samuel J. Palmasano.
Therefore IBM has no problem building its basic walls on different platforms - and if they do not work, leave them again.
In contrast to the opponent Microsoft, who appears and falls in principle with its Windows operating system.
Successful technologies
At IBM’s winnings, IBM participates in the largest number of services, software and hardware each to a fifth.
In 1990 hardware with more than 50 per cent of it was the largest.
Since 2000, IBM has sold low-income assets worth $15 billion, but at the same time it invested 58 billion dollars in the purchase of future powerful technologies.
In these investments IBM also continues after 2008, when the current financial crisis was first hit by a storm over the world.
IBM also believed in the power of his first boss Thomas J. Watson, who increased its investment in the midst of the major global economic crisis.
So far, IBM seems to be overstated by the current crisis.
The value of IBM shares has increased dramatically by 120 per cent since 2008 and the company's clean-up gains continue to increase.
The company logo of IBM says: everything can change - just not the values.
That is why it can also be expected that this flexible giant will also master the next crisis.
IBM History: From the Cassesser to World Flights
The company IBM (International Business Machines) founded in New York a few hundred years ago had a fairly complex name - Computing Tabulation Recording Corporation.
The name IBM was first adopted in 1924 - it was originally used as a trademark for a discount in Canada and South America.
The foundation stone for later IBM laid the foundation of four companies whose history dates back to the 1980s.
They have technologies such as the famous check-cards to register the beginning and end of work.
To the architects of this new company, Charles Ranlett Flint, who had also taken the lead in the Board of Supervisors until 1930.
And it was Flint who appointed the head of the competition company Thomas J. Watson to assist him in the management of the company.
This leader then even put the founder of IBM in the shadow - based on Watson's ideas today on the company's invisible culture and identity.
Watson led the company until 1952.
IBM, started, as the name tells us, with the production and distribution of all possible machines for trade - from worst and cheese cutters up to cash.
In the first four decades in which Watson led the company, he doubled its sales to nine million dollars and the company expanded to and from all continents.
Watson was so undisputed for the company that he spent all forty years in the principal's cell, until he was dissolved by his son, Thomas Watson Junior.
Under this direction IBM began to work on the development of artificial intelligence and also developed the first programming language.
In the 1960s, IBM technicians and computers of NASA flew into All - to Mercure and Saturn and also in 1969 to the moon.
In 1964 IBM developed the first computer family with the same computer architecture - the IBM System/360 series.
A classic PC that determined the computer standard of that time came in 1981 under the name IBM 5150 on the market.
Twenty years later IBM sold its computer production to the Chinese company Lenovo, on the other hand, but bought the consultant part of PricewaterhouseCoopers and thus increased fully and fully in the business with high value consulting services and services.
The strategy to pay for IBM in the last three years is the concept "Smart Planet".
It is intended to introduce technologies in a way that is clearly not yet planned, such as to improve the situation in transport and urban administration.
In the trade sector IBM recently introduced the Smarter Commerce platform to help traders lead the entire commercial cycle.
IBM also has a strong history in the Czech Republic.
In 1932 IBM established a subsidisation in the former Czech Republic - as the first country in Central and Eastern Europe at all.
Today IBM ČR also operates a strategic outsourcing centre in Brünn.
The Centre for Central and Eastern Europe is located in Prague and here is also a world-wide top priority, which is covered by the technology of voice recognition.
Darina Richtárová on her underground streets:
Iveta - this nest can keep you, I don't want it anymore!
Darina Richtáróová (53) says - now it's closed!
After her husband, Josef Richtář (53) had become their lover of Iveta Bartoshová (45), Darina still hoped that Joseph would grow up from his rosary dream and come home.
But now it is finally over with patience and she has set clear rules for the rest of her life.
"Joseph can come home but no more than my partner," said D. Richtářová.
When Darina Richtářová of the singer I. Bartosová had offered her own home a flight, she might not even fall into the dream as it did with her husband.
When Iveta went out and back to říčany on her knees 30 days later, Joseph went with her.
Yes, he even publicly knew he loved her.
In time, Darina redesigned, yes, it seemed as if she wanted to get back to her trusted husband - but now she finally gave him the run-off.
Richytár doesn't care who his wife sleeps with
If, however, rychtár Iveta Bartoshová should be left in the future, he will certainly not receive open arms.
"He is the biological father of my dreams, and if he wants to decide his days in our common home, then I will not expel him."
"However, not as a lover of old esel, but as a person to whom I still have certain ties," said Mrs. Rychtářóvá; but she also said that she had already been emotionally separated from him and was alone on mutual responsibility.
The condition that Darina has given him his back is that Joseph is still wearing clothes.
"I respect my wife's decision."
"I stay with Iveta, nothing changes."
"My wife wants a paper wedding and I respect it."
"The company continues, I care about the repairs, the gardens, the basics, the purchases."
"With Darina I kept myself quite normal, just don't share the bed any more," said J. Richtár (the sheet) Blesk.
If Darina wants to find a new love, then she doesn't want to stop them.
"We don't sleep with each other, so I don't care if she has a friend or who it is.
I am clear that it is my fault that I have fallen in love with Iveta and therefore I take all responsibility.
The worst female suspects: How's it going with you?
When men are urged to call certain typical female unaccompanieds, they will save only some propellers from the tomb.
Dear women, do you recognize yourself again in the following lines, in which we let some unsitting Revue pass again, which causes men to pour the blood into the veins?
Search for purchase
Does their boyfriend suggest they're shopping?
Do you have to buy at least one hat a week?
Would you like to buy it and can it be a little bit more?
Then it's really about a weakness in your case.
Some women are aware of it at least and try to keep their business losses under control.
But hand on heart, which woman already seems to be looking for a good seating clothes just to drown through a dress business and not try all (in all possible color combinations) in the cabin?
Even if the purchase for most women is a hobby, for men it is often the pure hole.
But let's think about how often they've told her husband - you'll be better off...
Constant Disappointments
"Am I not too fat?"
"I had to take at least five kilos off - should I start jogging or performing Gymnastics?"
"Am I going to miss you at all?"
Do they have any knowledge of this?
Yeah?
Then you may also belong to women who are legally entitled to what they look like.
This does not mean that you should leave, but many men react allergicly when their wife is constantly upset about her appearance.
The stronger sex is somewhat - with the increasing frequency of complaints, women are increasingly unchaste.
Ordering and cleanliness at first place
It's a fight against windmills.
Pop windows, tiles and dust wash when they explode - and this at least twice a week.
Swim with her partner because once again he walks with dirty shoes on the clean bottles, you beat the children because the right-fashioned wash basin is already drunk and because the glass at the living room has again fingerprinted, but where does the police make so much?
If you are suffering under this kind of "diviance", then you should know that you can't exceed anything and don't put order and cleanliness in family life first.
In the end, this measure of purity can also damage the mutual relationship and especially the peace of the family.
Style
"Smurfy turnhouses come into the washroom."
"Do you really want to pull the old socks again tomorrow?"
"You don't just throw a knife at the floor."
If your partner is exposed to such a Tirade, you should not be surprised that it brings him to the palm.
Of course, that doesn't mean bad, but they just want what he's got.
If men knew this, they might not need to compete so much.
Klatsch & Tratsch
Some women like to scream and shout, since behind the back is confused or even disappointed or you smile at alliances.
Women are now focused on relationships, so they want to focus on such topics as, for example - who, where, with whom, how and why.
Well, each of us women has a bit of unharmed clasp and tratsch on stock.
Hands on the heart - that's probably all women.
But this is not to be exchanged with the greatest calibers that are nothing and no one is sacred, which may be considered by everyone around them and which pose a significant danger especially to women's collectives.
Jágr and Voráček joined Philadelphia with their assistants to win
The Eishockeystürmer Jaromír Jágr had a large share at the NHL at the start of the month with two assistants at the 5:3th of Philadelphia on the ice in Carolina and is thus again the producer of Czech players in the NHL.
In both cases Claude Giraux, who added another assistance and was invited to the best player of the match, took the view of the 19th-century Eishockeystar.
Two assistants in the same game also listed Jágr's player Jacub Voráček.
Jágr claimed after the game of journalists against him, he had a great night of prophecy.
"I'll tell him before the game that he's got a hat trick today."
I've had it somewhere."
"He and again has such a feeling," Jágr said, after his action Giroux already reached a tower at the first shot of the Flyers.
A little later, the second encounter also had "a Czech spy".
Voráček fought behind the Hurcanes Tower and presented it between the circles to the successful Maxim Talbot.
One second before the amphibious of the first third, the home player Patrick Dwyer achieved a short hand, but then the second third belonged again to the Flyers.
Special Giroux.
In cooperation with Jágr he achieved his third encounter, then Wayne Simmonds tied his shot to the fourth tower.
"I love playing with him."
"I don't want to say he's the best player of the League, but he's definitely one of the best three," Jágr said.
"I wouldn't have felt like I was playing with such an Eishockey player when I finished my career."
"I'm glad I'm rich."
"I cut my game on me."
"All the years in the NHL my players put their game on me and now the fun turns around," said Jágr.
Carolina was still playing the drama - through the encounters of Tuoma Rutua and once again four who moved from a criminal committee, it came to a door.
However, Matt Read prevented any further complications he had in excess of two against a success.
"Excellently acting pronger still in our zone."
"He wiped out the puck, I took a ride up and (read) went to the farthing."
"I tried to meet him and I'm glad that it was broken," Voráček described the last meeting of the party from his point of view.
Through this victory, Philadelphia sat at the top of the Eastern Conference.
The Czech reverse player of Montreal Jaroslav Špaček was injured in the game against Buffalo and shot in the second half because of an injury to the upper body.
In addition to their experienced Beck, the Canadians also had an infamous leadership in the Penalty Shoots 2:3.
One of the criminal committees could not change Tomáš Plekanec.
More than the lost points hurt the coach of the home team, perhaps the high-poverty accident in the defense - the game they only played with five players at the end.
"That's bad."
"The encounter we only played with one experienced player to the end, the rest were young players."
"But there's nothing to do, so we have to be done," said Jacques Martin.
"For every change, there was an attack after the other, and we had nothing to do with it."
"We had to make the game easier and get the fuck out of our third."
There were still reservations here," said P. K. Subban, one of the players.
The Czech Torhüter Ondřij Pavelec took out thirty shots from Tampa Bay and thus contributed to the 5nd victory over Winnipeg.
At the gates of the jets, which thus ended a series of five landings, there were five different protections.
Development of travel prices since 1989
Until 1989 there were only five approved state travel offices in the then ČessR: Čedok, sport tourism, CKM, recreation and auto tourism.
The travel offices were then sold mainly to the socialist Eastern bloc countries, only to select from the West at that time.
And so Czech tourists travel to the Baltic Sea (in the German Democratic Republic – the DDR), to the Soviet Union (Sotchi on the Black Sea Half Crime), to Bulgaria and Romania to the Black Sea and to Hungary to the Balaton.
A slight exception was the period from 1962 to 1972 when you were forced to travel to Yugoslavia, then Yugoslavia entered a experimental course and therefore the journey to Yugoslavia was severely restricted.
A great paradox of socialist times was that it was not even allowed to travel freely within the socialist countries of the East block (also the Czech Slovaks).
If a citizen of the ČSSR, for example, wanted to travel to Poland individually or even to the Soviet Union, he needed a letter of invitation, otherwise individual travel was not possible.
Once the travel offices also started to travel in the west, however, they had to buy huge snakes or sleep before the travel office, or at least they had "good known" in the travel office.
That's not how it's been done for a long time.
The same is true. Debt statement - the condition for a trip to the West - was only given "politically reliable" people - the others were not even allowed to travel.
The Czechoslovakia currency was not a free exchangeable currency, so it would have been impossible to raise the necessary financial resources ( western currency) for a journey to the west.
Therefore, most of the Czechs continued to spend their vacation in India, no wonder that the Czechs bought countless weekly homes and doschens - a habit that has lasted until today.
The revolution that took place in 1989 followed a revolution of the Czechs on foot.
While a holiday in the DDR or Bulgaria was the measure of everything by 1989, the Czechs spent 4.5 million of their foreign holidays in countries around the world.
A violent paradox, which you are no longer aware of today, is the fact that you could not travel in the most popular holiday country of the Czech Republic - Croatia until 1989 because it was part of the former Yugoslavia.
At the beginning of the 1990s, the debt obligation was raised in the neighbouring Western European countries, which attracted a strong wave of short-term visits mainly to Vienna in Austria and Germany.
The Czechoslovak had been unable to get enough time from their journey to the West just because everyone wanted to be there for at least a few days.
This is how the Czech vacationers sleep on their journey to Paris in the park because they had already had the money for a accommodation in the hotel or in a pension.
A typical feature of foreign travel from Chechnya was then a full-packed caseroom with reserves, beer and durables.
Another important milestone was the introduction of the free exchangeable Czech crown - after decades our tourists were finally able to buy the Western currency free.
Our standard of living, as well as this, also increases the average levels, which led to a further important moment in 1997.
As a result of the increased demand for travel, after 1997, travel offices began to prepare regular trips through charter flights, which made the flight impossible to deal with quantifications compared to the past.
By the end of the 1990s, the Czechs, with the exception of the United States, had already paid free of charge with all the highly developed countries of the world, making travel even easier.
Another interesting moment in the history of "post total" travel came in 2000, thanks to the high demand for the first direct charter flight into an exotic country - to Thailand.
Since then, direct charter aircraft with Czech passengers fly to far-off sunny countries; this year you fly directly from Czech countries to 12 exotic destinations.
To the 100 Tsd. Chechnya travel in exotic countries every year!
Another significant moment in the era that marked our "postrevolving" development came in 2008.
On 17 November 2008, the United States announced its visa obligation for Czech tourists, which will eventually join our country in the highly developed countries of the world.
In 2008, the Czechs first spent more than half of their vacation abroad (50.3%) and for the first time in their history, they spent more than 15 TZK per head for a single holiday, including the cost of the holiday.
The main meeting is to find a new president - again a path.
For almost five months, the Czech football has no president and does not fear that the successor of Ivan Hashek at the top of the Czech football band (FAČR) will not be known after the extraordinary main meeting on Thursday in Nymburg.
To date, there is no agreement on which maintenance is to be chosen.
And without this there is no vote on the three potential successors at all.
Three stakeholders want to manage the Czech football - Jindrich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomáš Paclik.
In June, Hashek returned from his work, where he had urged his colleagues to join in and find a strong personality that could lead the football in the future.
Only - in the Åra to Hashek, the old quereles between the two connection rooms returned which cannot be attributed to a common candidate.
This was clear and clear on 16 September when the new president was to be elected.
The delegates of the main assembly had come to the people's house in Prague Fourtel Směchov, because the negotiations had no results and it was not just about the election itself.
In other words, it was not possible to determine who was actually eligible for the full collection - only the qualified representatives or the full-time staff.
At least part of the agreement was reached on this one point, as well as on the recommendation of the Institute for State and Law, whose opinion was not based on full authority.
However, the conflicts over the maintenance continue.
Nor did the Executive Committee make any more clear of the matter at its meetings - whether regular or exceptional - in principle, there is nothing else in the agenda.
Even if the concepts of choice changed a few times - the neurological point remained the same.
The question arises: how should one proceed in round 3 to avoid a pact situation?
"The dispute concerns whether to proceed in line with the settlement or whether any other model must be found," said Dušan Svoboda, one of the three chairmen of the FAČR, representing the professional football in management.
According to the set-up model, in the third round of the candidate, who receives the largest percentage of support in the room for which he applies.
Measurements are likely to be made on the compromise that the candidate who receives the highest number of votes from both chambers.
On the other hand, the Czech side is provided that the winner receives at least one secondary majority in this percentage of votes.
"Then the two rounds have no meaning at all, this mode would question the entire twin-room concept," Svoboda understands the entrances of the mother side, which at the best end it is not to add the waning but to choose according to valid setting.
Tomáš Paclik agrees with this too, even if it is mentioned that the appropriate maintenance of all candidates at first is likely to be opposed by Pelta.
"My wish is that it will be selected further after the settlement."
"In order not to be considered as the last major assembly," said the owner (the football club) Victoria Plzeň, who for the first time applied for and held a stand against Pelta in his opinions.
But Pelta remains optimistic.
His opinion is that the new president will be known in Nymburg and he believes that the candidates will also work constructively in the future.
"The possible qualification of the national team for the football-EM today would certainly contribute to the improvement of the momentum."
"If the football is only on the Euphorian well, then there is also greater willingness to cooperate," said the Jablonec official, who brings with him the greatest experience of all three adoptions and this at both professional and regional level.
Rajchl's back there.
"I hope for an agreement, but the situation is unfortunately complicated."
"This is not a matter between people from forests and forests, but there are certain efforts to "justify" the rules for their own purposes."
"That is why a new blockade is not excluded at the main meeting."
"I hope, however, that the healthy human mind will finally be healed," said Rajchl.
Just - a lot of time to agree on all sides no longer remains.
Some negotiations should probably take place directly in Montenegro, but who knows whether football will be complete until the qualification game is complete.
The charter aircraft, which was supposed to fly to Podgorice, among other things, Dalibor Kučera and Rajchl, could not start in Prague in the morning because of a technical disturbance, and so it was sought to take part of the Executive Committee to the point of departure of the Barrage Hinspel.
Finally, however, it is likely that the meeting at ministerial level is crucial to which it is supposed to come on Wednesday.
Josef Dobeš, Minister of Schools, Youth and Body Training, would like to move the split parties within the country's largest sports association.
It is very much on the game: state applications, the credibility of the Czech football and also the next main ČSTV meeting, which will show the new direction for the Czech sport following the financial problems of Sazka.
Paclík is fighting for the president's position because he does not see suitable candidates
If Tomáš Paclik, the chief of Pilsner footballer before the extraordinary Main Assembly, could have made a strong candidate who had fulfilled all his ideas about the new president of the Czech Republic's football league (FAČR), he would not have taken this position at all.
"If there were a good lawyer, I would fight for him and deny the choice."
"But in the present situation it was not possible to find such an approach," said Paclik ČTK.
The main reason for Paclík to go to Duell with Miroslav Pelta and Jindřich Rajchl is therefore to prevent the alleged preferences of the choice, Pelta, to the top of the FAČR.
Paclík also stresses that in the case of his victory, he will only consider exercising the President's role for a year, until 2013, until the end of the main meeting.
In the president's position, he would like to see an experienced top manager who is not very involved in football.
"I have personally spoken with some people in question."
"It's hard to believe that some told me they didn't want to identify themselves with the Czech football right now.
"I'd like to change such views," he said.
In most cases, Paclík argues that the connection of Pelta's with the president of the Pilsner District Football Association Roman Berbr, a man with a controversial call behind the bullets as a powerful lobbyist, has the ability to influence delegates' votes at major meetings.
For Paclík it is therefore unacceptable that Pelta had the position of the President.
"In his victory, today's state would be preserved and there was no progress in the Czech football."
"The support by Berbr, a smart businessman, has twice as bad as football," Paclik stressed.
In this regard, he also notes that Pelta's name had not been used for some time in connection with telephone interruptions to detect corruption in a case of corruption, however, it was made worse by the Pelta.
"I don't know which prestige should bring a victory from Pelta to the (tsk.) football."
"And how we would do it in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA," said Paclik, who said his previous statement, "he will sell the Pilsner football club if Pelta is president," but he already sees something left.
If Paclík should be defeated in the Donnerstwahl, however, he could imagine future cooperation with Pelta.
Similarly, a further candidate - Rajchl, who had supported the Paclik before the main assembly in October, ended with a fiasko.
"He (Pelta) would be the first one I'd go to."
"He has great abilities."
"I could give him a good example as head of the National Mission."
"But I don't think he's able to lead the connection as manager."
"I don't like my nose yet in matters of which I don't understand," said Paclik, who had made it appear in September that he had replaced the Dagmar Damková after the trial with Ludjäk Macela on the spot.
Paclík himself claims he has grown to feel the role of the President of the Union.
And he is referring to his ability to lead private companies, since last summer he is also the chief of Pilsen, who celebrated the first triumph in the League with his support in May.
"I have the power to change something in football environment and contribute to a certain cultivation of it."
"To limit the influence of certain interest groups that tend to influence disciplinary and vocational commissions, which, up to the point of otherwise, has been affected," Paclik pointed out, which does not make any cure from his antipathy, for example, against Sparta chief Daniel Krétínský.
As one of his priorities, he saw the strengthening of relations between the FAČR and the Czech Olympic Committee, which would help him lobby for the political top politicians to get more money out of the lottery tax in sport.
"This is one of the key things the new president should be devoted to."
"When it comes to the control of gambling, as the political parties declare, then I understand their argument, but they also have to be clumsy and clear about where money goes," he said.
In addition, Paclík does not see his connection to the Pilsner Club as a handicap, although he himself emphasizes that the president of the FAČR must be "over-partial".
Pelta is again connected to Jablonec, Rajchl with Prague Dukla.
"That's not just ideal."
"It makes no sense, however, to transfer my shares to the Pilsner Club apparently to a third person in order to return after 12 years," Paclík explained.
Pelta promised new settings of the FAČR that would exclude a patent situation in the future.
Two days before the main meeting of the football league, one of the candidates for the presidential board, Miroslav Pelta, will make himself strong in the case of his election to ensure that the FAČR will receive new status that will exclude future conflicts over the maintenance of weapons.
The Jablonec staff member is reliable and believes that the election will be successful in the Czech election if possible.
Pelta had already made a promise before the unconstitutional election in September, which he wanted to focus on the national team and the winning of financial resources in the case of his election.
He decided only at the last moment to take part in the election before the last major meeting, so he could help him take the two-month break to defend his ideas about the leadership of the football and present it in a broader context.
"People at all levels dedicate themselves to football, they are impatient and are expected to be known by the President on Thursday."
"He feels that it is the highest time that the connection will be led by someone, means the man who is primarily associated with the Jabloneser Club, but who has also acted for many years at Sparta and at the Executive Committee.
He also believes that he has sufficient experience to lead the Czech football.
He is convinced that the Euphoria is responsible for today's problems with the election, which ruled in the days of Ivan Hashek.
"Unfortunately, at the June General Assembly, the sentences were valid, which were not as perfect as they were all adopted.
If they did not allow different explanations, we had already had a president since September," Pelta said.
He used the most important document of the Union as a means of lockdown for the delegates.
"I should be president, then I take it personally and I'm ready to take responsibility personally if it doesn't. "
"This is a basic thing without which he can't be," says Pelta.
Furthermore, he does not try to limit himself to his opponents.
He had already announced that he could have had a cooperation with Jindrich Rajchl, whom he recognized for his legal education and he knew that his opponent would be his first representative.
Also Tomáš Paclík touched him not long ago, which left no dry fads on Pelta.
In football he's been moving for over a year and can already point to some success."
"But his attacks were overwhelming and many people were shocked by his election campaign."
"And that is why many doubt his real character," Pelta addressed his opponent, who probably remained faithful to his announcements that he had already published in September.
In his opinion, his greatest weapon is the knowledge of football from the lower classes of the game until the National Army.
And this should be the distinction of Czech football.
"I would also try to end all the disappearances - from the cause of Bohemians to the consequences of the corruption scandal over the past year."
"At the same time, I would look forward to negotiations with the private and state sector to ensure sufficient financial resources for the entire football team," said the Sixteen-year-old candidate ČTK two months ago.
At that time he also promised that his entry into the top of the Czech football would mean no personal salutation.
"I had to trust myself once with the content of all the employees," he said in the direction Strahov, where the long anarchy is subsidizing reasonably Nervousity.
Despite these catastrophic scenarios, which accompany the next major assembly, he believes that the delegates on Thursday do not travel to Nymburg.
"If it really should be the only point of dispute, as you choose in the third round, then we'll go away from it."
"The football needs credibility and only wins it back when he finally has a new leader," Pelta remains optimistic two days before the possibly decisive day of his functional career.
Rajchl promises that the FAČR will work hard under him
If President Jindrích Rajchl, who has so far been represented at the main meeting on Thursday, were to be elected to the new President of the Football League of the Czech Republic, this would probably be the case for many people in this connection.
Rajchl, i.e., promises to start working hard in the case of his choice.
He wants to introduce system changes and to take responsibility for individual football areas for the members of the Executive Committee.
In addition, he promised to resolve the Bohemian case to improve relations with UEFA and FIFA, to raise more money in football and to continue the work that former President Ivan Hashek began.
"As president, I want to devote myself to football as a whole."
Started by the international contacts with UEFA and FIFA, via national elections, professional football until the youth's performance football."
"That's why I don't want to say I want to do everything by myself," said Rajchl in the ČTK talk.
"I am a team player and therefore I would like to share the competences of the Executive Committee so that each member is assigned a certain area."
And I'm going to share hard tasks so the football in every segment comes up with mileage."
Many would not have liked this because they had to start working really hard now instead of just criticizing the work of others," he added.
Because of the critical atmosphere in football movement, it has taken into account that no longer candidacy is required.
"It's known to me that I work 20 hours a day."
"But I need to know that it makes sense and that people are behind me, who don't want me to break the ties between my legs and any step I take," he said as an explanation why he was late.
"But many people told me I shouldn't give up because otherwise I would do it."
"That's trust you can't play," he said.
He may also be motivated to continue the work he started under Hashek.
"In two years we've been dealing with a lot of work and I don't want to just throw it away now."
"It was started processes, which may have come into force for a few years and I would just see that someone stopped her," he thought and expressed his concern that in the case that the other candidate - Miroslav Pelta would choose to return the situation to the times before Hashek.
"I believe in systematic progress and that's something that Mirek Pelta doesn't bring."
"There are people behind him, especially those who would make the football so that he would only be selected."
I can't deny something, but not that I'm a part of it."
"I try to be objective."
"I want football for everyone, because it's good for everyone and not just the chosen ones," said Rajchl.
He also contradicts the claim that he is only a president of the Czech Republic.
"Even if some people claimed the opposite, I really have the best option for measuring."
"For example, it is time to take over whether one should not share the League in a Czech and Hungarian part, whose winners then ascend to the first League at any time."
"Then it could not happen that today only three parent clubs play in the League, which is especially a problem for young players in the ranks," Rajchl says.
Since the head of the Pilsner Club Tomáš Paclik has now joined the fight for the President's role, Rajchl does not hesitate to appreciate his chances of being elected.
"I am disappointed with strong support in the Czech Chamber which has chosen me to its vice-presidents and now recognizes that there are clear successes behind me," Rajchl pointed out, which also sees the savings of tens of millions of dollars for non-profit contracts, the agreement on television contracts and the negotiations on the lottery law as his success.
On the other hand, he owes himself part of the debt that the bond is not drawn to a single strand.
While he says from Pelta, "he has previously been disqualified to help retrust the Czech football," he maintains the second Rivalen - Paclik for a strong candidate who really has to offer the football something.
"No one can question that he has done excellent work in Pilsen in just one year."
"If he were to be chosen, then he would probably continue the things that Ivan Hashek has introduced and his personal employment in the Commission would obviously not change fundamentally."
He would certainly not want to do things for his own good," Rajchl says about his rivals.
The most beautiful pools in Europe
Spring in Blue
Of Julia Stanek
Planchbecken in Ufo-Opticik, Prunkpools in Budapest: Those who travel through Europe can experience their blue wonders - and after a city-tour or a trip, the soft legs can relax in spring baths.
A book shows where wellness is most beautiful in the water.
If Iris Meder went on a search trip in the past half of the year, there was no need to miss one in her pack: her bath.
Back on the water, she looked high in artificially designed dolls, she turned against weak marble-puttens waiting on them at the back of the pool, and stopped over acrylicly restored youth-style shelves.
She picked up a bathroom and quickly picked it up in her notebook - as well as valuable details about the construction and history of the building.
More than 200 swimming pools have been discovered by Architect historian Meder in this way - and now in her book "Bade joy" is presenting: folk swimming pools in Munich, historical swimming pools in Blackzwald, "Hardcore concrete buildings" in Taunus.
Through 13 countries she led her "travel to the most unusual baths in Central Europe": In addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland she visited places in Italy, France, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland - and in each case a city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
The 46-year-old German is a true bath culture enthusiast.
With sport she doesn't have much on her skin, says Meder - just in the water is different.
It's just a shame that we have to find snowflakes with blue chameleons and chlorgestans while Jogger can catch the disturbed scent of fictitious forests or a happy bird-whitcher in the park.
"I've been asking myself one day why Swimming Swimming always has to be so rude," says the woman living in Vienna.
"So I began to collect beautiful bathrooms."
Double-declining depreciation [d]
Placentas in spring basins and essential sauna oil - the wellness factor in baths is so large because all senses are served, so sweet.
And if the builders have given a lot of money, swimming halls can be a real sight mask: "The town of a basement has a water surface in bathrooms."
"It is transparent on the one hand, but reflects the beauty of the entire building."
Everything doubles optically: high cloudy, brown kachells, jumper.
The small-format picture band "Bade joy" is featured on 190 pages of knowledge about the architecture and cultural history of historical wellness-Oasen - but above all, it makes fun of a spring into blue.
Noteworthy copies were discovered by the pool collector Meder in his research in Hungary.
In addition to great health baths such as the 100-year-old Szechenyi bath in Budapest, she found a nutty water in a dirty carshole (Höhlenbad in Miskolc-Tapolca) and a thermal bath filled with alkaline water and located in a glass-rich building (Várárosio Termáfürdö in Jászberény).
Spectacular views, however, offer many heated outdoors in Switzerland and Austria: While you have the whole city in your eye from the Zurich roof bath, you can look out for a swimming pool in St. Anton on the snow-covered Arlberg - and: In the steam bath there is a window from which you can watch the ride on the ski pool.
The most unusual pool design is expected by guests in Langgenfeld: The Aquadome Ötztal looks just like an ufo in the Alps.
From three to three open layers above it rises in the winter, while in the background the mountains of the Oztztal descend into the sky.
Alhambra in Blackzwald
Not in any swimming pool, the pool collector rose through the smell of chlorine into the nose.
Many thermal baths flow to Schwefel, in Árpád-Bad in the Hungarian Békescsba, it is so strong that it is hardly believed to be landed in a health bath.
The smell comes from the alkaline-hydrocarbon-containing water, which is almost black, and its crack pours one into the skin as soon as you get into your bones - a wellness experience of the special kind.
However, Iris Meder was also disappointed at her search for beautiful swimming pools: When she wanted to visit the free and sunny bath in Luhatschowitz, she found an abandoned terrace.
The bathroom designed by architect Dušan Jurkovic was closed in 1902.
When the Meder looked through the extended window of the red-white yellow youth-style building, she saw how uncrusted it was between the tiles.
In contrast, the case was rejected in a commercial swimming pool in Blackwood: the Palais Thermal in Bad Wildbad.
Three stages of construction have already been behind this bathroom; it can be discovered not only neuromanic elements that originated from its construction in 1844 but also a marble hall in Alhambra style, which was added about 1900.
Since the careful modernization of 1995, the Palais Thermal is the favorite bath of the pool-kenner Iris Meder - and this is not just because it originally comes from the Blackwood.
"It's already a performance, so different construction styles to melt into such a great unit," says Meder.
At such a palace, the rise in the thermal pool is evident only for further reasons.
Agrar-Speculation
Deutsche Bank allows raw material business to be lit
By Christian Teevs
Does the German Bank give up its business with agricultural raw materials?
According to SPIEGEL-ONLINE information, Josef Ackermann has commissioned a working group to examine the consequences of speculation for the poor in the world.
In January, the company head wants to see the consequences.
Hamburg--
For the German citizens, the matter is clear: 84% of Germans find it unacceptable to speculate that banks with agricultural raw materials such as whites or corn.
Two thirds of the respondents even demand that the German Bank and other credit institutions get out of this business, as it strengthens the problems of the world's poor.
This is the result of a Forsa survey in the order of the consumer organisation Foodwatch.
The study is based on a report presented by the Foodwatch in mid-October.
In this respect, author Harald Schumann shows that the laws on global raw materials drive prices to high - and banks are therefore responsible for the global hunger problem.
The consumer protection campaign is directed specifically against German bank chief Josef Ackermann, even if large banks such as Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley act similarly.
Originally, raw materials laws were intended to protect traders from price fluctuations.
In the meantime, however, most experts agree that sugar has been linked to supply and demand - and at the expense of the worst benefits.
Unlike US competitors, Ackermann responded to criticism: He promised to check out the charges and said that it was not "the good call of the German Bank to play".
According to information from SPIEGEL ONLINE, an international working group is currently checking the rules from the feedwatch report.
By the end of the year the test will be completed and the results will be presented to the German Bank Board - as well as a recommendation on how it should be carried out.
At the end of January, the bank's tops want to report its consequences.
At the end, there could be a reduction in the raw material business, or even complete withdrawal.
Ackermann stuck to his image
Foodwatch Chief Thilo Bode welcomed the message, but at the same time confirmed his criticism at the financial sector: "The law on rising prices of food shows particularly dramatic how accountless banks today damage the general well."
Ackermann is now in charge of a special position as the Superintendent of Bankenlobbyist.
"The Deutsche Bank must remove all the facilities from its portfolio, where money is used for vegetables at food prices," said Bode.
"No matter whether Mr. Ackermann is leading hungry people or the German Bank's call."
The appearance of Ackermann comes at first surprise, but it is clear that the company head wanted to issue a perfect picture a few months before his departure from the office.
On Monday, the German Bank announced that the head of the Board of Directors would not be transferred to the Board of Supervisors other than planned.
With a turn of the disputed agra speculation, he could improve his image.
And he hardly needs to worry about possible inputs - so he would finally have to make his followers.
Each second would publish raw material plants
Footwatch is trying to keep the pressure on the manager high.
Already more than 30,000 Internet users have participated in the organization's campaign.
On Tuesday the survey was published by the Institute Forsa on 7 and 8 November 1001 people.
Only 11 percent are therefore considered to be legitimate for the offer of German bank facilities at which prices are paid for food.
Many bank customers would also have personal consequences if they knew that their bank was involved in such transactions: Each second would then announce the inquiry to all the facilities where money flows into the raw material speculation.
43% would be opened by a known bank, 49% would suggest to think about preaching their account and changing it to another institution.
21st House in Vienna
The surrounded Pavilion
By Ingeborg Wiensowski
An architectural history with heights, depth and happiness End: The Austrian World Exhibition Pavilion of Brussels in 1958 was awarded prices, was released in Vienna to the museum.
Now he's going to be reopened as an exhibition home.
When modern post-war architecture is heated by clear forms, glass halls, courageous shelves and new materials that are typical of the technical progress of faith, the Austrian Pavilion of architect Karl Swanzer for the 1958 world exhibition is an outstanding and famous example.
Swanzer's Pavilon then obtained the Grand Prix d'Architecture for its light and flexible steel glass construction.
The building is still considered to be a milestone of contemporary architecture.
He made the architects so famous that he also built the next world exhibition in Austria, Pavillon.
With his legendary BMW-Vierrzylinderhouse, he was finally internationally famous in 1973.
After the exhibition in the Swiss garden of Vienna as a temporary exhibition building, Pavilion was built and opened a museum of the 20th century in 1962 - the "20th house" was named after it.
The building was suitable but not spacious and technically as a museum - no walls on the walls of art, no good climate.
Nevertheless, it was used so long that modern art in Vienna became a new house.
Since 2001, the building has been empty and has come down more and more.
Now Architect Adolf Krischanitz has built the Pavilon, now called "21st house" and will be used as a museum for contemporary art in the future.
The museum Belvedere, to which the house belongs, opens the first exhibition - a happy event in every respect.
The new Agnes Husslein-Arco, who became the new director of the Austrian Gallery Belvedere in 2007, has been introduced.
Husslein-Arco, an art historian, promoted with remarkable careers, including in the youth as an iceman, later at Sotheby's, the Guggenheim Museum and as director of the Museum of Modern Salzburg, put pressure on the reconstruction by politicians and mental defenders, acquired public funds and private sponsor money and made use.
In addition to present art, the works of the painter Fritz Wotuba should be exposed by the same-named Foundation, give a café and a bookstore and build an office.
Strong supervision, small states
For implementation, then, Krischanitz was the ideal setting.
Not only because Joseph Olbrichs Secession was sensitively built and expanded in Vienna and had won the competition, but because he had studied at Swanzer at the Technical University of Vienna and the Pavilion was a "unusual important place" for him, where he "was almost every week" looking at the exhibitions.
He knew the Ur design, and he knew the problems of the building, which had already been lost in his translation into Vienna and his reuse to greatness and ease.
In the current reconstruction there were much greater problems: the building was "a energy leak," says Krischanitz.
The window profiles of the glassfassade have been changed, glass phased insulation glass has been used and the glass roof has been replaced by a special safety glass.
Cold brakes have been reinforced or replaced, and ash-filled tyres have been cleaned.
Two basements provided space for the new use, a low-end light hole between the house and the street provides lighting, a bridge leads to entry - almost a new one, but still the light Swanzer-Pavillon.
The original outer doors are left, the house is lined up in the old red-brown rose protection colorton.
And the cinema is even as good as it was before.
And that's all under the strict supervision of the memory authority and with small states.
"How often a material had to be found, which is good and cheap and also the memory protection has been lost," Kristchanitz says, pointing to a crying ground in the basement.
Despite all the pressures, problems and buildings, the building remained flexible and easy.
It was difficult to be with the Pavilion, "the one who came from Brussels," Kristchanitz recently said, a typical "Drop-in-the-City history".
Such an architecture is "always in the wrong place" and yet "increase the right consciousness".
In this case, the 21st house is not in the wrong place, because it is a city-based accident: the Swiss garden is just the newly planned "main railway station" with office and residence.
And another disaster may still occur: The 21st House could be strengthened by another Kristchanitz building, because the collector Francesca of Habsburg has bought the Berlin Temporary Kunsthalle, and as you can hear, it is already negotiating with the city for a nearby location in the Swiss garden.
Train plant Winter crisis package in millions
The train has issued a crisis plan to prevent flooding in the winter.
The number of employees should be doubled.
It costs millions.
In the fight against winter-conditioned arrivals and delays, the German Railway has an additional 70 million euros this year followed by a newspaper report.
The "Picture" Zeitung reported before calling for an internal crisis plan by 2015, its investments totalled around EUR 300 million.
To achieve better availability of vehicles and rail networks, extreme windings should also be achieved.
Among other things, it is planned to double the internal and external workers for the snow eradication on railway stations and roads to 16,000 people.
The aim is to free trains up to the start of operation and 90 percent of the operating weasel required within four to five hours of snow and ice.
Two months ago, the Chief of Railway Rüdiger Grube had also warned of a peak meeting with government and industry before arrivals and delays in this winter.
In the past winter, the railway had serious problems in passenger transport, since it was lacking, among other things, in severe weather conditions.
This is how many new regional trains have been expected for years to be approved by the Railway Federal.
There is also a delay in the delivery of ICE trains.
The train has also been making it necessary for them to check the axles of ICE trains more frequently in the workshop after an ICE had an axle break in the Kolner Main Station.
Deutsche Bank pays millions of fines in the United States
After the tumult about Chief Josef Ackermann comes new stranger from the United States: The German Bank has to pay a million bet there.
If the problems were not enough for the German Bank, the industry still holds its past in the United States: Frankfurt Institute pays $145 million (106 million) in comparison to contribute to conflicts caused by five major social banks during the financial crisis.
It's about selling mortgage papers.
The financial market regulator NCUA proposes a whole range of large banks to lead the company banks with false promises for the purchase of financial products; they had taken the risks down.
Such paper was lost during the financial crisis at great value and the banks were sinking into the depths.
"We are pleased that we could solve the issue without having to go to court," said a German bank speaker in New York.
The bank did not commit any debts against the comparison.
This is also true of the Citigroup, which committed itself to paying $20.5 million.
The NCUA president, Debbie Matz, welcomed the absence of both households.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for the U.S. Societies Banks and urges in their cases to protect customer deposits.
The NCUA is trying to replace the resulting billions of serious damage.
The comparisons now closed are the first of their kind.
The regulator had also dedicated himself to other large banks and in the summer JPMorgan Chase, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
In the case of the request for mortgage papers it is a so-called Mortgage-backed securities.
These are the basis for home credit.
When the US real estate collapse took place in 2007, this was a number of financial firms to be arrested.
In September 2008, at the height of the financial crisis, the US Investment Bank Lehman Brothers took over.
Even if the events have been back for several years, the banks in the United States are now facing a harsh wind.
Investors and supervisory authorities have made countless complaints in order to recover or to recover damages.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has dissolved the largest clause.
It invites 18 international banks to benefit from two state-owned state-owned Fanny Mae and Freddie Mac in mortgage transactions of about 200 billion dollars.
The German Bank must also have a complaint from the FHFA, which is worth more than $14.2 billion from 2005 to 2007.
The supervisory authority requires Frankfurter to stand up for "substantial losses" without calling an accurate sum.
The German Bank had rejected the claims as irrevocable and explained that it wanted to return.
Warren Buffett increases by 10 billion at IBM
Financial buffett invests heavily in IT company IBM.
Since March, he has bought shares worth more than ten billion dollars.
In the meantime, the great American investor Warren Buffett had always stated that it was not possible to invest in IT and computer companies, since long-term development of companies is only bad forecasting.
However, he has now read the business reports of IBM and changed his opinion on investments in the industry.
He has already had to understand much earlier that IBM offers services in particular and creates computer systems for the IT distributions of other companies.
An investment by Warren Buffett is considered to be a hit in the financial world.
As a result, the IT image IBM can now be called "Sir IBM".
Because Buffett now included in the CNBC US economy, that he had bought IBM shares in the value of $10.7 billion since March.
Its investmentholding Berkshire Hataway is therefore one of the largest shareholders of IBM with a share of 5.5 per cent.
Buffett said that IBM didn't even know anything about the commitment.
He praised the management that he himself had provided for good results in the economic crisis.
"They've done a great job," said Buffett to the strategy.
IBM has been spending a lot of time on the lucrative IT services such as the operation of computer centres.
The more than 100 years old computer pioneer also offers software and advice as well as powerful business computers.
Buffett had been renting technology companies up to date.
He says he only invests in companies whose business he also understands.
Instead, Buffett hit about with a freight train, with a lubricant manufacturer or machine builders.
Its Holding Berkshire Hataway has about 80 own subsidiaries also shares in a whole range of large companies such as Coca-Cola or Munich Re, the former Munich back.
The 81-year-old had taken over the small textile company Berkshire Hataway in the 1960s and had built it into one of the most valuable companies in the world.
However, his life-style has been ruled out.
It is therefore a cult figure for countless employers around the world.
His almost unfathomable sense of monetary value brought him the name "Omaha's Oracle".
Following the announcement of the Buffet Investment, IBM’s share grew by a percentage.
"Big Blue", as IBM is also called, is worth more than 220 billion dollars at the stock market and is therefore among the most valuable technology companies in the world with Apple and Microsoft.
At Microsoft, said Buffett, he didn't want to come in.
Founder Bill Gates was a close friend.
The threat is understandable
After the discovery of the "Zwickauer Cell" there are two Turkish media in the German state.
A newspaper even speaks of a "bloody ideology" that now survives.
The murder of eight Turkish voters and a Greek retailer between 2000 and 2006 had a legal extremist background.
This message responds to fear and concern in Turkey and within the German population in Germany.
For many German-Turkeys, this brings back a long-founded advantage: since the fire attacks in Mölln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993, there has been no comparable violence with legal extremism.
However, the fact that there is foreign hostility in Germany was never a question.
However, the discovered legal extremism network reveals a scale whose dimension is not visible for a long time.
"Is the Bloody Ideology Again?" titled the Internet issue of the Turkish newspaper "Haberturk".
However, the newspaper "Sabah" stresses that one of the daughters should be a V-man of the constitutional protection and shows concern that German authorities could also be developed in the legal summit.
The Turkish community of Germany responded: On the weekend with a monthly watch in front of the Brandenburg Tower, she recalled the victims of racist violence.
Just two weeks ago, the Turkish Community in Berlin had thought together with German and Turkish politicians in a festival of the fifth anniversary of the German-Turkey business agreement.
In happy colors, the interstellar was impressed - as a story of success.
As an example, the reporting of some Turkish media: "Germany's gift to the fifteenth" reads the title of an article in the Turkish Internet platform "Haber X", which refers to the background of the murder series.
The German edition of the "Hürriyet" also does not allow for this thoughtal link.
"It begins to sneez," says the title of the column by Ahmet Külahci.
He stressed that people were killed, paid taxes and had made an important contribution to the reconstruction of Germany with their work.
At first critically, the police are discussed in German Internet forums and their subsequent arrests.
Why it has not been much more likely for the German authorities to search for suspects in legal extremism circles, the authors wonder.
At least one of them shows rhetorically ready for drastic measures: "If we continue to break up here, the migrants remain nothing other than self-defence and armament."
"That'll probably be the best self-defense."
"From the goodness of the disclosure and appropriateness of the punishment of the entire network, the internal peace in Germany is very much dependent on the well-being of Germany," writes "Sell".
What it means is that if internal peace in Germany is in danger, the attacks of Mölln and Solingen in the 1990s will be explained.
The photo of the fire Queen of Solingen is deeply enthralled in German and Turkish memory.
Because no other event showed the living Turks here more clearly that there is a serious threat, and that Germans can speak of munitions and distance in right-wing violence.
However, the attacks intensified our feelings on the Turkish side.
Undo the last action
In the Turkish press, in particular, the failure of German policy after the attacks was prevented: Helmut Kohl refused to visit the survivors of Möln.
After the fire attack by Solingen, he sent a partegram to the Turkish presidents, but he was represented at the ceremony in Cologne by his Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel.
All the way a person's value is calculated according to the height of his tax duties.
The current reporting of the Turkish media again shows how deep the mystery of many Germans is in this state of law since then.
In addition to the efforts to clarify and reevaluate terrorism in Germany, open words are needed this time.
The Zurese scandal bank
The most random bank in Europe is not located in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
The BW went into the financial crisis almost bankrupt and later closed from a crisis to the next.
Now it's supposed to be a German.
That's how Axel Weber probably didn't think.
After his spectacular departure from the top of the Bundesbank in July, he was informed that in 2013 he would take on an almost spectacular new job: the president of the Governing Council of the Swiss Grandbank BH - an unexpected and lucrative career step.
Axel Weber welcomed the public, praised Switzerland for its beauty and for its new solidarity and left friendly comments on the future colleagues.
"The U.S. has created the tournament."
"I am happy to work with Kaspar Villier and Oswald Grübel."
But in September it was clear that everything would be different.
A trader from the Bank in London had gone through all bank security systems and requested about EUR 1.7 billion.
BH President Oswald Grübel, a banker not only famous in Switzerland, had to go.
Since then, the President of the Board of Directors of the Administrative Board has also been accused - and all of them have asked: When will Axel Weber finally come?
Weber has already been known to consult the Bank of February 2012.
And he is already taking over in May - not only in 2013, as the bank reported on Tuesday.
For Axel Weber, it's gonna be hard.
He is no banker, much more economic professor and notation banker and had certainly needed a working time.
He then assumes responsibility for a bank's strategy, which should have demonstrated once again that it deserves the title "largest scandal bank in Europe".
Because the BW is huge on the one hand - until recently it was the world's largest asset manager - and has been closing up for years from a scandal in the next.
Nothing, it seems, remains such a proud Swiss bank.
It started in the financial crisis.
By 2007, the U.S.B. had an excellent reputation.
The image of the lost and solid but also exhilarated Swiss asset manager had combined it with noble objectives: she also wanted to become a very large number in investment banking.
Thus, the 2007 BBB managed, on the other hand, with 1.6 billion dollars more money available to customers than any other bank in the world.
And on the other hand, it was awarded as an investment bank in the League of the World's largest banks.
That was an impression.
The only banker and later a long-term bank professor in Zurich, Hans Geiger, said: "My students have always stopped the BW as a model of a good bank."
"From today's point of view, one asks: How could I be so angry?"
He was very angry.
In 2007, it was first revealed that something belonged to the U.S.
In the middle of the year, President Peter Wuffli was surprised to return, which so far has been regarded as high-tech and equally brilliant banker.
A few months later, the man wondered why he had gone.
The Bank's investment party had requested subprime papers and had to write billions.
In order to borrow this, the U.S. Department announced a capital increase of some 13 billion francs.
In fact, she found investors, however, who had called on some people until recently before the nose: an intransparable Asian state fund from Singapore and an Arab state fund that was so moving that one would never know its name.
But that was just the first blow.
In April 2008, it got worse.
The Bank had to report new billions of losses, and the Governing Council, Marcel Ospel, who was the second most paid Governing Council of Switzerland in 2006, had to return.
In October 2008, the disaster followed: The BW was in the face of its investments in the financial crisis before the collapse and had to be saved from the state.
The National Bank bought the BBG for Zig billions of problematic securities, and the Swiss Eid Association gave six billion francs for a force loan which they could be co-owner of the Bank.
The whole of Switzerland was shot - because she noticed how dramatic it is for a small country when it is hosted by so many banks.
Finally, the 2007 balance sheet was more than five times as large as the Swiss economic performance (see chart).
"We couldn't save the U.S.B. once again," says Banking researcher Geiger.
At the first disaster, the second came to an end.
A few months ago, the U.S. government capitalized in the tax war and was ready to issue the data available to the customers that could have withdrawn with the aid of the Bank.
In addition, it approved a payment of $780 million as a refund of unrighteous profits from these businesses and fines.
In this way, the BW was more or less open to help with tax withdrawal.
At the same time, she lost something that has been her capital since she was in the competition for rich customers: the Nimbus of weakness.
After the scandal, the Swiss banking secret was no longer the same.
It followed the resignation of the President and the President of the Board of Directors.
And the exodus of customer money.
Thus, within a few months, the Bank had lost its credibility in both central business areas: in investment banking through miscellaneous projections and in asset management through tax recovery aid.
And as soon as it's calmer again, just as you thought, now the U.S. will get it back, as this unusual trader's story follows: one individual trader needs EUR 1.7 billion before the bank realizes that something is going on.
And it's going to be obvious: with risk management in investment banking, it's still not obvious.
"In the case of Adoboli, it must be noted that the risk control has changed too little," says Martin Janssen, economist and financial professor at the Banking Institute of the University of Zurich.
The financial situation of a large German bank is also certain: "The problem of BW is that it has no risk control."
However, it was precisely the idea of the fact that the Swiss bankiers had been present long ago to become guardians of the world's great assets: no too great risks, for security for money - even outside the Alpine Republic could break up the world once again.
The treasurers of the Swiss banks became a symbol of unwavering reliability like Lindt and Springli for particularly noble chocolate.
The centre of the BW in Zurich is still suitable for the click of the Swiss private bank - it is only a bit larger.
It's already a classic situation.
The bank has its main seat at the Zurich Railway Station, which leads from the main train station directly to the Zurich Sea, which is covered by the snow-covered peaks of the Swiss mountains.
The buildings here are beautiful, the cargo rentals are the highest in Europe.
Juwelier like Tiffany's is found here between Swiss traditional businesses such as the Conferies Sprüngli.
For centuries the Swiss banks have lived here: from the National Bank about the Palace of Credit Switzerland to elite private banks such as Julius Bär.
The reception room of the BW is a hard drive.
Inside are the walls of marbled walls, so thick leather chairs stand in addition to the bank logo a large indication of "safe".
The BB knows what the customer is looking for here: safety.
This idea of the Swiss Bank has both Swiss Grand Banks, BB and Credit Suisse, but has sometimes been stressed - or told how the head of a small Swiss private bank finds it.
He does not want to read his name in the newspaper, and he does, like all Swiss bankers, with the two largest banks.
The BW has become too large, he finds - in particular in the investment banking, where the Angelachsen had also expanded.
The Swiss had nothing to say back there.
"And if so, they have adapted themselves to the seats of the angels for a long time."
In fact, it was the English investment banking that changed the U.S., which protected its first high profit and then the deficit: no European financial institution has lost as much money as the Swiss Grand Bank.
On 15 October 2008, the disaster was visible.
"On that Wednesday the government coalition of the small seven million countries decided to take the biggest rescue action in the history of their nation," writes author Lucas Hässig in his book "The BWW-Crash".
Up to 68 billion francs or about 45 billion euros, politicians were authorized to save the large bank in front of the bank.
How could that happen?
If you speak to Swiss banks, they will see the problem in particular in the size of the BW.
In June 1998, two of the three Swiss Grand Banks joined a strong group.
There was a bank that was already too large at the merger for small Switzerland - and growing further.
It was said that the two different banks of the TBB had completed: a rich but sleepy bank with a focus on asset management in Zurich and a worse but already more internationalized.
Suddenly the international investment banks came at a cost of a lot of money, with which they were able to drive a huge train.
Two names are related to this rise of the BW: Peter Wuffli, head of the BWC from 2001 to 2007 and Marcel Ospel, then President of the Governing Council.
"I always thought Wuffli and Ospel were a dream team," says bank researchers Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the high-tech, wise, who understands many of the models and statistics, and Ospel, the man who worked from the bankkeeper to the top."
But Ospel has finally left himself on Wuffli.
And Wuffli probably made a decisive mistake at the end: "He thought his models were the reality," says Geiger.
"That's a tragic case."
Tragic, maybe.
Of course: Surrogate came before the case.
The staff of the BBW are clearly reminded of the driving forces meetings on which the Chief Wuffli released the same words: Goldman Sachs from the throne.
The U.S. Bank was the world's most powerful investment bank.
It led the "League Tables" which documented the success of the banks of that time.
That's why the U.S.B. wanted to go up.
Some steps have already been successful.
In the retail business and in the stock trade, she played it all up.
However, the company consultants who have been asked to do so have a weakness: in international interest business, in the banking language "Fixed Income", there is a strong distance to the largest banks.
The U.S. mortgage products have gaps.
To end these gaps, BB started an adventure that almost cost its existence.
Hungry after growth, both the bank itself and a hedge fund established before it were invested in American subprime plants.
She developed into a powerful machine that packed and distributed securities on American mortgage loans - but also held risks.
Even when other banks were looking for the rise.
"Even in the summer of 2007, when the American real estate market was in flamen, the BB bought there," says Banken expert Geiger.
So big the Euphoria, so deep the case.
One manager had to go after the other when the attempts to break up seemed more difficult than thought.
Posts at the U.S.A. have been at the locker seat and are still awake.
Whoever runs the Grand Bank now has a almost impossible job.
He has to find a strategy for a bank that has all of the following business models.
Banking researchers Geiger already has an idea: Close with investment banking, focus on asset management, return to the Swiss roots.
The bank doesn't want to go so far.
But the investment banking is going to break so hard, so much is now clear.
The next Thursday, the new bank chief, Sergio Ermotti, wants to present his future strategy to the world.
The 51-year-old Italian Swiss was actually considered a transitional solution when the bank suddenly broke apart from former Grübel.
In the meantime, he did: he was to keep the business of the BW, sharing with the Zurich Bank on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants to return the investment bank to its position in the middle of the 1990s.
3500 places stretch it.
But that won't be enough.
The BB needs a vision.
Who is she?
What does she want to earn?
These are the questions that Axel Weber is sure of right now.
He says he will only look for a home in Zurich with his wife for the first time.
Next year.
Fear of recession in Europe under U.S. Burse
The current recession in Europe has taken away the courage of the US investors for the weekend.
The government changes in Athens and Rome remain without force.
The broken industrial production on the continent raised hopes for a stabilization of the debt crisis in the Keim.
The general relief of government change in Rome and Athens could not be achieved.
The euro fell against the dollar.
The Italian and Greek glass was still full of gold in the past week, not as half empty - but now the problems were again in the background, says Mark Luschini of Janney Montgomery Scott.
In particular, financial values were on the sales lists.
The Dow Jones index of the standard value noted a decrease of 0.6 per cent at 12.078 points.
In the course of trade, the market barometer fell between 12.027 and 12.170 points.
The broader S&P-500 index was closed at 1251 points, a minus of one percent.
The Nasdaq technology source index lost 0.8 per cent and went with 2657 points from the trade.
In Frankfurt, the Dax was awarded a minimum of 1.2 per cent in 5985 numbers.
The industry in the 17 euro countries has significantly reduced its production and is moving towards the end of the rise.
In September, companies produced two percent less than in the previous month, as Eurostat reported.
This was agreed by US investors skeptically: "We are not an island, but independent," said Steve Goldman of Goldman Management.
Europe will not be able to get rid of a recession as soon as possible, and there will be further signs of weakness in the banks.
The investmentist Warren Buffett confirmed this caution only: It is not clear whether Europe is strong enough to do everything for the end of the crisis, he said in a CNBC-Interview.
It is therefore too early to invest in European government loans or banks.
Buffett, on the other hand, was a decades-old principle over the hills and went into the US technology industry.
Its investment of more than ten billion dollars in IBM supported the company's share rate and almost made it more noticeable against the trend in trade.
The paper closed almost unchanged at $187.35.
Buffett paid an average of $170 per piece according to his own data and is now holding 5.5 per cent.
The share rate of its investment firm Berkshire Hataway is 1.3 per cent lost.
The Bank of America's share was significantly stronger than the market by 2.6%.
The house has nearly all its shares at the China Construction Bank and is worth $6.6 billion for it.
The Institute wants the net gain from the business, especially its capital ratio, to meet stricter regulatory standards.
The aircraft builder Boeing put in place and therefore limited the losses in the Dow.
The share was 1.5 per cent after the group had gathered the largest order in its history.
Airline Emirates ordered 50 long-track machines of type 777 on Sunday and indicated the value of the order to $18 billion.
Even with options on 20 other machines, the volume is up to $26 billion.
At the New York Stock Exchange, about 710 million shares were exchanged by the owners.
719 values were added, 2281 returned and 79 remained unchanged.
At Nasdaq, 1,38 billion shares 630 in Plus, 1913 in Minus and 82 were unchanged.
Intelligent cows spread themselves out in cities
In many places seed breeds are referred to as "problem birds": However, high-quality animals are no longer allowed to move out of the cities, claimed experts.
They like one, they want to get rid of the other very quickly: dogs have been part of the city scene for centuries, but in many communities there are people complaining about the pressure and noise of the animals.
In this regard, a means of combating the "problem bird" has not yet been seen.
Sachrying was no longer to be obtained from the cities, experts said at the first Christmas season in East Africa.
There are experts from all over the federal area on possible routes.
You are searching for alternatives in the cities
Naturalists also brought back the problems in cities to the rural flight of especially protected seedland: the chemical use in agriculture has increased to ruin traditional habitats.
The hunting, the growing construction and the fall of typical fruit trees made the birds hard to live.
Crowds are under protection of nature.
Large colonies with more than 600 Bruts are located in the west-west, in the north-west, among others in Jever, Diepholz and Achim in Bremen as well as in Leer.
There, 2005 provided a controversial project for mass killing of cows in the countryside for negative strike lines.
Critics had described the catch of animals in bird cases and the beating with ties as particularly brutal.
"The normal distribution, the degradation, doesn't bring anything," stated the city and landscape planner Werner Klöver from empty.
The environmental expert Manfred Kaiser from Lahr in Baden-Württemberg also said that he had many undesirable consequences.
"The animals are wet out, great colonies break up and divide into other places."
Glucture is only thought of as an exception to hospitals, nursing homes or schools.
"We have to live with them, we can't get them away anymore."
Without the environment, the problem is not solved in the cities, said Mayor Wolfgang Kellner from Leer.
It is possible to combine animals from grasslands from sensitive habitats and locker offers to relocate them to other places.
"Infototables instead of chain saws" was contrary to the psychology and ethnology Uta Maria Jürgens for a completely different approach to animals: "A pickle in the face we can finally get to the best of our own consciousness."
In Schleswig-Holstein, Jürgens had founded the Asheberger Krähen course to inform the guide on the life of the high-quality sheep.
The project will already be adopted by tourists.
Jürgens also had his own opinion on the criticism of birds: "There is every amount of communication that has to say much."
The intelligence and ability of the animals are legendary: seeds use not only means of getting to a playground but also their tools themselves.
Researchers at the University of Cambridge recently tested at four seasons how far the intelligence of the birds reaches.
In an experiment, the birds quickly learned that they had to bring up a device with stones to reach a motherarve.
Without much training, they recognized objectively what size and shape a stone must have to be in order to enable the platform to collage.
In a second attempt, the pfifies had to solve a more complex problem.
In a underground cylinder, the researchers had placed a small enamel with a motellarve.
With the snow, the birds couldn't reach their beak.
However, the researchers had stopped them from holding their heads.
From there all four animals formed a hook, with its help they then picked up the enamel on the handle from the wheel.
Three of the four seeds have even reached this point.
Christian Ronaldo shoots Portugal for EM 2012
The hopes of Bosnian and Turks remained on one side.
The favorites of Portugal, Croatia, the Czech Republic and Ireland are also at the EM 2012.
Portugal, the Czech Republic, Croatia and Ireland have released the latest European Championship tickets in Poland and Ukraine in the playoffs.
Based on the double successful Superstar Christian Ronaldo (8., 53.), Portugal hit Bosnia-Herzegovina 6:2 (2:1) and made the fifth EM participation in the game perfect after the 0:0.
The Czech straight in the play-off back game at the outside of Montenegro a 1:0 (0:0) after the game was already a clear thing.
No more burning also left Croatia at 0:0 against Turkey, Ireland held a locker 1:1 (1:0) against Estonia.
Nani (24), Helder Postiga (72, 82) and Miguel Veloso (80) reached the next hit for Portugal.
The former Wolfsburg Bundesliga-Profi Zvjezdan Misimovic with a converted trade meter (41.) and Captain Emir Spahic (65.) had doubled for Bosnia.
Sena Lulic saw the yellow-rote map (54.).
Bosnia has already been split into the playoffs for WM 2010 in South Africa to Portugal.
At the stadium da Luz in Lisbon, Portugal announced a start to measure.
Ronaldo was hunting for a freehouse of about 30 meters for early driving into the masks.
A good quarter hour later Nani showed its wide range of qualities and met from 25 meters to 2:0.
The Bosnians who didn't take place in the first half hour had their first clear chance by Torjäger Edin Dzeko.
The ex-Wolfsburger of the English Table Leader Manchester City put a headball on the side of the latte, but the ball didn't cross the Torline (33).
Jiracek meets for the Czech Republic
Next, Judge Wolfgang Stark of Ergolding stood at the centre.
After an attack against Helder Postiga in the Bosnian Strafrum, Stark decided on Schwalbe and showed the Portuguese the yellow card (36).
On the other hand, Stark had a disputed trading firm following an action by Fabio Coentrao, who certainly transformed the Misimovic.
After the break, however, the vice-president made it clear in 2004 with four encounters.
For Chechnya, Petr Jiracek ended in 81. The last two minutes also ended.
This is why the European master of 1976 is following the EM for the fifth time.
However, the team of trainer Michal Bilek with the German legionaires Michael Kadlek (Bayer Leverkusen) and Thomas Pekhart (1 FC Nürnberg) had also been lucky and had to last a second.
In the last moment, a possible owner by Thomas Sivok (9).
Montenegro had its greatest possibilities when Duo Stefan Jovetic and Dejan Damjanovic were in action.
Damjanovic jumped in the 40th minute from the drive from the strand border just barely over at the port of Cech.
After the break, the quarlatte had to be saved for the already wounded world class waiter of the Czechs, again the Governor of the FC Seoul (50).
The door just before closing finally made everything clear.
Turkey therefore lost the football wonder of Zagreb.
Four days after the 0:3 in Istanbul, the Turks didn't come out of a 0:0 in Zagreb.
While National Trainer Guus Hidink has to take his place as safe as possible on the WM-third bank in 2002, Croatians can enjoy their fourth participation in an EM environment.
Before 31,000 spectators at the Maximir Stadium, the Turks had discovered almost a dream start.
Selcuk Inan met in the seventh minute with a distance of only the pphostes, the attacker Kazim Kazim could not lower the gap in the tower.
However, after the second step, Croatia took more and more control.
After the break the Croats didn't burn anything.
In addition to Mario Mandzükic from the VfL Wolfsburg, who made it up from 62 minutes for the Dortmunder Ivan Perisic place, the German legionaires Daniel Pranjic (Bayern Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Intracht Frankfurt) were still in use.
Trapattoni for EM
In Dublin, the Irish celebrated the first EM participation since 1988 in Germany.
Stephen Ward brought the team of Trainer Giovanni Trapatoni, who had already made the 4:0 success in the game for a preliminary ruling at the 32nd minute.
Konstantin Vassilijev (57.) looks good for the guests.
Ireland had to wait until 23 minutes before Robbie Keane from Los Angeles Galaxy had the first good chance.
Only at the last moment did the Estonian Interior Service prevent the possible leadership target.
But it was so far in the 32nd minute.
After an unfortunate turn of closure by Pavel London, Ward was in position and pressed the ball at 1:0 across the line.

SAP wants to double the number of employees in China
Europe’s largest software manufacturer SAP invests billions in China in the next few years and wants to double the number of its employees in the country.
By 2015, about two billion dollars (about 1.5 billion euros) will be spent, shared by the Dax Group on Tuesday.
"We will create additional research and development facilities and set up appropriate staff," Co-Chief Bill McDermott announced at a customer fair in Beijing.
The population is now expected to grow from about 2500 to 4500 employees.
The number of discounts of the world market leader for corporate software will be doubled from five to ten or eleven.
So far SAP is present in Beijing, Shanghai, Guanzhou, Chengdu and Dalian.
About 4,000 of the world’s more than 176,000 SAP customers are located in the Boomland.
The growth plans in China are also an important building block of the Dax Group’s 2015 strategy.
SAP wants to increase its sales to EUR 20 billion by 2015.

Currently, the software provider's business, which employs 55 000 employees worldwide, is running as well as rarely before.
SAP has been active in China for 20 years.
"Now we want to expand our activities (...)," explained McDermott.
"Our goal is to promote sustainable growth in China through comprehensive disclosure."
Mass slaughter at a personal level
Stunned and generous, Peter Englunds begins his new book "Greed and Smell. A story of the First World War, tells in nine cycles" with a long list of leading people who go to heart.
Here is a tip as you could go forward: Cut this page carefully and make it your bookmark.
You'll get to know these people in England's romantic story very well. And these main people will work as your GPS, as a lighthouse in these few moments where you like England's men and women are lost in the snow of the war and your illusions are shattered.
Peter Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which determines the Nobel Prize for Literature.
He wrote an unusual book that he did not describe as an inappropriate work of ancient history.
It contains only a few great names, important contracts or famous battles. There are few messengers, exploratory reporters or discussions about tactics and equipment.
It's less a book about what happened, he explains, but rather "a book about how it was." It's about "Emotions, impressions, experiences and voices".
"Beautifulness and fear" is almost the war experience of 20 more or less independent men and women on both sides of the war, from school ladies and botanists to mountain climbers, doctors, hospital drivers and offices.
Some of these people are going to hell.
Some will be caught in war, lose weight, be mocked or die.
Each of these lives flickered like the vodkas in one church, some come up, while others are destroyed.
England's book is weighted from the usual historical books.
It also corrects the idea that World War I was only the dominant position war on the Westfront.
"Beautifulness and fear" travels with an expert view over other places of war: the Alps, the Balkans, the East Front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
On the soldiers in this book, beekeepers, a celebrated Christmas night under the pyramids in Egypt, set-up flights are an inexhaustible problem.
This is almost from the beginning of a moving book.
The war overwhelms these people's lives like a natural disaster, like a hurricane Katrina that flows to Cordit.
Imagine that you are a woman who is home with her children and cannon fire is on the street. Do you stay or catch the flight?
Who's coming at all?
No one understands what's going on or why this war is going on at all.
"Failure facts," says England, "are shaped by confusion, acceptances, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, alpine dreams and dreams."
"Beautifulness and fear" followed by individuals such as Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young German shipmaster.
Your stories were mostly taken away from memories, letters and other material already published.
Their life stories can be frightening or exciting, but they are extremely alive in England of the small collection that is lost in details.
Many of them are in need of help and help.
In the story of a German schoolgirl, he says: "In return, everywhere."
"False coffee, false aluminium, false radar rubber, paper binder, wood button."
He tells more about the replacement in Germany.
He describes "meat made from pressed rice and ground into hammock fat (and finally served with a false bone from wood), tobacco made from dried roots and dried potatoes, shoes that were contaminated with wood."
There were, as he noted, "837 registered food ingredients allowed in the production of wheat, 511 registered coffee ingredients."
Some stories are about honor and integrity.
An American recognizes his own drive to wildness and says about the war: "I feel that, despite all this, what was intended for men was more than sitting in the living room with the evening sheet or the best seller and a cigarette and a whisky in hand, and so to do, as such a fascated civilization and as giving no barbaric behind its own reinforced and damaged skybrush."
On the other hand, a British soldier recognizes that he is likely to die and will not take notice of it or take care of it.
"If you're willing to sacrifice yourself, take a distance, you want to think that this is happening before a public," he writes.
Instead, it's as awful as "a condemned man who was held in secret."
Other observations are from the old Europe, which falls apart, and about new types of terrorism.
"The conflict has become increasingly an economic battle," England writes, "a war between the factories."
He begins the achievement of what he calls "a new species in the bestiary of the young century": "The word is used and Ideologically convinced mass murderers in the action which strikes while sitting behind a desk."
People behave in an unprecedented way and there are also voluntary behaviours such as heroism.
England discusses soldiers who are actively trying to cope with a prostitute with a sexual illness in order to escape the front door.
"The great expression of it can be discovered in the trade with Gonocokken-Eiter because soldiers bought and laughed at their genitals, hoping to get into the hospital," he writes.
"Those who were really confused threw him into the eyes of what led them to be blind to the rest of their life."
In this translation from the Swedish version of Peter Graves, England's poetry will be shameful and yet inexhaustible and fit perfectly for its human task.
In thousands of small scenes, he begins the way in which the war "contained in one way uncontrollable forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred".
People start asking themselves why their leaders bring them to war.
The best books about World War I were mostly faked like Paul Fussels "Great War and Modern Memory" or Romane such as Erich Maria Remarques "In the West nothing new" as extensive historical books.
England's band joins an unconventional rest hall.
His book has the most glorious ending I've ever read in a book.
I'm not giving it up anymore.
But it is as if he had removed us with his book with this page with the main characters before the nose and touched us with a stream of wood.
After an early failure, a minute's planned overrun
Hundreds of police officers were involved, some of whom wear wear wear helmets.
You had decided for Monday night on Tuesday because at this time there are few people in Zucotti Park.
The operation was kept secret and only a few senior officials were informed. All others initially believed to participate in a practice.
Police President Raymond W. Kelly was among them and his presence highlighted the fact that the operation was full of challenges.
The events of the past weeks, such as the use of pepper spray against Protestants, which violates the rules of the Dezernat and has caused the household owners a huge increase in public sympathies, were no longer possible.
And so the police action was carried out to remove the protesters from the Zuccotti Park after two weeks of planning and training.
Officials had prepared this by observing how legislation was being carried out in other cities.
A disaster exercise had taken place with a look at Zuccotti on Randalls Island.
Officials strengthened the so-called Chaos training - measures to combat terrorism, as well as the rapid spread of a large number of police officers - to focus on Lower Manhattan.
The last unit of education was located in the Manhattan side of the East River.
The order to get into the park came "in the last minute," said someone who is trusted with the order, what for a statement as "training".
"The few police officers who were involved in my knowledge didn't know it was about Zuccotti Park," said someone who wanted to stay anonymous.
"The only ones who knew it was about the Zuccotti Park were the top officers of the resource."
A reason for the secret was a lesson that the city had learned.
On 14 October, officials wanted to make room in the park, but soon back, as hundreds of Protestants came together after they had learned of these plans.
Officers of various police units were involved in the operation from the day of service, including the use of command from the whole city - hundreds of mobile officers who are normally used in high criminal neighborhoods.
Mr. Kelly said that during the day many people went into and out in the park, almost like Pendler, so that 1 hour of the night is a good time to go in.
"It was appropriate to do this when the minimum number of people were kept in the park," he said.
Rescue cars with Jupiter lamps and speakers were ready for departure at the Picke Slip and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive near Manhattan Bridge.
The lamps and the messages recorded above, drawn from the speakers, seemed to attract many Protestants.
When the public officials entered their bright blue wind jackets in the park, many Protestants simply broke up their affairs and left the place.
The police said that by 1:45 a.m. no cells would be arrested to give the protesters time to pack their possessions and goods together.
Other teams of officials have seen how they gathered around to join, and should be required in the park.
Reporters were forced to leave the park.
Paul J. Browne, speaker of the police president, said this was what happened to their own safety.
But many journalists claimed that they wanted to stop watching police operations in the park, and they said that the treatment of officials was very bad.
Mr. Browne said that television cars could have been made in the Church Street on the west side of the park.
When the police moved in the direction of the West through the great crowd on personal matters of the Protestants, including suitcases, costumes and cloths with clothes, they followed their representatives of the city training that was lifted, which was abandoned.
Some Protestants who refused to go were thrown out. Images of this appeared recently on the Internet.
A main core of protesters was located near the kitchen area of the camp in the center of the park position.
Some of the created barriers and the police continued to put their method of arrests.
About 10 people in the camp's epicenter join their arms.
And two people turned to trees themselves, Mr. Kelly said.
Officers of disaster protection were called to cut them off.
As Mr Kelly said, no arrests were held in the park until 3:30 p.m.
The room was closed after the police said 75 minutes later.
Mr. Browne said 142 people were arrested in the park.
Most arrests came, as he said, due to "untaxable companies and resistance to arrest".
The most prominent local officer was Joseph J. Esposito, the head of the department, the highest uniformed officer of the department.
Phil T. Pulaski, head of the crime department, was also there.
Despite his presence, Mr. Kelly "did not perform the operation", as Mr. Browne said.
In order to reach them, a second group of officials awaited on the east side of the Broadway, between Liberty and Cedar Street.
In Cortland Street, a street block north of the park, and in Pine Street, a block south, Barikaden was built.
It could be seen how these places from the police have continued to expand around the Zuccotti Park.
In one place, it was observed how many officers, many of them with protective shields, drove people out.
About 28 people are in the north.
Some of the most violent actions of the night took place in the south of the park.
At 5 o'clock in the south of the Pine Street, a protestor jumped onto the roof of a police vehicle and other demonstrators released the air from a police bus.
In one place, the amount was a piece of sparrolz.
At the end, an official and a Protestant came into the hospital.
The manager's cooperation will be brought to justice because of the decisions made against the city
The company, the hundreds of school managers who lost their jobs last month, reports, plans to accuse the city on Wednesday, as the exclusions are not necessary and discriminatory because of their inadequate influence on the schools that teach poor students.
The complaint is probably the last possibility that the Cooperation Council, District Council 37, is still open in its efforts to reverse the conclusions.
Six hundred and twenty-five school assistants, management coordinators and other staff members who were the worst paid employees in the city and who had lost their jobs on 7 October in a shock described the business leader as a political right to refuse access to a health fund that the working groups were undertook to close the budget.
This claim was categorically rejected by the authorities.
At a hearing of the City Treaty, Dennis M. Walcott, Director of Schools, said last month that the discharges were part of the budget that was approved in June.
A member of the City Treaty returned and told him that there was nothing in the budget to specify that the school staff would be released.
Officials of the City Treaty said they had and warned the Ministry of Education before a complaint. On Wednesday, a press conference will be held at which the appeal before the Supreme Court will be formally announced in Manhattan.
The complaint will be made by Mr. Walcott and the Ministry of Education of the City as accused and eight dismissed workers as complainants who are all colourful or Latin American women, like most of the helpers who have lost their job.
Elizabeth Thomas, a speaker from the city's Ministry of Justice, said that the city did not present the complaint and therefore could not comment on its individual claims.
According to a New York Times complaint project, the cooperation focused on the number of dropouts at schools in the four armaments of the city to support a complaint for inequality treatment. She claimed that poor schools had lost more aid since they were temporarily subfunded.
It shows that, while there were no discounts on States Iceland and only a few discounts in the schools of Upper East Side or TribeCa, 17 school assistants in District 23 in Brownsville, Brooklyn, have lost 46 assistants in Districts 8 and 9 in the South Bronx.
With the finding of the loss of five out of eight school assistants who were employed in public school 36 in Harlem, where 68 percent of the students lived in poverty, the complaint says: "This is not the presence of well-known parents who can organize expenses to cover budget cuts."
P.S.: The budget of the 36th district was reduced by 3.26 per cent this year. In addition, money was lost when the city changed its accounting method for the extra-financing of each poor school registration.
The cooperation also regrets that the Heads of the High Schools were led by language into the Irre, which allowed the approval of the management coordinators.
The memo used the English word "excess" to describe the action, even if "excess" (German: translation) in the United States is usually described as a teacher's change from the school's salary list into a pool of available workers paid by the central office.
"Six-six management coordinators have been released, not translated," the complainant said.
Mission ended, Congress ready to understand Libya
Finally, it seems as if Republicans and Democrats in Washington would already understand the rise in Libya.
All that was needed was the success of the revolution, the arrest and execution of the long-term dictator Mummar Gaddafi and the end of the American mix.
On Thursday, the Senate's International Relations Committee, together with Senator John McCain (Arisona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Connecticut), will decide a resolution that will support the President of the Senate, John Kerry (Massachusset), who will praise Libya for the successful rebellion and the US troops for their "mut".
"This resolution honors the courageous people of Libya who have begun rebuilding their country," Kerry said.
"It is a confirmation of its support for its democratic efforts by two parties."
The language may sound innocent, but so far it was not easy in the Libyan debate.
This summer legislators dispute both parties and the White House on the choice of a number of resolutions to legitimize or undermine the role of the US military in the NATO mission.
In June, Kerry and McCain submitted a resolution which approved the limited use of U.S. military forces in Libya.
The law was rejected in the Senate by a broad border group of both parties and there was no vote.
However, on the same day, this law was passed in the Senate. Furthermore, the House approved a decision to reduce the money for American operations in Libya.
This led the US mission into a kind of legislative fire - with a congress that was sufficient to criticise Obama in a way that was sufficient to criticize him in the course of the mission, but it was not wise enough to finally remove him from the ground under his feet.
Then the inconsistencies of the Congress were overcome by the events.
In August, Tripoli fell under the Libyan rebels and Gaddafi was killed on 20 October.
The NATO mission officially ended on 31 October.
Now the Senate may be ready for trade.
The Committee's resolution on International Relations "gratulates Libya's people with great courage and extraordinary endurance in their own freedom" and "engraves the men and women of the US military and their coalition partners who support military operations to protect people in Libya for their extraordinary courage and professionality."
The resolution also confirms "the national interests of the United States in a successful and irrevocable transition from Libya to democracy".
Will the new measures be fully supported by the foreign relations agency or will they be broken down by the legislators, as the law of June has done?
The last version is based on the opposition of Senator Richard G. Lugar (Indianapolis), the top Republican of the Committee.
Lugars spoke on Monday that he had not yet seen the final version of the new law.
According to the Chapter it is on the Senate that this week agree on a constitutional change which requires a balanced budget, a high priority in almost every Congress-Later period of the Republicans and some Democrats.
The measures under the direction of the Republican Bob Goodlatte (Virginia) will be the first constitutional change in the budget or other area which will come at the time of voting in the Senate or Congress.
Other legislators have tried successfully so far to bring their amendments to the vote, although they have often tried enough.
The amendment is only one of 68 constitutional amendments submitted to this convention and includes a whole range of topics.
Some are double - the same law was presented both to Congress and to the Senate - others are just slightly different from each other.
There are at least 15 versions of the balance sheet change in the Senate alone and another dozen which would "control federal expenditure".
Some of the laws are also identical, but they give their contractors - in particular the beginnings of the Republicans who want to take their course of life - the opportunity to explain that they have "confirmed" such a measure.
The budgetary control legislation adopted in August requires that both Senate and Congress vote on a change in the budget balance.
In March 58 senators voted for a non-binding resolution which supported the idea of such an amendment.
In addition to the budget, some members want to limit the number of provisions which Congress members can make while the Republican José E. Serrano (New York) wants to increase the limit on two times the President's office.
The Republican Jesse L. Jackson (Illinois) has proposed a number of amendments which guarantee, inter alia, the right to good education and health care.
A change which prohibits marriage under the same sex is as a change which prohibits the burning of passions, a constant proposal.
In addition, some legislators want to allow the repeal of federal laws if they deny them.
The more demanding, as the Members propose, the faster they move, as they have been in the past years.
At 111th Congress, the legislators proposed 77 such amendments at 110th Congress 66.
The time expires in comparison with the early 1990s, in which members regularly propose more than 150 amendments every two years, so the numbers available in the Senate library.
But they were not much more successful than they are today.
The last amendment to be added - the 27th - was ratified in 1992, but has already been proposed to the Congress in 1789.
"Founded but not defeated," said Giffords in his first television show after the attack
Ten months after an armed man was shot at her during an election event in Tucson, Republican Gabrielle Gifffords (Arisona) appeared on the national television evening. She sang alone to the Broadway section "The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow" and said that the desire to get back is greater than to return to the convention.
When she appeared with Diane Sawyer in the ABC news "20/20", she ran by words and needed help on her way.
The shipment showed the severe slow recovery of the damage that the bullet, which shared its damage, has crossed the left side of its brain and has cut its head from front to back.
Three months ago, she was surprised to return to the convention to give her voice to the shoulder.
In her first television interview after the attack in January, where six people were killed and 13 were injured, Gifford laughed and sang - and described her generation as "hard".
When Sawyer asked how she felt, Gifford replied (41): "All right."
The interview with Gifford and her husband, Astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of a unique "20/20" specialty that was recorded shortly before the publication of the new book of the couple: "Gabby: A story about courage and hope."
The special is following Gifford's Genesung since the attack on 8 January.
In videos that Kelly had recorded in the first week, you can see her in the hospital bed, with a cool pink head and a long neck over the stem.
She can only have one or two fingers if her husband encourages her to do so.
Months later, Giffords sits in a wheelchair while the therapists show them how they perform simple movements.
A nick with the head.
A sugar with the lip.
And then their first words are, "What."
After a few days, Giffords has another word: "Toast". She wants to change her breakfast.
Videos that are played in the ABC show show show that music played an important role in Gifford's generation: You see how the congressmen, together with the therapists at Cyndi Laupers "Girls Just Want Have Fun" and Tom Pettys "Free Fallin" sing.
In an interview with Sawyer Giffords, who spends two hours every day with therapy, said that they cannot remember the day of the attack.
Her husband said he had read an article in a daily newspaper about the attack on 12 March when she interrupted him and asked for the first time after the six people who had been killed during the attack.
The forced protection Jared Lee Loughner sits in a prison in Missouri and is severely treated while waiting for his treatment.
"Many people have died," said Gifford Sawyer.
"Hard, hard, hard."
During his wife's birth, Kelly Sawyer told her, "I've been hit."
"So, I'd say, "Gabby, you weren't defeated?" said Kelly.
You've just been hit.
And you'll get through it and you'll get it and you'll get back stronger than ever before.
Treat troops with respect rather than respect
The event was a Wall Street-Gala that collected millions of dollars for blind veterans in New York City.
Kid Rock sings a ballade about helplessness, frustration and loss.
Hundreds of soldiers, sailors, pilots and marines gathered around him.
The amount in black smokings stood up and cried.
"The soldiers and soldiers were seen as heroes," said David Saltzman, who organized the grant action in the spring.
A senior military officer on the Gala who was observed, among other things by the Chief of Staff and the then president, Admiral Mike Mullen, saw the role of the troops differently.
"They were introduced as wise children," the officer wrote in an e-mail.
I'm sure the organizers have meant it well.
I know that.
But it wasn't respect, really not.
The cracks reflect the harsh relationship between the military and the most distant, sometimes surprising American public.
The troops will be defeated with praise for their sacrifice.
But the lobby's got its price, say services.
The public is growing as you do people in uniform suffering.
"We were no victims," said Brigade General Sean B. MacFarland, who will be authorized by the forces in Iraq and will soon go to Afghanistan.
"But apparently the only way to support is to press us into the role of unhappy souls."
The issue is extremely sensitive to military leaders who do not want to appear in conflict with the public they serve.
They have also recognized that the forest, which returned troops in the last few years of the Vietnam War, was much worse.
As a result, there are discussions about mercy in styles and privacy between war veterans.
After his two sons returned from battle with the sea, Colonel Mark Cancian warned them that people outside the military world could see their service from two different perspectives.
Some would view them with a sense of awe as they conquered the rebels and traveled to exotic places.
Others would wonder whether an "extremely, violent veteran is hiding under the surface", said Cancian, who had fought in Iraq and after his return to Washington, had taken over an elevated state post.
In his search for work, he said, he said that some of the questionnaires asked him subtly whether he was able to stand up to the pressure of a demanding post in Washington just after his return from the struggle.
"When you talk about your service, you have to stop the negative impressions," Cancian told his sons.
The lack of transparency of the military is part of the lack of interest of the Americans in the war.
Services in the field of war will be taken out by a country that has little experience with the military and only few benefits in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, only rarely seen as a lobby.
"We as a nation no longer appreciate military heroship as much as it was absolutely common in World War II," said Lieutenant General David Barno A.D., the US troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, the praise of politicians and the public is mainly focused on the suffering of a servant.
Teams shall be recognised for the number of attacks they have committed, for the number of friends they have lost or for the severity of their injuries.
Military is facing the growing pressure of the harsh approach to rape.
In this week, an important hearing is whether 28 women and men are charged with assaults against the military court.
Unless it comes to this, hundreds of complaints are prepared for the next hearing.
Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old and was pregnant on the 11th week when she was raped by a soldier's colleague last night.
It was in October 2008 and she just returned to her casino in Miramar north of San Diego from the evening with a friend when she met a male colleague who took a 12-pack beer with her.
He asked her if she should accompany her to a drink in her room.
"My alarm clocks went off," said Lyman.
But the Texanerin lost his mind.
I thought, "Well, he's 19.
He's from Texas," she said.
"I wish I had heard of my feelings of loneliness."
A few minutes after they went to Lyman's room, the man came after her, pushed her down and raped her, claimed her.
This week, on 18 November, Lyman and 27 other current and former military officers are awaiting a trial with a historic hearing in Arlington, Virginia, in which they will decide whether a complaint they have filed against former Defence Minister Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld will be allowed before the court.
The complaint claims that Gates and Rumsfeld have not been subjected to widespread violence within the military and in violation of the constitutional rights of the soldiers.
In February of Susan Burke, a lawyer from Washington, D.C., filed the complaint at the beginning of 17 complainants who rose to 28 in the following months: 25 women and three men who all claimed to have been raped or sexually abused by military colleagues and that the military failed to find out, condemn, or provide adequate legal advice after the joint attacks.
Burke says she's following the Supreme Military Command since the problem started there.
"The military is built hierarchical," she says.
"Who are the individuals who are in the position to pay off the culture? The leadership."
Burke also says that since February she has contacted nearly 400 more survivors, many of them may be part of future complaints.
Her strategy: Instead of putting all the complainants in a basket as they say, they will, if necessary, make many more complaints to get the press straight.
The defence team for the Ministry of Defence, led by the Federal State Officer Neil MacBride, has submitted an application to dismiss the complaint.
The acts of the Court of Justice, which are present in Newsweek, clearly set out the defence strategy, firstly, that the military cannot be charged with any damage caused by the current or former soldiers.
Because of a law of the Supreme Court of the year 1950, known as the Feres Doctor, the government did not take advantage of any damage caused by the soldiers present in the active service.
"The possible damage occurred during the complainant's military service," says the document.
The Ministry of Defence rejects any comment on this story.
Things have changed since the 1950s.
If women are not yet allowed to serve in the fight, the distinction is based on the name: modern wars have only rarely clear fronts.
Both in Iraq and in Afghanistan, teams of soldiers play increasingly important roles, especially in contact with domestic women in war zones.
The result: 150 soldiers died between these two wars, two thirds of them fighting.
It's time for the military to be modernized, Burke says.
And they are not alone in fighting, but three other complaints are held against them.
At Yale Law School, the Veterans' Legal Services Clinic is preparing a complaint against the four main military teams for the necessary promotion of a female hostile atmosphere.
Regardless of this, the joint Vietnam Veterans of America collects a complaint against the military, in which one focuses on the diagnosis of "Personality Disappearance", which has received the victims of violence to get them out of the service - a common premise of activists such as Anu Bhagwati of the Service Women's Action Network, a human rights group.
In December her group filed a complaint against the Veterans Administration (i.e. the administration of the war veterans) in which she advocated discriminatory practices in dealing with performance requirements for persons who claimed to have been sexually abused in service.
Nine laws were submitted independently of each other by a combination of senators and representatives of both parties to the Congress which offer a number of points of reference.
In 2010, sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office (e.g. Office for Prevention and Reporting of Sexual Abuse) of the Ministry of Defence reported 3,158 sexual abuse.
However, most abuses are not reported at all and this figure takes into account about 13.5 per cent of estimated 19,000 cases per year.
The report published in March also examined the prosecution rates: in 2010 20 per cent of the reported cases were reported in the military before the court, only half as many as in civil law.
The complainants in Burke's case describe their attacks as only the first of a series of dreams.
In Lyman's case, she reported the necessary reinforcement of the military police less than an hour after the accident.
On this night, she says, she was asked to tell 11 times the details of her strengthening a whole series of police officers, doctors and command staff.
She had a law of violence and the blood of her attacker, which came from a cut on her arm, was found in her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman was heard by a judge. During this hearing she was asked for the sex she had had before her interview with her friend.
Six people said as characters in the name of the forced father who was finally released.
"I remember myself well on the day the sentence was read," says Lyman.
"I thought we were going to use it. I ran out of the courtroom. "
"They took me to the psychiatric department and I remember that when I got back, I told my commander: "That wasn't his procedure. That was my procedure."
Lyman was invited to seek out a military psychiatrist who eventually diagnosed a personality disorder and informed her of her service.
In January 2010, she was unexpectedly released, so she received no support.
Whether the complaint filed by Lyman and the other complainants is purely speculative, says John Turley, professor of law at George Washington University Law School.
However, he notes: "In my view they should be present."
What is between them and a judgment is this doctrine that has been criticised since it was first questioned.
I'm now a critic of the Fees Doctor.
The military goes a decade ago because they do not have the same interest and the same interruption that brings a debt with them.
He adds: "The chances are against them... but it's important for them to try it."
These things will only change if good people are ready to fight.
If the hearing does not follow its course, Burke, the prosecutor's lawyer, will begin with hundreds of other complainants for future cases.
"We will continue to fight the military in this regard until it comes to reforms," she says.
Or until we die, whatever happens first.
Walls have eyes: How did researchers observe you on Facebook?
Before he became the new face of legal extremism in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was just one of many boys who sent their anti-immune opinion online.
On Monday, Breivik, who had managed to have a ammo in Norway in July, where 77 people were killed, had his first public hearing before the court.
Although Brevik may have been treated alone, he is still not alone in cyberspace: He has spent a lot of time in front of his computer and fought with some of the millions of nationalists who support right-wing groups on social networks.
After the tragedy of this summer, researchers wanted to find out more about these people.
How can you find her?
This is easy - you just need to log in on Facebook.
"We have established that it was not difficult to come to them," says Jamie Bartlett, the main author of a recent report by the British idea factory DEMOS on digital populism in Europe.
Facebooks Hide personal data is so encyclopaedic, Bartlett says that researchers must simply use the advertising tool of the page to determine their desired demographic data with scientific accuracy - as the marketer has done for years.
Bartlett's team found half a million fans of right-wing groups throughout Europe and then visited them with Adds, but instead of connecting themselves with a new band or a new diet product, Ads users were invited to a survey where after their education, their attitude towards violence and their assessment of their own future.
Thanks to Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues were able to ask more than 10,000 right-wing parties in 11 European countries - without having to leave their office once.
"It's a real new method of research," says Bartlett.
Some of the results are hardly surprising. Online providers of right-wing groups are most young, male and proud of immigration .
But in a kind of surprise movement, "those who combine their online activity with an offline activity are smarter, more democratic and less violent than those who sit behind their screens."
DEMO's work is just an example of how Facebook becomes a new hot tool in the hands of scientists.
Idean factories, medical researchers and political scientists use the page to study everything from health questions to social trends such as "like", text messages and status updates.
With more than 800 million active users who add three content per day to the average, Facebook "Data Supernova" generates a research tree that has increased the number of scientific works named this page by nearly 800% in the last five years.
For some researchers, the beauty of Facebook is the fact that you can study through this page people you don't usually get on the street with your clipboard.
"If you tried to ask people of the British National Party earlier, it was very difficult to identify them."
"They had to inform the party first and had never given them access," says Bartlett.
"It's all gone on Facebook - you're going straight to them."
Others say that the page offers an opportunity to identify and solve social health problems.
A recent study by Dr. Megan Moreno from the University of Wisconsin, Madison, and her colleagues found that students who discussed their full-time Facebook are more likely to drink more heavily than students who are struggling with this subject.
Moreno suggests that equivalent students, such as resident consultants, monitor the page and help a student when they post a lot of statistics.
"They can't solve a problem if you haven't recognized it," said Dimitri Christakis, Morenos Ko-author and director of the Child Health, Treasure and Development at the Children's Research Institute in Seattle of Washington Post.
"We have found an opportunity to identify threatened children who would not otherwise have been found."
Facebook also keeps tapping the data of its own population.
The page's database has created statistics on the status of relationship and Valentine's Day, the selection of the 2010 elections and a national lucky index (both in the first line used only Facebook data - Masters of digital freedom have long known that the page should make its large data collection available for other research purposes.)
However, Facebook users know that the page observes them whether or not they want it now. To be able to play Scrabble with a friend who is thousands of miles away, you are allowed to display your own personal data.
But what if the users of Facebook become part of a question they don't even know about?
While researchers have strict guidelines on how to collect their data offline, everything is allowed online.
"I don't think that many users have ever thought about the fact that a researcher could study their profile," says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at London Knowledge Lab, to a study from 2006, where he examined the public pages of students on Facebook.
"As far as she's concerned, it's only about her and her friends."
Then there is the question of methodology.
Even offline there is no guarantee that a researcher is absolutely honest.
On Facebook it is impossible to know how many of the data are true in a user profile and in contributions.
"What you say on Facebook and what you do outside of Facebook are two completely different things," says Selwyn.
So despite his age, Selwyn thinks as a technological researcher that a clipboard and a stick are still the best research tools anyone can use.
"There is no substitute for going out into the real world and talking to real people," he says.
"Social research needs to take care of the social environment - and every amount of social life is still gone."
"Dear and inhuman": Anders Behring Breivik appears for the first time before a public court
Another Behring Breivik, the man who had two amoklobes who were killed in this summer in Norway, described himself in his first appearance before a public court in Oslo as a "resistance" fighter.
"I am a military commander in the Norwegian opposition movement and a templer in Norway," he said in front of a courtroom with more than 500 people.
"I appeal against the Court because you have received your mandate from organizations to support hate-ideologies and because it is supported by multiculturalism."
"I recognize the laws, but I don't feel guilty."
Richter Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during this monologue because "Brevik did not want to give him the opportunity to use this hearing as a platform where he could express his views."
For the same reason, he refused to use Breivik, who gave a written statement, the permission to return to his victims at the end of the hearing.
In addition, Nesheim ordered that the police keep Brevik in custody for 12 more weeks, he had no access to the media for four weeks. He said that the authorities would monitor all visits and the entire correspondence over eight weeks.
About 30 survivors and members of the victim participated in the hearing.
Some came in the hope to see Brevik in the eyes, others wanted to confirm that he remained behind bars and bars.
They all shared the goal that everything was going to end.
"I thought he was cold and inhuman," said a survivor of Utoya to the Norwegian ambassador NRK.
"It was unpleasant, but for me it is a part further after I have seen and heard the suspects."
Breivik took a dark approach and a blue tie and worked during the entire hearing quietly and professionally. He watched journalists and survivors in the eyes as he walked away and left the building again.
Despite Breivik's remarkable indication that he would be part of a greater "resistance" movement, the judge came to the conclusion that he was not mentally ill and said that there was no evidence that he had complications.
Some may have felt that the attacks of July 22 appeared to be the work of a single extremist and not of a group of radicals.
But does it automatically ease the misery and confusion that still haunts a whole nation?
"I wanted him to look like a monster, but he didn't do it," said one victim.
"It would be so much easier if he did."
7 lessons from the interview with the dead Steve Jobs, which was shown this week in a theater
After the death of Steve Jobs on 5 October, some compare him to Henry Ford and prefer technology as a great modern inventor.
But what Apple fans may find in the most recent job interview that was found on the main markets this week, is how much this creative head of business and work has understood.
He was certainly a designer, a dreamer, and even an appointed hippie, but he was also an acrylic organizer, who had worked hard on diagrams - a man who believed that many business leaders were suffering from "a disease of mind," "that a really great idea makes up 90% of the work... [but] there is an enormous amount of art between a great idea and a great product."
In 1995, Bob Cringely developed the TV series "Triumph of Fachidiotes" about the explosion of the personal computer. He spent more than an hour with jobs in which they conducted one of the rare, full-time conversations.
At this time, it was more than 10 years since Apple's job was forced to work hard at his new NeXT computer company, and he enjoyed the broad acceptance of the Internet.
While a small part of Cringley's interview was used in fachidiotes, he says that the copies of the interview were missing during delivery.
A complete VHS copy was discovered in the director's garage just after his death.
This easily revised film material is the basis for the 68-minute film "Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview", which comes into the Landmark Theatre this Wednesday and Thursday.
For someone who is known to accept detailed interviews, jobs here appear surprisingly in the explanation of his technological philosophy and business strategies.
And Incrediblely.
During the interview there are four times too long breaks between question and answer - 10 to 15 seconds after which jobs clearly reflect their thoughts and strive for accuracy.
There are also moments when Jobs' perfectionism comes to days when he seems impatiently to respond to Cringelis questions and tends to go faster on topics or side-by-sides of greater importance.
Before the era of Pixar, iPod or iPhone, the lost interview seems somewhat mysterious when jobs assess what other companies of their opinion do right or wrong and represent their own vision of the future of the computer.
It is a matter of reading posthumous reviews of the career Jobs'. But jobs here as the beginning of dreams that are at the root of greatness are quite different, original and inspiring.
He has a vision of how things could and should be.
Shortly after he had done all this here, he left and did it.
A quick look at seven remarkable sequences of the lost interview:
As he learned to run a company:
"During all the years in the business, I always ask, "Why do you do things?" And the answer you always get is, "Oh, that's how it's done."
No one knows why he's doing what he's doing.
I've found out.
Jobs continues his efforts to rationalise the book management with Apple.
It is interesting how costs were recorded - most of them started with "standard costs", which were applied to mere suspicion and then adjusted with "debt" - developed an automated factory that ensured that business costs could be determined to the minimum.
How the Pope was moved:
Jobs tells of the "Blue Box", which he built with Steve Wozniak, a device with which you could fit into the telephone company and conduct telephone conversations abroad.
The device has already been written a lot, but Job's enthusiasm when it describes the Blue Box as an act of self-authorization is captivating.
He describes how Wozniak and he would test the box by using a taxable phone, act on a call and then connect from an AT&T network to another, while they cross as many satellites as possible.
"We sent things half a thousand times around the globe, and if you screamed on the phone, it came out a minute later on the phone," says Jobs jokingly.
"We were young and we learned that we could build on ourselves something that could control billions of dollars of infrastructure worldwide."
We both didn't know much, but we were able to build this little thing that could control a giant thing, that was an incredible lesson and I don't think it would be without them Apple.
Jobs tells more about a glorious stream, the Wozniak and he almost pulled off when they called in the middle of the night through Blue Box in the Vatican and wanted to talk to the Pope, while they were able to follow Henry Kissinger so well.
Since several members of the Catholic hierarchy were summoned in the middle of the night to speak with the American diplomats, the two had to leave before the pope himself came to the phone.
How he fell in love with the technique (and unprepared Bill Hewlett):
At the age of 12, when he was looking for replacement parts to build a frequency meter, he looked for Bill Hewlett in his phone book and called him.
Shortly after her 20-minute phone, she received jobs for the summer part-time job at Hewlett Packard.
"It had a remarkable influence on me. It was the only company I had seen in my old age, and it shaped my views on what a company was and how well it dealt with its employees."
Later, one of the HP employees who visited the company's research works in Palo Alto saw "the first desktop computer ever built".
He was as big as a boxer, had a small screen with brown wheels and I loved him.
I would climb up and hang on this machine and write programs for her at HP.
How to improve innovation:
Many times in the interview Jobs are talking about how to find new products spontaneously.
Already early in his career, when he built several platinums, he was asked by a client to build up the entire computer.
He worked with a payment period of only 30 days and had to consider both the composition and the delivery of the finished equipment.
Later on Apple, he recalls the problems he had with developing a computer mouse:
"I remember the above arguments... you swore to me that it would take five years to build a bridge that would cost $300] and I stood up, went out and found a manufacturer."
Ninety days later we had a bridge that we could build for $15. That was incredible.
About large companies that are left:
Long before Apple survived, Jobs saw the ways in which so many industrialists competed with their vision in pillars and lost control of their shares.
"Let's say you're working at IBM or Xerox, so do you make a better copy or printer, then?"
They own the share monopoly, so the company is no longer successful.
Sales and marketing make it more successful, so [it is such people] who finally drive the companies and the product that people are forced to make.
The product gene that has led to this monopolization will be collected by people who have no concept of good products or bad products - hand art.
It happened to Xerox...
Xerox could have owned the entire computer industry.
You could have been ten times bigger if you could have been Microsoft in the 1990s...
You've discovered the bottom line from the victory.
About Innovation as an art form:
"There is every amount of craft between a great idea and a great product... when you develop this great idea, it changes and grows."
You learn a lot about his features.
You have to make votes, certain things you can't, but electrons, glass, robots, factories.
You have to mark 5000 things, these concepts, and bring them together...
Finally, it goes on to the taste, it goes beyond trying to get together with the best witness created by humans and then trying to bring these things together to what you do.
Picasso said that good artists copy, make great artists.
We are always shameless in the pursuit of great ideas.
Part of what Macintosh did was that the people who worked there were musicians, artists, artists, zoologists, historians who were, in turn, the best computer scientists in the world.
If it hadn't been the computer industry, they would have created fantastic things in other areas.
Scalia and Thomas are serving against health laws as a court case
On the day that the Supreme Court gathers behind closed doors to discuss the political participating question whether President Obama's health laws will be heard, two of his judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, took part in a dinner sponsored by the Chancellor that the case will be brought before the court.
The case took place last Thursday when all nine judges met for a discussion to discuss the applications for examination.
One of the cases to be dealt with was a complaint by 26 countries against the extensive reform of health, which was decided last year by the Congress, a law which, in the case of conservative activists everywhere in the United States, became a victim.
In fact, a 5 1/2-hour basic discussion will be expected in March, which will probably call for the Presidential War 2012 which will be in full place at the time when the judgment will be announced.
The lawyer who stands before the court and is accused of breaking the law will probably be Paul Clement, a general government official under the government of George W. Bush.
Clement's Kanzlei, Bancroft PLLC, was one of almost two thousand companies that supported the federalist society's annual dinner, an old-fashioned group dedicated to the defence of conservative principles of law.
Another company, which is the Diner Sponsorship, Jones Day, represents one of the trade unions, the National Federation of Independent Business which enforces the law.
Another sponsor was the pharmaceutical agent Pfizer Inc., who is deeply involved in the outcome of the process.
The dinner was held in a Washington hotel a few hours after the court had consulted the case.
The service included Mitch McConnell, the head of the Group of the Republicans in the Senate and a clear opponent of health reform
Scalia and Thomas.
This is nothing new: the two judges have been visiting the events of the Federalist Society for years.
And that doesn't violate moral rules.
In fact, judges are exempt from the Code of Conduct which regulates the actions of the lower federal judges.
If they do so, they may fall under Code 4c, which states: "A judge may take part in law-enforcement events close to and other organizations, where the judge cannot speak, honorably or according to the programme, nor may he be a guest of such events."
On the other hand, the extreme proximity of Scalia and Thomas to two of the Chancellors involved in the case, as well as to a company with a massive financial interest in it to alert moral and government activists.
"This confusing break with moral and the contradiction to the code is punishing the complaints of a certain judge lying, the court adhered to the same rules that apply to all other federal judges," said Bob Edgar, President of the Common Cause, a civil law movement in the United States.
"The judges have won and won during an effective event with lawyers with flexible procedures in the court."
Their representation and their support for a grant action for this event undermine any claim for impartiality and are not acceptable.
Scalia and Thomas show little feedback to critics who say that they would easily mix judicial matters with groups that are led by the agenda, such as the Federalist Society.
And Thomas' wife Gini is a well-known conservative activist.
On the contrary, the conservatives claimed that it was the richest Elena Kagan who had a moral problem, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan was a general state lawyer under the Obama government when the first legal proceedings were brought before the Court.
Her critics forced Kagan to withdraw himself from hearing the case because of prejudice, since they were too committed to defending the law to be uncompromising.
Kagan doesn't make any arrangements to do this.
Boeing takes record of 18 billion dollars in land
Emirate Air Company orders 50 double aircraft from type Boeing 777 with an option of 20 more aircraft.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliner to Oman Air, a business worth more than $1 billion.
It is really a rare message that a company receives a order over 50 parts of its products.
But it is a big deal when the company of the air carrier Boeing Co. is and the list price for these 50 aircraft is in total at a record of $18 billion.
Also unusual is Boeing's orderor: the Middle East, a growing goldmine of future aircraft orders.
In a forecast published on Monday, the Chicago company estimates that airlines from the Middle East will need US$ 450 billion in the next 20 years 2,520 aircraft.
Boeing announced his greatest command on the weekend for commercial aircraft, measured at the value of the order: 50 double Boeing 777 jets.
The Hammer contract came from Emirates airport from Dubai.
In addition, Boeing announced it in 2011 on the Dubai Airport, an option to buy 20 more aircraft that will increase the total list price to $26 billion.
On Monday, Boeing Oman Air ordered six Boeing 787-8, the so-called dreamliner that greatly improved the gas consumption and the comfort of passengers.
The list price for six of these aircraft is more than $1 billion.
"This is absolutely positive for Boeing," said Neal Dihora, a Börsenfachmann of Morningstar.
"The quality of these special customers is very high."
Many airlines in the Middle East are owned by the oil-producing countries.
So they don't have the money to pay the aircraft. More than that, it's an increase in the oil prices that usually damage airlines, since this is one of their biggest cost points, not so damaging because the country deserves a higher oil price.
This is important because they tend less than other airlines to break or move aircraft orders when oil prices rise, Dihora said.
"They have a natural insurance," he said.
The order of Emirates confirms Boeings' leadership position on the market for large-scale aircraft and helps keep the Airbus competitors SAS in check, which attacks the A350 position.
Boeings victory on the airship came four months after Airbus announced, but would move the introduction of the largest A350, which directly competes with the 777-300ER.
One pushes the introduction to gain more confidence after customers have demanded higher profits and wealth.
Boeing shares rise by 1.5% to $67.94.
Mexico's President's sister apparently lost election in Michoacan
Luisa Maria Calderon claims the drug dealer against Fausto Vallejo from the PRI in the race for the government posts.
The sister of President Felipe Calderon appears to have lost her application for the office of Governor of Muchoacan during the violent state elections. She claimed that on Monday, drug dealers had influenced the race in favour of one of her opponents.
According to the preliminary results, Fausto Vallejo has won the run by the institutional party of the revolution, the PRI, the government post in the western state.
"The introduction of organised crime during the entire election process and especially on Friday is alarming, not only for Michoacan but for the whole country," said Luisa Maria Calderon in a radio interview one day after the Sunday election.
"They threatened our candidates, our employees in the polls ... they have been employed by electoral clinics, built street blocks ... and ordered people to vote in [for the PRI]."
The PRI ruled for seven decades in Mexico until it lost its presidency in 2000.
But they strive for a return and the victory in Michoacan is an important step in these efforts.
The PRI hopes for a victory in the presidential election in July.
Vallejo seems to have just hit a little bit, which had led to the polls before the election day.
Calderon, a candidate for the conservative Partido Action National PAN of her brother, refused to acknowledge Vallejo as a winner.
Silvano Aureoles, the candidate for the left Democratic Revolutionary Party PRD, who is still an ambitious governor, came to place three, a difficult landing for the broken and unlucky left leadership for the presidential election 2012.
Aureoles also refused to acknowledge the provisional results.
Vallejo, former Mayor of the capital of Morelia, lies links to drug dealers and forces the other candidates to accept the results.
Michoacan has been controlled for a long time by drug cartels that have specialized in marijuana, heroin and amphetamine.
It is the home country of President Calderon and he has chosen Michoacan to launch a military-led offensive against drug dealers in December 2006.
Violence is still going on.
A PAN Mayor was killed a week before the election during an election event for Luisa Maria Calderon and many candidates were expelled from fear of local elections.
For the PRI, a victory strengthens the party, no matter how strongly the elections in Michoacan appear.
The man who will probably represent the PRI in the run around the presidential office is Enrique Pena Nieto, the Vallejo from Washington, and said: "I think this victory will give us courage in the next year."
ADB forces Asia to help save the eurozone
The Asian Development Bank (ADB) calls on India and China to support the saving of the eurozone in its serious debt crisis in order to prevent a long-term decline in the growth of Asia's economy.
Rajat Nag, director of the ADB with seating in Manila, said that the two of the world's fastest growing economic nations must "all in your power" to speed up the recovery of the currency block either by the International Monetary Fund or by direct mutual agreements.
He warned the BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China), who looked at the difficulties in Europe and said that financial support for European leadership and European resources through Asia would help prevent a long-term collapse of the global economy.
"We're all sitting on the same boat."
"So is any help that Europe can help from this crisis," he said to the Financial Times in an interview at the end of the World Economic Forum in Mumbai.
"Asia may be protected up to a certain degree, but it is not immune."
"If China and India can help, then with all the means."
In the past months, the European monetary union has led to a serious debt crisis.
In the past days, Italy's interest costs have increased at risk and the Prime Minister has returned from Italy and Greece.
The emerging serious debt crisis in Europe is most likely to drive the global economy into the recession and lead to calls for leading countries to come together to support the euro area.
Mr Nag said that any support for Asia would be channelled by the IWF, but he said that mutual agreements - such as the purchase of EU rescue fund bonds, the European Financial Stabilisation Facility (EFSF) - offer European partners in Asia greater negotiating power.
And Sharma, the Indian trade minister, said that "Indi will do everything in his power" to help the eurozone, as its own economy now suffers from declining exports and foreign capital flows.
"No one wants the eurozone to remain unstable and turbulent," he said.
"We are facing great challenges and we have to get a high level of growth."
"It's no option, it's an order, because elsewhere we find work for our millions of young men and women."
Others argue that developing economies, such as India, are not allowed to help wealthy Europeans when they face major economic challenges themselves.
Ashutosh Varshney, professor at the U.S. Brown University, said it would be very difficult to sell 1.2 billion people in India for Europe, of whom more than 800 million dollars or less live the day.
"At once they will find out that the Greeks are going to rent 50 and spend holidays on the beach. Then there is a problem," he said.
Lee Howell, Director of the World Economic Forum, asked similarly why India's reserves should be used in order to keep the many and well-paid employees in public service in Greece, led by jobs in poor working conditions, lost facilities such as the railway.
Mr Nag said that the crises in the eurozone would have "significant domain effects" throughout Asia.
The forecast of ADB with an economic growth of 7.5 per cent in Asia for the year 2011 is now at "the risk of extinction" due to the impending danger from Europe.
He said that harmful fraud markets had to create "crisis plans" in order to protect themselves from a downward trend and a significant reduction of capital in their economies.
Urgent warnings from the Pentagon before possible cuts in the defense
Minister of Defence Leon Panetta called on the Congress on Monday, when he warned that automatic budget cuts would weaken national security without notice. So he solved a financial chain reaction from the Pentagon halls to the battlefields in Afghanistan and the civilian fleets.
The Pentagon is already considering cuts of 450 billion dollars in the coming decade, but it is now afraid that further cuts of $600 billion or more will be necessary if the Congress cannot reach a conclusion in the expenditure.
"The effects of these cuts would be honorable for the ministry," Panetta wrote in a letter to the Republican senators John McCain, Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, South Carolina.
He said that a failure of the Congress to reach a budgetary agreement leading to a so-called action would lead to 23% general cuts and a stop of many new projects.
"As a result of such a high reduction, carried out in such an unexplained manner and manner, most of our ship and construction projects would make it impossible - you cannot buy three quarters of a ship or building - and other modernization efforts seriously damage," Panetta wrote to the senators.
"We would also be forced to separate ourselves from a large part of our civilian personnel, and since the reduction would be implemented so quickly, we would have to allow for the security of the limited likelihood of civilians to reach the goal."
"These changes would destroy the faith of those who receive our military justice and seriously damage our alarm mission."
The cuts were finally met by the fighting groups," Panetta said.
"While the wartime quotas are not directly affected by the seizures, the heavy impact on the basic budget would adversely affect the efforts of the war," Panetta warned.
"Personal settings have been shortened which would lead to delays in the settings and the post-war approach."
"The holders of staff would be cut off, which would lead to late payments to wartime dealers and the legal and political support would be broken."
The two senators answered Panetta 10 days ago and asked for more details about the potential impact of automatic cuts on the Ministry of Defence.
"The consequences of an attack by the Ministry of Defence would lead to a rapid fall in the United States as the leading military force of the world."
"We are strongly opposed to this dramatic action," said the senators in a joint statement on Monday afternoon when they published Panettas letter.
"This is a result we can't live with, and it's certainly nothing to be forced on us."
"The adoption is a threat to the national security interests of the United States and its members should not be allowed."
Whether Panettas letter and the new warnings of senators will increase pressure on a compromise in the budget or strengthen demands to remove the pentagon from cuts will remain to be postponed.
Panetta has increasingly voiced the possible cuts, although he was able to collect many years of experience with the budget in the Congress and the White House before he came to the top of the Pentagon and knew that he was faced with difficult decisions.
At a press conference last week, the Minister of Defence painted a beautiful picture that could be preceded by a military with scale but without core.
"It's a ship without matros."
"It's a Brigade without ammunition."
"It's an air force guard without enough pilots."
"It's a paperman, an army of castles, buildings and bombs without enough soldiers who are able to carry out the mission," Panetta said in her opening speech at the Pentagon.
"It is a power of conflict which is lacking in moral and alertness and which is not able to engage with potential enemies."
"She'll be really hurt."
In an annex to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta introduced new details on how to reduce "significant operational risks created: delays in times of crisis, conflicts and disasters, severe restrictions on our worldwide capacity for use and intervention, which leads to unacceptable risk in future war operations."
And Panetta said that some of the biggest defense projects of the strike could fall to the victim, including those already tested and already in the early planning phase.
This list also includes the fighter F35 Joint Strike Fighter, a planned new bomber aircraft, the next generation of ballistic U boats, the new Littoral Combat Ship and the new underground vehicle needed the army and marine to replace the Humvee.
This would save up to $80 billion in the next 10 years, but the sponsors would say that it is an important next step to equipment so that possible risks can be addressed by China and other opponents.
How to Eliminate a Liar
A look at the current battle lines shows how worrying and widespread confusion and lies are in everyday life.
The presidential candidate of the Republican, Herman Cain, is involved in making charges of sexual harassment by several women. Both sides deal with each other in lie.
The management of Penn State is accused of myinaid, as reports have reportedly been kept, after which a retired football coach boy has been sexually abused.
Last week an open microphone was heard when French President Nikolas Sarkozy accused US President Barack Obama of lying to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
Lies destroy careers and corrupt countries.
The New York Congressman and Internet exhibitor Anthony Weidner became a narcissist when he engaged in accusations that were quickly rejected by unconstitutional evidence.
The former presidential candidate John Edwards is accused of failure in the campaign funding, which is related to the transfer of an exceptional case.
And then, of course, no one who has experienced it has forgotten the media circus, which President Bill Clinton has solved during his second term in Oval Office about his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
Stories about shootings in school and college exams are widely disseminated.
There were occasions when teachers gave their students the exams so that they could get good results from their performance tests themselves.
Mentors who should teach the opposite send a message that lies and rumors are okay.
How much change do we experience?
As studies show, we lie every day between 10 and 200 times.
However, many of these lies are considered unnecessary.
Another study shows that foreigners are staying together three times during the first 10 minutes of a meeting.
To recognize lies or to "discover lies" is one that is important for every person, and this is both for personal and professional reasons.
Far from a society game such as Scharaden, where it is the goal to call "Have you!", the elimination of an exchange of knowledge is a serious field of science based on scientific data collected at the universities seen over the past six decades, which carried out extensive research projects, especially in the fields of psychology and physiology.
One result of the research is that most old myths were removed from the lie.
Lies look at one in the eyes.
They don't always stop, they stop, they stop, they rot and they don't always bite.
However, you must not conclude that these lies are difficult to detect and eliminate.
A trained liar can go through the truth by learning something about the structure of the charge, which teaches fine facial expressions, question and timing.
I've spent several years studying the scientific results of the comprehensive and continuously growing range of entertainment. And it is clear that setting up an exchange is a modern ability that is easy to learn and helps us to find in our complex world, especially if the setting or question of persons or negotiations or administration is part of our own professional responsibilities.
Good liars are very good at estimating other people's interests and controlling their own emotions. And they are excited about how they will be taken from others.
Thanks to research we know that extraterrestrial people often lie more often than introverted people, that men often think "self-oriented" lies than women, who lie more "orientate to others" - usually want to protect the feelings of others - that married people less often accuse their partners than unwed people (but the lies they tell are mostly "fat lies").
We also know that when a person is removed as a parent, others feel less guilty of having joined them.
How do you know if someone's lying?
First of all, by observing this person’s normal behavior.
It's called Baseling, the starting position.
It provides a reference point for later evaluation of changes.
Note the attitude, the laugh, the voice quality of your test person.
They should know better if someone routinely interferes with the foot, so that they do not accuse him of being wrong if he interferes with his foot during a meeting.
Then take note of occasions of casual and nonverbal behaviour.
Consider these seizures as alarm clocks that scream, not as evidence of delay.
People who drown may start when they try to remember their history. Perhaps they show their feet towards the door or lie in the direction of the exit, change their position in a significant way or show a "responsive after the setting", this deep, relaxing inventions and the change in attitude when all hard questions are gone.
Questioners often falsely signal that an appointment is too late just to keep an eye on this delay after the appointment.
In addition, pay attention to the language of your pilot.
The composer of Scott Peterson is famous when he used the form of the past when he claimed that his murdered wife was still alive and resolved a national search for her.
Disgusting people can also use a distant language: "I had no sexual relationship with this woman... Miss Lewinsky" or if you repeated a rude question at all.
The most common signs are subtle.
Some people use "qualifying language" when they answer a
By doing so, the answer will be more effective than technical, which is often due to alarm clocks.
There are no drugs to eliminate lies, but you can learn skills thanks to which it is possible to get rid of them.
Thanks to these abilities, everyone can rarely be victims of offenders, both in private and in professional life.
A cross-cutting plan of an oil pipeline will be processed after risk by late US approval
A few days after the Obama government has threatened to delay the approval of a planned oil pipeline from Canada in the Gulf of Mexico, by calming down trade unions and at the same time protecting the environment, the pipeline is trying to redesign the project so that it can return to normality.
TransCanada said on Monday evening that the planned Pipeline will be reopened from the ecologically sensitive area of the Sandhills in Nebraska.
The company announced the decision at a press conference in the Parliament building of Nebraska.
Alex Pourbax of TransCanada said that the company was still confident that the pipeline would finally be approved, even with another race.
This was followed by a announcement by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs last week, after which a decision would be taken on a federal solution for the project until the new possible process was reviewed, which covered the area of Sandhills in Nebraska as well as the Ogalala Aquifer, a great supply of groundwater.
"This is a real step forward," said Republican Lee Terry, a Republican from Nebraska, against Fox News.
The new environmental review commissioned by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs may defer a decision until 2013, following the elections next year, even if officials have lied that politicians were involved in the decision.
Obama stated last week in a written statement that the decision was a task of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and said his support.
The 1700-mile pipeline was connected to Canada with the Gulf of Mexico.
It would pump 700,000 barrels of oil per day from the province of Alberta to the refineries in Texas.
To do this, the pipeline had to pass through six states.
They have environmental protection, but they love jobs because they appreciate that the pipeline creates 20,000 jobs.
However, the lawmakers Nebraska, who are against the plan, break the laws to force a return from the region of the Sandhills and the Ogalala aquifer, a major source of drinking water and sanitation.
The current study on the impact on the environment of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has found that the project had little impact on the environment, but the source of the energy industry says that the prime minister of the Ministry has called for a separate probe of the review procedure, which focuses on two issues.
One is whether a lobbyist established by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was counsellor of Hillary Clinton in 2008, is involved in a conflict of interest.
The other is whether an undertaking commissioned to carry out the original study was an inappropriate choice as it is linked to TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle complains that she may force a child out of fear to give up
A New Yorker family claimed that the disco-Diva Patti LaBelle in the lobby of her Manhattan building had suffered a fatal accident that had put her little daughter so in fear that she had given up for fear.
The Tirade of "Lady Marmalade" singer, 18 months old Genevieve Monk, was so worried that she was suffering from "personal changes, sleep disorder" and "increasing fear of strangers," her family said before the Supreme Court in Manhattan.
It was last November 10th when the coroner Kevin Monk, his wife, Roseanna, wanted to break up into a family flight.
While Kevin Monk was driving the car, Roseanna Monk took the pack and Geneva on his arm to the lobby in her building at Riverside Boulevard.
Roseanna Monk said she had been detained near the door and stopped her daughter for a moment.
"Someone appeared behind me and said, "You know what your daughter just did?" I said, "Yes," and went to get her back on the arm," she said.
LaBelle reminded the pregnant woman crying.
"She said in an aggressive tone, 'You shouldn't sit your daughter near the door,' said Roseanna Monk.
"I told you, "I don't care what you say or think."
She became angry and started to shift – she used the F-word and the A-word and was very loud...
She had a bottle of water in her hand and began to tap water from the bottle on me.
She said Genevieve would have become hysterical.
"I said to this woman, 'See what you've done with my daughter,' said the mother of the child.
LaBelle leaned on the mother who was still Genevieve on the arm, and had to stay behind from her accompanying and be taken to a waiting car, says Roseanna Monk.
The baby cried so much that it had to pass, she said.
Later, the family LaBelle asked for an apology in writing, but no answer was received.
LaBelles' lawyer and representatives did not respond to calls for an opinion.
The complaint calls for a lack of specific damage, but the lawyer of the family, Sam Davis, said that he does not take into account the honor and plans the family to spend the money they get the childcare aid.
"We want Patti LaBelle to take over responsibility for her behavior," said Davis.
"This kind of behavior is absolutely unacceptable, especially when it comes to the day when a child nurse wears an 18-month-old baby on her arm."
Climate change is the most important factor in the economy
In the first year of Mario López Valdez's government, unemployment and black labour rose in Sinaloa, while foreign investments returned and the economy stagnanted.
2011 will be remembered in the economic history of Sinaloas. It is the first year in which Mario López Valdez, who himself became the founder of the change and held high hopes in terms of economic growth, is in the government. However, because of the climate changes, growth cannot be the talk, but the main economic indicators have deteriorated.
The low temperatures in February caused not only losses in millions in agriculture, but also limited the growth of the state economy to limits and caused a general decline in economic activity by 3.6 per cent in the first quarter. This is mainly due to the historical breakdown of agricultural development by 31.16 per cent, which has had a dramatic impact on other sectors of the economy.
According to a report published by the Council of Mexicoo para el Desarrollo Rural Sustainable (i.e. the Mexican Council for Sustainable Agricultural Development), 582,000 hectares of agricultural land were damaged, of which 78.03 per cent were completely destroyed and the rest 21.07 per cent were partially destroyed.
The decline in economic activity until November has continued to increase unemployment in the Mexican state. In the first quarter, Instituto National de Estadística y Geography observed a rapid rise in unemployment, as from January to March 55,053 people in Sinaloas had no employment, which represented 4.53 per cent of the employment population. In the second quarter, unemployment rates rose to 5.28 per cent and from July to September to 6.19 per cent, resulting in 74 000 unemployed people in Sinaloa. That is 18969 people more than in the first quarter.
Less liquidity
The unemployment rate in Sinaloa in the year goes back to several factors. Economic scientist Gerardo López Cervantes, Dekan of the University of Autónoma Economic and Social Sciences University (UAS), comments that public institutions' policies directly explain the growing unemployment.
"What we are now seeing is an increase in unemployment which has several factors to do. Among other things, with liquidity losses on the market, due to the legal cuts adopted to combat money laundering at the Congress, because it is not easy for those who acquire the forbidden dollar to work for themselves to invest or use them for something else," he said.
Migration stopped
López Cervantes pointed out that growing unemployment is also a demographic factor.
"The number of people who leave the country looking for work abroad, especially in the United States, has declined. This is on the one hand to return to the problems of entry and on the other, because it is also difficult to find work. These people are staying here and looking for work to increase unemployment," he says.
Black Work
The analysis of the labour market in Sinaloa is even more difficult when it takes into account the high proportion of black labour. According to INEGI 60.38 per cent of employees in the country who work without being paid in social insurance cases.
For unemployment and black work, the lowest wages in Mexico are the lowest, according to the statistics of the Mexican Institute of Social Security (Mexico Social Insurance) and the Secretariat of Trabajo y Previsio Social (Governmental Authority for Labour and Social Care in Mexico).
The average monthly income of workers in Sinaloa was 5352 pesos until September; this is much less than the total average of 7375 pesos.
ADI Regression
In addition to the decline in economic activity and increasing unemployment in 2011, the most significant decline in foreign direct investment (ADI) is recorded in the last ten years. According to the Secretariat de Economía (State Economic Authority), the ADI amounted to $630,597 dollars from January to June, which represents a decrease of 87.74 per cent compared with the $5,143,312 in the same period in the previous year.
The Secretariat de Desarrollo Economico del Gobierno (Governmental Authority for Economic Development) notes, on the other hand, a total investment of 17,280,000 pesos in 2011, mainly from companies from the tertiary sector.
The Debts
In view of the economic crisis, in July the Government requested a credit of 3,000,000 000 000 pesos to be invested in the 18 communities for the rehabilitation of the economy in infrastructure projects.
Reactions
For the company's representatives, the first year of government Mario López Valdés made it clear.
Miguel Loredo López, President of Cámara National de la Industria de la Transformación (State Chamber of Working Industry in Mexico), said that no efforts were made to harmonise the views of the various sectors, including the Government of Mexico.
"The economic activity in Sinaloa was really very necessary this year. It must be worked hard to re-establish the lost terrain this year and we must work twice. The efforts of all and in particular the progress of the already well-adjusted government teams have not been sufficiently aligned," he said.
Long-term economic development
Loredo López noted that events such as the frost at the beginning of the year made the economic development of the country difficult and disappointing.
"The low economic flow is the result of several events, including the cold. One of the most important effects is a slowdown economy that is not moving enough to create an economic dynamic that could create an acceptable flow of processes, products and services. Therefore, we will close the year far below our expectations," he said.
Redefined Recruitment
Theodore Salazar Uriarte, President of the Confederación Patronal de la República Mexicana (Companyverband Mexicos) in Sinaloa, stated that it is necessary to allow the State for dynamic productive activities.
"In general we have observed that it has been worked. We believe that it is necessary to develop a long-term programme to re-adjust the country's economic occupation and line, as it is important to activate all material and human resources Sinaloas," he said.
There's a lot to do
The president of Coparmex stressed the importance of developing a future perspective that will lead to government efforts in better roads.
"In general I would say that the government has achieved good results in various areas. Economic development has progressed, but it is important to develop a long-term programme," he said.
He stressed that the current state power has made progress in the government.
"There are areas where you can say that the government has dealt more comprehensively. What I can say is that it has been worked and that the government is aware that there is still much work ahead of it," he said.
Detainment for 8 kg Marihuana
At five years of imprisonment and 100 days, a residents of Navalato were sentenced to eight Kilo Marihuana.
The State administration of the Republic announced that the drug dealer was Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, who was sentenced to a public health penalty - the possession of Marihuana for trade.
According to Act AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I, Valenzuela Sandoval was arrested on 7 June 2010 by Mexican soldiers during the monitoring of the Cipriano Valdez road against entry No 80 in El Castillo, Navolato.
The drug dealer was in a white delivery car where he kept a black cloth in a box in the car and a small back bag on the driver's seat, where the military found eight kilos and 23 grams of Marihuana.
For this reason the seized goods were handed over to the judge of the district and the punishment is still in full.
Debts for construction
The social constructions provided for in the programmes Hábitat, Recate de Espacios Públicos and 3x1 are at risk for migrants because of lack of funds to be completed or only with great delay, Miguel Ángel López Miranda said.
The head of the city's social development authority stated that although the construction programmes have already progressed, they are now at risk, as the government has not paid for the funds it has allocated to the three programmes of 11 million peso.
He said that the total investment in these three programmes was almost 50 million peso, 25 per cent of which fell to the state. Until now only the Federación and the Community had managed to finance the construction work, so that it would be expected to delay the completion.
"12 million must be punished, and although the year is over, they have not given us any money, and that, although they have already paid us part in July," he said. "In order not to be late, we have already started construction work, and they are already making progress, but we need the money."
He stressed that under the government of Jesús Aguilar Padilla the State had not fulfilled its obligations, why the Community had to accept a loan of 7 million dollars at the beginning of its government period.
"This has been the case in the last legislator period, because the State did not have sufficient economic resources. The programmes continued and we had to create funds that the State had not given up to participate in these programmes in this year," he said.
Even if the government authorities are obliged to pay for this fund, he commented that the Minister for Administration and Finance was asked to speed up administrative work and to pay the outstanding amount as quickly as possible.
"At least 12 million must be punished, and although the year is over, they have not given us a penny."
The Court approves the transfer to the digital television in Mexico for 2015
The transformation of analogues into digital signals has been one of the most important changes in the world in recent years.
The Supreme Court of Mexico (SCJN) presented the constitutional complaint filed by the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies against the Presidiumary leave and the power to deliver analogs on digital signals from 2021 to 2015, due to the lack of eight votes necessary for law enforcement.
A minority of four ministers, including the President of the Supreme Court, Juan Silva Meza, was the view that President Felipe Calderón did not go beyond his responsibilities when he issued the legislative decree with details on the movement to the territorial digital television.
This decision rejected the constitutional dispute brought into force by the Senate because it did not receive the required qualified majority by eight votes in order to allow the Court to decide whether the Constitution or non-constitutional.
In the draft complaint prepared by Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero, it was proposed to clarify the law code for constitutional reasons as the Federal Commission for Telecommunications (Cofet) (Federal Commission for Telecommunications in Mexico) is responsible for the radio and television regulations.
Only Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero approved the project.
With this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies filed constitutional complaints against the bill. Following the adoption of the complaint, Minister Sánchez Cordero no longer referred to the bill and introduced all activities to establish the digital transfer.
The Council of Ministers also called for the complaint submitted by the Chamber of Auditors to be brought into the debate on the project which was also responsible for the Minister Sánchez Cordero.
In its contribution, the Prime Minister did not agree with the arguments of the project, and since the country Government does not have to regulate the measures to be taken by public administration in general.
"I also do not believe that doing so would affect the independence of the regulatory system." She also recalled that, for example, for the planning of strategic policy areas such as the telecommunications sector, the national government is responsible for constitutional reasons, as this leads to state affairs.
The replacement of the analogue signal by digital is one of the most important changes that have occurred in the last few years around the world, and it works to make better use of the radio spectrum, a high quality of the signal and more channels.
The shift towards conversion, she thought, would be an increase in the use of digitalization, which is a decision in public interest which does not have only technical aspects, "because it covers economic, social, political and security technical aspects."
These matters, they stressed, "make trade throughout the system necessary, in accordance with the principle of economic governance by the State, they included a set of characteristics which placed the Constitution in the hands of the national government."
She recalled that many countries had already implemented the digital transformation around the world, although they had a high level of government.
It cannot be concluded that the government, by issuing the bill issued by the Congress, would intervene in the competences of the Congress, as they would be governed by the laws adopted by the legislation," she assured.
The possibility of selecting the list of votes in Michocán will be taken into account
According to PREP, the difference between the first and second places in the choice of the Governor is nearly 27 per cent, with 879 votes of total 6074 not yet counted.
The possibility of individual counting of the vote list is a reality in the election in Michocán this year, as according to the data published by the programmea de Resultsados Electoral Preliminates (PREP), the difference between the first and second places in the governorial elections is almost 27 per cent, with 879 votes of total 6074 not yet counted.
In this regard, the President of the Council General del Instituto Elektoral de Michocán (IEM), María de los Ángeles Landeral Zaragoza, recalled that on the last 9 November the election place had adopted a number of arrangements to harmonise local regulations with the reform of the United States in emergency matters.
It was recalled that neither his political constitution nor his election law nor his law on electoral reform had been adapted to the reforms adopted by the Congress so that they had not entered into force during this election. Governor Lionel Godoy Rangel refused to publish their publication in the State Indicator within the time limits set for it by the argument, or against it.
On 9 November, the Supreme Court of Mexico (SCJN) decided on the constitutional complaint filed by the local legislation and assessed the vote of the State official on the constitutional reforms as "unfair and illegal", since they did not have the right to "conform or impose a Veto against it".
María de los Ángeles Landeral stated in an interview on the possibility of individual counting of votes that, thanks to the adoption of the directives by the Council General del IEM, it was now possible for the local electoral authority to select the voting lists in part or in full.
The results of the Protocols may not be in accordance with the following conditions: the Protocol on the number of votes and the calculation of votes is not in fact before or is not in possession of the chairman of the voting committee or there are obvious errors or changes in the Protocols.
In addition, the total number of fully-fledged elections may be made if there is a difference between the mandatory winner and the second-place winner, which is equal to or less than one percentage, provided that an express application is made at the beginning of the meeting by the party or coalition president, who is the second of those candidates.
The voting calculation may also be carried out in its entirety if after the proper calculation it is established that the difference between the required winner and the candidate is equal or less than one percentage in the second place, provided that there is an express application by a representative of the party whose candidate has become second. In this case the selection packages which have been issued would be excluded.
It is worth noting that the elections in Morelia are in the same situation where according to PREP, the difference between the first and second places is almost 0.16 percent, although the votes of 129 of the total 923 have not been numbered yet.
His last wish
His ass will be spread across the Zapalinamé Mountains, confirming the family.
The rest of the pilot Felipe Bacio Cortés dreamed of this Sunday evening at Saltillo, his place of birth. On Monday, the death scene and a death event took place.
According to family members, the last will of the Colonel was that his ass would be spread over the Zapalinamé Mountains.
After a while, the family of Bacio Cortés returned to the capital city of Coahuila with the others in case of an accident to come back to life in an aircraft of the Mexican Air Force. The superior of the next person participated in the ceremony in Campo Marte.
About 12 o'clock a day, the boss's ass landed at the funeral hall, which is located at Boulevard Nazario Ortiz Garza, where family members and friends came.
At 5.30 p.m., his remains were examined at the Saltillo Institute of Technology. This body view was launched by his former fellow students from the technical assistance team and his American football team, which was attended by Felipe Bacio during his preparation.
"He wanted to return to Saltillo and that his ass would be spread over the Zapalinamé Mountains. He had always said so to his family and friends," said Sandra Bacio Cortés, the sister of the pilot.
From her point of view, the Colonel had fulfilled all his dreams and she is of the opinion that he had been in the fullness of his life. "He was a successful man, especially as a father and as a son, a loving brother and always stood by for his family."
Felipe Bacio Cortés left the place Saltillo very young to join Zapopán, Jalisco.
Some could not understand it because they thought it would even speed him up on a truck. However, he always tried to make his dream become a pilot.
His grandson Jorge Alberto Dávila Bacio has him as a good man in mind. "He was almost at Saltillo, and already wanted to welcome him as the occasion when he took Martha Sahacún to Saltillo."
The young man remembers that he had been traveling to Zapopán from seven years of age to graduation his family members. Therefore, he knows that his uncle died when he did what he liked most: flying a plane.
A Last Decision
The President of the Mexican Air Force, Felipe Bacio Cortés, was approved under the direction of Governor Jorge Torres López with all honor. His honor was granted to the people and the government, the Mexican army of the sixth military area, the Mexican Air Force, the school leader and students of the technical education agency of Saltillo, where he studied in 1985 and attended both the study and the sport.
Bacio Cortés died a few days ago when he was kidnapped by a rapist, in which State Secretary José Francisco Blake Mora and six other persons from the same authority were arrested.
At 18.05 p.m. the trapped remnants of Bacio Cortés, citizens of Saltillo, arrived at the scene of the cashier of the supply company to members of the Mexican Air Force, led by Major Jaime Martinez. There he was expected to be transferred by his family members, including his daughter Amanda and his wife Cristina, his mother, sister and other colleagues, students and teachers.
The remaining bodies were found on a ground floor at the Cadereyta NL
A few hours before the fund, military officers proposed the media to 11 persons arrested in the same area in connection with organized crime.
Three men were found killed by shots in different parts of the body and a charity committee in a left Finca in the village of Cadereyta Jiménez, Nuevo León.
The event took place at 1.5 kilometres from Cadereyta to Santiago on the height of El Castillo.
Several survivors saw that the door of the wall surrounded by a concrete wall stood out of the ground.
As they looked into the house, they found the bodies of three persons in the inside, which they immediately informed the competent authorities.
One took a yellow T-shirt and dark hoes without shoes; next to him was another who was dressed with a white top.
Just one meter away, the body of another person with red T-shirt and blue hair.
All three were on the roof.
According to the information received locally, the three persons had to be killed elsewhere because no patrols were found.
On the wall of the Landaus there are inscriptions that write an organised criminal gang to another and several collections were found in the wall and door.
11 Persons arrested in Cadereyta
The Secretariat de la Defensa National (State Defence Secretariat) presented 11 persons, including a minor, who were part of a crime that was mainly active in the area of Cadereyta and who were associated with abortions, murder, haliconeo (humanejagd) and domestic funerals.
According to the public information, eight persons were arrested on 11 November in the settlement of Los Alveros and a prisoner was released.
Three properties and a phone were secured. The arrested confirmed to be members of the criminal group "Los Zetas".
On 12 November at 06.00 a.m., soldiers found a PKW with two shots on their way to the Rancho Viejo village in Cadreyta.
During the inspection of the car, the military found a long weapon, a cargo equipment and 18 patrols.
Later, on 13 November at 4:00 a.m., one of its complexes was found in the municipality of La Frauda, which attempted to catch the flight in the presence of the military.
You will be admitted to the premises of General Terán, China and Cadereyta.
Education of the new Italian Government on Wednesday
The appointed Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet with the President of Italy tomorrow to present this new government, which is to offer the stars to the crisis that has led Italy to the end of the economic collapse.
The appointed Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet with the President of Italy tomorrow to present this new government, which is to offer the stars to the crisis that has led Italy to the end of the economic collapse.
A message from the Presidential Palace announced that Monti, appointed on Sunday, would meet with the president of the state, Giorgio Napolitano, on Wednesday to confirm government education.
It will be concluded that he will be presenting a majority of a cabinet composed of technocrats, although it is not yet clear when the new Prime Minister's office is represented.
Monti said he would present to the president the results of the talks with the political parties on government education.
"I want to confirm my absolute confidence in our country's ability to be completed with these difficult times," the former EU Commissioner told journalists.
Monti did not explicitly confirm government education, but his comments suggest that the obstacles are overcome.
The "frame is now well sealed," he added.
Monti has been able to form a government in less than three days, which is much less time than normal. Meanwhile, Italy is fighting a political and financial crisis that has driven the costs of debt to an unhindered level.
The new government led by former EU Commissioner Monti has to adopt a hard-temperature package required by the European politicians to recover the alleged trust in Italy.
The pressure on oil on Monti continued to increase through the changing market situation, resulting in the Italian government loans being charged with 7% interest for 10 years. This is in line with the situation in which Greece and Ireland were forced to apply for the European Savings Screen.
Emma Marmagagglia, President of the Italian Industrial Association Confindustria, shared the press after a meeting with Monti: "We said we would support this government by all means."
We believe that this government is the last chance to get Italy out of this emergency.
The opportunities for Montis' success were greatly increased by the support of the PDL party by Silvio Berlusconi, who had to return on Saturday following the crisis.
"We believe that Professor Monti's efforts are determined to produce good results," said Angelino Alfano, secretary of the Central Law Party.
The support of the PDL, the largest party in Italy, is essential because so far many of its members have spoken against a majority of the governments which are composed of technocrats.
Parliament's support
The new government of Monti needs strong parliamentary support for the implementation of the likely unfavourable savings measures.
Resistance to its efforts or the need for reforms could once again cause a growing financial market attack.
The Italian association of foreign banks exercises its claim that a failure of Montis was a disaster, as well as pressure.
Monti began his discussions with political parties, trade unions and entrepreneurs on Monday as well as with youth and women's organisations.
The task will be completed tomorrow at the end of this session.
Monti was appointed this Sunday by Napolitano, who in response to the crisis has put in place an extremely rapid government change.
After a short look at the end of the last week, when it was announced that Berlusconi would return, uncertainty over the success of the new Prime Minister reached the costs of the Italian government loans again at critical limits.
An Italian rescue with a state debt of EUR 1.8 billion would be too much for the current EU savings screen.
Monti said that his Government must continue to hold the next elections, which are expected to be held in 2013, despite the premise that the politicians will only give him time to implement the reforms instead of the elections.
Monti said he would like to include politicians in his cabinet, but the large parties are saying that this should only be made up of technicians, a reference to their concerns in view of the pressure on the financial markets.
Political sources point out that mutual misunderstandings and differences between parties make the involvement of people out of political life complex.
Spain has more game opportunities than the Ticos
Ten of the 22 players from Spain have over 50 international games on the Buckel.
From the pages of Costa Rica there is only one of the 22 listed 50 games behind.
A huge difference for Costa Rica when the 22 for the game of friendship, which takes place today at the San José National Stadium, is compared to each other.
While the World and European Masters, the number one at the FIFA's monthly ranking, can reflect on a considerable number of Class A election games, the three-coloured team only has the defense player Michael Umana as the only one with over 50 international games.
This number reached on the last Friday with the game against Panama (0-2) in Rommel Fernández.
The Spanish players who play in the Liga de las Estrellas (Starliga) and influential Clubs of the Premier League of England each year have the opportunity to participate in numerous home games (Liga and Cup Championships) as well as high-level European Cups such as the Champions League.
In addition, experience with the Spanish Fury comes with complicated decision-making games at the Eurocup and football championships.
The Tico footballers, however, have few international encounters within the Concacaf, which is on the FIFA ranking list.
We will see how the Spanish team draws its last register: The Iker Casillas Tower, which on the last Saturday against England (Netherlands 0-1 in London) reached a level similar to the former Andoni Zubizarreta tower.
Casillas will play against the three-coloured men today and Spain will play a new record of 127 foreign games.
Xavi Hernández, player of the Barcelona Football Club, has 106.
Casillas and Xavi even received recognition from the UEFA last week, along with others of the Iberian team who had reached the magic number 100: the cited Zubizarreta with 126 and the middle-sturmer of Schalke, Raúl González, with 102.
The number of hundreds also approaches Carles Puyol with 97 games.
Xabi Alonso followed him with 91, Fernando Torres with 90, David Villa and Sergio Ramos with 81, Andrés Ineista with 62, Csc Fábregas with 61 and David Silva with 53.
From the sides of the Ticos and close to Michael Umana are the left side towerer Junior Díaz with 48 games and Störmer Bryan Ruiz with 45.
From there only five to more than 30 games came: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis López with 35.
Those with the smallest games.
Less than 30 games show in the Spanish team Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), Álvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31).
On the side of the National Guard, Roy Miller comes to less than 30 games with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest doesn't even get close to the 20th border.
While Nacho Moreal has only four games and Jordi Alba two, recorded in Costa Rica Víctor Bolívar only one and Olman Vargas and Edder Nelson had not yet had her debut.
The historic tower of Spain is David Villa with 50 encounters followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
For Costa Rica, Bryan Ruiz shot with nine most towers, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
The Quintett performed Costa Rica in his tour to celebrate his 20-year-old existence
"To play in Costa Rica is a dream that is real"
In the exclusive conversation with Viva, bassist Jeff Amen of Pearl Jam says that the band is prepared to give one of its best concerts on the next Sunday at the National Stadium.
For more than 20 years they have been expected, but the band ensures that they have a dream when they play in Costa Rica.
The bassist and co-founder of the group, Jeff Amen, the last week of Brazil, provided an exclusive interview.
The band is located in the southern part of its tour to celebrate its twenty-year-old existence and on Sunday, 20th, they make their only stop in Central America.
On this day they will meet at the National Stadium at 19.30 a.m. with the band The X from Los Angeles and Las Robertas from Costa Rica.
They read an extract from the conversation to find its complete copy in the online edition of La Nación.
For your Costa Rican fans a dream happens when Pearl Jam plays in Costa Rica: Do you know what this means for your fans?
Playing in Costa Rica is a dream that is also real for us.
This is just the second time that we play in South and Central America, and so far it has been great.
I've just been on vacation in Costa Rica. It's such a beautiful country that we're going to stay there for a few days.
It's exciting for us to bring our music there.
I ask you this because the band's fans have been completely successful. They experience the days before the concert more intensively.
What do you guys like?
Thank you for all these years on our side.
We've spent almost 21 years until we arrived in Costa Rica. Thank you for waiting so long and it makes us sorry, it took so long until we got here.
Some people even think that your concert will be the biggest show of the year.
Isn't that a little pressure from your visit?
Some of the biggest shows we've held in the last 21 years took place in the last two weeks.
We have played a couple of rice shows in São Paulo and we hope that they have made us fit for this concert in Costa Rica.
Really, we've got fun to play there.
We love this country, we love surfing and are fascinated by the jungle. Costa Rica belongs to the best countries in the world.
How did you get to know Costa Rica and its waves for the surf?
Many of our friends are Surfer and I have a great friend who lives in Tamarindo where the waves are simply unpredictable.
My friends are always on their way to the surf to Costa Rica and Nicaragua. Together with Mexico are the excellent areas for the surf. In this way, we have learned about people who love the surf.
With a look at the tour, she has offered her rice shows with many songs.
What plans do you have for the event in Costa Rica?
Since we've never played there, we don't have any limits either.
We will try to give the best show with many different songs. We want to play some songs from each album and offer our fans a good and diverse repertoire.
You never repeat your repertoire.
Why?
I think that's part of it because we have nine plates and can play over 120 songs. Everyone likes another song, so the decision we're playing each one doesn't fit easily.
If we take two or three songs that we haven't played anymore into the repertoire, we can get our concentration better straight and they'll surprise us because they call us the reasons why we've missed these songs. Otherwise, they could get lost.
That makes the show more interesting for us and I believe, and that's why it's for the public.
With this tour you celebrate your 20-year-old history.
If you turn back, you will find it hard to believe in your success?
Yes, total.
For the first time, I believe that none of us have ever imagined playing in a big rock band, and that's over 20 years. It seems like a dream.
We also put on these blessings and find it great, even now we can make music together.
We like to play music and we love it.
We are lucky to be able to travel to the places of the world that we have always wanted to visit once and for all.
Things couldn't be better.
What did it mean for you to participate actively at the time of the harvest?
It has always been an honor to belong to this group of great bands.
We are good friends with the people of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It is surprising and quite unusual when a movement from a group of friends takes place.
Here and again a band from one city goes forward, but it is already unusual when five or ten groups come from the same city at the same time.
We are proud of it and feel honored to be part of the Seattle group.
Sometimes we're still playing together.
In the last year we were at a festival with Alice in Chains and Canada with Mudhoney and we see sound gardens on her tour. We are glad to be with them all and it is a pleasure to be part of this settle sound.
It is also very unusual that a band like you and the same musicians have stayed together for as long as possible.
Yes, four of us have been playing together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) has been standing with us 13 years ago. This is already much more time than many bands endure.
For the first time, I believe that we all appreciate our happiness, that we are still alive and that we care about each other.
We are all good friends, why we have opened up musical ways that give each individual the freedom to experiment.
One trusts the other and its music. We couldn't go any better.
Your relationship with peace is not always easy. On the other hand, you can always do what you want thanks to your success.
How do you find a balance?
The way we grew up has made it easier for us to find a balance.
We're sure not to be on tour too often because it's too easy to lose this game with huge masses of people who love your music.
As long as you think people are here because of music, you remember that you have to watch the music and what they have called into life, without forgetting to be a famous rockstar.
What memories do you have on your other project Mother Love Bone?
I think we wrote very good songs and at first it was great.
For three years we were a band that had never published a record until the death of Andy (Andrew Woods).
We were disappointed to have spent so long. We are still good with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore) who built the band with us. When I see a song or photos, I think of what an unfaithful man Andy was and how he brought me to laughter. It was always a pleasure to go to work together and to laugh about music and football and many other topics.
He was an extraordinary person and we missed him.
The Inland band Las Robertas is responsible for opening the show in Costa Rica.
Does it agree that you know their work, especially Eddie Vedder, and that is why the band has been looking for the opening?
Yes, the production sent us videos from several groups and this band liked us very much. That is why we are curious to see what Las Robertas can offer live. This is definitely exciting.
Why do you always change the text of Yellow Led Better when you play live?
That's a question for Eddie Vedder, I don't know.
He sings him, and I think he sings the first thing he likes.
Who have you been influenced by as a bassist?
From so many+
The first of these to me are Geezer Butler, John Enwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There are so many that I could talk all afternoon about the bassists that happened to me.
How has Pearl Jam managed to keep the ring alive, although it's no longer about fashioning?
I think we all don't feel very attached to the word Green.
If I think about it, I fall into the bands I mentioned earlier, such as Mudhoney, Sound Gardens, Nirvana and all the others who came up at the same time. If they are still important today, I find it great because it is worth listening to this music and bands like Mudhoney are doing better now than ever before.
At first her music was darker, now she's more positive.
Why?
That's interesting because I think there are some songs on the new album that might seem a little easy. But there are other songs like The End or Just Breathe that are included as very dark songs, although they also have some positive effects on themselves.
To both of them came the tears when I heard how Ed played.
I think if you're older and something traumatic is happening in your life - for example if you lose a family member or a friend - then your artistic creation and your music and these two songs are very touching for me.
But I am also the view that one can be a happy person and still make dark music.
Peru:
Fujimori returned to the hospital for medical examinations
The former President Alberto Fujimori was admitted to a public hospital on Tuesday to investigate the loss of his legs, informing his household.
The 72-year-old Fujimori, who has lived for 25 years because of human rights violations during his reign (1990-2000), has had several diseases, including lung cancer, which is operated four times and controlled.
Alejandro Aguyunaga, a congressman and his personal doctor, told the TV that Fujimori would spend three days in the Peruvian hospital Instituto National de Enfermedades Neoplásicas to determine the cause of his pain and muscle loss in the lower limbs.
Agouwaga commented that his opinion could be appealed to Fujimori for humanitarian reasons. However, he did not want this because he held him innocent.
He was operated four times on foot cancer and lost 18 kilos of weight. Other diseases such as severe erosive gastritis, a skeletal ulcer, kidney stones, blood pressure and bleeding problems in his legs were reported by the doctor.
Fujimori has since September 2007 in der Haftanstalt Directorate National de Operations Speciales de la Policía.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the murder of 25 people by the death squadron of the Peruvian army, which was secretive during his reign.
Mujica travels to Mexico to strengthen political relations
An official approach by Uruguayan President José Mujica and consisting of several ministers and entrepreneurs began their visit to Mexico on Tuesday to expand trade between the two countries and discuss the political issues of the region
Mujica will meet his Mexican official, Felipe Calderón, next Wednesday. This will be followed by a meeting with politicians, business people and a collective meeting with the Uruguayan people living in Mexico.
The discussion between the two Presidents in Guadalajara City "needs to exchange information on all policy areas between the two countries", the President of the South American country announced on his website.
According to local media, Mujica seeks the support of Calderón as regards the difference with France when French government chief Nicolas Sarkozy placed the South American country on a list of tax paradises at the G20 summit in Cannes, France.
In his speech Sarkozy threatened to exclude those countries that still appear as tax paradise from the international community. This statement was withdrawn from Uruguay and sent an application to his ambassador in the European country.
Mexico has been the President of the G20 since November, a group of the world's most powerful trade and industrial countries. Since January of this year there has been an agreement on the exchange of tax information to prevent the double settlement with the South American country.
In recent years, the Government of Uruguay has tried to speed up the ratification of agreements on the exchange of tax information to be drawn up from the "green list" of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and countries that have not introduced all international standards for cooperation in tax matters.
Since 2004, there has been a free trade agreement between Mexico and Uruguay which has contributed to a growing exchange of goods between the two countries.
The snowy installer is the third dimension of "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario has been fighting for 25 years for the salvation of Princess Peach from the clans of the evil bowser, but never in three dimensions: in "Super Mario 3D Land", he is fighting for the love of the girl in stereo technology.
The game, which comes this month on the world's loading signs, has been cut off from the start to the properties of the portable Nintende 3DS console, which can be played without a special three-dimensional mirror.
"Mario is the figure that has to say how the stereoscopy works without glasses," Omar Álvarez, who is responsible for the press specializing in Nintendo in Spain at the presentation of the video game in Madrid.
Álvarez explained that "Super Mario 3D Land" is "the first video game by Nintendo, originally developed for this console," because so far there have been success articles such as "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D" adaptations already exist.
The speaker of Nintendo stressed that, although it is three-dimensional, "Super Mario 3D Land" is a "frequency" video game that allows a quick, fluid game.
Álvarez confirmed that "Super Mario 3D Country" has two games in a single game: The first part is "light", to catch the less successful users.
Then experts on the different levels of game that become increasingly difficult can "turn around" a second round.
In addition, users can choose between a "aggressive D" or one that only affects the depth of the action. To overcome obstacles without being victimized by "optic effects", however, it must always be played three-dimensional.
This trip to the three-dimensional world also means the return of the figure to a portable console, which has not been the case since 2005.
With this video game, Nintendo wins the fans of Saga and repeats the success of the last edition: The speedy installer must overcome dangerous platforms to free Princess Peach.
However, the player supports news on movements, the environment, clothing and enemies - and a "playable" Luigi.
Column for the delivery of Portililos in the United States
The president of Guatemala, Álvaro Colom, announced this Tuesday that he would take part in the delivery of former Governor Alfonso Portillo so that they would be responsible in the United States for the money laundering of $70 million.
Thus the process ends with the US application for Portillo's delivery so that it can be brought before the court.
In a press conference confirmed that its decision was based on the independence of the judiciary and the government, taking into account that a decision-making court had already ordered the delivery.
He stressed that he had not been involved in court decisions during his government and had taken all the delivery requests from which he was informed.
In addition to Portillo, Sergio Ruano Marroquín is delivered for murder and serious physical injury, Edgar Estrada Morales and Victor Estrada Paredes, both for drug trafficking.
Coloms is a government act which is carried out when all judicial and constitutional courts have been created to condemn the former President of the State (2000-2004).
In accordance with the decisions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Guatemalan Constitutional Court, Portillo must be issued if his trial in Guatemala has been clarified and his human rights guaranteed.
Portillo was released for the 120 million Quetzales in the Ministry of Defence during his government time. This deal was before the delivery, but the Minister made opposition and led to a new case.
Trinijove has helped 6,000 young people who are threatened with social exclusion
The organization was called upon to prevent the marginalisation of young people without vocational training.
The first 25 years of social assistance organization Trinijove has led to significant results: in this fourth century, 6,000 young people were supported by social exclusion to find a way out of their difficult situation.
In addition, over a hundred jobs are created for this social group.
On the occasion of the anniversary, an event took place yesterday at the former work buildings of Fabra i Coats, where more than 300 people participated in the event.
Trinijove was called to help young people with low education, without work, with drug problems threatened by the risk of marginality in 1986.
At the recent festival in Sant Andreu, a number of officials from institutions and institutions participated in the association that worked together for the past 25 years.
The participation of political representatives in different directions to election times hampered the impartiality of work done by Trinijove.
In addition to the President of the Generalitat (Parliament of the autonomous Region of Catalonia), Artur Mas and his predecessor Jordi Pujol took part in the celebrations of former socialist Minister of Education Ernest Maragall and former Mayor and current left-wing town tract Richard Goma.
The large hall of Fabra i Coats is also visited by the current Catalan Minister for Social Affairs and Family, Joseph Lluís Cleries, and the director general of the social work of the Sparkasse La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa.
Mas stressed that Trinijove was called into life in very difficult times and that today's times are not less complicated. But he added that the work done so far "is a good foundation".
For the Presidents of the Generality, Trinijove is an example of a white fight against difficult circumstances and of people in difficulty.
"The economic crisis is for the unity and the work he does is nothing new," he said.
The house in which the rice parties were held has been expanded
The owners had 11 of the 13 apartments in the building on the street of Balmes No 51 (Barcelona).
The 12 household owners left the building yesterday afternoon without opposition.
All of this indicates that the alpines of the neighbors of House No. 51 found an end to the streets of Balmes.
Twelve people left the building this afternoon voluntarily, which they had been illegally occupied and in which they had organized huge parties that had moved the neighborhood to disintegrate.
After the space, the door was switched to avoid a similar situation.
"From now on, access will be controlled," the house manager confirmed.
The houseowners, who occupied 11 of the 13 apartments of the building - the rest of the population - took along the entire electrical plant and part of the water supply. They also took up the walls and left all kinds of müll, especially with alcoholic drinks.
In the three floors below, huge parties were celebrated which lasted up to two days and drove the tenants away.
In addition to the building there is a discotheque, Balmes 51, which also caused damage.
Her owner, Maria Pantinat, declared that her business would have returned to 80% since the start of the household.
The owner of the discotheque showed that the owners made their unsubstantiated competitions because they sold the drinks to three euros while they spent 10 euros in the discotheque.
In addition, the owner of the leisure place was shown by the neighbors because of the peace of mind, while their speech about the noise was not caused by the visitors of the disco, but by the owners and especially by the guests of the party that were organized there and who were more and longer following the statements of the oppressed neighbors in the last few weeks.
The discotheque officials stated that the damage had been so great that they agreed with the owner of the building that they would not have to pay any rent for the last nine months.
The Guardian Urbana (city police) also confirmed that they had received more complaints from their neighbors in the last few weeks.
The president of the PP (Partido Popular - People's Party) in Barcelona, Alberto Fernández Díaz, had requested that the building be immediately reopened and the problems of civil society as well as the arrival of the city quarter in the grip.
He explained that before the summer there was only one floor of the building, but that housekeepers in the last few months had been forced into all the floors of the building and almost all the apartments. In some it even came to dining rooms.
In this sense he added that "it is necessary to put an end to impunity and to act against the social actions in the building."
Last night another building was built in the city square of Nou Barris by the Catalan police.
At 15.30 p.m., the police approached Montral No. 35 after receiving a call from a neighbor who had noticed how four people wanted to move into the building.
The four were arrested without delay.
Park or mountain?
The architects are excluded from the dispute over the honorary with the exclamation.
The city statement on the 16 gates opens the debate on the significance of Collserola in Barcelona on New.
In the mid-80s, at the height of the lost Corporación Metropolitana de Barcelona (CMB), this administration published its letter of appreciation for the promotion of Colserola.
The brochure described the mountain as a huge park in Barcelona City.
He was even compared in numbers to the Central Park of New York.
With the passing of the CMB in 1987, the park was again at the top of Barcelona, since the capital of Catalonia is one of the few that are not scattered in the north-south direction, but up (mountain) and down (sea).
The establishment of Collserolas as a natural park plays with this idea.
As an example, the Central Park no longer served as a model, but Yellowstone with Wild Swine in the role of Yogibar.
So far, when the city was released in September, it was a giant release consisting of 16 competitions for further access to Colserola.
No doubt a tower refers to the concept of a park.
Either it's like someone's got to put doors on the ground.
The question is itself: Collserola, park or mountain?
The expression is not only from an organisational point of view but also in view of a reflection on the city, the subject of discussion in the mouth of all architects from Barcelona.
It is almost a recurring issue that can be brought back to the two members of this old box that will meet in the raise.
And that is exactly what this fact offers the substance for one of the rare agreements between what three architects from Barcelona think about and some university professors who have objected to the project.
Miguel Rollán, Daniel Modol and Martha Bayona: The invitation is appropriate.
For Rollán "it is necessary" after the attack on the coast on the "front on the mountain" until the talk by Ildefon's Cerda, which has not been delivered over the green apples.
"It should be clear from the principle that Barcelona is the largest park in the beach.
Among other things, because he's very accessible.
Collserola is complex," the architect explains, for which the title "Tore of Collserola" is a "lexical case" in itself: "It is not possible to imagine itself "as access to a park but as an integration of areas on which it must be treated."
Modol, like Rollán and Bayona with urban experience, considers the proposal as an "intellectual challenge", the "some dangers" in itself.
Risks resulting from the "insecure which brings the design of a public space today" following the experiences of the 1980s, which had their "dangerousness" in the forum.
The first concern is the self-esteem of what must be built.
"Something is always meant to determine the next step," i.e. to exceed it.
"You have to think about new urban planning instruments, because the current [relevant to the General Metropolitan Plan (PGM) ] can lead to a real disaster."
Modola, which is more concerned with the question, simply means the side of Collserola, which goes towards Vallesana, "can be understood as a park which is not in the direction of Barcelona", and for purely topographical reasons.
Modol recalls that there is already a study by the Patronat de Colserola, which should not be "on dry ears", although it is grateful to the city administration that it has given his Gremium the opportunity to work on this project "from the very first moment on".
He also notes that the approach of the mountain to the city of the ledger, which enables the architects to participate in the debate, although he is "in doubt" about whether this technical profile should lead to multidisciplinary teams called into life ("just the right", he says), "We architects should be just a tool."
Bayona points out that the answer to the question in the title of this article is complex, since the terms of reference lack a global view of Collserola: "There have been 16 competitions in the circle," he says, "on the Aegean Sea. But there are no long-term perspectives that the area is concerned with in its entirety."
This has at least led to his participation in the 16 competitions.
Otherwise, the program and the definition of a project for a tower would coincide with the architecture of the tower.
In its opinion, the city should ensure unconditionally that the columns are so equipped directly over the Ronda de Dalt throughout its entire length, which creates a smooth transition between the city and the green areas.
Casino leaves Jonas Larrazábal, who comes free
After 72 days, Sweeney's official of the Casino Red released the brother of the Mayor of Monterey from the process that is being conducted against him because of his forced repression.
After 72 days of detention, Manuel Jonas Larrazábal is released after being released from prison after being handed over by the Casino Red’s official before the second court of the district, which led the process against the mayor of Monterrey’s brother.
After listening to the Casino Royale, Sergio Gil García, the owner of the Casino Red, published a series of photos and videos on which Manuel Jonas is to be seen, which will probably force him to pay a sum of money so that the city administration will approve the secret operation of the Wetthouse.
After the trial, the State administration opened a criminal procedure against the brother of the Panist Mayor, who was arrested on 2 September for 30 days.
After four hours with the officer of the Ministry of Público 3 and Delos Patrimoniales, he was brought to Casa de Arriago 1 in the Barrio Antiguo of the capital.
There he remained 49 days after a second term of detention after the official of the Ministry of Público had refused the punishments for his occupation and organized crime.
On 19 October he was transferred to the port of Cadereyta because he must have saved the owner of the Casino Red with one and a half million pesos. However, he remained in the middle security tract for only a few hours, as he had to submit murder threats against him.
The authorities allowed him to participate in the court procedure as a witness to the city prison of San Nicolas de los Garza.
On 25 October, he was assigned by the Secretary of the Second Criminal Court of the District Court, Jorge Yánez, to a court of law, which stated that there was sufficient evidence after almost two months of investigations to justify Jonah’s payment of 1.5 million pesos to the representatives of the gamehouse in order to open it against it.
This month, the official of Casino Red, Víctor Aldo García Gómez, tried to release the judge José Luis Pecina, the brother of the Mayor, why he will be put on a free foot in the next hour.
During the hearing, Ramiro Arias, the official of the Ministry of Público, García Gómez, assigned to the court, asked whether these damages had been caused and what the owner of the building had said.
According to the 197/2011 case, Jonas Larrazábal is free to speak. No objections can be raised against the process, and no damage will be required.
After hearing the official of the vetthouse at 15.50 p.m., Larrazabal Bretón was set free without delay.
The court secretary, Jorge Yánez, went to San Nicolas de los Garza's city prison to inform Jonas that he had been released and his case would be recorded in the papers.
He also informed him of the judicial order for immediate release.
The Secretary Dionisio Pérez Jácome has details about the accident of aircraft, where government secretary Francisco Blake and seven other persons came to life.
The Secretariat of Communications y Transportes - SCT (Secretariat for Communication and Transport in Mexico) informed that the investigation results of the accident where government Secretary Francisco Blake Mora and seven other persons came back to life indicated that the helicopter was directly speaking to the ground with its entire undisclosed structure without the pilot being able to launch an emergency landing.
At a press conference, Dionisio Pérez Jácome, Secretary for Communication and Transport, said that the pilot had confirmed that the weather conditions were suitable for the flight.
"The fact that the propeller birds had contact with trees at 25 meters high, where the hopper lost the call seems to indicate that the helicopter had several underground contacts."
He also explained that the hopper was built for 19 inches, so he met all the conditions for the transport of the staff.
In addition, he said that during the studies in the area where the machine had come down, no bone fragments were found.
"In the search, no aircraft parts were found at other locations, which covered the entire structure.
The hopper was built for 19 inches, so he met all the conditions for personal transport.
The area shows a reduction of 7 to 30 degrees.
It is now preferable to obtain the results of the studies as soon as possible, but these several months may last a year, perhaps even a year.
On the other hand, Gilberto López Meyer, Director General of Aeroportos y Servicios Auxiliaryes (Secretariat for Aircraft and Aid Services in Mexico), assured that the Hubschraper of Etado Major Presidential flew at the speed of flight and that the aircraft had fallen into a weak state.
"This information reinforces the belief that it was at the time of the rise of normal flight operation."
At a press conference, the director of the SCT, Pérez Jácome, referred to six relevant points that should be taken into account during the investigation:
View speed:
In accordance with the flight regulations, it was a flight according to the rules of the flight. This means that the man had to have a proper view during the flight and on the ground.
Weather conditions:
The AICM listed appropriate weather conditions at the start. During the continued flight towards the border area between Mexico City and the state of Mexico, some deep-fashioned clouds emerged.
Selected stream size:
It is possible that the mansion had chosen a lower area with a better view towards the Cuernavaca valley because of the clouds.
Source location:
The source coordinates and the last radar recording of the hub switch agree. There may have been no loss of control over the aircraft or any deviation from the flight.
Extension of the remaining aircraft in a limited area:
The information available so far indicates that the hopper has been driven directly and indirectly.
The pattern of the scattered aircraft grids suggests that the hopper was hung on the ground with its undamaged structure.
No references to fire or explosion:
The rest of the aircraft offers no fire or explosion on the ground.
The last results of the investigation showed several ground contacts.
During the on-site investigations, aircraft parts were found at a height of 9200 feet above sea level. The area is arbitrary and shows a reduction of seven to thirty degrees.
The photos show the sequence in which the hopper is likely to go to the bridge.
Some information suggests that the hopper may have several ground contact points.
After a minimal search in an area beyond the closed area of the crash, no classified aircraft could be found, which reinforces the acceptance that the unsecured aircraft structure was spoken against the ground.
MSS announces a research protocol to find the gene for pregnancy
It is a social insurance company in Mexico that is leading a research project to find the gene for pregnancy in children and young people supported by IPN specialists.
The Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social - IMSS (Social Insurance Institution of Mexico) announced that it is a research project leading to the discovery of the gene for pregnancy in children and adolescents under the title "Genetics of pregnancy in childhood and youth", which should be found in relation to overweight genetic markers.
Miguel Cruz López, Head of Unidad de Investigación Médica en Biokémica (Division for Medical Research, Biochemistry) at the clinic Hospital de Specialities del Centro Médico Nécional Siglo XXI stated that an interdisciplinary team consisting of doctors, nurses, nutrition specialists and social workers was established.
This team is supported by specialist and postgraduate students at Instituto National de Salud Pública (INSP) and at the Centro de Investigación y de Estudios Avanzados (Cinvestav) del Instituto Politécnico National (IPN).
The population is invited to participate in the study. Interestors can come to the IMSS sports sites in the valley of Mexico, where tests are conducted every Saturday at 8:00 p.m. with children and young people.
He stressed that the investigation at the Cuauttémoc sports site (in the west of the state of Mexico) and continued on 8 October at the sport site of Nezahualcóyolt (in the east of the state of Mexico).
If the target of 500 to 600 researchers is achieved, the study will continue at the sports site of Independencia (South of the capital district) and will be completed at Morelos (north of the capital district).
He stated that the aim of the study was to identify factors and the role of genetics in the development of obesity and the identification of risk factors for Mexican children and adolescents to prevent chronic degenerative diseases.
Despite the global date of diabetes, he stated that it would be expected that thirty-one thousand children and adolescents aged from six to 14 years should fill in the understanding and under the supervision of their parents about nutrition.
They will also be asked questions about their physical activity and their family history of illness to control risk factors that may cause diabetes or renal failure.
He further indicated that during the said days the subjects (weight, size, count of the count of the population), their blood pressure would be measured and blood levels such as glucose levels, triglyceride, cholesterol, insulin and genetic factors (test of the identification of genes in relation to pregnancy in children) would be determined.
Cruz López stressed that this study would be carried out due to the health care of health personnel over the alarming weight loss of young people.
"The health questions from the years 1999 and 2006 revealed that in almost six years the proportion of boys with disabilities has increased by 77% and of girls with disabilities by 47%. Overweight was also dramatic," the IMS Specialist stressed.
He pointed out that the search for genetic markers was justified because the genetic history of the Mexican population differs from that of other peoples.
He noted that a (e) Mexican (in) average of 65 per cent of Indian-Americans, 30 per cent of Europeans and 5 per cent of African descent, which is reflected in genes related to diabetes and obesity.
In general, he stated that the genetics of fatty acids are forced into the inability to burn the excess of energy taken from us (Caloles) so that it will be absorbed in fat.
The researcher explained that the direct benefits of the survey participants were in a comprehensive study of the children, which would determine whether they demonstrated a degree of overweight or obesity.
It would even examine the occurrence of dark skin rashes in the neck and intestine (Acanthosis), which would indicate the likelihood of metabolic disorders and diabetes in the presateum.
All information would be treated confidentially and informed by the doctors in writing. The doctors will inform the parents of all the results of the measurements and suggest changes in the life-style that are appropriate for the prevention of diseases.
Cruz López explained that there are three main factors that are responsible for overweight, obesity and other chronic diseases: lack of movement, which is a lack of movement every day, most of the time of the day before the TV and use means of transport, instead of taking short steps to walk.
The high calorie intake, i.e. increased consumption of sugar-free drinks and carbohydrates (Tamales, bread, pizza, hamburger, etc.), together with high fat and protein intake as well as the genetics to be analysed in this research project.
Asphalt from UNAM Prevented Victims
Rafael Herrera, a researcher at the University of Chemistry at the University of Mexico at UNAM, develops modified asphalt with polymers to make the mixture more resistant to weather conditions and temperature changes
It would not have been necessary to repair almost 200,000 casualties if the rain time in the Metropolitana del Valle de Mexico (Mexico Valley Valley) zone (city area of the Gulf of Mexico), said Rafael Herrera Nájera, a researcher at the University of Chemistry (FQ) at UNAM, warned and assured that if the outbreak and maintenance of the asphalt plague occurred, the number of casualties would be significantly reduced or even avoided.
In his speech "Scatters from a technical point of view", which he held for the International Year of Chemicals, he announced that the laboratory responsible for which he was responsible developed with polymer modified asphalts to produce a mixture similar to the asphalt which shows greater mechanical resistance at both high and low temperatures.
Mr Nájera believed that this type of modified asphalt in areas with extremely hot climate, such as in some cities in the north of the country, should be used to improve the behaviour of the street area and to avoid the presence of casualties.
He stated that the asphalt - the hardest part of the soil oil - is a carbon-water combination, part of which has a high molecular weight - the asphaltes - and the other part is a low - the so-called malthenes. Together they give the road floor its characteristic physical behaviour.
The mathematical behaviour of the asphalt means that this is compared to a liquid at a high temperature of almost 180°C, at 120°C it is very complex and almost fixed at 50°C while it is used at very low temperatures.
"This means that the resistance of the asphalt on the streets is not equal, but changes on a day depending on the weather conditions and temperature changes," the chemist said.
The researcher of the FQ noted that the streets of Mexico City had mostly a flexible road cover consisting of six material stories, of which the last three sections contained.
Between the upper layers is a layer of asphalt, which consists of small asphalt bathed in asphalt and then fortified stones.
Any individual stones of this collapse history, be bathed in Asphalt.
If vehicles continue to be driven and forces are created, this shield enables a good distribution of forces in the road floor.
"If it were a modified asphalt, the forces would be even better distributed," said the chemist.
"Over the cross story," he said, "a last sheet will be set up, which is so called a trajectory consisting of changed stones, i.e. sand that was also bathed in Asphath.
Since these ships are in contact with the vehicles, they need a greater mechanical force than the crash history and they need to be driven.
In addition to receiving and disseminating most of the strengths of this road, it is necessary to maintain an appropriate thickness and the material from which it is composed.
The weather conditions, in particular humidity and temperature fluctuations, are further important factors to take into account, above all the water", he said, "because it significantly affects the behavior of the landscape.
When the ground is wet, water enters into the layer and becomes difficult again. This causes a rise in all layers of the street area and thus the presence of fractures.
When a stroke occurs," he said, "the cover story will be taken out first, while the crash story will be affected only then. But the damage does not occur immediately, but it is a process that needs to be maintained by appropriate maintenance programs at the first signs."
The member of the National de Investigadores (National Research System Mexico) said that the vehicle gas is another important reason for the presence of casualties. Therefore, the thickness of each deck of the road deck must always be in relation to the vehicle fleet and it must be ensured that this system is kept in place to prevent frequent casualties.
Rafael Herrera pointed out that there are still many research work to be done, for example about asphalt emulsion that is already on the market in other countries, with which the victims simply and without applying high temperatures are being repaired.
What was missing from the candidate del Valle to be the new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of the factors that affected melina Ramírez Serna did not get the crown of Miss Colombia.
El Valle gets his 14th Missile.
Once again, Valle del Cauca left empty at the dedication of the crown for Miss Colombia.
This time Melina Ramírez Serna had to be satisfied to stand at the winning podium to look at a silver crown and the band that appeared to her as a new Miss Colombia.
With the result of this night in Cartagena, where Miss Atlantic took the crown and the zeder, the department is already on 14 missiles and Melina belongs to the legion of women from Valle del Cauca, who had almost held the crown in their hands. These include: Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Dominguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Rosa Mary Álvarez (1981), Olga María Arenas (1987), Leila Blance (1988), Monica Evers (1989), María Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Gille Garphanie (2000), Catalina Giraldo (2007) (Gerère), Catalina
The big question that many are asking today is: What is missing?
Because the result is the decline of a great favourite that has shown at any stage that she had everything to be the new Miss Colombia. Not only was she chosen to be the King of the Police and Major Rostro Jolie by Vogue, titles that also received the beautiful Queens of Taliana Vargas and Natalie Navarro, who took the crown of the Miss Colombia home.
The first factor that is crucial to the decision of the jury to refer her to the First Miss is that she had not convinced her answer to the question "What book has influenced you most and why?" which was put by Martín Murillo Gómez by the Carreta Literaria Leamos.
The young woman from Valle del Cauca added to the questionnaire:
"I read a lot, I believe quite much in literature, I think it's a kind of civilisation, and finally I think that the book that was most beautiful for my childhood, 'The Little Prince', is a very deep book.
At the moment I read 'School and Sühne'. It is a book of universal culture that we should all read. I just read a book by Irene Nimirovski, a Russian, a wonderful book called 'Leidenschaften'.
One answer that stood on a small face, first because of the concept 'civilize' and secondly because she had not specifically explained how each of her books mentioned it had influenced her.
But after the ceremony ended, Melina explained that she felt calm and happy with the result: "The universe is a way of doing what must happen.
And for all people: Read a little 'The Little Prince'. It's a great book.
Among other things, it is said that the love of El Valle is burned.
A journalist from Bogota pointed out that the fact that she was the preferred one who was the most intimate of all the events and who had received all the prices in advance (Gastronomy Competition Oster, public opinion on the best handcuted costume and Reina Madre), "the other candidates had made themselves self-evident, which was why the Queen could not shine on the stage."
And this was noted at her first show in the bath at the beach of the Hilton Hotel and at her two rise at the funeral.
Although she was safe with both of them, she lacked the strength and courage that the representatives of Magdalena and Atlántico were looking at.
Ariel Osorio, a journalist of the program "Como en casa" at the RCN channel, said that the fact that Melina was crowned for the mission "shows that the candidate who won most of the prizes during the competition will not finally be queen".
In addition, Valle went to the conclusion of the press from the road - an error.
Another hypothesis is that Valle could not convince the jury of her interest in social work, which is ultimately the essence of the national beauty competition.
It will already have reason to say that two days before the international jury, Lucy Dughty, they were looking for a woman who was committed to the social affairs of her country.
"Beautifulness alone is not enough for a Miss Colombia. You have to look at the body and focus on the social feeling that she had already worked with projects before taking part in the competition," she said.
It is also speculated that Valle had sinned with her defects of the herders and fibrosis that you noticed in the opposite direction. But this is contradictory because the jury chose her as a candidate for 'natural beauty' with a healthy body, good nutrition habits and responsible physical work.
The coach of the kings, Jorge Hernán Orozco, says that Melina didn't have the best body to give it better, "but her problem with the fibrosis on the stomach, which was almost to be noticed for me honestly, stressed her score on the last day."
In the meantime, journalist Guido Hoyos from Cromos magazine saw the mistake of the woman from Valle del Cauca being the surgical inputs she had been under.
"The operations are also, but Valle didn't know how to make them right.
Her body has never been her strong side, and this place had to pay her."
Because of this price, which was awarded for the first time by the national beauty competition, after the event in the bathroom apparition, there was a wonderful prospect that should be true at night. It was exchanged that Raymondo Melina had given a trusted price to not let her come into the benefits of the crown.
Whether it agrees or not is the fact that Melina has since her reign, although not as a queen, but as a princess, a position that allows you to appoint the national beauty competition Colombia in one of the international competitions.
However, she will enter the history as one of the kings who, despite her overwhelming event for Cartagena, had left the crown.
So was the work of the doctor who identified the body of Alfonso Cano
A lophoscopist from Cali went into history as the man who identified "Alfonso Cano".
The work of these officials plays a key role.
On November 4th, a Lophoscopist of the State Intelligence Unit (CTI) from Cali was the man who confirmed the identity of the leader of the FARC (Fuerzas Armadas Revolutionarias de Colombia - Revolutionary War Forces) by comparing the fingerprints.
Of the seven Lophoscopists in the CTI department, this week, Eliazar González had worked with a man from Puerto Tejada who had been involved in criminal proceedings for 21 years.
At the beginning of his career, González worked in congregations of Chocó, where he often had to work in the jungle for five days to reach the place where the bodies he was supposed to identify.
In 2000, he moved over and after completing the required course, specializing in lophocopy, which is the examination of the skin that has been exposed to strains, i.e. hand and foot surfaces.
In the week of application against the so-called Alfonso Cano, Eliazar was instructed to pack clothing for at least three days.
Something big was waiting for him.
On Friday night he flew from Palmira to Cauca in the Hubschruber.
He knew that he should identify two bodies and that the suspicion was that one of the men who had led the oldest warrilla in the world could be. Therefore, he should include the fingerprint page of Guillermo León Sáenz (his real name).
However, when he reached the place where the body was located, he could not identify him because of his physical appearance, as this did not at least resemble the images he had seen in the mass media.
He had no bart, was like a farmer in the area, didn't wear glasses and was very thin.
But fingerprints don't lie.
Armed with a lupe, ink, a plant core and a bag lamp, Eliazar compares the fingerprints of the body to those on the printed sheet.
He'd seen it right: it was "Alfonso Cano".
That same night this man from Puerto Tejada was responsible for informing defence minister Juan Carlos Pinzón that it was actually the leader of the FARC.
On track
For a Daktyloscopian of Sijín in Cali, the statement made by President Juan Manuel Santos Eliazar González at a press conference on the use of "Cano" was very important.
Many people don't know our work.
Daktyloscopy is an exact science without errors that can be a key self-acting factor when solving a penalty.
Lophoscopists not only identify bodies, they also support investigations into murder and robbery and confirm the identity of the arrested persons.
When they are arrested, many criminal officials present false documents or they have no one.
We take off the fingerprints and search them in the database.
The researcher told us that at a table he had to walk a piece of wall out of a house, because the thief had just stood up at this place with his hand when he pulled out a piece of gold and money.
"The walls are difficult because their surfaces are inadequate for the removal of fingerprints. But in this case we were able to get the print out of the whole hand and identify the offender who had participated in several trials," he recalled.
With fingerprints, suspects can also be charged or charged.
A toner was recently found around a bottle of snowflakes.
The investigation suggested that a family member could be suspicious, and actually agreed to a fingerprint on the bottle.
Although this does not guarantee that it is about the killer, it will be associated with the place where the offence was committed.
A Dactyloscopist of the CTI stated that "the fingerprints with chemical or physical reagents would be taken from the object."
If they appear, a plant source or band will be used for adoption.
Then the prints are sent to Asif, which is the criminal database, or person.
"The problem is that there are still many Colombians without papers," the CTI expert said.
He didn't mean everything like it was shown in the SCI TV series.
Just as not all gold is what shines, not everything you pick up is a fingerprint.
However, it can be used if an appropriate comparison is performed.
The "imports" demand the authorities out of New York
Hundreds of demonstrators were forced together in cells on the Zuccotti square.
A large part of the room command came and changed its location to a nearby park.
The members of the Ocupy Wall Street movement requested the New York authorities to issue this service on this day when they re-examined with a legal order to attend the Manhattan Square after they had been removed from the area in the morning and tried to own another place at Big Apple.
Hundreds of demonstrants forced themselves before the Zuccotti Square, where they had a legal order that allowed the "importers" to enter the new cells at this place. Meanwhile, another part of the movement was held at the command of the room and occupied a park north of the city, where it came to nine arrests.
"Our idea is that if the court does not allow us to camp on the spot, we will meet elsewhere and continue the fight with legal means to return to Zuccotti, with sit-ins and peaceful demonstrations," said Mark Bray, one of the speakers of the movement "Ocupy Wall Street".
Brey pointed out that the answer of the "importers" to the room of her cell camp, which was directed directly by Michael Bloomberg, the mayor of New York, came before the court, where Justice Lucy Billings issued an order banning the violent space of the place and the demonstrators approved the cell.
In addition, the "imports" have a new park which is located at the intersection of the central Canal Street and the Sixth Avenue near the entrance to the Dutch tunnel, which connects New York and New Jersey, and is owned by the Trinity Church.
They could have owned the place for at least an hour. But then the police came in and arrested some of the demonstrators, although Bray could not give any accurate numbers. He assured the news agency Efe that he had seen several journalists with handcuffs.
The organization ensures that hundreds of people have been found in this place, where religious leaders have also been arrested as evidence of their support for the movement and to the police.
In the meantime, the Zuccotti Square (a country in private property) is closed pending a hearing which is still under way for this service day and which will analyse the legality of the area in the morning.
Some of the demonstrators at the site took photographs of this judicial order and distributed it. They even gave some police officers who were watching the site what "some small coincidences" had resulted in, as Bray reported, some police officers had killed demonstrators.
The judicial order prohibits the authorities to remove members of the Occupy Wall Street from the place and the application of "the laws which were adopted after the occupation and to prevent demonstrators from returning to the park with their cells and other things they had previously used."
Mayor Bloomberg makes it clear to the press that because of this legal arrangement, the reopening of the place for public transport and demonstrators was resumed. The demonstrators showed that the city laws did not allow them to re-establish themselves with cells and sleeping bags.
The Mayor personally defended the area of the Zuccotti Square in the morning, where almost 200 people were arrested, and decided that because the demonstrators "were opposed to the law."
Bloomberg stated that he had given the arrangement for space because it had "turned to a place where people didn't come to demonstration but to break the laws and in some cases to add other people's damage", because "some businesses had received threats" and the residents had "their quality of life".
"The room in the morning was empty and showed that Bloomberg was interested in the protection of the financial interests and not in the protection of the interests of North American workers," added the speaker of the movement, who accused the Mayor of "not respecting the freedom of the press".
The officials of the "Occupy Wall Street" reported that they had been monitoring "great actions" for Thursday, and, although together with community organizations and cooperatives, to think of the two months that the protests have been going on since 17 September.
Pamela Anderson is the young woman Maria at the TV show.
Together with Michael Bublé and other Canadian celebrities, they will take part in the television program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" on 1 December.
The Canadian Pamela Anderson was Tim Allen's assistant in "Home Improvement", the rescue room in "Baywatch", Kaninchen at "Playboy", the woman of rock music Tommy Lee, and now the actor and model at a Canadian Christmas television broadcast will be the young woman Maria.
The private TV channel CTV announced today that Anderson, together with the "crooner" (Balladen singer) Michael Bublé and other Canadian celebrities, will appear on 1 December in the TV program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" and will be hosted by a very special young woman Maria Liven.
CTV today spread images of the television program, in the Anderson - also for the distribution on the Internet of a personal porno, in which she, together with her former husband, appears to be the victim of "Mötley Crüe", Tommy Lee, as a young woman Mary with a doll in the drawer that is supposed to represent Jesus.
In the scene, Peters, a well-known Canadian comemiker of Indian origin, recently worked as a moderator at the "My Violet Torpedo of Truth" mission of Charlie Sheen, as a Jesuit.
The CTV Christmas program is not only based on Anderson and Peters, but also on the Canadian singer Bublé, who married the Argentine model Luisana Lopilato at the end of March in Buenos Aires and who is not far from this controversy.
Bublé recently named North American Kim Kardashian "Hour" at a concert in New York.
Japan will be reborn after the earthquake
The GDP grows by 1.5% thanks to domestic consumption and ends the spiral of the free case from the beginning of March
Since last March, the Japanese economy has been paralyzed, which is still in the generation after the devastating earthquake that swept through a nuclear crisis, and the worst disaster that Japan has experienced in World War II.
The government's first estimates in Tokyo assessed the damages of $300,000, a blow that seemed to slow down despite the severe economic crisis.
After three quarters, the data on the gross domestic product from July to September finally concluded this chapter: the GDP grew by 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and by 6% to the quota calculated on the year.
The second quarter measured value - in Japan begins the business year in March 2012 - also means the fastest growth since the period from January to March 2010.
The resurgence can be partly explained by the sale of machinery for the reconstruction of the areas affected by the earthquake and the next tsunami.
In fact, the companies increased their investments by 1.1% compared to the decrease of 0.9% for capital facilities recorded from January to March, the first return after six months of outstanding increases.
Nevertheless, the real transformation of the Japanese economy is not based solely on keinsian tensions that use the crisis to build or build infrastructure.
Growth is particularly due to Japan's development of domestic consumption, which currently accounts for 60% of Japan's GDP.
This variable increased by 1%, despite growing expenditure on vehicles, travel and leisure activities.
The Stigma of Yen
Tokyo has relied on the domestic market after the Yen - the Japanese currency - in one of the "insurance guarantees" of investors fleeing from the eurozone debt crisis and the false forecasts for the U.S.A., a privilege that is like a gravestone on the accounts of the exporting companies.
With a stronger currency, products abroad are expensive, a serious problem for a country whose economy is based on the health of major technological producers.
For example, Toyota and Sony returned their weak business results from July to September.
While markets continue to oppress the peripheral EU countries, Yoshihiko Noda's government continues to grow.
"You need to be aware of the risks facing you, for example the deterioration of some foreign economies, the effects of overcrowding in Thailand and the rapid increase in Yen," said the Secretary of State for Economic Policy Motohisa Furukawa yesterday.
The prospects are not really very encouraging.
The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) stated that in September most Member States had shown clearer signs of slowing down economic development.
The indicator, which presupposes the turning point of the world economy, showed that brakes would be taken at the largest economic potential.
Because he fell from four tenths to 100.4 points in comparison with 100.8 in August.
The euro area is even below this average value, which is at 100, after falling by 8 tenths to 99.13 points.
Athens is allowed to raise doubts again
Papadimos says the savings would be approved, but the conservatives will not sign a written agreement
With the high risk premiums of peripheral countries and widespread insecurity, Greece continues to be affected by the labyrinth that comes out of the great European debt crisis.
The impression that the "consens" of the new Greek transitional government is rather a response to the pressure from Brussels than a real conviction of political forces is slowed down by facts.
During the new Prime Minister, Lucas Papadimos, last night, pointed out that there were no alternatives to structural reforms and that the hundreds of days due to his appointment were likely to be too short for their implementation, the leader of the conservative party Nueva Democracia, Antonis Samaras, assured him that he would support the new sponsorships and that he would not, in any event, withdraw his request for new elections on the proposed date of 19 February.
"The most important task of this government is the implementation of the decisions taken on the summit of 26 October," Papadimos assured yesterday that a parliamentary debate will be opened with the vote of confidence for the new government.
A package with 24 employment promotion programmes, reform of the law of discipline for officials and new measures against tax evasion are the first initiatives.
Nevertheless, Samara's communication does not raise doubts about his attitude: "We have committed ourselves to supporting the transition government, but nothing else."
The conservative leader went too far with his challenge of the EU and the IWF, the organisation that needs to close the 8,000 million people in Athens urgently. He made it clear that he would not be able to make a commitment statement on the implementation of the savings measures.
But the European Commission, which is still upset by the effects of the poker game with Papandreu Referendum, confirmed yesterday that it would not be expected to meet its demand: economic aid would not be signed if the new government and the leaders of the most important Greek parties "a clear written agreement would not be signed as soon as possible".
The Ministry of Economic Affairs, Amadeu Altafaj, said that the inspectors of Troika "very soon" returned to Athens to discuss with the new government "what is necessary for the payment of the sixth section" of EUR 8000 million" although there is no final date yet.
The Greek knot still has a lot of feet.
King Sofia: "These are instruments for progress and hope"
The King stressed the "principal" position of Spain with regard to this type of financing
Spain "has reached a leading position in the role of small funding worldwide".
King Sofia of Spain recalled yesterday that in the last two decades, Spain has developed as the second contributor to this instrument for international cooperation in the world. Its "We know" refers to a "A tool for social progress, justice and the hope for a better future for all mankind on the basis of trust in men".
The Queen extended the fifth World Summit on Small Credits in Valladolid yesterday. She was convinced that it was "no doubt" that this kind of business would be "absolutely impossible" in order to achieve the annual dividends covered by the United Nations by 2015 and "in particular the goal of living with income from less than a dollar per day, so under the "poor limit".
Spain "continues to work" on the expansion of the benefit network "to the last corner of the world and leads this task responsible," noted Queen Sofia, who hopes that the initiatives and contributions that will continue from the summit that will last until Thursday will be "the creation of new capacities and better opportunities for the disabled and especially for women" are guaranteed as the main beneficiaries of this loan.
"We have recorded many successes" and "there are many challenges."
The summit on small credit is not only a forum for debate, but also a platform for "two fundamental objectives".
The Queen stated that it would be expected that by the end of 2015, 175 million poor families should have access to these financial services and that ten million of these households would exceed their poverty limits.
The concept of small credits goes back in Spain and the rest of the world to the "road initiated years ago" by Muhammad Yunus, which King Sofia considers to be an "Act of Justice and Recognition".
The father of this funding instrument described it as "a wonderful idealist who has written himself against poverty" and whose work she has known for 15 years when the Queen traveled to Bangladesh to learn about the loan strategy.
A year later, the first World Summit in Washington and other meetings at the Elfenbeins in 1999 and Canada in 2006. In all, "we can observe a continuous further development", the Queen, whose commitment to this project was expressed yesterday as "family head" in Valladolid and as "the speaker of the poor".
Finally, King Sofia ended its talks by animating the participants to participate in the debate and to seek solutions to the fight against poverty.
"Ethical Order"
Spanish Foreign Minister Trinidad Jiménez pointed out that solidarity is "a ethical offer" for the whole democratic state.
In this sense, she stressed that it was an error to bind development aid at times of economic trees because it was a "long-term commitment".
Jiménez was of the opinion that small credits were "the first and most rigorous policy to eradicate poverty", and that the governments of the industrial states were now "more than ever" to work on solid criteria, and should not allow the solidarity of the crisis to fall short.
For Spain, small credits are one of the "most important forms of development aid".
The Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodríguez, accused "the success", "marginized" people, "the always before closed doors" "hope" and the mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier León de la Riva, welcomed the people in a city who opened "their doors, affected by the spirit of solidarity".
The CDU proposes to select EU Presidents on the basis of a general vote
The first day of the Congress of Christian Democrats (CDU on Monday, 14 November in Leipzig) died for Angela Merkel, Chancellor and president of the Christian-Democratic Party, without real difficulties.
Europe's future was not originally foreseen in the programme, but it was in the autumn, in particular in order to provide enough for those activists who consider the government's policy to be too late today and perhaps Italy's tomorrow.
The presidential request proposed by the Bureau of the European Commission was almost unanimously adopted.
Of the 1001 delegates, only nine had voted against, ten had included the vote.
The several minutes of standing ovation, which was first due to their intervention leave, as well as a few hours later, Wolfgang Schäuble, did not open any doubt since the three European-led finance ministers.
The main decade of the Chancellor - as well as the application - is the following slogan: the answer to the crisis calls "not less, but more Europe".
Not only because Europe means peace, but also because 'nine million jobs are directly dependent on the euro'.
For the Chancellor, "the time for a break in Europe has come."
This could be expressed by a change in the Lisbon Treaty with regard to the eurozone budget policy; however, this could be made available to the Presidents of the European Commission on the basis of a general vote".
This is, however, one of the proposals adopted by the Congress, which were clearly part of Wolfgang Schäuble Pate.
Of course it is not likely that the 47 will soon join this revolution: Great Britain is facing the issue, and the leaders of the CDU believe that Nicolas Sarkozy is the same opinion.
However, the milestone is located.
In addition, delegates in an overwhelming majority rejected the proposal for the weight of each country in the ECB's delegation according to the weight of the individual economies, which was apparently a strengthening of Germany's position.
Therefore, the chancellor, who looked at the climate improvement within her party, has strengthened the points of reference to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl. However, she has no longer tried to win her congress at the cost of the "small" or the European countries in difficulty which would without delay criticise the proud Germany.
As far as the European application of the importance of "German-French friendship" is concerned, Angela Merkel France does not call on the plan.
At least not directly.
Because this reminds us that Leipzig was in the middle of a bloody battle two hundred years ago.
In fact, one of the highest substations of the Napoleonic army.
What is represented by the error in the patient's reports?
According to family assistance, UMP and government are now taking the disease messages into action.
Nicolas Sarkozy will meet in Bordeaux on Tuesday, 15 November to look for family assistance and talk about what has been happening since 2007 - the subject of the fight against social fraud and economic dependence from the state.
In order to accompany this attack, which is aimed at undermining the economy in a hard test, but on the other hand, not less than a ban on an axis of the right Presidency campaign, the majority would like to focus on job alerts.
Firstly with budgetary objectives: the Government intends to introduce a fourth day of career before taking into account a report of illness in the private sector.
In good German this means that a sicker worker would lose his salary for four days without the approval of the specific company, thus at least 15% of his monthly income.
A survey which, according to the daily newspaper "Les Echos" of Zorn, would help to bring into line EUR 280 million.
And those who were more symbolic with another mavnogram went on: the state officials were to enter an unpaid career day in the case of sickness (as long as there is for them, in contrast to the three career days in the private sector, there are no career deadlines).
While these issues are being discussed, most of them also re-examine the subject of fraud, which is this time due to the abuse of labour.
"Controls will be significantly more important, and in addition they will be reimbursed if this is required," warned Xavier Betrand on Sunday, 13 November before the microphone of the transmitter RTL.
As in other cases, the effects of this notification on the reality of fraudulent actions in the field of disease reports seem to be somewhat disproportionate.
This has already been the subject of permanent observation since 2002 as well as political offensives which have borne the most common fruits.
The French are no longer more sick than people in other parts of Europe.
First, however, we reject the national figures.
According to the CNAM case, more than EUR 237 million was paid in 2006.
As a result of the Economic Research and Documentation Institute of Health, the daily expenditure in 2008 was EUR 11.3 billion, 5% of health expenditure.
This amount includes 46% of maternity leave and job accidents and 54% of sickness leave, which is EUR 6.2 billion.
And then 2.5% health expenditure.
In 2010, compared to the 17.8 days in 2009, a study by the Alma Consulting Group was conducted on average only 14.5 sick days.
An average of some differences: another, published in 2007 by Monster.com, a career planning website, showed that 75% of the 40 000 questioned French workers had not taken any single day of illness.
Another study, which was conducted this time by the disease insurance, shows that 37% of the disease reports in 2010 were shorter than 8 days; 22% between 8 and 14 days, 15% between 15 days and one month, 15% between one and three months and 11% over.
In comparison with their European neighbours, therefore, French workers no longer tend to be able to work.
A long-term study conducted by two researchers at the French State Research Centre (CNRS) in 2010 showed that the overall rate of absence (based on disease or otherwise) increased between 1994 and 2001 and that in France, between 10% and 11% compared to 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the United Kingdom or 16% and 18% in the Netherlands.
In the case of reports of patients, there is a loss of proportion of black work.
As far as the business is concerned, there is only a weak outage.
The strengthening of legislation since 2002 indicates that there are systematic checks in cases of disease reports that exceed 45 days.
In 2008, the CNAM (public university for the education and further education of technicians and engineers) identified among 1.5 million controls that 13% of the 285,000 of the reported short-term disease reported were "unjusted or too long" in 37.050 cases.
In the systematic controlled cases of disease for more than 45 days, less than 1.2 million were 11% of "unsuitable or unfair" cases, which is 132 000.
In general, this makes 169 000 "unjusted" cases for several million workers who have made a report of illness.
A figure that represents only a weak sample against those of the black work.
According to UMP coordinator Dominique Tian, author of a report published in July on this issue, this represents between 9 and 15 billion euros of tax revenue per year, i.e. more than the total cost of daily payments, and therefore more than the last mentioned.
Papademos: Greece should introduce a new adaptation plan
Greece needs a new adaptation programme to start its economy.
This was announced on Monday, 14 November by Prime Minister Lucas Papademos before Parliament, in addition to the fact that his Government had not been able to carry out this task for a hundred days since the Union.
"In order to continue its efforts to strengthen the economy, we need the support of our European partners and a new budget adjustment programme," said the Head of Government in his first public speech at the opening of the debate on Parliament's confidence vote on Wednesday.
The implementation of the decisions taken at the Euro-Egypt meeting on 27 October was the "main task" of the new government, as the country's role within the Eurozone was "on the game" as it added.
Accordingly, Mr Papademos has planned to reduce the country's deficit "of 9%" of gross domestic product from now until the end of the year, after which it was 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
The rights of the new sponsors
Mr Samaras, Head of the Right Flight, had given his consent to the measures already approved on Monday with regard to an attempt to obtain an exemption from the debt crisis, but predicted that his party would not be prepared for additional savings.
"We will not vote in favour of new initiatives," he said at a meeting of the members of his party, New Democracy.
He had already explained himself to the standards of reducing budget deficit and debt, as well as the fight against waste, however, was hostile to any policy that would undermine economic momentum.
Olli Rehn, EU Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs, who had prevented the IWF and the EU from granting the necessary loan over EUR 8 billion without the written guarantee of all parties on their support for the planned plans, had replied that his word would be sufficient and he would not sign anything under pressure from the openings.
Euthanasia and associated freedom must be legalised, so an expert greme
The Canadians live in order to avoid death, as reported by the Royal Society of Canada
The Gremium stated that governments, health care institutions and doctors worked together to prepare the best painkillers, as well as on cancer cases.
The Canadian society lives in a denial of death.
Only 9% of Canadians can actually talk to their doctor about the conditions under which they want to die and make arrangements for this purpose.
This is one of the conclusions of a taxable report by the Royal Society of Canada, where six experts were involved in various fields of expertise, including ethics, law and medicine.
This body recommends that the government amend the penal law in such a way as to allow with Switzerland and euthanasia where this choice is made and that such a decision be taken in patients who are considered to be able to make such a decision.
As a task, experts draw up a recently published survey of the independent company EIU, which compared the quality of death in 40 countries of the Earthball.
Although Canada has placed itself in the 10th rank, the study notes that "the medical death control in Canada has created a culture in which people are afraid to break the subject of death".
Medical care or not: 77% of Canadians have no access to painkillers, so the experts ordered by the Royal Society of Canada inform us.
And despite the majority of Canadian wishes to die at home, 68.6% of those in the hospital eventually die.
The rate is considered by the whole country to be 86% of the deaths reported in the hospital in Quebec at the highest.
In the issue of euthanasia and with Switzerland, the authors of the report are faced with conclusions that the position of the federal government which has already taken place does not conflict with any amendments to the Criminal Code in respect of euthanasia and with its companion Switzerland.
Now, however, there is no evidence that such decriminalisation would lead to the use of immunization of euthanasia or accompanying suicide by uncompliant or non-compliant persons.
On the contrary, there are a number of cases of such abuses in countries where euthanasia and companion Switzerland are not legalized, as Jocelyn Downie, reporter of the report, confirmed at a teleconferencing conference yesterday.
"Euthansia is practiced in Canada where it is clearly illegal."
"Suicide is also practised in Canada, although clearly illegal here," Jocelyn Downie explains.
Canadians Feared the Euthanasia
We are now aware that according to an Angus Reid survey carried out in 2010, 85% of Canadians have already applied for euthanasia, as they are of the opinion that this allowed people to slow down their suffering at the end of their life path.
And 66% believe that the conduct of a legalization of euthanasia has no effect on conveying the message that the lives of older or disabled people are less valuable.
With regard to those who have already practiced a co-existence, 41% of the respondents are of the opinion that they should not be prosecuted.
As regards the maintenance or setting of the funds in patients, the situation is less clear, the author of the report.
They also set out in their recommendation list that the provisions of the Penal Code should not apply as criminal.
In addition, the Expert Group calls for experts to be involved in the task of respecting the provisions of the means of living, and this must be feared without criminal prosecution.
The Gremium stated that governments, health care institutions and doctors collaborated on more painful treatment in order to prepare the best painkillers, as well as on cancer cases.
Finally, with regard to the resources already widely used in the Canadian health institutions for health care, the Gremium calls for at least considering them, since they are as small as euthanasia used to reduce physical pain and they are related to the same procedures.
Preservation of other experts
Some experts in the field of health law have already made reservations as to the conclusions of the expert report of the Royal Society of Canada.
RA Pierre Deschamps, a health specialist, has described the behaviour of reporting experts as "extrem" among other things, as they do not set any limits for euthanasia practice in patients at the end stage.
"This opens the door to a situation in which anyone who lives and is over 18 years of age asks another person to help him at his suicide," said RA Deschamps, who had reviewed the report yesterday.
RA Deschamps also stresses that the authors of the report appear to have the responsibility of the individual over all other values involved in the social impact of society.
But now, he says, "there are guidelines and obligations in a society".
Margaret Somerville, a health law specialist, also called "a strong resistance" to the conclusions of the report that she titled as "Pro-Euthanasi-Manifest".
Margaret Somerville, who is a member of the Royal Society of Canada, is particularly concerned with the non-use of misuse in certain countries where euthanasia and accompanying Switzerland are legalized, such as in the Netherlands and Oregon.
The King of Jordan calls on President Assad to take the power
Damascus flags a "Complot"
Syria is apparently more isolated
The Partisan Bashar al-Assads have demonstrated yesterday before the authorities of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
The diplomatic pressure on the Syrian Bashar al-Assads, which, thanks to Russia's support and a "computt" directed against the country, has increased yesterday.
Two days before the Syrian withdrawal by the Arab League, the European Union had imposed its sanctions on Damascus, although Turkey and Jordan, the Syrian neighbouring countries, had taken a position in favour of a withdrawal from President Assad.
King Abdullah II. Jordan yesterday was the ambitious Arab Prime Minister who had urged President Baschar al-Assad to "submit his authority in Syria" in which the fourteen civilians and members of the government were already killed.
"Put Bashar's interest in his country at heart, so he would come out, but in addition he should create the necessary conditions for a new era of political life in Syria," said the king of Jordan, neighboring Syria, in an interview with the BBC.
The Turkish diplomat chief Ahmet Davutoglu, on the other hand, had complained that the Turkish mediation attempt which had been addressed to the Syrian regime since the beginning of the year had not been successful.
"Those in the Middle East who cannot be at peace with their people and can't be satisfied with this," he said in a statement to Syria, the neighbouring country, to which Turkey is taking a stand that is becoming worse.
The United States, on the other hand, has examined the "constitution of the consensus against Assad and the structures of the Syrian regime" as a result of the decisions of the League of Arab States and the European Union.
"The international community, the United States, the EU, the Arab League and countries like Turkey have been attacked by an ever-increasing tone in Syria in the face of the repressions," said Mark Toner, a speaker of the State Department.
During this period, 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the government were killed in the region of Dar'a in South Syria, the Syrian Human Rights Observatory announced.
Two other civilians, according to this NGO, had come to live in the city where he was buried.
As a result of a press conference, the Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Muallim was still the view that the country "taxes at the end of the crisis".
On the other hand, he has taken note of the decision of the Arab League to suspend Damascus from its duties, which is a "hazardous step" in his assessment.
Syria "will not be followed," he added under the charge, "those who will fail against Syria will fail".
Following the decision to suspend Syria, the Arab League is currently investigating a "protection mechanism for civilians" and wants 500 members of Arab human rights organizations, the media and military observers in the country.
French Foreign Minister Alain Jappé also spoke in favour of sending UNO observers to protect civilians from repression of the regime that he was arrested after his "paranoia".
A comprehensive reassessment of the League is planned for the morning in Rabat to discuss the implementation of the crisis plan decided on 2 November, in particular the alleged withdrawal of military troops from the occupied cities and the release of detained demonstrators.
Russian Vice-Minister Sergej Lowrow has adopted the Arab League's decision yesterday as "misappropriate" to prevent possible sanctions against Damascus, although China had already taken note of the implementation of the crisis plan.
Italy
Monti calls on the markets to be patient and Italy to be willing to sacrifice
Mario Monti, a future Italian head of government, has taken a little more time from the markets to form his staff and implement a program to "sacrifice" to restore the credit quality lost during the last few months of the Berlusconi government.
The former EU Commissioner had held negotiations with the political parties yesterday before today's meeting of trade unions and employers.
It was his job to launch a cabinet into Parliament which consisted of a relatively strict combination of external technologies.
"Monti spoke of an important programme with a number of victims," said Francesco Nucara, rapporteur of one of the many parliamentarian groups participating in the talks after he met with the former President-in-Office.
Gianfranco Fini, President of the Chamber of Deputies, had been reluctant to wait for Mario Monti to vote in Parliament until Friday to ensure that the new government has sufficient support.
The talks will be drawn up in the presentation by Mr Monti of a list of complaints which will be attended by thousands of ministers to the Head of State, Giorgio Napolitano.
M. Monti commented that the rigid nervousness of the stock market and the compulsory market required time.
In "a democracy there are certain deadlines" to prepare a government as well as a government programme, he stressed under the note that "the markets will be shown slowly and with understanding".
His order was first examined by the Presidents by the markets, but his concern was further reinforced, especially after an unexpected industrial decline in the eurozone in September.
The prime minister is to create an existing pillar of major technocrats, although he stressed that he would also like to share "political" with others.
The new government should only be estimated by 2013 at the date of the next parliamentary elections.
According to Gianfranco Fini, the President of the Chamber of Deputies, the new government should receive Parliament's confidence until Friday.
M. Monti has been committed to working in all urgency to make Italy a "new protagonist" in Europe.
A speaker from EU Commissioner Olli Rehn stressed that "our diagnosis of the Italian economy has not changed itself in the light of the new government".
The EU, which is convinced that Rome's objective of the budget balance in 2013, despite the savings plans reached in recent months, has called for new hard work, in particular.
Emma Marcagagglia "Chief of the Chiefs" of Italy, which will meet in Monti on Tuesday, is also on the need for economic recovery," but a country that has no record of growth which cannot respect the fiscal figures."
M. Monti, who is known for his competence and his independence as EU Commissioner (1994-2004), stands for an "Epochen change" in Italy after 17 years "Berlusconism"; the "Professor" symbolizes "the challenge of reliability" as well as "other Italians", such as the leading producer.
The graven unknown here sees the length of his staff.
President Napolitano would like to avoid the proposed elections, since Italy has reached 200 billion euros of state obligations from April to April 2012.
Russian scientists help Iran's nuclear energy programme
A Russian scientist, Wjatschalaw Danilenko, helped Iran develop a nuclear-weapon-free pusher, so a specialized American NGO was confirmed on Monday.
The Institute for Science and International Security ISIS is based on the recent report of the International Atomic Safety Agency AIEA and other documents issued by this UN agency to identify this scientist.
Last week the IAEA had shared its "earnest concern" because of a "probably military dimension" of the Iranian nuclear programme.
According to an introductory study of the AIEA documents since ISIS, Danielenko, born in 1934, had been working in a Soviet military nuclear power plant in Cheljabinsk (Ural), and had been involved in the production of synthetic diamonds produced by explosion.
In 1989 or 1991, he was to leave the centre to establish a company in Kiev which produces "Nano diamonds".
In 1995, the economic difficulties of his company had led him to contact the Iranian message in Ukraine.
Prior to his return to Russia, he worked on an Iranian programme from 1996 to 2002.
In its last report, the IAEA noted strong evidence that Iran's development" of a nuclear explosive system"was supported by the work of a foreign expert, who was not only excessively involved in this technology but also as a member of the Agency reported on his entire career in this technology, directly working on the military nuclear energy programme of his country of origin."
Anti-Islamic offences and delicts have increased by 50%
The crimes and delicts committed against Muslims have increased by 50% from 2009 to 2010, although other racist or religiously motivated violent crimes have either slightly declined or increased during the same period, according to the FBI statistics published on Monday.
According to this data, the total number of violent crimes committed against Muslims from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010 increased by 49% in 2010, despite a 13% increase in violence against Catholics, a 4% decrease in Jewish penalties and a global increase of 14% in anti-religious crimes and punishments.
The total number of "hassed-motivated crimes" has increased to 6,628 cases, of which 47.3% by racial differences and 20% by religious differences of motivated punishments, according to the FBI.
"After a fall in 2009, it is disturbing to see these crimes and penalties again," the Human Rights First stressed.The increase in anti-Islamic violence is particularly significant," the organization added in a communiqué.
"Human Rights First had long emphasised that the violence directed against Muslims, as well as all forms of hate crimes, should be regarded as a serious violation of human rights," added Paul Legendre, a responsible member of the organization.
"The US Government can and should do more to combat these violations," he added, under the assumption that this could be carried out by improving the police's attitude towards hate crimes.
The "hass Offences" is an inheritance in the U.S. federal law from the era of the civil rights struggle.
This legislation was adopted after the death of Martin Luther Kings to punish violent men who are directed against race, skin color, religion or race and who are now also involved in sexual harassment.
Twitter changes the platform and looks more and more like Facebook
The Microblogging website Twitter has introduced changes in the presentation of its platform on Monday to enable its users in particular to observe the activities of those who follow their entries, which allow the service to resemble those of Facebook once more.
The new "Activity" tab and another "Name" allow you to better read-only live after the activities of other "Twitter" users who follow their messages ("Tweets") and follow your messages.
This allows them to find out whether they are allowed to follow their messages, whether they subscribe to new contributions, or whether they are favouring certain messages, etc.
This new Twitter menu offer was tested before its general internet distribution on Monday"in August at a low percentage of users", said Twitter speaker Carolyn Penner in front of the French Press Agency AFP.
Twitter was for its little instinctive features known, shared with something esoteric encouraging Wordlaut (RT for the referenced Reitrages of another person).followfriday for recommending to follow another user) thus opening up a wider audience with a more comparable management than that of the large public Facebook and Google+ networks.
In the network, users discussed using certain "Tweets" on the Internet about this innovation.
"This is useless, compelling and very similar to very Facebook," writes @jemb123.
"The "Activity" function will help me to follow certain elements of my Flux Twitter better," said @dannykronstrom.
Austria
Introduction of a "Golden Budget Rule" into the Constitution
On Tuesday, the Government of the Great Social Democratic/Christian Coalition in Austria decided to adopt a "Golden Budget Rule" in order to reduce public deficits and to avoid any degradation by rating agencies in the Austrian Top Bonuti (AAA).
It was the social democratic Chancellor Werner Faymann, who had announced this decision at the end of the Council of Ministers, although the Austrian public debt was 74.6%, so much more than the 60% criterion established by the Maastricht Treaty, but clearly below the debt level of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
"If Austria's payment capacity is not reduced by AAA to AA+, we have to pay three billion euros a year in interest," Michael Spindelegner, Vice Chancellor and Christian Democrats Foreign Minister argued.
Austria also claims that the Brussels summit of the eurozone Member States took place on 26 October: at that time the Heads of State and Government had requested that public deficit reduction be reduced by the end of 2012 and that a return to public account balance should be made to the Constitution or by adopting an equivalent law.
This is similar to the "German model" taken by the Austrian Government, since Germany was the first European country to adopt such a "rule" in the Constitution.
By 2017 the structural budget deficit should be reduced by 0.75% of gross domestic product (BIP) each year, and since 2017 the structural budget deficit of the state should not exceed the 0.35% limit of GDP, although the regional states should show comparable households as well as the communities.
The objective is to exclude budget liabilities in the 2020/21 horizon under the 60% criteria laid down by the Maastricht Agreement.
Starker Yen
Noda comes with a new intervention on monetary markets
Japan's Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned on Tuesday that the Japanese government would intervene again in the monetary markets if Yen should continue to increase.
"If we should establish an exact volatility" in the Yen exchange rate, we will act as we did last time," said Mr. Noda in the Senate.
On Tuesday, Yen was again near the historical level, which the Japanese authorities had forced on 31 October to intervene.
Tokyo had sold massive Yen against dollar in order to reduce the Japanese currency value, which has been a new record value since 1945 against the dollar.
However, the Yen has been regularly increased by purchases of investors who consider the Yen as "flight value" in these uncertain times of global economic collapse and debt crisis in Europe.
The dollar fell under 77 yen on Tuesday, the euro was spent under the 105 yen's symbolic chain near the levels that had drawn the last intervention.
Before the financial crisis 2008-2009, the dollar was reported on the 120 yen, the euro more than 160 yen.
This electricity fire of the Japanese device damages the export of the archive as it costs the "Made in Japan" products and reduces the income value drawn from Japanese companies abroad as they exchange them in foreign currency.
"Japan is fighting after the earthquake and the tsunami on 11 March, which destroyed the Tohoku region (Northern East), for its reconstruction," stressed Mr. Noda, who fears that this glory of the Yen could already kill the weak awakening in Keema.
The third world power has been growing in the third quarter - 1.5% compared to the previous quarter - for the first time this year thanks to the rapid export and consumption of "lombed" households once again.
However, the Prime Minister estimates that the tenure of Yen does not reflect "the economic foundations of Japan".
On the other hand, Minister of Finance Jun Azumi has called on the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened a two-day meeting of its monetary policy committee on Tuesday, to take all reasonable steps to strengthen Yen.
However, Hirohide Yamaguchi, the Deputy Governor of the Institute, has announced that BoJ has already introduced "appropriate assumptions" to allow him to read that no additional money lock is expected on Wednesday.
As a result of the last meeting, at the end of October, the Notenbank had increased its state bond purchases of 5 billion yen (47 billion euros) in order to raise the amount of coverage of yen (519 billion euros) which it had allocated for various purchases of financial securities in order to overcome the liquidity market.
Eurozone:
Cinnamon feet fast in height, drilling back
The risk of the closure of the debt crisis is constantly undermining the European figures.
Despite the recruitment of new heads of government in Greece and Italy as well as the best growth rates in France and Germany, the Councils of the weaker countries continue to increase.
The sources that are still concerned about the stability of the euro area are also operating on this service day, on 15 November, a little more in negative films.
In Paris the CAC lost by 10 a.m. 1.4% and fell to 3.064 points.
The Dax in Frankfurt went back to 0.4%, London to 0.1%.
"In view of the new tensions with regard to government loans in the euro area in difficulty, the global stock markets continue to deliver some of their short-term gains.
"The capitalists are nervous and are just too aware of the risk of arrest," says Terry Pratt, an institutional broker at IG Markets, quoted by the Press Agency Reuters.
The growth in Tokyo, which, on the other hand, at the renewed fear of market participants with regard to Europe's capacity to continue the debt crisis, ended with a decline of 0.7%.
"As the rest of the world has focused its eyes on Europe, and trade moves on a limited variation corridor, unless the investors have any evidence that the situation has stabilized," estimates Mitsushige Akino, fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
This resurgence of concern about the future of the eurozone damages the unit currency that continues to base on the service day.
The euro has been moving for one and a half months at its lowest level.
At 10 o'clock the European currency was worth $1.3570, so it went by 0.4%.
According to the source makers, they returned after the CDU, the Party of Chancellor Angela Merkel, who had gathered at the convention on Monday, had filed an application which, in particular, provides for the possibility of leaving the euro area without leaving the European Union at the same time.
The Italian and Spanish councils are far below the 6% limit.
Italy's and Spain's loans are still at a very disturbing level.
This Tuesday morning, the income of the Italian bonds reached 6.85% by 10 years, which was more than 6.2% of the Spanish title.
These tensions of interest rates in the south, but also in France, continue to fuel the fears of the prosecutors.
The future Italian Head of Government, Mario Monti, called for more time from the markets to restore the situation threatened by debt relief in Italy.
The new Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos confirmed, on the other hand, that the implementation of the decisions taken at the Eurozone summit on 27 October would be "the main task" of his Government.
Spain is in the market visir, as Parliament elections take place in the country on Sunday.
The "spread" range between the German and Spanish 10-year obligations has reached a new historical height.
Expected eurozone growth figures
In the third quarter, France rejected a 0.4% economic growth due to the budget consumption and therefore slightly better than the expected 0.3%.
However, the statistical agency INSEE had reviewed the decline in the numbers of the second quarter, although a decrease in 0.1% of gross domestic product (BIP) was instead of a stagnation.
In fact, it's the fourth quarter that gives economic experts the most satisfaction.
Germany, on the other hand, had to record an increase of 0.5% over the same period.
A first estimate of the entire euro area will be expected at 11 a.m., where the EU Commission warns of the risk of a new recession.
Energy policy:
Facts should be won over documents
If there is a subject that cannot be dealt with on the basis of short-term considerations or emotions, this is certainly energy policy.
The availability and costs of electricity directly affect the purchasing power and competitiveness of companies.
It is wise to accept an election meeting to think about this subject and the position of nuclear energy.
The debate will only bear fruit if it examines the overall economic, social and ecological consequences of the proposed options.
The French should base their opinion on objective facts, rational data.
Although there are 7 billion people on this planet, if the demographic evolution is leading to a double demand for electricity by the year 2050, the world's population should not have to forget an important element.
At the same time, we need to slow down the linkage of fossil resources in order to continue to produce sustainable electricity without the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, one of the issues that have been eliminated from the ecological debate, in order to combat climate irregularities.
The accident of Fukushima does not change this parameter.
Germany continues to be isolated in its decision to reject nuclear power.
This is neither the case in Belgium, which undermines its decision on the need to find a replacement replacement source, nor in Switzerland, which is just intended to build only nuclear power plants of the last generation.
The Czech Republic, the United Kingdom, Finland, Poland, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India and Brazil, to name just a few countries, continues to pursue their projects with determination.
The United States, on the other hand, has decided to join their park by re-entering the work Three Mile Island after the nuclear fall.
Even if it is based on renewable energy sources, the German model is sometimes taken as an example, however, the reality of the discussion is contrary to it.
The choice in Berlin will be in the form of a deterioration of the electricity price, an increased energy dependence on imports of gas, particularly from Russia, which will result in an increase in CO2 emissions caused by gas and coal power plants.
The whole of these unpleasant effects will already be observed within a few months.
The case in Denmark is allowed to remember.
Denmark, on the other hand, is a European Tablet Leader with regard to wind energy of 30% of its electricity; on the other hand, the country is one of the most powerful users of coal and gas, which is different from wind energy; its CO2 emissions and its electricity price are 65% and 50% higher than the corresponding European average.
Thanks to the stability of our energy policy our neighbours pay a 40% higher electricity bill than our French budgets.
Since energy prices in the globalised economy play a key role in competitiveness and the stability of the industry at national level, French companies have benefited from the most favourable electricity in Europe.
Any significant reduction in nuclear energy would therefore result in a strong increase in energy prices, which would allow the noble statements on the reindustrialization of our country and the defence of purchasing power to illusion.
Questions revealed that the price that the large majority of the French are willing to pay is as low as they are able to recognize resistance to the principle of this energy source.
We are now aware that the energy policy of our country has enabled us to build an industrial sector with 125.00 jobs directly and 440,000 jobs.
Due to its strong export character, it brings a number of specialised small and medium-sized enterprises into the international markets and makes them create countless jobs.
France should take the decision to withdraw from nuclear power so that a large part of this SMEs would fall to the victim, and the annual 6 billion euros on investment debt and nuclear energy exports would be more and more complex.
Which electrician would be required to operate on a planned EPR for sixty years if its producers were programmed?
In order to solve the energy equation, one must realize that there is as little one as one devil work as a miracle instrument for the production of electricity.
The CO2 solutions developed by the Areva company to use nuclear energy and renewable energy are evidence of the complementaryity of energy sources.
The highest possible level of safety is an absolute imperative for nuclear power.
In France we have a security authority that has carried out uncompromising and transparent controls in existing works, such as construction in Flamanville.
Their work crews who have made a name based on their professionality are to be seized from the security proposal.
Within 50 years, the nuclear industry has experienced three serious disasters.
Only one, and although in Three Mile Island, has been established under normal operating conditions, he has loved without consequences for humans and the environment.
In Tschernobyl, the drama was challenged by reactor construction as well as innocent human failure.
In Fukushima, some seem to forget that the accident of two natural disasters has never been caused by a massive mass that has caused the death of more than tens of thousands of people.
The core industry will draw its lessons from this incident as it did after the two preceding events.
As a result of this approach, as well as cooperation between the security authorities of the French and German nuclear power plant operators and manufacturers, the EPR is a draft which enables it to resist such phenomena.
Since it is considered desirable under the electrotechnics to build a nuclear power plant, a construction stop in Flamanville would be a great gift to the competition of Areva and EDF by allowing them to travel on their free path to the leadership position in the inexhaustible nuclear power development.
It is impossible and legitimate to look for the best energy source for our country, but it would be irresponsible, emotions, dogmas and party leaders to dominate a debate which also determines the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Is immigration a burden or an opportunity for the economy?
The immigration policy under Nicolas Sarkozy was criticised by many angles - overload of police, judicial and administrative bodies because of a policy underlying the numbers, the compatibility of this policy with the status of a "country of human rights" as France itself had.
Recently, the Government's charge against foreign students had been brought to the attention of the Ministry of the Interior (see Release of 23 May), who announced that France "does not need any talent, walls or basements from abroad".
But this policy has only rarely been analysed from the economic perspective.
On this issue, there is a wide-ranging consensus between rights and links.
On the right hand side was attacked by Jacques Chirac, who had stated in 1976 that "900,000 unemployed people, including over 2 million migrant workers, should not pose a problem for a country", by left side by Michel Rocard, who was quoted in 1990, France "could not capture the whole poverty of the world".
Each difference consists of the degree of gravity
The fear of the invasion of the national soil by the proud Polish Klempner was shared in 2005 by both right and left.
The immigrants were taken from both camps as a burden to the economy and to the French society.
The only difference is in the degree of pregnancy that you want to treat immigrants.
In his programme, Francois Hollande restricts itself to banalities, which refers to partnership development allowing us to solve our "Migration Problems".
This idea of immigration as a burden, as a problem, may affect the choices; however, it is cost-effective.
As economic experts Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron present us in a recent work that summarizes the latest findings on immigration (External People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 S.), there is a broad consensus among the specialists about the positive impact of immigration on economic growth, wages and jobs in the countries of migration.
Restricting immigration would weaken growth and damage labour market situation.
The fear of the influence of migrants is based on the assumption that they will ensure that the domestic labour forces, in particular the less qualified ones, will be replaced by pressure on their wages.
Experience shows, however, that immigrants are, in fact, more complementary than domestic wage workers, as they exercise a serious profession in sectors that are technically unloaded.
The low-qualified immigrants work in sectors where domestic wage workers are less qualified than immigrants in dynamic sectors where training is not covered by the job offer.
Positive Remuneration Effect
Just as a surgeon would have difficulty working in a country where there is a lack of anatheists, this complementarity also has a positive effect on pensions and the domestic labour market.
Giovanni Peri has calculated in this way and in this way that a 1% increase in immigration flows resulted in a related long-term increase in real wages between 0.6% and 0.9%.
And this without taking into account the fact that the diversity of ideas and economic growth introduced by immigrants is available (highly proportion of immigrants under American Nobel Prize winners; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
Migrants are also contributing to the social systems, which in European countries are about 1% of the total budget.
For example, the World Labour Organization estimates that a person aged 30 years to Germany will contribute a net contribution of around EUR 150,000 to the public budget on average over his or her lifetime.
Nicolas Sarkozy wanted to take over the missing cut points "with the teeth" on his mandate.
However, these infected teeth, which the immigrants should break, achieved exactly the opposite effect.
Europe has discovered democracy, now remains to think of European democracy
Democracy is a valuable good; it is also a sensitive good.
The European continent should remind itself of who, after their discovery in Athens more than two thousand years ago, had left behind the whole 20th century of the tragedy of World War I, of Totalitarianism, of the Holocaust, of the Gulf, but also of France in Spain, of Salazar in Portugal and of the Upper Greece.
Some may have believed that it was possible to exercise the right to vote, and although it was directly possible to see democracy cover one for every time over their enemies.
Since Napoleon, it has been known that it was a characteristic of the mind.
The general right to vote, which represents the necessary condition of democracy, is not enough for this and can be as good as the "pressure instrument", as it was then expressed by the Republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot.
No, democracy requires more: a public space, a public spirit, values, an organization, separation and control of violence, education, disclosure, economic and social spirit, a legal statement.
The crisis in Europe in which we are living is an economic crisis, but it is also very and very early in the political and democratic crisis.
In this regard, the change in the opinion of the Greek true falsification referendum had been twice as close as possible: once the need for a strong return to politics, on the other hand, but also those of the disturbing feeling of their inability, of their incompetence.
This ambivalentity should be considered as permanent.
The truth is that the front lines of the democratic struggle have fallen down today, and that the Republican soldiers, or at least most of them, are no longer heading in the right direction.
We have nothing to gain in order to bring about a success of the national referendum which has been organised according to the needs and traffic.
A free choice for the Europeans alone or a gap with connected eyes into the empty of the nationalist return: a serious choice for the citizens!
No, we want to be a hacker, but a collective task, out of full law, explained and sustained, an election and democracy, this time at European level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain and Portugal - you know, in the rest of the world, where to end the list - since there is only one crisis, and it dominates Europe.
It is a whole Europe that is driven by the dictatorship of the markets and the rating agencies, which is subject to its lack of power and its lack of solidarity.
It is Europe, which is at international level.
One is concerned about the transfer of sovereignty to Europe - in this case it is all Europe that loses its sovereignty, and so on, each of the nations belonging to it.
The urgency is to give the people's sovereignty back to the leadership of the European project.
Because it is common ground for Europeans to reduce the burden of their debt, to free themselves from markets and to start a future through investment.
The rise from the crisis has taken decisions at European level on conditions that cannot be met without having to lead us to complete democratic law.
After this proposal by Jacques Delors and the Socialists has been fought for a long time, everyone today needs to be guided by the European economy.
Agreements.
But without political integration and a stronger democracy - as they advocate citizens - it would be a new tortoise and another sack gas.
We need to take a new step towards building a Europe.
In order to create the Republic in France, it had to " create" Republicans.
The revolution of interests alone could not afford enough here.
This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.
We need to form a more integrated Europe at an economic level.
This can only be achieved by creating a politically seen democratic Europe, a genuine European peoples' unity.
We need Europeans to create Europe.
"Contact-free" chip cards become generalised
On Tuesday in Villepinte, the world fair for Chipcarten opens its doors close to Paris in an optimal manner.
According to Eurosmart, the year 2011 would actually end with an increase of 11% in global sales of microproserchips (EC cards, SIM cards) with more than 6 billion units sold.
The most difficult segment is the contactless technology that enables payments in public transport or comparison of purchases by simply keeping the card on a read-only device.
In comparison with the 320 million sold last year, 460 million free chip cards should be sold worldwide this year!
In 2012, its market share should continue to increase (580 million expected units) and represent more than 10% of the global chip card market (6,925 million cards).
Europe will gain access to land after a long time of the Asia-Pacific region.
Some 26 million Visa cards are already equipped with this feature, and 75 000 payment terminals are accepted.
In France, the beginnings have been improved: only 400,000 contact-free visa cards have been distributed.
However, consumer markets are making a fuss.
Carrefour has therefore issued 2.5 million unlinked Pass MasterCards this year.
In order to survive at a higher rate, it is now necessary for banks to equip their customers with these cards.
"Two large French financial institutions have committed themselves to hand over to their customers in the future systematic bank cards which are connected to the stateless chip," says Gérard Nébouy, Director-General of Visa Europe France.
Banks test payment by phone
However, this is only a first stage on the way to the means of payment for the future: mobile phone.
A growing low percentage of devices is thus far equipped with the necessary NFC (NFC) technology to carry out these transactions.
"They're too late."
"But at least next year they should experience real progress."
"We calculate in 2012 the world sales of 80 to 120 million units," explains Marc Bertin, President of Eurosmart.
But the banks have taken the initiative.
The Crédit Agricole had announced yesterday the start of a test course in Caen, which will run from December to next June.
The iPhones of some 200 customers and employees should be equipped with a capsule that allows for free payment.
The BPCE operates a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And the Société Generale had also said yesterday to prepare for the introduction of a tender that would allow their customers to pay without contact by phone.
Terrorist front is understood from the Sahara to Nigeria
Paris is concerned about the relationships between al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb and the Boko Haram sect.
The long-disquieted relations between the Al-Qaida terrorist group in the Islamic Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian sector Boko Haram seem to confirm.
On Sunday, Algerian Deputy Minister of Visas, Abdelkader Messahel himself confirmed that Algiers has now "encouraged" about it.
"The way in which the two organizations proceed and the relations of the secret services lead to clear cooperation," he said without further deliberation.
Paris seems to do a similar analysis.
The findings on the execution of two Frenchmen in Niger, which took place last January, have been supported by border stations for days.
Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory, who were kidnapped in a restaurant in Niamey by Aqmi's supporters, should have been killed on the same day as several of their drivers because of an operation carried out by the French special units.
French and Nigerian investigators wanted to find several telephone chips belonging to the terrorists in the drummers.
Terrorism
The analysis of the telephone calls conducted leads to several chat partners stationed in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), the investigators are particularly interested in the numbers of two chat partners: A number leads to a Nigerian who has been in Maiduguri for a long time, a city in northern Nigeria, where Boko Haram's village is located; the other leads to a man who is close to Aqmi and the sector.
"This is a step forward, however, you must wait for a clearer location before you can talk about operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Harem."
"But it's possible."
"I have known for years that the sectors are dealing with financial and intellectual support from Auvens and that it is increasingly active," laments Nigerian researcher Kunle Amuwo.
In recent months these "supporting services" have become increasingly timely in their course, as well as the demands and operating modes of Boko Harem, which now mean the attracting of suicide killers and the use of increasingly complex explosives that carry the same manuscript as those used by Aqmi.
The international community, to begin with Washington, has since put pressure on Abuja to take account of the problems caused by Boko Haram.
The Nigerian authorities have considered the grouping to be a community of illuminates, which should not be given special attention.
Faster Success
The Boko haram founded in 2002 in Maiduguri around a mosque, a school as well as the fundamentalist Iman Mohammed Yusuf - which in Haoussa means so much as "the Western education is a shame" - follows the creation of an Islamic emirism in northern northern Nigeria.
In this region of the Middle East, the combination is making rapid progress.
It politicalizes and demands strict observance of the Scharia, while its associated activists are taking advantage of the fight against the ungodly central government.
The activists first have churches, bars and authorities in the visitor.
In 2009, activists from Boko Haram showed their stronger attacks on the Commission.
However, the reaction since Abuja is usually ignored.
The army surrounds the city, but it's 800 dead.
Mohammed Yusuf, who was arrested in prison, is murdered in prison.
As a result, the sectors are becoming more radical and leave their regions in the north.
On the last Christmas night, she became known as an careant in Jos, who demanded 80 people's lives, so to another in Abuja.
In June Boko Haram will be awarded the debt of a suicide warrant which occurred in the safe police headquarters in Abuja - the first of its kind.
In August, the United Nations' local seat is on the top international target ship.
The formation of a terrorist in Africa, which is to lead from Mauritania through Nigeria to Somalia, has been encouraged by all security experts.
While the Aqmi Mali and the Niger have been operating the Somalis of al-Shabaab in Kenya, Boko Harem seems to be a new threat in the centre of the continent.
Last week, Alain Juppé warned President Good Luck Jonathan in Nigeria before Boko Harem and was ready to show "notice all".
The world behind the Republican presidential candidates
With Romney, Herman Cain and Rick Perry, they rival in simplification and ignorance about China, Iraq and Israel.
Can a crisis-fashioned America have a complex world that is easy not to say: lead simple ideas?
If you listen to the Republican presidential candidates so, the voters could almost get this impression.
For a few days, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and their competitors have repeatedly made their powerful statements as well as their states regarding the foreign policy, the traditional republican focus.
On China, Iran and Israel's aid - often undermined in no way - Sloans.
With regard to the appointment of the Grand Old Party at the highest level in the course of mid-Romany, the Chinese are threatened to attend the WTO and they are the leading theme of the "Money manipulation" in an America that is driven by the overcrowding of entire industrial sectors into Asia.
Dumm ran when this was supposed to imply the inception of a trade war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, a former messenger in China under Obama and the only candidate who seems to have a clear vision of a foreign policy, has almost cut off the air with regard to his emotions that are smiling at him.
He called for a firm but constructive exchange with Beijing (also the current state of Obama).
But Huntsman will not listen, as he stands in the depths of the questions of opinion.
Reagan's Image
Romney also had military attacks against Iran if the sanctions were to be lifted to halt the nuclear programme.
"If I'm going to choose, I'm going to give Iran's content," he said.
"When Obama is reelected, they get the bomb."
Moreover, he has pledged to strengthen Israel's military assistance and Obama to remain guilty of obligations against this partner.
The entrepreneur Herman Cain, the second-largest candidate in position, on the other hand, carries an impressive knowledge of the act.
He recently called on the Chinese military threat to counter the fact that Beijing "trys to develop a nuclear power" - and it seems that China has been in possession of military nuclear weapons since 1964!
The technical Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and calls for military attacks on Iran, is on the other hand willing to serve the American army in Mexico against drug cartels.
Obama's return to follow-up against mutual terrorists from 2009 was also threatened by Cain, Perry and the candidate Michele Bachmann.
One is far from John McCain, the Republican candidate in 2008, an extra-political weight.
In contrast to the current presidential contractors, Reagan also had simple ideas and nevertheless won the Cold War.
They called out in memory that Obama himself was an amateur and had to give water into his wine, as far as the issue of anti-terror was concerned.
They need to be entitled to the failure of his intimate twin talk with Iran, the previous withdrawal of his "young" from Iraq, his independence in Libya, which also brought him the call of weakness.
This application, however, is not completely enforced.
The population is more likely to appreciate the positive balance of national security under Obama, which has disabled bin Laden.
Since Iraq, they have been facing military interventions leading to reconciliation.
And Obama is surprised by his argument that America needs to be restructured economically to raise its leadership position to a new life.
Nord Stream, new door to Russian gas in Europe
The North Stream gas pipeline, which runs on the shore of the Baltic Sea and directly connects Western Europe with Russia, has been put into operation.
It will provide gas for an equivalent of 30 million households.
The Russian gas station Gasprom wanted this event to take place with glazing and gloria.
Over 500 invited guests, including four heads of state and government, have spent the last Tuesday at the coastal coast under Orchester crossing and at the Feinschmeckerbuffet of the launch of the new North Stream Gas Remote Control, which connects Russia and Germany directly under the sea mirror.
The German Chancellor Angelika Merkel, the Russian President Dmitri Medwedev, the French Prime Minister François Fillon, as well as his former colleague Mark Rutte from the Netherlands, have brought together the tax of the valve, which brings Russian gas into the Western European network.
With the new gas pipeline, 27.5 billion cubic metres of additional Russian gas per year are to be delivered to Western Europe by a first pipeline of 1.224 km, which connects the region of St. Petersburg with Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.
A second pipeline that allows a total delivery of 55 billion cubic metres of gas - the equivalent of French total consumption - is to be completed by the end of 2012.
And you can already call the possibility of building a third lead on the same route.
For gasprom, the timely and precise completion of this huge construction work works like a victory.
The project was very controversial in Poland and the Baltic States.
The North Stream Pipeline will enable direct gas delivery to Germany, while avoiding any transit crossings by third countries (Poland or Ukraine) on the road.
For this reason these two countries lose a little of their power: For them it will be more difficult to exercise pressure on Russia by trying to close access to Western European markets.
Warshaw, at the most strongly committed to the debate, was not allowed to compare the North Stream Pipeline with a "new German-Swedish Pact" in connection with the alliance between Hitler and Stalin for the purposes of the occupation of Poland in 1939.
This means that the issue of political vision is too sensitive.
Western Europe has gained even greater security of supply through the promotion of these Russian projects.
This is, however, due to the cost of strengthening European energy, as the project has struck a gap between Western and Eastern Europe.
In almost five years Russia has completed its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich, Western countries that demonstrate strong gas consumption and move their gas forward.
"This gas pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, it is a new artery that connects us organicly and in a way," François Fillon confirmed when he called for the removal of the gas pipeline, pointing out to what extent the major gas contracts are also important from a political and economic side.
All of this explains the wide range of the gas prom manager represented in Lubmin with regard to gas management.
The construction of this gas pipeline is also an excellent technique.
The waterway consists of steel with concrete handles to protect them from ships.
It rest on the seabed, about 200 m deep.
In its construction, mining fields dating from World War II had to be balanced.
"About a hundred mines had to be removed or destroyed," said Jens Müller, speaker of the company Nord Stream.
In addition, strengthened measures were needed to protect the Fauna and Flora.
The lead is a long blade of metal, heavy as 242 Eiffel Towers, which is not interrupted by the whole length: either by valves or maintenance stations.
A control platform was planned for the coast of Sweden, but the project managers have taken a distance from it since the Swedens had little effort to see a Russian state company sit on a permanent basis and at the height of its coast.
"In the case of a havarie, we close the gas spill class in less than a minute," explained Jens Müller.
In the case of a leak, the gas available in the gas pipeline thus escapes into the air.
However, this case is unlikely to be considered by the designers as the fibre content has been estimated at a length of 100,000 years.
The state surveillance of the gas pipeline is provided by both a underwater robot that is controlled for external observation purposes by a ship, as well as by a device that is circled within the gas pipeline.
It has the shape of a cigarette, with a diameter diameter of one meter, is introduced into the tube and moved through the gas pressure.
After three full days of movement through the direction at a speed of 3 meters per second, the device delivers the precise information on any deformation of the metal at its arrival.
The gas pipeline has been designed to function for 50 years without having to be subjected to only the minimum repair.
The gas circulation is simply guaranteed by pressure.
This is 200 bar at the entrance, 100 bar at the exit station.
Five companies have combined their forces to carry out this project.
However, the leadership remains in the hands of gasprom, which holds 51% of the share.
The German companies E.ON and BASF (je to 15.5%), as well as the Dutch gas and the French company group GDF Suez (je to 9%).
These five companies have formed a company called Nord Stream, which is responsible for the construction and operation of the gas pipeline.
She has her seat in train in Switzerland, where taxation is particularly cost-effective.
Gasprom has thus rented the entire capacity of this company to transport its gas, although it is in the twenty-first year contract.
"Gasprom will be paid for the total capacity, no matter how gross the real transportable gas amount falls," said Jens Müller.
The financing of the gas pipeline was secured at 30% by shareholders and at 70% by bank loans.
The total cost of work should be EUR 7.4 billion for both pipelines.
For GDF Suez, for example, the investment total is 240 million.
However, the minority shareholders are forced to re-establish their emissions, as gasprom alone carries the risk of debt.
The gas pipeline is located at a sandy, well-managed coastal beach at Lubmin from the Baltic Sea.
The 4.5 meters high valves form the gas liner.
Sensors measure pressure, temperature and other figures of the relevant gas before it is continued into the German gas pipelines.
Since the last Tuesday this terminal is delivered with a million cubic metres of Russian gas per hour.
In full capacity, this would be 3 million cubic metres per hour and 6 million in 2012.
Moleskine, a brand notebook.
From an Italian company about fifteen years ago, Moleskine now wants to give the writing a new style.
It has a flair of adventures, accompanied by the writing at Kerzenschein.
The notebook of Moleskine is easily recognizable, with its black, rectangular connection, its rubber band, the iron-colored pages, as foretold over time.
The Moleskine Notebook, as it is known today, was created in 1997.
The Italian company Modo Modo, whose seat is in Milan, decided to bring a distinctive design book to the market.
Maria Sebregondi, then the company's professional consultant, is responsible for the introduction of the new product.
The notebook was inspired by an alternative production technique called Mole Skin (Maulwurfshout), which is called a wooden wool jacket, which is used for example in relation to lawn molluscs.
This type of notebook was asked by writers and travelers very much.
"Moleskine has relived an old and almost forgotten object that has been considered an icon of avantgardist artists up to the 20th century," explains Maria Sebregondi, now responsible for Modo Mode.
The success is one.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales rose by 26% and grew by 12.7 million.
This is far from the normal production of the first year in which only 3,000 notebooks were designed.
Moleskine passes the Italian border and is exported to 70 countries, from France to the United States.
It is difficult to make a phantom image of the buyers, as the notebook attracts business people as well as students and professionals.
Moleskine has the image of cosmopolitical, cultural and open-minded customers.
The small Italian company, which started with its 12 employees, is now employing over 100 employees and has two offices since 2008; one in Milan, the other in New York.
The company sells its notes in bookstores, on Internet portals such as Fnac, in small shops in the city center and understands how to apply its identity.
"We have followed the time spirit and its new need for writing, despite the e-mail being raised," Maria Sebregondi said.
This cultural attraction is accompanied by the development of the company Moleskine: the brand recently launched an exhibition called "Detour (Umweg) " in the architects and artists' own notebooks.
In August the company also placed a link with Leopardden model on the market due to the film festival in Locarno.
Moleskine benefited from its success and this cultural spirit and understanding to diversify its products: bags, term calendars, containers, computers... The brand shows the whole range of articles.
A success that brings down the plan: In autumn 2006, Modo Modo was purchased by the Investment Fund SG Capital Europe, which is today Syntegra Capital, and this led to a new chapter in the history of the Moleskine company.
Why is the unemployment rate so high for disabled workers?
About 19% of the disabled are looking for a job.
Today the "15th week of work for the disabled".
Despite a well-known public policy introduced in 2005, unemployment rates in persons with disabilities are always double as high as average: 19% versus 9% of total unemployment.
Disappointment?
"No, so says Éric Blanchet, Director General of the Association Adapt, which focuses on the "week of work for the disabled."
"The progress made within 15 years is significant."
"Then the unemployment rate was not doubled but three times as high."
"There's not much to do."
It must be said, however, that there are still many obstacles to the unemployed before they get a job.
The elderly are more frequent: 37% are older than 50 years (17% on average).
They have a low level of qualifications: 80% of them have no support and there are only 10,000 persons with disabilities among the 2.3 million students with a higher education decision.
Finally, long-term unemployment is also very widespread: 53% in the population of the disabled compared to 38% in the overall population.
In short, there are so many criteria that make it difficult to get a new job and to "make the core of the problem", says Christian Grapin, Director-General of Tremplin, an association founded in 1992 that helps companies to acquire disabled workers.
So much for the business brakes.
The unspoken language, the attitudes of the spirit, which are certain, remains, but gradually develop.
A study conducted in April by the IMS Association for La Cité magazine, which was conducted by the asked managers, "a weak level of knowledge about the disabled", "represented" is "by persons in wheelchairs, mental or intellectual minorities".
As a result, the private companies with more than 20 employees have a long way ahead to achieve the employment target of 6% disabled workers, which was laid down in a 1987 Act.
These last mentioned figures from 2008 refer to a ratio of 2.6%.
"We are now at about 3%," reports Pierre Blanc, Director General of Agefiph, the organization responsible for making contributions from companies that violated this law.
The evidence: the number of "payers" stations has decreased as the amount of the amounts paid between 2007 and 2011, although from 59 000 to 46,000 (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
"The 2005 Act, which provides for an increase in contributions, created a strong pressure on the company," said Pierre Blanc.
"But this improvement also brings real recognition, especially in the major business groups."
According to the Ministry of Labour, only 59% of the jobs were employed between 20 and 49 employees, while companies with 100 to 199 employees were 82%.
Hazard: "What for happiness"
Just before they wore the "Blue Servicepers (20:45 hours) stars, Eden Hazard and George's Leekens had not earned their pleasure, which brought them the game of friendship.
It would be too far to say that there has been a secret understanding between them, but the image speaks symbolic bands.
On the side of the audience of the city de France, George Leekens and Eden Hazard had been able to close peace well and pleasantly.
Five months after the temperatureful gesture of his attacker against Turkey, the Belgian national trainer had nothing to say about his person as a praise.
"I am very pleased with Eden, his progress and the fact that he is Belgium."
"I want to look forward," says the friendly Liller on his side.
What is the contrast between his performance in club and national help "It's a unit that justifies everything."
"In Little I've been over all year what isn't the case in Belgium."
"It's time for me to go to the start."
Hazard will come to Saint-Denis, remanding free of charge against Romania with regard to the match against France to finally "to shine".
However, without leaving the notes of the "exquisite".
From the age of 7 years, the French National Army has been making fire, leading its victorious fields between 1998 and 2000.
"I've always been supported," he confirmed.
This will help to strengthen the "one-off" character of this encounter.
Sovil in advance: "Mathieu (Debuchy), Johan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami) will be there," he says.
"We just walked along the road."
"Go play them means grave happiness!"
In contrast, Leekens read "Stolz" with kindness.
"The Stollz, a Galamatch."
"Stolz" also to confirm - in its "neighbourly" - that France" has become a very high-level team again," and that is less than a year after the trauma of Knysna.
"Laurent Blanc has done a damn good job," he said.
Although Belgium is missing in the next European Championship, the technician is very likely to share the aircraft with the blues (the French National Aid) ... and in the direction of Brazil in 2014.
"We little Belgians are coming out of the grave," he stressed.
"We're planning a thing, the players are ambitious, they're hungry."
"They will be noted at the leading games." The game is against France.
Portugal is very reliable
The Portuguese team of Paulo Bento sees with great optimism the return game against Bosnia (2:00 p.m.) this Tuesday in Lisbon.
In the game, two men had lost their skill.
"At the end of this 90 minutes we will be a happy team and above all a happy country."
Paulo Bento is already in Poland and Ukraine.
For him there is no doubt that "La Selecçao", his national assistant, for whom he has been responsible since September 2010, will be qualified for the European Ministry of Education 2012.
For Portugal, this means only 90 minutes of happiness.
But there's a match to play, and save an opponent, and even Bosnia.
In view of the game (0-0) on Friday in the cave of Zenica it seems obvious that the towers have not yet fallen.
Portugal ruled over more than an hour clearly the party, but it was not able to highlight the important stamp that had taken the pressure from it.
"This is a good result, however, which poses a certain risk, as we have not achieved an outsider."
At home, however, in its bright city de la Luz in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced that they should be in front of a public who should also be on the game, even if the party was declared "very close", said the optimistic but clear Bento.
"We expect a very short match, however, are absolutely convinced that the upper hand can be won," said the 42-year-old Portuguese trainer.
"We have continued to have a 50% chance at European Championship 2012, however," said Carlos Queiroz's successor.
On Friday evening in Bosnia, the Portuguese are forced to reach and win a tower.
A difference can already suffice the Bosnians who also need a tower.
"This is a good result, however, which poses a certain risk, as we have not achieved an outsider," Bento regrets.
"We will appear against a man who has high technical qualities and has a lot of individual qualities," he added.
As in Zenica, the Portuguese had already put maximum pressure on Bosnia to "give them no time to think."
A good idea, provided that it is implemented this time.
