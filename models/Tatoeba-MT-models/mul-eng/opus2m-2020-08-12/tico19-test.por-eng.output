A rapidly progressive cumulative incidence of coronary virus disease (COVID-19) in the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, 1 January to 15 March 2020
The cumulative incidence of coronary disease cases (COVID-19) shows similar trends in the countries of the European Union/Economic Space and the United Kingdom, confirming that although it is at a different stage depending on the country, the COVID-19 pandemic is moving rapidly across all countries.
Based on the experience of Italy, countries, hospitals and UTIs should prepare for more than one outbreak of COVID-19 patients who will need care and, above all, intensive treatment.
On 31 December 2019, a number of cases of unknown etiology pneumonia were reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On 9 January 2020, the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention of China reported to the cause agent as being a new coronavirus, now referred to as Coronavirus 2 of the severe respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
Since then, the disease resulting from the infection by SARS-CoV-2 has been called Coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
The evidence so far is that 80% of people with COVID-19 develop a mild form of disease, i.e. a respiratory infection with or without pneumonia, and most of them recover.
In about 14% of cases, COVID-19 evolved for a more serious disease, requiring hospitalization, while 6% of the remaining cases evolved for a critical disease, requiring intensive treatment.
The mortality of patients hospitalised due to COVID-19 is 4%.
In this study, we evaluated trends in the cumulative impact of COVID-19 in each country of the European Union/Economic Space (EU/EEA) and in the United Kingdom and compared them to those of the Province of Hubei in China.
We also compared the current number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom with Italy between 31 January and 15 March 2020.
Cases of COVID-19 in EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom
After China, COVID-19 was geographically spread, and the dynamic of the COVID-19 pandemic in the rest of the world is currently following that country.
On 11 March 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 as a pandemic.
The edition of Eurosurveillance 2020, Spiteri et al. reported the first cases of COVID-19 confirmed in Europe, in accordance with the WHO definition of the case.
In the EU/EEA, the first three confirmed cases were reported by France on 24 January 2020 in persons returning from Wuhan in the Province of Hubei in China.
On 15 March 2020, cases of COVID-19 have already been detected in all 30 EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom, and between 31 December 2019 and the above date, 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths have been reported, with 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths in Italy alone.
Acquisition of cumulative numbers and cumulative incidence of COVID-19 cases
At the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), the number of cases reported by COVID-19 in each country in the world, obtained only from official sources, such as the Ministry of Health of the Countries, national and regional health authorities and WHO, is updated every day at 8 p.m.
These data were used to assess trends in COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom, and to compare them with those in Italy.
As an approach to the prevalence of active cases of COVID-19, we calculated the cumulative incidence of 14 days of COVID-19 cases, taking into account the natural evolution of COVID-19 in each EU/EEA country and the United Kingdom, during the period from 1 January to 15 March 2020.
We also presented the cumulative number of reported cases from each country until 15 March 2020 to 8h, and compared with Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
Trends in COVID-19 in EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom
The trends in the cumulative cumulative incidence of 14 days of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom generally followed those of the Province of Hubei in China (Figure 1).
In general, for the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom, the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 began to increase by 21 February and then significantly increased by 28 February 2020 (complementary material).
This was mainly due to the rapid increase in cases reported in Italy, but all other EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom showed similar increases in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 (complementary material).
Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom compared to Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
It points out that by 15 March at 8 a.m., 15 other EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom had already reported a total number of cases which were compatible with Italy three weeks or less.
Our results indicate that the number of reported cases of COVID-19 is increasing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom.
The trends observed in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 suggest that the pandemic is progressing at a similar rate in all countries.
This happens despite countries being at different stages, variations in the actions of national public health systems and possibly different definitions of cases in countries and different protocols for the selection of patients who should be tested to confirm COVID-19, including an update test.
In early March 2020, doctors in affected regions of Italy described a situation in which 10% of patients with COVID-19 needed intensive treatment, and the media reported that hospitals and intensive treatment units in these regions had already reached their maximum capacity.
Data on hospitalization by COVID-19 cases are currently available at EU/EEA level for only 6% and 1% of cases, respectively (not shown).
However, they should be systematically collected to complement current surveillance data with a focus on the number of reported cases and the number of deaths.
A study conducted between 2010 and 2011 showed a huge variation in the availability of ITI beds and semi-intensive units in Europe, ranging from 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 in Portugal for every 100 thousand people.
This means that countries can have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 IUU beds and semi-intensive treatment for a population of 100 000 inhabitants between 2010 and 2011.
Modeled scenarios related to the saturation of the health system capacity, with estimates for each EU/EEA country and the United Kingdom of the prevalence of cases of COVID-19 hospitalization associated with a 90% risk of intensive care beds are provided in the sixth update of the ECDC risk assessment on COVID-19.
In view of the fact that cases have so far concentrated in certain regions of the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom, and hospitals and intensive treatment units are generally subject to a defined population of regional scope, information on cases and beds of intensive treatment should be made available preferably in the Nomenclature of territorial Units for Statistical Purposes 2 (NUTS-2).
Italy's example and trends in other countries show that the COVID-19 pandemic is progressing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom.
The countries, hospitals and UTIs should therefore prepare for a sustained Community transmission scenario of SARS-CoV-2 and for an increase in the number of patients with COVID-19 who will need medical assistance, especially intensive treatment, as in the affected regions of Italy.
In accordance with the ECDC’s rapid risk assessment, a rapid, proactive and comprehensive approach is essential to delay the spread of SARS-CoV-2, with a change in the content approach for a mitigation approach, as the rapid increase in the number of cases may not provide sufficient time for decision-makers and hospitals to understand, accept and adapt their actions properly if not implemented in advance.
The rapid risk assessment also lists public health measures to mitigate the impact of the epidemic.
There is a small window of opportunity during which countries have the opportunity to intensify their control initiatives to reduce the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce pressure in the health system.
If these initiatives fail, other EU/EEA health systems are likely to have a rise in patients who will need intensive treatment in the next few days or weeks.
The COVID-19 disease epidemic of 2019 (COVID-19), caused by Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) disease of severe respiratory syndrome (SARS), has already killed more than 3,000 people and infected more than 80,000 people in China and the rest of the world, resulting in a disaster for the population.
Similar to its homologous virus, the SARS-CoV, which caused SARS in thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 could also be transmitted from germs and cause similar symptoms through a similar mechanism.
However, COVID-19 has less gravity and mortality than SARS, but it is much more transmissible, and affects older than young people, and more men than women.
In response to the rapid increase in the number of publications on the new disease, this article seeks to provide a current and comprehensive assessment of the research object, which is rapidly developing.
We will discuss the basic principles of epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis and disease prevention.
Although many questions still need answers, we hope that this study will help to understand and eradicate this hostile disease.
The Spring Festival on 25 January 2020 became a unique and unforgettable memory for all Chinese who were obliged to remain confined to the entire holiday and for several weeks thereafter due to the epidemic of a new viral disease.
The virus is very similar to the coronavirus (CoV) that caused a serious acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic in 2003; therefore it was called SARS-CoV-2 by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 February 2020, and the disease was called CoV-19 (COVID-19).
The epidemic began in Wuhan, China, and spread rapidly across the country and almost 50 other countries around the world.
By 2 March 2020, the virus had resulted in more than 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19, with more than 40,000 recovered patients and more than 3,000 dead patients.
WHO warns that COVID-19 is the "public enemy number one", and is potentially more powerful than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nei.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months more than 200 articles were published on COVID-19, including its virology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis and treatment, since the first report on 7 January 2020, which determined the sequence of the virus isolated from several patients.
This article seeks to sum up the progress of research in this new area of rapid development.
Whenever relevant, we will compare COVID-19 to SARS and other disease caused by COV, the respiratory syndrome in the Middle East (MERS, a 2012 epidemic).
We will also discuss what we have learned so far about disease prevention and predictation, as well as other urgent issues.
CoVs are traditionally considered non-lethal pathogens for humans, mainly causing about 15% of the common cold.
However, in this century, we have found two times highly pathogenic human coVs, which are SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, causing an epidemic originating in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, respectively, and which have recently spread to several other countries with morbidity and fearful mortality.
Thus, the current COVID-19 is the third epidemic of COV in the documented history of human beings.
According to Fig. Fig.1.1, a number of cases of pneumonia with unknown origin were initially reported in Wuhan on 31 December 2019 to the National Health Commission of China.
Seven days later, the CV sequence was published.
On 15 January 2020, Wuhan's first fatal case was reported.
Meanwhile, the epidemic spread rapidly to nearby cities, provinces and countries.
On 20 January, the count of health professionals was reported, suggesting that transmission among people was possible.
On 23 January, the city of Wuhan was confined, with all its public transport interrupted.
On 24 January, the first clinical study on the disease reported that 41 patients with only 21 confirmed cases had direct contact with the Wuhan Sea Fruit Market, which was considered the starting point of the contagion by an unknown animal source.
On 30 January, WHO declared the epidemic a global health emergency.
Until now, disease has already spread throughout China and almost 50 other countries around the world (Fig. (Fig.2).
As the situation gets worse quickly, the size and the final severity of the epidemic should still be determined.
On 11 February 2020, a study of several centres with 8,866 patients, including 4,021 patients confirmed with COVID-19, presented a more up-to-date picture of the epidemic, as follows (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bbbbdA).
SARS-CoV-2 infected people of all ages, mainly in the age range from 30 to 65 years.
Almost half (47.7%) of the patients were over 50 years of age, some were under 20 years old, and only 14 were under 10 years of age.
SARS-CoV-2 infected more men (0.31/100,000) than women (0.27/100,000).
COVID-19 was promoted in groups, mainly in Hubei and around it.
COVID-19 received an average of 5 days (2-9) for diagnosis based on the appearance of symptoms.
The mean incubation period was 4.8 (3.0 to 7.2) days.
The mean time of rest based on the appearance of symptoms was 9.5 (4.8-13 days).
The basic number of reproduction (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51 to 4.05), and the adjusted R0 was 2.23 to 4.82.
The number of people infected rose exponentially before 23 January 2020, corresponding to the time of mass transport before the spring festival in China.
The mortality of patients with confirmed cases was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10% to 1.86%), and the adjusted mortality of all patients was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02% to 4.59%).
The three main risk factors for COVID-19 are gender (male), age (more than 60 years old) and severe pneumonia.
CoVs are a subfamily of large and encapsulated viruses that contain a single chain of RNA in a certain sense.
They can be divided into four genes, namely: alpha, beta, gamma and delta, of which it is known that alphacoronovirus and betacoron virus infected human beings.
Glycoprotein spike (S) from the envelope connects to its cell receptors of angiotensin 2 converting enzyme (ECA2) and dipeptidil peptidase 4 (DPP4) for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV respectively, and subsequent membrane fusion occurs.
The viral RNA gene is released in cytoplasma; after replication of the viral gene, the genomatic RNA accompanied by capsulated glycoproteins and nucleocapside proteins form vesicles containing viruses, which bind to the plasma membrane and release the virus.
The first sequence of the SARS-CoV-2 gene was reported on 10 January 2020.
It was found that SARS-CoV-2 is a new type of beta-coronavirus with more than 99.98% genetic identity among 10 successive samples collected from the same place of origin from the South, the Huanan Sea Fruit Market, in Wuhan.
SARS-COV-2 is genetically more similar to SARS-COV than MERS-COV.
Through the electronic transmission microcopy, the particles of SARS-CoV-2 were discovered in ultrasound sections of the human airway epithelial.
Human ECA2 has been found to be a recipient for SARS-CoV-2, as well as SARS-CoV.
However, S protein S of SARS-CoV-2 binds to human protein ECA2 more weak than SARS-CoV protein, which corresponds to the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes a less serious infection in patients than SARS-CoV.
The SARS-CoV-2 can also form a new short protein coded by Orf3b and a secret protein coded by Orf8.
The ORS-CoV-2 Orf3b may perform a function in viral pathogenicity and inhibit the expression of IFNb; however, the Orf8 does not contain any known domain or functional reason.
On 18 February 2020 Zhou, et al., reported the ECA2 Cryo-EM structure of total human compression to the resolution of 2.9 Å in a complex with the B0AT1 amino acid carrier.
It was found that the complex, which had open and closed compliances, was grouped as a dam, and the ECA2-B0AT1 complex may combine two S proteins, which provides evidence for the recognition and infection by CoV.
B0AT1 may become a therapeutic target for the treatment of medicines to remove infection by SARS-CoV-2.
The host of origin and the intermediate
It is known that both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have originated from germs and have been transmitted to human beings through cevets and camels, respectively.
Through a phylogenetic comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with other CoVs, the rats were considered the native hosts of SARS-CoV-2, since the new virus is 96% identical to two CoVs of the SARS-SARs called bat-SL-CoVZX45 and bat-SL-CoVZX21.
However, the intermediate host who helped the virus cross the species barrier and infect human beings remains unknown, and the transmission route still needs to be discovered.
Ji, et al., suggests that the cobras carry the virus of the human beings, which involved a homologous combination in protein S.
According to a study, researchers in Guangzhou, China, suggested that pangolins, long-term follicular mammals that are fed from formulas and are often used in traditional Chinese medicine are the potential intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2 based on genetic homology of 99% between a coV discovered in pangolins and SARS-CoV-2.
However, a 1% difference in two genes is a major difference; therefore, final results for concrete evidence are expected (Fig. (Fig.33).
The physical-chemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are mostly unknown.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive in vitro for 48 hours in dry environment and up to 5 days below 20 °C with moisture from 40% to 50%.
The SARS-CoV-2 can have similar properties.
It was reported that SARS-CoV-2 is sensitive to ultraviolet rays and to 56 °C temperature for 30 minutes; e.g., ethanol 75%, chlorine disinfectant, peracetic acid, chloroformium and other organic solvents, but not chloride, are effective in disinfecting the virus.
In general, the entire human population has no immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and therefore is susceptible to the new virus.
Currently, no detailed study has been reported in relation to the immunological response to SARS-CoV-2.
Therefore, we can only look at previous studies on other CoVs, mainly on SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Fig. (Fig.4).
In general, after a virus invades the host, it is first recognised by the host's immune immune system by means of standard recognition recipients (PRRs), including C ectin receptors, Toll type receptor (TLR), NOD type receptor (NLR) and RIG-I type receptor (RLR).
Through different routes, the virus induces the expression of inflammatory factors, dendritic cell growth and the synthesis of Type I interferons (IFNs), which limit the spread of the virus and speed up the phagocytosis of macrophages in viral antigens.
However, SARS-CoV protein N can help the virus escape immune responses.
In a short time, the adaptive immune response joins in the fight against the virus.
T lymphocytes, including T CD4+ and CD8+ cells, play an important role in the defense.
T CD4+ cells stimulate B cells to produce virus-specific antibodies, and T CD8+ cells directly kill infected cells.
Collaborative T cells produce pro-inflammatory cytokines to help protect cells.
However, CV may inhibit T-cell functions by induceting the apoptosis of T-cells.
Humor immunity, including supplements such as C3a and C5a antibodies, is also essential for the fight against viral infection.
For example, isolated antibodies from a recovered patient neutralized MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, an exacerbated reaction of the immune system generates a large number of local free radicals that can cause serious damage to the lungs and other organs and, worse to the hypotheses, multiple failure of the organs, and even death.
The infection by SARS-CoV-2, characterized by the appearance of symptoms in a group of people, affects older people with pregnant relationships and pregnant women.
It is common that people exposed to a large number of viruses or whose immune system is compromised have a greater chance of being infected than others.
The estimated average incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 is from 1 to 14 days and, in most cases, from 3 to 7 days, based on a study of the first 425 cases in Wuhan.
However, a study of 1,099 cases showed that the incubation period was 3 days, on average, and varied from 0 to 24 days.
A more recent study, as described above, shows that the incubation period was 4.8 (3.0 to 7.2) days, based on the demographic of 8,866 cases.
It is essential that health authorities adjust the effective time of quarantine based on the most precise period of incubation, thus preventing infected persons who do not have symptoms from transmission the virus to other people.
As current practice, individuals exposed to or infected by the virus usually need to stay in quarantine for 14 days.
Should the quarantine period be extended for 24 days?
Fever is usually the primary and primary symptom of COVID-19, which can come alone or accompanied by other symptoms such as dry cough, lack of air, muscle pain, vomiting, headache, throat pain, chest pain, diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting.
Some patients had dyspnea and/or hypoxaemia a week after the symptoms of the disease appeared.
In serious cases, patients rapidly evolved for acute respiratory syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis and coagulopathy.
Patients with febrile and/or acute respiratory and febrile symptoms, even without abnormalities in the diagnosis by lung image, should undergo treatment for the virus in order to receive an early diagnosis.
A demographic study at the end of December 2019 showed that the percentages of symptoms were 98% for fever, 76% for dry tissue, 55% for dyspnea and 3% for diarrhoea; 8% of patients needed ventilator support.
Similar results were reported in two recent studies of a family group and a group with the transmission of an asymptomatic individual.
In comparison, a demographic study in 2012 showed that patients from MERS-CoV also had fever (98%), dry tones (47%) and dyspnea (55%) as main symptoms.
However, 80% of patients needed ventilator support, much more than COVID-19 patients, which consists of the highest mortality of MERS compared to COVID-19.
Diarrhoea (26%) and throat pain (21%) were also observed in patients with MERS.
In patients with SARS, it was demonstrated that fever (99% to 100%), dry cough (29% to 75%), dyspnea (40% to 42%), diarrhoea (20% to 25%) and throat pain (13% to 25%) were the main symptoms, and ventilator support was needed for approximately 14% to 20% of patients.
Until 14 February, the mortality of COVID-19 was 2% when the cases confirmed in the world reached 66,576.
Comparably, the mortality of SARS until November 2002 was 10% of the 8.096 confirmed cases.
For MERS, based on a June 2012 demographic study, mortality was 37% of the 2,494 confirmed cases.
A more recent study reported that the basic number of production R0 of SARS-CoV-2 was up to 6.47 with a confidence interval (IC) of 95%, 5.71 to 7.23 while the R0 of SARS-CoV ranged from 2 to 4.
A comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV in relation to its symptoms, mortality and R0 is presented in Table1.1.
The above figures suggest that SARS-CoV-2 has a higher propagation capacity than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but it is less lethal than the latter two.
Therefore, it is a much greater challenge to control SARS-CoV-2 epidemic than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
The appearance of symptoms in a group of people usually occurs in the same family or in the same agglomeration or vehicle as a cruiser ship.
Patients usually present history of travel or residence in Wuhan or other affected areas, or contact individuals or patients infected in the previous two weeks with symptoms.
However, it has been reported that people can carry the virus for more than two weeks without symptoms, and patients who receive high hospital attendance may again oppose the virus, which generates an alarm to prolong the quarantine time.
Patients have a normal or reduced number of white blood cells of peripheral blood (mainly lymphocytes) at the initial stage.
For example, lymphopenia with white blood cells count below 4 x 109/L including lymphocyte count less than 1 x 109/L, and high levels of aspartate aminotransferase and viremia were detected in 1,099 patients with COVID-19.
The levels of enzymes and myoglobins in the muscle and liver were increased in some patients' blood, and the C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation were increased in the blood of most patients.
In patients with severe cases, Dimero-D levels, a product of fibrin degradation present in the blood, were high, and lymphocyte count was progressive reduction.
abnormalities in torax radiographics are present in most patients with COVID-19 and present bilateral irregular shadows or cloud-glass opacity in the lungs.
Patients generally developed atypical pneumonia, acute pulmonary damage and acute respiratory discomfort syndrome (SDRA).
When SDRA occurs, uncontrolled inflammation, fluid accumulation and progressive fibrosis seriously weaken the gas exchange.
The dysfunction of type I and type II pneumoocytes decreases the surfactant level and increases surface tension, thus reducing the ability of the lungs to expand, and increasing the risk of pulmonary collapse.
Thus, the most serious results of torax radiation are usually the most serious form of the disease.
On 18 February 2020, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 demonstrated the decommissioning of pneumatics, the formation of hyalin membrane, interstitial lymphocytes and sinic cells in the lungs of a patient who died from the disease, consistent with pathology of viral infection and SDRA, and similar pathology of patients with SARS and MERS.
The detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA through the polymerase chain reaction – reverse transcriptase (RT-PCR) was used as the main criterion for the COVID-19 diagnosis.
However, due to the high rate of negative errors, which could accelerate the epidemic, clinical manifestations began to be used for diagnosis (which occurred not only from RT-PCR) in China on 13 February 2020.
A similar situation also occurred with SARS diagnosis.
Therefore, a combination of the history of disease, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests and radiological results is essential and indispensable to achieve an effective diagnosis.
On 14 February 2020, the group Feng Zhang described a protocol for use of the SHERLOCK technique, based on CRISPR, to detect SARS-CoV-2, which detects synthetic RNA fragments of SARS-CoV-2 in 20 x 10-18 mol/L to 200 x 10-18 mol/L (10 to 100 copies per input microlitre) using a measurement range of less than one hour, without the need for a complex instrumentation.
We hope that the new technique can dramatically increase sensitivity and convenience, if checked in clinical samples.
Due to the lack of experience with the new CoV, doctors may provide, at the best of their ability, palliative treatment for COVID-19 patients at the same time as trying a variety of treatments that were used or previously proposed for the treatment of other CoVs such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and other viral diseases (Table 2).
These treatments include current and potential treatments with antiviral drugs, immunosuppressants, steroids, plasma of treated patients, Chinese medicine and psychological support.
Even the plasma of patients who recovered was recommended as treatment.
The pharmaceutical companies are running out of time to develop antibodies and vaccines against the virus.
The SARS-CoV-2 mainly attacks lungs at the beginning and probably also attacks other organs with ECA2 expression, such as the gastrointestinal system and the kidneys.
However, respiratory dysfunction and organ failure are the main threats to patients and the main causes of death.
Therefore, respiratory support is essential to relieve symptoms and save lives, including general oxygenation therapy, high flow oxygenation, non-invasive ventilation and invasive mechanical ventilation, depending on the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms need to receive extracorporal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), an alternative alternative cardiopulmonary technique used for the treatment of severe heart failure or respiratory failure.
In addition, maintenance of electrolytic balance, prevention and treatment of secondary infections and septic shock, and the protection of the functions of vital organs are also essential for patients with SARS-CoV-2.
The cytokine cascade is known to result from the exacerbated reaction of the immune system in patients with SARS and MERS.
The cytokine cascade is a systemic inflammatory response form characterized by the release of a series of cytokines, including TNFα, IL-1b, IL-2, IL-6, IFNá, IFNb, IFNGg, and MCP-1.
These cytokines induce immune system cells to release a large number of free radicals, which are the main cause of SDRA and multiple failure of organs.
Immunosuppression is essential in the treatment of cytokine cascades, especially in severe patients.
Corticosteroids and tocilizumab, an anti-IL6 monoclonal antibodies, are being used to treat cytokine cascade.
Other immunosuppression treatments for cytokine cascade include modulation of the immune response to T cells; blocking of IFN-y, IL-1 and TNF; inhibiting JAK, blinatumomab; suppressor of cytokines 4 and HDAC inhibitors.
Steroids, such as immunosuppressors, were widely used in the treatment of SARS to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
However, high dose steroids were not beneficial for severe pulmonary injury in patients with SARS and COVID-19.
They can cause serious side effects, mainly avasculal osteonecrosis, affecting drastic or prognosis.
However, short-term treatment with corticosteroids at low to moderate doses was recommended for careful use in patients with COVID-19 severe patients.
At the time this article was written, no effective antiviral therapy was confirmed.
However, intravenous administration with remdesivir, a nucleotide analogue, was found to be effective in an American patient with COVID-19.
Remdesivir is a new antiviral drug developed by Gilead, initially intended for the treatment of diseases caused by Ebola and Marburg virus.
Subsequently, remdesivir also demonstrated a possible inhibition of other simple-fithal RNA viruses, including MERS and SARS viruses.
On this basis, Gilead provided the composition for China to perform some tests in individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2, and the results are very expected.
In addition, baricitinib, interferon a, lopinavir/ritonavir and ribavirin were suggested as potential therapy for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage and other adverse reactions may occur after combination therapy with lopinavir/ritonavir.
Interaction with other drugs used in patients should be monitored with caution.
Plasma of treated patients and generation of antibodies
The blood collection of patients who have been treated with a contagious disease to treat other patients suffering from the same disease or to protect healthy individuals from contracting the disease has a long history.
In fact, patients treated generally have a relatively high level of antibodies in blood against pathogen.
Antibodys are an immunoglobulin (lg) produced by B lymphocytes to fight pathogens and other foreign bodies, and they recognize unique molecules in pathogens and neutralise them directly.
Based on this, the plasma was collected from the blood of a group of patients treated with COVID-19 and was injected in 10 patients in severe condition.
Its symptoms improved within 24 hours, with reduced inflammation and viral load, and improved oxygen saturation in blood.
However, verification and elucidation are necessary in order to propose the use of the method on a large scale before the development of specific therapies.
In addition, given the therapeutic effects, some plasma-related disadvantages should be considered cautiously.
For example, antibodies may overstimulate immune response and cause cytokine release syndrome, which is potentially fatal toxicity.
Concentration of antibodies in blood is generally low, and plasma demand is great to treat patients in severe condition.
It is difficult to develop and produce specific antibodies with sufficient speed to combat an epidemic of global proportion.
Therefore, it is more important and practical to isolate B cells from treated patients and identify genetic codes that code effective antibodies or make a choice for effective antibodies against essential proteins of the virus.
In this way, we can rapidly increase the production of antibodies.
Chinese Traditional Medicine, MTC, has been used thousands of years ago to treat a variety of diseases in China.
However, its effects depend heavily on a combination of multiple components in a formula that varies depending on the diagnosis of a disease based on MTC theories.
Most effective components remain unknown, or are empty, since it is difficult to extract and verify these components or their best combinations.
Currently, due to the lack of specific and effective treatment for COVID-19, MTC has become one of the main alternative treatments for patients with moderate or moderate symptoms, or for patients who have recovered from serious stages of the disease.
For example, it was found that Su Feng Jie Du and Lian Hua Qing Wen capsules are effective in the treatment of COVID-19.
The best treatment rates for patients with COVID-19 were observed in several provinces in China who used MTC in 87% of patients including Gansu (63.7%), Ningxia (50%) and Hunan (50%), while the Province of Hubei, which used MTC only 30% of patients with COVID-19, received the lowest treatment rate (13%).
However, this is a difficult comparison, since many impact factors, such as the number of patients and the severity of the disease, should be included in the evaluation.
On February 18, 2020, Boli Zhang and colleagues published a comparative study between the exclusive treatment with Western medicine and the combined treatment of Western medicine with MTC.
It was found that the times necessary for the recovery of body temperature, for the disappearance of symptoms and hospitalization were significantly lower in the group treated with Western medicine and MTC than in the group treated with Western medicine only.
The lower rate of symptoms (from brands to severe) was significantly lower for the group treated with Western medicine and MTC than for the group treated only with Western medicine (7.4% versus 46.2%), and mortality was lower in the group treated with Western medicine and MTC than in the group treated only with Western medicine (8.8% versus 39%).
However, the effectiveness and safety of the MTC still await more duly controlled tests on larger and more central scales.
It would also be useful to characterise the mechanisms of action and explain the effective components of MTC treatments or their combinations, if possible.
Patients confirmed with COVID-19 or suspected of disease generally feel a great fear of highly contagious disease and can be fatal, and people in quarantine also feel understandable, lonely and irritable.
In addition, the symptoms of infection, such as fever, hypoxia and cough, as well as the adverse effects of treatments, such as corticosteroids, may increase anxiety and psychological suffering.
In the initial phase of the SARS epidemic, several psychiatric morbidities, including persistent depression, anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotor excitement, psychosis symptoms, delirium and even suicide trends were reported.
The tracking of contact and mandatory quarantine, as part of the public health system action against the COVID-19 epidemic, may become the most anxious people, and they may feel guilty about the effects of the contagion, the quarantine, and the stigma imposed on their families and friends.
Therefore, mental health care should be provided to patients with COVID-19, to persons suspected of disease and to those who had contacted them, as well as to the general population, who need it.
Psychological support should include the establishment of multidisciplinary mental health teams, clear communication with regular and precise updates on the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic and on treatment plans, and the use of professional electronic devices and applications to avoid direct contact between people.
Effective vaccines are essential to interrupt the transmission chain of animal reserves and people infected for subsequent hosts, and are usually complementary to antiviral treatment in the control of outbreaks caused by emerging viruses.
Initiatives were taken to develop vaccines based on protein S to generate powerful and durable neutralising antibodies and/or protective immunity against SARS-CoV.
Vaccines were evaluated in animal models for SARS.
However, the in vivo efficacy of these vaccine candidates in older subjects and their lethal challenge models and their protection against zoonotic virus infection still need to be determined before the start of a clinical study.
This is probably due to the fact that SARS has disappeared 17 years ago and no new case has been reported since then.
On the other hand, sporadic cases and focussing on MERS continue to take place in the Middle East and spread to other regions, due to the persistence of zoonotic sources in endemic areas.
Vaccination strategies have been developed for MERS using non-inactive viruses, DNA plasmas, viral vectors, nanoparticulars, particles similar to recombinant viruses and protein subunits, and some have been evaluated in animal models.
The development of a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 for non-immunised individuals is an urgent and essential task for the control of the current epidemic.
However, it is a challenge to overcome the difficulty due to the long period (18 months, on average) necessary for the development of a vaccine and changes in the dynamics of the CoVs.
As a new disease, COVID-19 has just begun to manifest its complete clinical development, reaching thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients recovered gradually without symptoms.
However, in the same way as SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also associated with high morbidity and mortality in patients with severe cases.
Therefore, building a prognosis model for disease is essential for health agencies to give priority to their services, especially in areas where there is a shortage of resources.
Based on the clinical studies reported up to now, the following factors may affect or be associated with COVID-19 prognosis (Table 33):
Age: age was the most important factor for the SARS forecast, which is also valid for COVID-19.
COVID-19 mainly affects people between 30 and 65 years of age, with 47.7% of patients over 50 years of age, in a study of 8,866 cases, as described above.
Patients who needed intensive treatment had greater opportunities to present underlying comorbidities and complications, and were significantly older than patients who did not need intensive treatment (with an average age of 66 years versus 51 years), suggesting that age is a prognosis factor for the health outcome of patients with COVID-19.
Gender: SARS-CoV-2 infected more men than women (0.31/100 000 men and 0.27/100 000 women), as described above.
Comorbidities and complications: patients with COVID-19 who need intensive treatment are more likely to suffer from acute heart injury or arrhythmia.
Cardiac episodes were the main cause of death in patients with SARS.
It was reported that SARS-CoV-2 may also combine positive ECA2 collaocytes, which may lead to hepatic dysfunction in patients with COVID-19.
It is important to note that age and underlying diseases have a strong correlation and may interfere with one another.
abnormal laboratory results: the level of C-reactive protein (CRP) in blood reflects the severity of inflammation or tissue injury and was proposed as a potential prognosis factor for the disease, response to treatment and final recovery.
The correlation of the CRP level with the severity and predictive of COVID-19 was also proposed.
In addition, lactate hydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and elevated creatinine quinase (CK) may also help in predicting the outcome.
These enzymes are expressly present in several organs, mainly in the heart and liver, and are released during the injury to tissue.
Therefore, they are traditional markers for cardiac or hepatic dysfunction.
Main clinical symptoms: the radiation of torax and the temporary progression of clinical symptoms should be considered together with other questions for predicting COVID-19 outcomes/complications.
Use of steroids: as described above, steroids are usually used as immunosuppressors as an additional therapy for infectious diseases to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
Given that a high dose of corticosteroids was widely used in patients with severe SARS, many survivors suffered from vascular osteoencrosis, with permanent incapacity and low quality of life.
Therefore, if necessary, steroids should be used in a low dose and for a short period in patients with COVID-19.
Psychological stress: as described above, during the COVID-19 epidemic, many patients experience high stress, since they spend long periods of quarantine and uncertainty, and witness the death of loved family members and other patients.
It is essential to provide psychological advice and sustained support to help these patients recover from stress and regain normal life.
According to demographic studies so far, COVID-19 appears to have different epidemiological characteristics than SARS characteristics.
In addition to repeating in lower respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 is able to react efficiently to higher respiratory treatment and does not cause symptoms in the initial phase of infection (or cause only mild symptoms), similar to other CoVs that cause common colds.
Therefore, patients infected at the initial stage or during the incubation period may produce a large amount of virus during their daily activities, causing a great deal of difficulty in controlling the epidemic.
However, it was considered that SARS-CoV transmission occurs when patients are seriously ill, with most of the transmissions not occurring in the initial phase.
Therefore, the current epidemic of COVID-19 is much more serious and difficult to control than the epidemic of SARS.
Great efforts are being made in China today, including the bordering of Wuhan and neighboring cities, and the continued quarantine of almost all the population, in the hope of interrupting the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Although these actions have had a dramatic impact on the economy and other sectors of the country, the number of new patients is decreasing, indicating the remission of the epidemic.
The most optimistic estimate is that the epidemic is over by March, and the phase of deceleration lasts between 3 and 4 months.
However, other specialists are not so optimistic.
Paul Hunter, et al., believed that COVID-19, which seems to be substantially more infectious than SARS, will not end in 2020.
Ira Longini, et al., established a model to predict the outcome of the epidemic and suggested that SARS-CoV-2 could infection two thirds of the world's population.
A group of Canadians reported that SARS-CoV-2 was detected in the throats of the throat and middle arm of patients who recovered and received a high hospital in the previous 2 weeks, indicating that the new identified virus could become a cyclic episode similar to the influence.
However, promising indicators took place in China on the basis of the decline in the number of new cases, indicating that current strategies could be working.
It was originally expected that Ebola would cause up to one million cases, with half a million deaths.
However, with the quarantine and strict isolation, the disease was maintained under control at the end.
It is possible that SARS-CoV-2, in the same way as SARS-CoV, may become weaker than its infectiveness and, at some point, becomes a less pathogenic virus consistent with human beings.
A comparison of the COVID-19 epidemic with the SARS and the MERS is found below (Fig. (Fig.55).
SARS-CoV-2 is highly transmitted by toss and breath and possibly by direct contact with substances contaminated by the virus.
The virus was also found in faeces, which creates a new possibility: oral-fetal transmission.
A recent 138 case study reported that 41% of cases were possibly caused by non-economic infections, including 17 patients with underlying diseases and 40 health professionals.
Therefore, greater care must be taken to protect people, especially health professionals, social workers, family members, colleagues and people with direct contact with patients or individuals infected.
The first line of defense that can be used to reduce the risk of infection is the use of facial masks; the use of surgical masks and respiratory masks N95 (series No. 1860s) helps control the spread of the virus.
surgical facial masks prevent fluids from being transported into the air or attached to the surfaces of the objects, where other persons may be infected.
However, only the N95 masks (series No. 1860s) protect against inhalation of viruses of 10 nm to 80 nm, with only 5% of viruses being able to penetrate it completely; SARS-CoV-2 is similar to SARS-CoV size, and both have approximately 85 nm.
Since particles can enter up to five combined surgical masks, healthcare professionals in direct contact with patients should use N95 masks (series No. 1860s), but not surgical masks.
In addition to masks, health professionals should use insulation routes to further reduce contact with the virus.
The viruses also infected an individual through the eyes.
On January 22, 2020, a doctor was infected by SARS-CoV-2, although he was using a N95 mask; the virus could have entered his body through his eyes.
Health professionals should therefore also use transparent facial protection or protective glasses when dealing with patients.
For the public in general in affected or potentially affected areas, it is highly recommended that all wash their hands with disinfectant soap more often than normal, try to stay home in isolation and limit contact with potentially infected people.
A metre is considered an adequate distance to stay away from a patient.
These actions are effective methods to reduce the risk of infection, as well as to prevent the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 has emerged as a new virus for human beings, its high approval for SARS-CoV, as reported on 7 January 2020, should have caused a great warning for China, based on its recent history with the SARS epidemic in 2003.
However, only on 19 January 2020, the director of the Wuhan Disease Control Centre calmed down the citizens, saying that the new virus has a low rate of contagion and limited reproduction among humans, and that it was not difficult to prevent and contain disease.
This message left the most relaxed people, especially when the whole country was preparing for the Spring Festival, and the critical period for the disease in Wuhan on a minimum scale was lost.
Disease control agencies in China can benefit from this hard lesson and make crucial improvements in the future.
For example, these agencies should: (1) be more careful when making public statements, since everything they say is absorbed by citizens and can influence their attitudes and decisions; (2) be more sensitive and responsive to the inconsistencies from hospitals, rather than waiting for formal communications from doctors and authorities; (3) be more restrictive to contain a potential epidemic at its initial stage instead of trying to strengthen the public; and (4) to issue more often effective targeted simulations to increase public awareness of epidemic diseases and to test and improve the social response system regularly.
The COVID-19 epidemic caused by the new SARS-CoV-2 virus began at the end of December 2019.
In less than two months, it spread across China and almost 50 other countries around the world at the time of writing of this text.
Since the virus is very similar to SARS-CoV, and the symptoms are also similar between COVID-19 and SARS, the COVID-19 epidemic caused a return sensation of SARS.
However, there are significant differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are essential for the containment of the epidemic and the treatment of patients.
COVID-19 affects older than young people, and men more than women, and pregnancy and mortality rates are also higher in older than in young people.
SARS has a higher mortality than COVID-19 (10.91% versus 1.44%).
Patients with COVID-19 transmit the virus when they do not have symptoms, while patients with SARS usually transmit it when they are seriously ill, which leads to a greater difficulty in containing COVID-19 than SARS.
This explains in part because SARS-CoV-2 is spreading much faster and affects regions more than SARS-CoV.
The regular RNA test for SARS-CoV-2 may be negative in some patients with COVID-19.
On the other hand, treated patients may receive a positive test for the virus again.
These results dramatically increase the risk of spreading the virus.
Given the rapid progress in the COVID-19 research, several critical issues still need to be resolved, as follows:
Where did the SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although a 96% genetic homologist has been found between SARS-CoV-2 and two CoVs of sardines similar to SARS, we cannot yet conclude that SARS-CoV-2 has origin in the sardines.
What animal was the intermediate species that transmitted the virus from the original host, from the womb, say, to humans?
Without knowing the answers to questions Nos 1 and 2, we cannot cut transmission efficiently, and the epidemic may have a recurrence at any time.
Although molecular modelling and biochemical tests have shown that SARS-CoV-2 binds to ECA2, how exactly does the virus enter into the cells of the respiratory tract and causes subsequent pathological changes?
Is the virus also linked to ECA2-expression cells in other organs?
Without clear answers to these questions, we cannot get a quick and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will the epidemic last?
How is the virus genetically evolving during the transmission of human beings?
She'll become a global pandemic, disappear like SARS or have seasonal relapses, like flu?
It is essential, but it may take some time to find answers to the above questions and to so many others.
However, regardless of the effort required, we have no choice to stop the epidemic as soon as possible and return to our normal lives.
Zonotoxic origins of human coronavirus
The mutation and adaptation prompted the evolution of coronavirus (CoVs) and its hosts, including human beings, for thousands of years.
Before 2003, it was known that two human coVs (HCoVs) caused a brand disease such as a common cold.
The epidemics of severe respiratory syndrome (SARS) and of the respiratory syndrome in the Middle East (MERS) changed what was thought about the CoVs and revealed how lethal and devastating HCoV infection could be.
The rise of SARS-CoV-2 in central China at the end of 2019 highlighted the COVS again and surprised everyone with their high transmissibility and reduced pathogenicity compared to their brother SARS-CoV.
HCoV infection is zoonotic, and understanding the zoonotic origins of HCoVs is enormously useful.
Most of HCoVs originate from rats in which they are not pathogenic.
The intermediate booking hosts of some HCoVs are also known.
The identification of animal hosts has direct implications for the prevention of diseases in human beings.
The investigation of CV host interactions in animals can also provide important information on the pathogenicity of CV in human beings.
In this study, we present a general view of the information available on the seven HCoVs, with a focus on the history of their discovery, as well as their zoonotic origins and interesting transmission.
An important analysis is that we make comparison and contrast between different HCoVs of a perspective on the evolution of the virus and the recombination of the gene.
The current disease epidemic by CoV 2019 (COVID-19) is discussed in this context.
In addition, the requirements for effective transition between patients and the implications of the virus's evolution into the severity of the disease are also highlighted.
Coronaviruses (CoVs) belong to the Coronaviridae family, which includes a group of encapsulated viruses, positive polarity and simple fine-grained RNA.
These viruses that present the largest gene, between 26 and 32 kilobasses, between RNA viruses were called "CoVs" because of their cornology when observed in electronic microscope.
As far as the structure is concerned, the CoVs have unsembled genes that share a similar organisation.
About two thirds of the genome contains two open reading structures (ORF1a and ORF1b), which are translated into polyproteins of replication pp1a and pp1ab.
Polyproteins are transformed again and generate 16 non-structural proteins, designated nsp1 to nsp16.
The remaining portion of the gene contains ORFs for structural proteins, including spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleoprotein (N).
Some specific line accessory proteins are also encoded by different CoV lines.
Based on the difference in the protein sequences, the CoVs are classified in four genes (alphaCoV, betaCoV, gammaCoV and deltaCoV), among which the betaCoV gender contains most of the HCoVs and is subdivided into four lines (A, B, C and D).
Phylogenetic evidence showed that mammals and rodents serve as genetic sources for most of the alphaCoVs and betaCoVs, while birds are the main reserve of gammaCoVs and deltaCoVs.
For thousands of years, the CoVs have constantly crossed species barriers, and some have become relevant human pathogens.
To date, seven human CoVs (HCoVs) are known.
Among them, HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 are alphaCoVs.
The other five betaCoVs include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, severe respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV), central respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2.
HCOV-229E, HCOV-OC43, HCOV-HKU1 and HCOV-NL63 viruses usually cause mild symptoms such as common and/or diarrhoea.
In contrast, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and recently identified SARS-CoV-2 are highly pathogenic and cause serious respiratory tract infection lower in a relatively higher number of patients, with a high chance of developing acute respiratory discomfort syndrome (SDRA) and extrapulmonary manifestations.
The first strain of HCov-229E, B814, was isolated from the heart of patients with common cooling in the mid- 1960s.
Since then, more knowledge has been accumulated through extensive studies on HCOV-229E and HCV-OC43, with both causing auto-limiting symptoms.
In fact, the concept that HCV infection is generally harmless was widely accepted to the epidemic of SARS.
The SARS epidemic that occurred in 2003 is one of the most devastating of the current and infected more than 8,000 people, with a gross mortality rate related to confirmed cases of approximately 10%.
Ten years later, the epidemic of the respiratory syndrome in the Middle East (MERS) resulted in a persistent epidemic in the Arabian Peninsula, with sporadic propaganda for the rest of the world.
The new HCOV of 2019 (2019-nCoV), which was subsequently named SARS-CoV-2, is the agent responsible for the current epidemic of the 2019 Coronavirus disease (COVID-19), which took more than 3.120 lives and infected more than 91,000 people until 3 March 2020.
The alarm is sound, and the world needs to prepare for the Sars-CoV-2 pandemic that is coming.
All seven HCoVs have zoonotic origin in domestic mammals, changendongs or animals.
Several lines of evidence correlate with the evolutionary origin of all HCoVs from germs, where viruses are well adapted and not pathogenic, but demonstrate great genetic diversity.
The COVID-19 epidemic presents huge medical, scientific, social and moral challenges for China and for the rest of the world.
The tracking of the zoological origins of HCoVs provides a structure to understand the natural history, the incentive force and the restrictive factors of the migration of the virus to other species.
This can also guide and facilitate the search by the reserve host, intermediate and amplifier of SARS-CoV-2, with important implications for the future prevention of viral migration between species.
In this article, we present a general view of the zoonotic origins, the interesting transmission and pathogenicity of HCoVs.
In particular, we highlighted and discussed the common theme that HCV parental viruses are usually not pathogenic in their natural reserves, but they become pathogens after the relevant transmission to a new host.
We have also reviewed the trend of HCV evolution, in which increased transmissibility is usually accompanied by a reduction in pathogenicity.
The outcome of the current SARS-CoV-2 epidemic is also discussed in this context.
Animal CoVs have been known since the end of the 1930s.
Prior to the first insulation of HCov-229E strain B814 from the heart of patients who contravenes common cold, different CoVs were isolated in several infected animals, including peru, camundonggo, cow, pig, cat and dog.
In recent decades, seven HCoVs have been identified.
A brief summary of the history of HCOV discovery in chronological order (Table 1) would be informative and informative.
The first HCoV-229E strain was isolated from respiratory treatment of patients with higher respiratory tract infection in 1966, and was subsequently adapted to growth in lung cell lines WI-38.
Patients infected with HCov-229E had common cold symptoms, including headache, breath, malaise and throat pain, with fever and cough present in 10% to 20% of the cases.
Later, in 1967, HCoV-OC43 was isolated from the culture of organs and subsequent serial passage in condominants' brains during lactating.
The clinical characteristics of HCoV-OC43 infection appear to be similar to those caused by HCoV-229E, which are symptomaticly different from the infection by other pathogens of respiratory tract, such as influenza A and rhinovirus.
HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are distributed globally, and they tend to be transmitted predominantly during the winter season in temperatures.
In general, the duration of incubation of these two viruses is less than one week, accompanied by the disease for about 2 weeks.
According to a study with human volunteers, healthy individuals infected by HCoV-229E developed a common cold brand.
Only some immunocompromised patients have experienced severe lower respiratory tract infection.
SARS, also known as "atypical pneumonia", was the first documented pandemic caused by HCoV in human history, and the etiological agent is SARS-CoV, the third discovered HCoV.
The first case of SARS goes back to 2002 in GuangDong Province, China.
The SARS epidemic resulted in 8,096 cases reported with 774 deaths, spreading across several countries and continents.
With the exception of "survivors", it was estimated that each contaminated person may be contaminated about two others, with an incubation period of 4 to 7 days, and with the appearance of the viral load on the tenth day of the disease.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV are initially exposed to mialgia, headache, fever, malaise and calaphrias followed by subsequent symptoms of dyspnea, cough and respiratory discomfort.
Lyphopenia, hepatic dysfunction and elevated creatinine quinase are the common abnormalities of SARS in laboratory tests.
Widespread alveolar damage, spread of epithelial cells and increase in the number of macrophages are also observed in patients with SARS.
About 20% to 30% of patients require, at some point, intensive treatment and mechanical ventilation.
In addition to lower respiratory treatment, several organs, including gastrointestinal treatment, liver and kidneys, may also be affected in these serious cases, usually with the occurrence of a cytokine cascade, which may be fatal, mainly in immunocompromised patients.
The virus was first isolated in a lung biopsy from a parent of a zero patient traveling from Guangzhou to Hong Kong.
Since then, enormous efforts have been devoted to research on HCoV.
HCOV-NL63 was isolated from a 7-month-old baby in the Netherlands at the end of 2004.
It was initially discovered that the virus was prevalent in small, elderly children and immunocompromised patients with respiratory diseases.
The symptoms of heart, conjunctivitis, fever and bronquiolitis are common in the disease caused by HCoV-NL63.
Another independent study described the isolation of the same virus of a nasal species of an 8-month-old baby suffering from pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although it has been identified in the Netherlands, it is spread around the world.
HCOV-NL63 was estimated to be approximately 4.7% of the common respiratory diseases, and its incidence of pico occurs in winter, spring and early summer.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with obstructive larynx, also known as crupe.
In the same year, HCOV-HKU1 was isolated from a 71-year-old man who was hospitalized with pneumonia and bronquiolitis in Hong Kong.
In addition to the pneumonia and bronquiolity acquired Communityly, HCOV-HKU1 was reported to be associated with exacerbation of acute asthma.
In the same way that HCOV-NL63, HCOV-229E and HCV-OC43, HCV-HKU1 was found around the world, causing acute respiratory diseases.
All these four HCoVs acquired Communityly adapted to human beings and are generally less likely to suffer from mutations and cause highly pathogenic diseases, although accidents have occurred for unknown reasons in the rare case of a more viral subtype of HCoV-NL63, which has recently been reported as a cause of severe respiratory infection of the lower respiratory tract in China.
In general, when these HCoVs acquire the ability to be effectively transmitted and to remain in human beings, they also become less virulent and less pathogenic.
The MERS-CoV was first isolated in 2012 from the lung of a 60-year-old patient who developed acute pneumonia and renal failure in Saudi Arabia.
While most of the cases confirmed by the laboratory are originating in the Middle East, cases imported with occasional secondary propaganda for close contact were reported in several European and Tunisian countries.
Another secondary epidemic occurred in South Korea in 2015 with 186 confirmed cases.
The clinical manifestations of MERS are similar to those of SARS, characterized by progressive acute pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many patients with MERS also develop acute renal failure, which is therefore very peculiar to MERS, among the diseases caused by HCOV.
More than 30% of patients have gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhoea and vomiting.
Up to 14 February 2020, more than 2,500 cases confirmed by the laboratory were reported with a high mortality rate related to confirmed cases of 34.4%, which turned MSRS-CoV one of the most devastating viruses known to man.
From mid-December 2019, groups of patients with pneumonia, who were known to be retrospectively associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, were detected in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
The World Health Organization declared the continued epidemic of lower respiratory tract infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 a Emergency Public Health of International Importance and also designated COVID-19.
Until 3 March 2020, 90.053 cases were confirmed in the world, with a gross mortality rate related to confirmed cases of 3.4%.
It is noted that the fatality related to confirmed cases in Hubei, China, is 4.2%, while the fatality outside this city is 1.2%.
SARS-CoV-2 causes severe respiratory infection, as well as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, with the presence of fever, cough and dyspnea.
Some patients also have diarrhoea.
The pneumonia is one of the most serious symptoms and can rapidly evolve to the syndrome of acute respiratory discomfort.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are very similar due to high level approval of 82% in the nucleotide sequence, they are grouped into different branches in the phylogenetic tree.
The SARS-CoV-2 appears to be less pathogenic, but it is more transmissible than the SARS-CoV and the MERS-CoV.
Asymptomatic individuals infected by SARS-CoV-2 have been reported, and they can contribute to the rapid spread of the virus in the world.
The comparison and contrast of SARS-CoV-2 with the other six HCoVs reveal similarities and differences of great relevance.
Firstly, the period of incubation and the duration of the evolution of HCV disease are very similar.
In this sense, SARS-CoV-2 follows the general trend of the other six HCoVs.
Second, the severity of COVID-19 symptoms is between the severity of SARS-CoV and the severity of the four HCoVs acquired Communityly (HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
On the one hand, the infection by SARS-CoV-2 presents characteristics that are more observed during the infection with HCoVs purchased in a Community way, including the presence of non-specific symptoms, brands or even the absence of symptoms.
On the other hand, a small subgroup of serious cases of COVID-19 may also be observed, as in the case of SARS-CoV infection, although the proportion is slightly smaller.
Thirdly, the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 also shows interesting standards, both in HCoVs purchased in a Community way and in SARS-CoV.
On the one hand, the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 is, at least, as high as those of HCoVs acquired in the community.
On the other hand, it should be confirmed whether the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 decreases after passing to human beings, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Finally, in the same way that the other HCoVs, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in fecal samples.
It still needs to be clarified in future studies if the golden-fetal transmission of SARS-CoV-2 plays an important role, such as in the case of SARS-CoV, at least in some circumstances.
It is also of great interest to find out whether SARS-CoV-2 can show seasonality, as in the case of HCoVs purchased in a Community way.
In any case, the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, including its transmissibility, pathogenicity and sustainable spread after its transition to human beings, will influence the outcome of the current COVID-19 epidemic.
All HCoVs acquired in a Community way that causes brandy symptoms have adapted well to human beings.
In another perspective, it can also be true that human beings have adapted well to these four HCoVs.
In other words, the two could be the survivors of old HCoV pandemics.
HCoVs that cause serious human diseases and people who develop serious HCoVs have been eliminated.
In order for this to happen, HCVs need to repeat themselves in human beings to a sufficient extent in order to allow the accumulation of adaptive mutations that neutralise the constraints.
In this sense, the more time remains for the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic, the more people will be infected, and the more likely that the virus adapts to human beings.
If adaptation is appropriate, its transmission to human beings would be difficult to control with quarantine or other infection control measures.
Several years ago, the four CoVs acquired Communityly circle around the human population, causing common cold in immunocompetent individuals.
These viruses don't need an animal reserve.
In contrast, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, highly pathogenic, have not adapted well to human beings, and their transmission between human beings cannot be supported.
They need to keep and spread in their zoos and take advantage of the opportunity to migrate to susceptible human destinations, possibly through one or more intermediate and amplifying hosts.
The SARS-CoV-2 has characteristics similar to the SARS-CoV, the MERS-CoV and the four HCoVs purchased in a Community way.
It is highly portable, in the same way that HCoVs acquired in a Community way, at least until now.
However, it is more pathogenic than HCoVs purchased in a Community way and less pathogenic than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
It still needs to be discovered if it will be fully adapted to human beings and will circle between us without a reserve animal or intermediate host.
Before discussing the animal origins of HCoVs, it would be useful to discuss the definitions and characteristics of the evolutionary, natural, reserves, intermediate and amplifiers of HCoVs.
An animal serves as the evolutionary host of a HCoV if it covers a direct relational antestrall, contributing high homology to the level of the nucleotide sequence.
Antistral virus is usually well adapted and not pathogenic in this host.
Similarly, a reservation host covers HCOV continuously and permanently.
In both cases, hosts are naturally infected and are the natural hosts of HCV or their parental virus.
In contrast, if HCOV is recently inserted into an intermediate host shortly before or near its introduction to human beings, it does not fit properly to the new host, and is usually pathogenic.
This intermediate host can serve as the zoological source of human infection and perform the function of an amplifier host, allowing the virus to respond in a transparent manner and then transmit it to humans and increase the scale of human infection.
A HCOV may have the infection interrupted if it is unable to sustain its transmission to the intermediate host.
In contrast, HCoVs can also be adapted to the intermediate host and establish long-term endemicness.
In this case, the intermediate host becomes the natural reserve host.
Epidemiological data revealed that the SARS zero patient had a history of contact with dogs.
Further studies of soroprevalence indicated that animal traders had a higher prevalence of IgG antiSARS-CoV compared to the general population.
Mascarata palmcives (Larvata Pagoma) and a dog-guaximin in live animals markets were initially identified as carrying viruses similar to SARS-CoV.
The identification was confirmed indirectly by the fact that no other SARS was notified after the fall of all citizens in the markets.
However, it was reported that forest or wild palm habitats without exposure to live animals markets were highly negative for SARS-CoV, suggesting that Mascarad palm habitats could only be the amplifier intermediate host, but not the SARS-CoV natural reserve.
It is noted that 80% of the different animals on the market in Guangzhou have anti-SARS-CoV antibodies; the possibility that several small mammals may serve as amplifier intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV cannot be excluded.
All these animals seem to be terminal strangers to SARS-CoV.
The subsequent search by SARS-CoV's natural animal host revealed a CoV of close-relationary relationship, called CoV HKU3 of Rhinolophus-related Sars (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3), which exists in the Chinese ferret.
These germs are positive for anti-SARS-CoV antibodies and for the genetic sequence of SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3.
This and other coVs of fungi share 88% to 92% of approval with SARS-CoV in the nucleotide sequence.
These studies provided the basis for the new concept that infants are the host of emerging human pathogens.
Several CoVs similar to SARS (SL-CoVs) were also identified in rats, but no CoV, with the exception of the named WIV1, may be isolated as live virus.
Angiotensin 2 (ECA2) transverse enzyme of human beings is known to be the SARS-CoV receptor.
It has been demonstrated that the WIV1 derived from fecal samples of rats uses ECA2 of mice, cevets and human beings as receptor for entry into the cells.
It is shocking that the sarcoidosis of patients with SARS was able to neutralise HIV1.
So far, the WIV1 represents the antistral with closer relation to SARS-CoV in mice, sharing 95% of homology in the nucleotide sequence.
Despite the high homology between these two viruses, it is generally believed that the WIV1 is not the immediate parental virus of SARS-CoV and that the rats are not the immediate reserve hosts of SARS-CoV.
The phylogenetic analysis groupes the MERS-CoV in the same group as the CV-HKU4 of rats and the CV-HKU5 of rats.
CoV-HKU4 and MERS-CoV use the same host recipient, dipeptidil-pepidase 4 (DPP4) for the virus entry.
Polymerase sequences of RNA-dependent MERS-CoV RNAs are phylogenetically closer to betaCoVs homologists identified in Europe and Africa.
So far, no live MERS-CoV has been found in wild pigs.
The MERS-CoV and its closest relative, the CoV-HKU25 of the rats, only 87% of the homologies share in the nucleotide sequence.
Therefore, the pigs may not be the immediate reservation host of the MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East have shown that drummers are soropistic for specific neutralisation antibodies of MERS-CoV, the same as Middle East cameras in several African countries.
The live MERS-CoV, identical to the virus found in human beings, was isolated from the nasal
It is also worth noting that the symptoms are usually brandished, but with massive transmission of the virus, were observed in experimentally infected cameras with MERS-CoV.
It is remarkable that infected cameras transmit viruses not only by respiratory route, but also by the fecal-oral route, which is also the main path of virus transmission in mice.
However, there are still no answers, since many confirmed cases of MERS do not have a history of contact with cameras prior to the appearance of symptoms, which can be subsequently attributed to transmission between persons or route of transmission involving unidentified animal species covering MERS-CoV.
The SARS-CoV-2 shares 96.2% of nucleotide homology with a CoV RatG13 of morcego, isolated from Rhinolophus amphines.
As in the case of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the difference in the sequence between SARS-CoV-2 and RatG13 is very large to assign a parental relationship.
In other words, the ants may not be the immediate reserve hosts of SARS-CoV-2, unless CoVs are almost identical to the ants are discovered in the future.
It is assumed that the intermediate animal hosts of SARS-CoV-2 should be set up among wild species sold and slaughtered in the Huanan Sea Fruit Attack Market, many of which were associated with the initial cases of COVID-19, indicating a likely animal transmission event to human beings.
Several recent studies based on metagenomic sequencing suggested that a group of small endangered mammals known as pangolins (Javanica Manis) could also cover betaCoVs anti-SARS-CoV-2.
These new pangolim CoV genes share 85% to 92% of homology in the nucleotide sequence with SARS-CoV-2.
However, they are also, in the same way, directly related to RatG13, with about 90% of the identity of the nucleotide sequence level.
They are grouped into sublingual viruses similar to SARS-CoV-2 in the phylogenetic tree, one of which shares an area of link to the receptor (DLR) with SARS-CoV-2, with 97.4% identity in the amino acid sequence.
In a huge contrast, SARS-CoV-2 and RTG13 DDRs are more divergent, although they present a high degree of sequential approval throughout the genome.
A recent study on pangolins also reported finding viral consensus sequences of lung samples, which are closely related to SARS-CoV-2.
This study adopted different configuration and manual curatorial methods to generate a partial genomic sequence, corresponding to about 86.3% of the viral gene in total size.
We cannot exclude the possibility that the pangolim is one of the intermediate animal hosts of SARS-CoV-2.
However, there is currently no evidence to confirm the direct origin of the SARS-CoV-2 of the pangolim due to the difference in the sequence between the SARS-CoV-2 and the betaCoVs related to the SARS-CoV-2 of the pangolins.
Furthermore, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RTG13 is even smaller than the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and betaCoVs related to SARS-CoV-2 of the pangolins.
The evolutional path of SARS-CoV-2 in mice, pangolins and other mammals still needs to be clarified.
While higher sequential homology was found in DLRs between SARS-CoV-2 and Pangolim, betaCoVs related to SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-2 and RatG13 share the higher genomic sequential homology.
It is highly speculative that the high degree of similarity between the betaCoVs DLRs of pangolins related to SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 is derived from the convergence evolution mediated by selectivity.
A contrary argument relates to the combination between betaCoV of pangolins related to SARS-CoV-2 and RTG13 in the third wild animal species.
As an incentive force in evolution, the recombination is quite present in betaCoVs.
The immediate zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2 remains in research.
In addition to highly pathogenic HCoVs, the zoonotic origin of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 virus was also studied.
Phylogenetic evidence indicated that both HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E could have originated from CVs of rats, while the parent viruses of HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 were detected in rats.
It was reported that an ARCoV-Aparalachian Ridge CoV detected in the North American tricolor was directly related to HCoV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E was genetically related to another COV of murcego, called Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, which was detected in Ghana, and there is also suspicion that the camels are their intermediate hosts.
For greater clarity, the current knowledge of known HCoV animal origins is summarized in Figure 1 and Table 2.
The phylogenetic analysis provided evidence for interesting HCoV transmission events throughout history.
When HCOV-OC43 crossed the species and infected human beings from domestic animals around 1890, a pandemic of respiratory infection was registered.
The history of interesting transmission of HCoV-229E is less clear.
AlphaCoVs of highly related HCoV-229E was detected.
Among them is an alphaCoV of alpacas.
Several lines of evidence corroborated the direct transmission of the virus of humans to humans.
First, human beings, but not alpines, may have contact with mammals in a shared ecological nest.
In contrast, human beings have direct contact with the alpines.
Second, alphaCoVs related to HCoV-229E are different and not pathogenic in rats, while alphaCoV of alpacas caused an epidemic of respiratory disease in infected animals.
Finally, alphaCoV of alpacas was not found in wild animals.
Therefore, the possibility cannot be excluded that alpacas receive alphaCoV related to HCoV-229E from human beings.
In fact, rats are the direct source of pathogenic viruses for human beings, including the virus of anger, Ebola virus, Nipah virus and Hendra virus.
Therefore, it is not surprising that infants transmit HCoV-229E directly to human beings.
As an alternative, while alphaCoVs serve genetic pool of HCoV-229E, alpacas and drummers can serve as intermediate hosts that transmit viruses to human beings, just as in the case of MERS-CoV.
The MERS-CoV serves as an excellent example of an interesting transmission of the ants for the dragonflies and the dragonflies for the human beings.
The evolutionary origin of MERS-CoV from the fungi is known in its initial identification and was confirmed by subsequent results.
It is obvious that mammals provide a rich pool of viral species for the exchange of interest of genetic fragments and the transmission of interest.
Longevity, high-density colonies, close social interaction and high flight capacity are all favourable conditions for infants to be the ideal "viral promoter".
On the other hand, the introduction of MERS-CoV in the drummers goes back to decades.
He is well adapted to these cameras, and migrated from an intermediate host to a natural and stable reservation host.
MERS-CoV is the cause of a well-branded disease and supports a relatively low rate of mutation in these animals.
Its sporadic transmission to human beings is an accident, and human beings remain terminal hosts of MERS-CoV, as its transmission cannot be sustained.
In contrast to the role of the cameras in the transmission of the MERS-CoV, the role of the pangolins, if any, in the transmission of the SARS-CoV-2, is different.
In particular, the betaCoVs of pangolins are highly pathogenic in pangolins.
They may be a terminal host for betaCoVs related to SARS-CoV-2, in the case of SARS-CoV.
Several possibilities for the relevant transmission of SARS-CoV-2 animals for human beings need to be confirmed or discarded in future studies.
First, the rats could be the reserve host of a virus related to SARS-CoV-2, almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.
Human beings could share the ecological nest with the ants by means of the fall or coal mines.
Secondly, pangolins could be one of the amplifying intermediate hosts, in which a virus related to SARS-CoV-2 had recently been infected.
Human beings contravenes the virus through the bite and consumption of dog meat.
Many mammals, including domestic animals, may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.
A study on antibodies produced from domestic and wild animals is necessary.
Thirdly, as mentioned above, the combination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 could have occurred in a third species that has both contact with both the fungi and the pangolins.
Search for SARS-CoV-2 animal origins is still active.
In addition to the different types of animal hosts, three main factors in the virus are important in facilitating that the CoVs cross the species barrier.
First, its relatively high exchange rate in the replication of the RNA.
Compared to other simple-fithal RNA viruses, the estimated exchange rates of the CoVs can be considered as "moderate" to "high" with an average replacement rate of approximately 10-4 substitutions per year, locally depending on the adaptation phase of the CV to new hosts.
The CoVs have the exorribonucleicase with a review mechanism, whose exclusion results in excessive mutatisability and slowness, or even inviability.
It is interesting that the nucleotide analogue replication of the CV by inhibiting this exorribonucleic acid and RNA-dependent polymerase.
Remdesivir is one of the most promising antiSARS-CoV-2 agents tested in clinical trials.
However, the exchange rates of the CoVs are almost one million times greater than those of their hosts.
In addition, the rate of exchange is generally high when the CoVs are not well adapted to the host.
Compared to SARS-CoV, which has a high mutation rate, the SARS-CoV-2 mutation rate is low, apparently, which suggests its higher level of adaptation to human beings.
It is assumed that he has already adapted to another host who maintains contact with human beings.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, this also applies to MERS-CoV, which is well adapted to the drummers.
Theoretically, it is unlikely that a genetic change would rapidly infect vaccines and antivirals against SARS-CoV-2.
Second, the large GNA gene in CoVs exercises an extra plasticity in the modification of the GNA for mutations and combinations, thus increasing the probability of interesting evolution, which is beneficial for the emergence of new CVs when conditions become appropriate.
This is confirmed by the abundance of single reading frames and coded protequities in relation to the last three inches of the end of the genome.
Thirdly, the CoVs exchange random and frequent models during the replication of RNA through a single "copying" mechanism.
In a host who serves as a blender, the exchange of fibers occurs frequently during the cross-section of the CV RNA.
Highly homologous and subgenomial RNAs can be combined to generate new CoVs.
Phylogenetic evidence of natural recombination was found both in HCOV-HKU1 and HCV-OC43, as well as in animals CoVs, as well as in the SL-CoV of the rats and the batCoV-HKU9.
Intervention of virus- hoster in relation to transmission
In addition to the three viral factors mentioned above, the viral interaction with the host recipient is another key factor that influences the transmission of interest.
Here, the combination of SARS-CoV is taken as a typical example, which also showed evidence of positive selection during interesting transmission events.
Based on the comparative analysis between SARS-CoV isolates of human beings and habitats, it is believed that SARS-CoV is undergoing rapid adaptation in different hosts, mainly with mutations in S protein S.
In general, DDR in a CV protein is interacting with the cell receptor and is intensively selected by the host's antibody response.
In SARS-CoV, DLR is in amino acids 318o to 510o in S1 fragment, which connects to ECA2 human, as well as its adapters to viral input.
SARS-CoV DLR is able to recognise ECA2 receptors of various animals, including pigs, cubs, changendongs and cassavaxins, enabling the transmission of the virus concerned.
In fact, it was observed that only six amino acid residues were different from human viral isolates and civetes in the DLR, and four of them were located on the ground of contact with the receptor for interaction with the ECA2 receptor.
The SARS-CoV of the tissues has K479N and S487T mutations in its DLR, which could increase the effectiveness of the interaction of spike protein with the human ECA2 receptor.
In other words, these two amino acid substitutions could be critical for viral adaptation in human beings.
Please note that SARS-CoV-2 shares the same cell receptor with SARS-CoV.
A 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in S1 protein S unit implies that the termination of binding of its S protein with ECA2 could have been altered.
In fact, a study with electronic chromoscopy shows a 10 to 20 times as close to this link as human ECA2 and SARS-CoV protein S.
It will also be useful to determine whether any other receiver may be necessary for the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
It is impressive that HCOV-NL63 also connects to ECA2, but with a different part of S protein.
There are several other HCoV receptors, such as aminopeptide N for HCoV-229E and sial acid 9-O-acetylated for HCoV-OC43.
They could also respond to the effective adaptation of these CoVs in human beings after the relevant transmission of their animal hosts.
In addition to cell receivers, the result of the relevant HCoV transmission is also managed by other factors of restriction and dependence with the host.
The differentiation of these host proteins between human beings and HCoV's natural reserve hosts such as mice, drummers and rodents could be a barrier to the transmission of interest.
HCoVs need to use the dependent factors with the host and subsidize the host's restriction factors for an effective interesting transmission.
In this sense, molecular determinants in this important area of the virus- host interaction still need to be identified and characterised.
A non-intended triage with an extent to the level of the host's dependence and restriction factors for SARS-CoV-2 using CRISPR's modern technology can produce good results.
New HCoVs Surgeon: Back to zero
The diversity of the CoVs provides wide opportunities for the emergence of new HCoVs.
In this sense, the CoVs of the fungi serve as a genetic pool of the HCoVs.
In addition, rapid mutation and genetic recombination also stimulate the evolution of HCOV and serve as two important steps in this process.
For example, the acquisition or loss of new genes of protein codification has the potential to radically modify viral phenotypes.
Among the SARS-CoV accessory proteins, it is believed that ORF8 is important in its adaptation to human beings, since SARS-CoV virus was isolated, but it was found that they codify different ORF8 proteins.
A characteristic of the exclusion of SARS-CoVs 29 nucleotide was discovered in isolated veins at the beginning of the human epidemic.
The exclusion divides the ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b, and is believed to be an adaptive mutation that promotes the alternative of guests.
In addition, SARS-CoV has a possible history of recombination with alphaCoVs and gammaCoVs, where a large number of smaller recombinant regions have been identified in RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.
Recombination sites were also identified in nsp9, most of nsp10 and parts of nsp14.
In the same way, it was demonstrated that the epidemiical MERS-CoV occurred in combination events between different lines, which occurred in tragedies in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, recombination events were also observed in other HCoVs in which HCoVs were combined with other animals CoVs in their non-structural genes.
It should also be warned that artificial selection can contribute to unwanted changes in viral genes, probably resulting from the relief of the pressure of the selection exercise on viruses, such as the pressure of the host's immune system.
One example of these effects is the loss of a long ORF4 in the prototype cap of HCoV-229E due to the exclusion of two nucleotides.
While intact ORF4 may be observed in HCoV-229E-related rats and camels, alphaCoV alpacas presents a simple incorporation of nucleotides, resulting in a change in the frames.
Finally, but no less important, the evolution of new HCoVs is also driven by the selection pressure in their spare hosts.
No symptoms or only mild symptoms were detected in rats when they were infected with CoVs, indicating the mutual adaptation between CoVs and rats.
It is likely that the rats are well adapted to the anatomical and physiological CoVs.
For example, defects in the activation of the pro-inflammatory response in rats effectively reduce the pathology triggered by the CoVs.
In addition, the activity of natural end-user cells in mice is removed due to the adaptation of the inhibitor of NKG2/CD94 natural end-user receptor, and the low degree of expression of Class I molecules of the main histocompatibility complex.
In addition, the high level of oxygen (ERO) reactive species generated by high metabolic activity of rats can both eliminate the replication of the CV as well as affect the review by exoribonnuclease, thus providing selective pressure for the generation of highly pathogenic strains when introduced into a new host.
More pathogenic strains of CV could also evolve by recombination, leading to the acquisition of new protein or protein characteristics for the host's adaptation.
Therefore, it is not the case that three new HCoVs have emerged in the last two decades.
CoVs are not pathogenic, or cause, at least brandy symptoms in their spare hosts, such as rats and camels.
They respond immeasurably without causing a high immune response from the host.
This document contains explanations about the discovery of asymmetrical carriers and the cause of serious cases of human infection.
Serious symptoms are mainly due to hyperactivity of the immune response and cytokine cascade, in which the greater the immune response, the more severe the damage to the lungs.
In contrast, in asymptomatic carriers, the immune response was decommissioned from the replication of the CV.
The same immune response desalination strategy could have beneficial effects on anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapy.
Interferon response is specifically strong in rats.
Therefore, the administration of interferon type I at the initial stage of infection by SARS-CoV-2 in human beings should be beneficial.
In addition, the activation of NLRP3 inflammation in the veins is weak.
Following this reasoning, the inhibition of NLRP3 inflammation with MCC950 could be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
The occurrence of SARS-CoV-2 follows the same principles as those of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
As it has been discovered that the betaCoV of mice shares 95% of nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV, there is a coV of mice that shares 96% of nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV-2.
Although it has been discovered that animals and other animals on the market have infected SARS-CoV-like viruses, the intermediate hosts for SARS-CoV-2 have not been identified.
BetaCoVs of pangolins, with high homology with SARS-CoV-2, were discovered indicating that pangolins can serve as one of the intermediate hosts, or betaCoVs of pangolins can contribute with genetic fragments for the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
Although the questions remain, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is produced by an accident or intentionally.
The CoVs returned to global attention due to the recent epidemic of SARS-CoV-2.
The study of CoVs in mammals and other animals radically changed our perception of the importance of the zoonotic and animal reserves of HCoVs in the transmission of human beings.
Wide dissemination evidence shows that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 have origin in the womb and are transmitted to people through intermediate hosts.
Since SARS-CoV infection originated from contact between human beings and civilians in the markets, closure of the wet markets and slaughter of civilians in these markets could have led to an end to the SARS epidemic.
According to the same reasoning, Pangolins should be removed from the wet markets to prevent zoonotic transmission, in the face of the discovery of multiple betaCoVs lines of Pangolins closely related to SARS-CoV-2.
However, it should still be clarified in future studies if SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to human beings through pangolins and other mammals, and how this transmission is transmitted.
On the other hand, the MERS-COV is in tragedies for a long time.
These camels serve as an important means of transport, and they are an essential source of meat, milk, leather and wool for the local community.
They are widely distributed in the Middle East and Africa.
Therefore, it is impossible to sacrifice all the channels for the control of MERS, as was done on the markets of wild animals in China to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
In order to stop the emerging epidemics of MERS, an extensive approach should be adopted to develop effective vaccines against MERS-CoV for camels, in combination with other infection control measures.
Since we have not been able to eliminate these viruses, new genotypes may arise and cause epidemics.
A variety of zoonotic CoVs circle in nature.
In particular, the CoVs of fungi with zoonotic potential are very different.
There are several possibilities that these zoonotic CoVs evolve and combine, resulting in the emergence of new CoVs that are more communicative and/or lethal to human beings in the future.
The culture of eating wild animals in some parts of China must be abandoned to reduce the unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
With the SARS crisis, MERS and COVID-19, a better response plan and preparation should be adopted.
In fact, many viruses exist on the planet for a long time.
They remain in their natural reserves until there is a chance of migration for another species.
Although mammals have many characteristics that promote the virus, the chance that people are in contact with insects and other wild species can be minimised if people are taught to stay away from them.
Continued surveillance in mammals is necessary for better understanding of the environment of the CoVs and their natural hosts, which will be useful in preventing the transmission of animals to humans and future epidemics.
In conclusion, the most effective way to prevent viral zoonoses is that people stay away from the ecological nichos of the natural reserves of zoonotic viruses.
Several parts of SARS-CoV-2's zoonotic origin are still missing.
First, if the rats transmit an anti-SARS-CoV-2 virus to the pangolins, it is important to find out that circumstances that the peacocks and pangolins could share the same ecological nest.
Secondly, if the pollutants play a more direct role in the transmission of human beings, it should be determined how people get in touch with the pollutant.
Thirdly, if a third parent has the role of the true intermediate host, it needs to be clarified how he interacts with the different species, including human beings, mammals and pangolins.
Finally, since several mammals, including domestic animals, may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, both surveillance and experimental infection should be carried out.
In the case of a mosquito, a pangolim or other mammals, it is expected that the SARS-CoV-2 or its parent virus that are almost identical will be identified in its natural hosts in the future.
Continued research in this area will highlight the evolution path of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, with important implications for the prevention and control of COVID-19 in human beings.
It is necessary to update the diagnosis criteria for "supposed case" and "confirmed case" of COVID-19
On 6 February 2020, our team published a quick guide for diagnosis and treatment of the infection of the new 2019 Coronavirus (2019-nCoV). This guide transmits our experience and constitutes a good reference to combating this global pandemic.
However, the cancer virus of 2019 (COVID-19) is new. Our understanding and knowledge are gradually increasing based on the constant findings of research and clinical practice; for this reason, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also constantly updated.
In this letter, we respond to a comment on our guide and provide the latest diagnosis criteria for "supposed case" and "confirmed case" in accordance with the latest COVID-19 Diagnostic Guides and Treatment (seventh version) published by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China.
In December 2019, the new 2019 Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) caused a outbreak, which is now officially known as the 2019 Coronavirus disease (COVID-19), and the virus is called Coronavirus 2 of the severe respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
On 11 March 2020, WHO classified COVID-19 as a pandemic.
In order to combat infection by SARS-CoV-2, our team developed a quick guidance guide published online in Military Medical Research on 6 February 2020.
He has drawn excellent attention since publication.
However, note that COVID-19 is a new disease. Our understanding and knowledge are gradually increased on the basis of constant research and clinical experience; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also constantly updated.
For example, the Guidelines for Diagnostics and Treatment of COVID-19 published by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China (http://www.hnc.gov.cn/) between 16 January 2020 and 3 March 2020 contain a total of seven issues with substantial changes in some context.
Our guide has now received a comment from Zhou et al., which presented a simple score proposal based on its clinical experience.
This work has added new evidence to our guide and also makes valuable references to this global pandemic.
Let us end your meaningful work and express our gratitude.
However, its work also needs to be updated in accordance with the latest COVID-19 Diagnostic Guides and Treatment (seventh test version) and recent studies.
According to the seventh edition (3 March 2020), in order to confirm the suspected case, it is necessary to combine an item of epidemiological history with two articles of clinical manifestations for extensive analysis or three items of clinical manifestations should be performed if there is no clear epidemiological history:
epidemiological history: (1) a history of travel or residence in Wuhan city and in nearby areas or other communities where COVID-19 cases were reported in the last 14 days prior to the occurrence of symptoms; (2) a history of contact with infectious cases of SARS-CoV-2 (with a positive nuclear acid test); (3) a history of contact with patients with fever or respiratory symptoms from Wuhan city and nearby areas or other communities where COVID-19 cases were reported in the last 14 days prior to the occurrence of symptoms; (4) a history of contact with a group of confirmed cases (more than two cases with fever and/or respiratory symptoms such as strokes).
Clinical manifestations: (1) fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) with diagnostic resources by image of COVID-19 infection; (3) count of total white blood cells showing normal, decreased or reduced lymphocyte count at the initial stage of symptoms.
The diagnosis of the confirmed case should be based on suspicion of any of the following serologic or pathogenic items: (1) examination of positive PCR for SARS-CoV-2; (2) sequence of the complete viral gene showing high homogeneity in relation to the new known coronaviruses; (3) positive for the specific antibodies IgM and IgG for SARS-CoV-2 in the serum examination; or any modification of the specific IgG antibodies for SARS-CoV-2 of negative for positive or increase of greater title than or equal to four times in the recovery phase above that acute phase.
We can note that the real-time PCR examination for nuclear acid in blood samples or respiratory treatment was added to the second and third edition (from 18 and 22 January 2020, respectively).
The pathogenic blood sample detection was added to the fourth and fifth edition (27 January 2020 and 8 February 2020 respectively), and the sorological evidence was added to the seventh edition.
These changes are based on the ongoing work of researchers in the search for an ideal set of nuclear acid detection kit for rapid diagnosis and samples of respiratory treatment, including blood samples, which increased the availability of different species and helped bring the positive result of specific antibodies to the confirmed criteria.
In addition, there is more and more evidence that we are reminded of caring for patients with atypical symptoms and symptoms.
Therefore, Zhou et al. fluxgram should be updated, since it classifies people without clinical symptoms as "low risk".
The score system also needs to be checked in more clinical studies and practices.
In conclusion, we await the emergence of more direct evidence and ask readers to provide their comments.
For the diagnosis of "supposed case" and "confirmed case", we suggest that they verify and obey the latest guidelines from their countries of origin.
Our team will also update our guide to offer help.
Bangladesh reports five new deaths due to COVID-19, larger daily
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths due to COVID-19 on the day.
That's the largest number of deaths in one day due to the virus.
Yesterday, the Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research of Bangladesh (IEDCR) reported that the number of confirmed cases recorded included 114 active cases and 33 recovered cases that remained at home.
A total of 17 deaths were recorded.
In an online press release, the director of IEDCR, Dr. Meerjady Sabrina Flora, said that the deaths included four men and a woman.
According to Dr. Meerjady, two cases were more than 60 years old, two were between 51 and 60 and one were between 41 and 50 years old.
She also said that two of the victims were from Daca.
The World Health Organization (WHO) declared a COVID-19 pandemic on 11 March.
A hospital agent told Anadolu Agency, a local news agency, that one of the dead was Jalal Saifur Rahman, director of the Bengali Anti-Corruption Commission, who was treated at the Kuwait Maitree Hospital.
On Saturday, in an online video communiqué, Bengal Minister of Road Transport and Bridges Obaidul Quader said that public transport would be paralyzed for more time than originally planned, until next Saturday.
This public transport paralysis began on 26 March and was scheduled to end on Saturday, 4 April.
The transport of essential products (medicine, fuel and food) was still permitted.
The first cases of COVID-19 infection in Bangladesh were recorded on 8 March, in two persons who returned from Italy and also in one of them's wives.
On March 19, the three had already recovered.
SARS-CoV-2 exceeds one million infections worldwide
On Friday, the total number of cases of infections by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus in the world passed over a million, reported the data of the University of Johns Hopkins.
At least 52,000 deaths were linked to COVID-19, the disease caused by coronavirus.
This framework came the same day that Malawi confirmed its first infections by coronavirus and Zambia had its first death related to the virus.
North Korea stated that until Friday it was one of the few remaining countries free of coronary infections.
Until yesterday, the World Health Organization reported 1,051,635 confirmed cases, including 79,332 cases 24 hours before 10 a.m. at the Central European Time (0800 UTC) on 4 April.
In the United States, more than 244,000 cases of coronavirus have been recorded, linked to at least 5,900 deaths.
CBS News reported, citing the data of the University of Johns Hopkins, that there were more than 1,000 deaths in the United States due to coronary infections on Thursday.
In the world, countries have announced more stringent measures to prevent the spread of disease.
On Friday morning, Moscow's favorite Sergei Sobayin extended the total blockade of the city until 1 May.
In the national area, President Vladimir Putin stated that the Russians would continue to be paid without comparing the work until 30 April.
The Portuguese Parliament voted in favour of 215 votes in favour, ten abstentions and one vote against.
Saudi Arabia extended throughout the day the duration of the touch to collect in the sacred cities of Mecca and Medina. Previously, it was only from 15h to 6h.
Thailand Plan to implement the action to collect from 22h to 4h
The governor of Ohio, Mike DeWine, announced that the state had extended the order to stay at home until 1 May.
Stores in Australia reduce health paper limits by transaction
On Saturday night and Sunday, Australian stores Woolworths and Coles reduced the purchase restrictions on the purchase of hygienic paper, respectively, for two packages and a package per transaction across the country's shops.
On Tuesday, ALDI also implemented a limit of a package.
These limitations were communicated by messages in the boxes and on the Facebook pages of the networks.
Because of COVID-19, buyers were supposed to be late if there was a need to isolate themselves.
On Thursday, Woolworths also limited the purchases of hygienic paper with delivery at home for a package per request.
These changes came after the previous restriction of four packages by transaction implemented by Woolworths and Coles on 4 and 5 March, respectively.
Coles, in his press note of 8 March, reported that even with the restriction of four packages, "many stores are still excavating stocks in less than an hour after delivery" and called for "no previous", while ALDI called it "unexpected" on a Facebook post on Wednesday.
Sales had an "incentive increase" last week, according to a Woolworths portal.
The costco store in Chamberra also limited the amount allowed for two packages last week.
To alleviate further the shortage, Cole ordered larger packages of suppliers and increased delivery frequency, Woolworths ordered extra stock, while ALDI previously provided stocks of planned promotion for the quarter.
Russell Zimmerman, executive director of the Australian Association of Varijistas, said that variables are trying to increase stock, but that restrictions on the local unit in relation to the frequency of delivery by road are difficult.
He expects high production costs, as suppliers are trying to meet the demand, and less promotions.
On Wednesday, ALDI announced that after the previous release of the stock, some shops would not be able to promote the quarter-to-fourth.
In a report by News.com.au, Dr. Gary Mortimer, a specialist at the University of Queensland Technology, said that stores are taking the stock all night long.
He pointed out that the hygienic role is a voluminous item with low stock numbers in terms of quantity, and that, when exhausted, it leaves many empty spaces in the plates, increasing the sense of shortage.
Coles and Woolworths have the idea [of] that if there was a lot of food in the dishes, if products such as hygienic and antiseptic roles could be [recorded] and were there in quantities, you would probably reduce the panic, Russell Zimmerman told ABC News.
The recycled hygienic paper manufacturer Who Gives to Crap said on the last Thursday that they would be without stock.
Kimberly-Clark, who produces Kleenex's hygienic role, and Solaris Paper, who produces Sorbent, emphasized that they were working 24 hours a day/7 days a week to keep supply, according to News.com.au's report.
The real estate site domainin.com reported that some real estate sellers were offering free hygiene paper to the first retailer in Melbourne, when fewer retailers were being made with buyers entering the folag at the end of the long week of the Work Day.
The fifth-day edition of NT News, a Darwin paper, included an insert of eight pages with the aim of being cut and used as a hygienic paper.
At first, the shops were reluctant to impose restrictions, according to ABC Australia's report on 3 March in which they said they did not have plans to implement restrictions on purchases.
Russell Zimmerman added that other products also have high demand, such as masks, antiseptics, dry products, soap for hands and fur.
As in Australia, on Sunday night, the British online supermarket Ocado limited purchases of the Andres hygienic paper for two packs of 12 rolls.
The World Health Organization declares a pandemic of COVID-19
On Thursday afternoon, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared that the current outbreak of COVID-19 — the disease caused by the Sars-CoV-2 coronavirus — is a pandemic.
Although the word "pandemia" indicates only the degree of spread of a disease, not how dangerous are the specific cases, WHO stressed the need to motivate governments to act:
All countries can still change the course of this pandemic.
If countries were able to detect, test, treat, isolate, track and mobilize the population for a response, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director general of WHO, said.
We are very concerned about alarming levels of distribution and severity and about alarming levels of lack of action.
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the U.S. Disease Control and Prevention Centres, it is a "no previous" pandemic.
In comments published by CNN in February, he stated that "no other respiratory virus has been monitored from birth to continued global distribution".
Ghebreyesus expressed a similar position, stating that "we have never seen a pandemic initiated by a coronavirus".
And he continued "and we never saw a pandemic that could be controlled at the same time."
The new pandemic status follows the WHO's January decision to declare the outbreak an emergency of public health of international concern.
The director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said that the result, "in sum, will worsen".
On Friday, the Associated Press reported that there were at least 126,000 cases of COVID-19 worldwide, with more than 4,600 deaths.
Coronavirus pandemic 2019-20 is a continuing pandemic of coronary virus 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the coronary virus of acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The survey was identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, and an international public health emergency of international concern was declared on 30 January 2020 and recognized as a pandemic on 11 March 2020.
By 10 April 2020, approximately 1.61 million cases of COVID-19 were reported in 210 countries and territories, with approximately 97,000 deaths.
About 364,000 people recovered.
The mortality rate is estimated to be 4% in China, while overall it varies from 13.04% in Algeria to 0.08% in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include fever, cough and lack of air.
The complications may include pneumonia and acute respiratory discomfort syndrome.
The time from exposure to start of symptoms is approximately five days, but it can vary from two to fourteen days.
There is no known specific antiviral vaccine or treatment.
The primary treatment is symptomatic and supportive therapy. The recommended prevention measures include washing your hands, covering your mouth with tossing, keeping people away and monitoring and isolation of people suspected of infection.
The authorities around the world responded to the implementation of travel restrictions, forty-ones, collection tolls, risk controls at the workplace and closure of establishments.
The pandemic has caused a severe global socio-economic interruption, the threat or cancellation of sports, religious, political and cultural events and generalized shortage of surplused supplies by the purchases from the pancake.
Schools and universities closed at national or local level in 193 countries, affecting about 99.4% of the student population in the world.
Disinformation about the virus was spread online and there were incidents of xenophobia and discrimination against Chinese people, people with descent and appearance from the East and Southeast Asia and other areas with significant cases of the virus.
Due to the reduction in travel and the closures of the heavy industry, there was a decrease in air pollution and carbon emissions.
Health authorities in Wuhan, China (the capital of the province of Hubei) reported a group of cases of pneumonia due to unknown causes on 31 December 2019 and an investigation was started in early January 2020.
In most cases, cases were related to the attacker market of the fruit of the Huanan Sea and therefore it is believed that the virus has a zoonotic origin.
The resulting virus of the urto is known as SARS-CoV-2, a recently discovered virus that has close links with morphine, pangolim and SARS-CoV. The first person with symptoms of having knowledge became sick on 1 December 2019 and did not present visible connections with the post-marketing group of the marine fruit.
The initial group of cases reported in December 2019 found that two thirds had a market link.
On 13 March 2020, an unverified report from South China Morning Post suggested that a case referred to 17 November 2019, in an individual 55 years of the province of Hubei, which may have been the first. On 26 February 2020, WHO reported that, as the new cases reported decreased in China, but suddenly increased in Italy, Iran and South Korea, the number of new cases outside China exceeded the number of new cases for the first time.
There may be significant subnotification of cases, especially among people with milder symptoms.
By 26 February, relatively few cases had been reported among young people aged 19 years or less, accounting for 2.4% of the cases worldwide. The United Kingdom's leading scientific consultant, Patrick Valencia, believed that 60% of the British population would need to be infected until effective collective immunity could be achieved.
Cases refer to the number of persons tested for COVID-19 and whose tests were confirmed positive in accordance with official protocols.
By March 23, no country had tested more than 3% of its population and several countries had adopted official policies not only to test people with mild symptoms such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland.
A study published on 16 March found that, in China until 23 January, 86% of COVID-19 infections were not detected and that these undocumented infections were the source of infection of 79% of the documented cases.
A statistical analysis published on 30 March estimated that the number of people infected in Italy was significantly higher than the reported cases.
The initial estimates of the basic reproduction number (R0) for COVID-19 were 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the U.S. Disease Control and Prevention Centre concluded that it could be 5.7.
Most people with COVID-19 recover.
For those who have not recovered, the time from the appearance of symptoms to death has been between 6 and 41 days, being 14 days the most common.
By 10 April 2020, approximately 97,000 deaths were attributed to COVID-19.
In China, up to 5 February, approximately 80% of deaths occurred in people over 60 years of age and 75% had pre-existing medical conditions, including cardiovascular and diabetes. The official death count for COVID-19 pandemic usually refers to those who died and who had positive COVID tests, in accordance with official protocols.
The actual number of deaths by COVID-19 may be much higher, since it may not include people who died without having passed the test, for example, who died at home, in rest houses, etc.
The partial data from Italy showed that the additional number of deaths during the pandemic exceeded the official death account by COVID by a factor of 4-5x.
A spokesman for the U.S. disease control and prevention centres (CDC) acknowledged that "we know that [the number of official deaths] is underestimated", a statement confirmed by epidemiological reports of subnotification in the United States. This sub-estimation occurs frequently in pandemics, such as the tsunami H1N1 epidemic in 2009. The first confirmed death occurred in Wuhan on 9 January 2020.
The first death outside China occurred on 1 February in the Philippines, and the first death outside Asia occurred in France on 14 February.
On 28 February, outside China, more than a dozen deaths had already been registered in Iran, South Korea and Italy.
On 13 March, more than forty countries and territories reported deaths on all continents except Antarctica. Several measures are commonly used to quantify mortality.
These numbers vary according to the region and over time and are influenced by the volume of tests, quality of the health system, treatment options, time from the start and characteristics of the population, such as age, sex and general health. The fatality coefficient represents the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed at a certain interval.
Based on the statistics of the University of Johns Hopkins, the overall mortality rate is 6.0% (97.039/1/617.204) until 10 April 2020.
The number varies according to the region.
In China, fatality coefficient estimates fell from 17.3% (in people starting with symptoms between 1-10 January 2020) to 0.7% (for people starting with symptoms after 1 February 2020). Other measures include the fatality rate (CFR), which represents the percentage of people diagnosed dying from a disease, and the fatality rate of infection (IFR), which represents the percentage of patients (diagnosed and undiagnosed) who die from the disease.
These statistics are not static in time and follow a specific population of infection through the case resolution.
Some academics have tried to calculate these numbers for specific populations.
The Medical Center based on Evidence from Oxford University estimates that the fatality rate of infection for the pandemic is between 0.1% and 0.39% in general.
The higher estimate of this interval is compatible with the results of the first random test for COVID-19 in Germany and with a statistical study that analyzed the impact of the tests on the CFR estimates.
WHO says the pandemic can be controlled.
The peak and maximum duration of the output are uncertain and can change according to the location.
Maciej Boni, of the University of Pennsylvania State, said that "without due control, infectious diseases usually reach their age and then enter decline when there are no more hospitals available for the disease.
But it is almost impossible to do any proper projection at the time when that will happen."
Senior medical adviser to the Chinese government, Zhong Nanshan, argued that "may end by June" if all countries are mobilized to follow WHO's recommendations on measures to prevent the spread of the virus.
On 17 March, Adam Kucharski of the London School of Health and Tropical Medicine stated that SARS-CoV-2 "will probably continue in circulation for one or two years".
According to the study of the Imperial College, led by Neil Ferguson, physical distance and other measures will be necessary "until a vaccine is available (probably in 18 months or more)".
William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University said: "I think it's unlikely that this corona virus will disappear completely, since it's highly communicable" and "that it can become a seasonal disease, coming back every year."
The virality of the recurrence will depend on the immunity of the group and the extent of the mutation.
The symptoms of COVID-19 may be relatively inspecific and the people infected may be asymptomatic.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
The less common symptoms include fatigue, production of respiratory secretion (catharros), loss of olfactory sensation, lack of air, muscle and articular pain, chest pain, headaches, vomiting, hemophitis, diarrhoea or cianosis. WHO says that approximately one in six people is seriously ill and has difficulty breathing.
The U.S. Disease Control and Prevention Centres (CDC) list that emergency symptoms are the difficulty in breathing, pain or pressure in the persistent chest, sudden confusion, difficulty walking and face or lips with blue coloring. It is recommended to seek medical help if these symptoms are present. The disease evolution can cause severe pneumonia, acute respiratory discomfort syndrome, sepsis, septic shock and death.
Some of the people infected may be asymptomatic, without clinical symptoms, but with the results of tests confirming the infection, researchers therefore recommend that those who were in close contact with a confirmed infection should be monitored and examined closely to remove the infection.
The Chinese estimates for the reason of asymptometics vary from some to 44%.
The usual period of incubation (the time between the start of infection and symptoms) varies from one to 14 days, but usually it is from five days. As an example of uncertainty, the estimate of the fraction of people with COVID-19 who lost the olfactory sensation was initially 30% and then fell to 15%.
Some details about how the disease is spread are still being determined.
It is believed that this disease is primarily spread by close contact and by small gothicles produced during the act of tossing, breathing or talking, being the nearest contact considered 1 to 2 metres (3 to 6 feet).
Studies have found that tossing without covering your mouth can make your gothicles reach 4.5 meters (15 feet) to 8.2 meters (27 feet).
Some people have suggested that the virus can also be transmitted by gothicles that remain for longer periods in the air, which may have been generated during a conversation. Respiratory gothicles can also be produced during the expiration, including speaking, although the virus is not normally in suspension.
The gothicles can be placed in the mouth and noses of people close to them or they may be inhaled by the lungs.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and cardiopulmonary re-immation (CPR) may cause nebulsion of respiratory secrets, resulting in air propagation.
The propaganda can also happen when someone touches a contaminated surface, including the skin, and then touches his own eyes, nose or mouth.
Although there is concern that it can be spread by faeces, it is believed that this risk is low.
The government of China neglected the possibility of oral-fetal transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The virus is more contagious during the first three days after the outbreak of symptoms, although transmission may be possible before symptoms appear and at post-patient stages.
There were positive tests for the disease up to three days before symptoms emerged, suggesting that transmission is possible even before the development of significant symptoms.
There are only a few reports of asymptomatic cases confirmed by the laboratory, but the asymmetric transmission was identified in some countries during contact tracking investigations.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) states that although it is not fully clear how the disease spreads, one person is usually infected by two or three other people.
In particular, it was found that the virus is detectable for up to three days in plastic (polypropylene) and 304 inoxidable steel, for one day in paper and for up to four hours in copper.
This, however, varies according to humidity and temperature. Estimation animals and other animals have already tested positive for COVID-19.
There is no evidence that animals can pass the virus on to humans. However, the British authorities recommend washing their hands after contact with animals, as well as after contact with surfaces that infected people may have touched.
Coronavirus 2 of the severe respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) is a new virus, isolated for the first time from three people with pneumonia connected to a set of cases of acute respiratory disease in Wuhan.
All features of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are similar to coronavirus related to its nature. Outside of the human body, the virus dies by domestic sand, which dissolves its protective envelope. SARS-CoV-2 is closely associated with the original SARS-CoV.
It is believed that it has a zoological origin.
The genetic analysis revealed that coronavirus is genetically associated with the gene Betacoronavirus, subgeneral Sarbecovirus (line B). Two branches of this same line are derived from rats.
It has 96% of the similarity, at the whole level of the gene, to the other samples of coronavirus that come from rats (BatCoV RatG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers discovered that there is only one amino acid of difference in certain parts of the gene sequences between pangoline virus and human.
The comparison of the whole gene has so far found, at the maximum, 92% of genetic material sharing between the koronavirus of the pangolim and SARS-CoV-2, which is insufficient to prove that the pangolins are the intermediate host.
The virus infection may be temporarily diagnosed on the basis of symptoms. The final confirmation, however, is by reverse transcription followed by reaction in the polymerase chain (rRT-PCR) of infected or computerized tomography (TC).
A study in Wuhan, comparing rRT-PCR to TC, suggested that TC is significantly more sensitive, although it is less specific, with many of its image characteristics matching other pneumonies and pathological processes.
Since March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends that "the TC should not be used for triage or as frontline test for COVID-19 diagnostics".
WHO published several RNA test protocols for SARS-CoV-2, the first of which was published on 17 January.
The test uses reverse transcription followed by reaction and polymerase chain (rRT-PCR) in real time.
The test can be performed in respiratory or blood samples.
The results are usually available from a few hours a day.
This test is usually carried out in nasopharyngeal spray, although the throat freeze is also used. Several laboratories and companies are developing serological tests, capable of detecting antibodies.
On 6 April 2020, none of these were sufficiently necessary to be approved for generalised use.
A serological test developed by Cellex in the United States was approved for use in emergency only by certified laboratories.
The features of computerized radiographs and Tomography (TC) images of symptomatic people include asymmetric peripheral glass opiates and the absence of plural waste.
The Italian Radiological Society is gathering an international database of image results in confirmed cases.
Due to overdose with other infections such as adenovirus, images without confirmation by PCR are limited specificity in the identification of COVID-19.
A major study in China compared TC to PCR and demonstrated that although the image is less specific for infection, it is faster and more sensitive, which suggests its view as an epidemic research tool.
Convulsive neuron networks based on artificial intelligence have been developed to detect features of virus images with radiographics and TCs.
The strategies to avoid transmission of the disease include maintaining a good personal hygiene in general, washing your hands, avoiding touching your eyes, nose or mouth without washing your hands, tossing or breathing in a paper lens and putting this lens directly into a waste container.
It is advised who has already been infected to use a public surgical mask.
Physical distance measures are also recommended to avoid transmission. Many governments have restricted or advised non-essential trips to or from countries and areas affected by the South.
The virus, however, reached the stage of Community propaganda in large regions of the world.
This means that the virus is spreading within communities and that some members of the community do not know where or how they have been infected. Health professionals who care for individuals who may be infected may be using standard precautions, contact precautions and eye protection. The tracking of contact is an important method for health authorities to determine the source of infection and to prevent subsequent transmission.
The use of localization data by cell phones for this purpose has raised privacy issues, with the International Anistia and more than 100 other organizations issuing a statement requesting limitations on this type of surveillance.
A number of mobile applications have been implemented or proposed for voluntary use. On 7 April 2020, more than a dozen groups of specialists are working in privacy-friendly solutions, such as using Bluetooth to register a user's proximity to other mobile phones.
Users then received a message if they were in close contact with someone who tested positive for COVID-19. Some wrong concepts about how to prevent infection have been circulated, such as touching the nose and loading with collusions, which has already proved ineffective.
There is no vaccine against COVID-19. However, several organizations are working for the development of one.
Washing hands is recommended to avoid spreading the disease.
The CDC recommends that people wash their hands frequently with water and know for at least twenty seconds, especially after using the toilet or when their hands are visiblely dry. Also wash your hands before eating and after absorbing the nose, tossing or breathing.
This is because, outside of the human body, the virus is dead by domestic sand, breaking its protective layer.
The CDC still recommends the use of alcohol-based hand hygiene with a minimum volume of 60% alcohol when there is no soap and water available soon.
WHO recommends not to touch your eyes, nose or mouth without washing your hands.
The surfaces may be disinfected with several solutions (in up to one minute of exposure to the disinfectant to an stainless steel surface), including ethanol 62-71%, isopropyl alcohol 50-100%, sodium hypochloride 0.1%, hydrogen peroxide 0.5% and iodopovidone 0.2-7.5%.
Other solutions, such as benzalconium chloride and chloride gluconate, are less effective.
The CDC recommends that, in the event of suspicion or confirmation of COVID-19 in a place such as a office or crèche, all areas such as offices, bathrooms, common areas, electronic equipment shared as tablets, touchscreens, keyboards, remote controls and electronic boxes used by patients should be disinfected.
Health organizations recommend covering the mouth and nose with a double coat or with a paper lens on tossing or spraying, as well as immediately removing any lens.
Surgical masks are recommended for those who may be infected, since using a mask may limit the volume and distance of movement of explosives when speaking, breathing or tossing.
WHO has published instructions on when and how to use masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, "The use of masks can reduce people's capacity to touch their faces, which is one of the greatest sources of infection without adequate hand hygiene." It has also been recommended to use masks by caregivers of people who may have the disease.
WHO recommended the use of masks for healthy people only when they are at high risk, such as carers with COVID-19, although they also recognize that using masks can help people not to touch their own face.
In several countries, the use of masks for the public in general has begun to be encouraged.
In the United States, the CDC recommends the use of non-medical masks for the face made of bread. China specifically recommended the use of non-medical masks for healthy people in general, especially when it comes into contact with another person (being 1 metre or less distance).
In Hong Kong, use of surgical masks is recommended by using public transport or by staying in crowded places.
The health authorities of Thailand are encouraging people to make facial bread masks at home and to wash them daily.
In the Czech Republic and in Slovakia, it is prohibited to go out in public without using a mask or cover the nose and mouth.
On 16 March, Vietnam requested that all use facial masks be used when entering public areas in order to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government demanded that all those entering supermarkets use a mask for their faces.
In Israel, all residents were asked to use masks for their public face.
Taiwan, which has produced ten million masks per day since mid-March, demanded that inter-municipal train and bus passengers use masks for the face since 1 April.
In Panama, it is mandatory to use masks for the face when leaving the street. At the same time, it was recommended to produce masks at home for those who could not buy.
Face masks have also been widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social distance (also known as physical distance) involves infection control actions designed to accelerate the transmission of the disease by reducing the next contact between individuals.
The methods include forty, travel restrictions and closure of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theaters or shopping centers.
Social distance methods can be applied by everyone when they are at home, limit their trips, avoid isolated areas, use un contacted greetings and stay away from others.
At the moment, many governments are obliged or recommending social distance in areas affected by the epidemic.
The maximum number of people gathered recommended by the U.S. government bodies and health organizations was rapidly reduced by 250 people (if there is no knowledge of COVID-19 transmission in a region) for 50 people and subsequently for 10 people.
On 22 March 2020, Germany prohibited public meetings of more than two people. Older adults and those with underlying diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, hypertension and compromised immunological systems faced a greater risk of serious diseases and complications, being advised by the CDC to stay home as much as possible in areas of Community epidemic. At the end of March 2020, WHO and other health authorities began to replace the use of the term "social distance" by "physical distance", to clarify that the objective is to reduce physical contact by maintaining social connections, whether virtual or distance.
The use of the term "social distance" has led to the impression that social isolation was needed entirely instead of encouraging contact by other alternative means. Some authorities published guidelines on sexual health during the pandemic.
These recommendations include having sex only with someone you live with, who has no virus or symptoms of the virus.
Self-insulation at home was recommended for those who were diagnosed with COVID-19 and for those who suspected of being infected.
Health agencies have issued detailed instructions for appropriate self-insulation. Many governments have demanded or recommended self-care for entire populations living in affected areas.
The most incisive self-care instruction was issued for those in high-risk groups.
It was advised that individuals who may have been exposed to COVID-19 and those who have recently traveled to a country or region with wide-scale transmission made up of 14 days of self-care since the last possible exposure.
The strategies for control of noise are the content or removal and reduction.
The containment is carried out in the preliminary stages of a outbreak and is intended to trace and isolate the infected, as well as other measures to control the infection and vaccines that prevent the spread of the disease to the rest of the population.
When the spread of the disease is no longer possible, efforts are being made to reduce: the measures taken now serve to reduce the spread speed and to reduce its adverse effects on the health system, as well as on the population.
Concentration and mitigation measures may be taken at the same time, in combination.
The removal requires more extreme measures in order to turn the pandemic into a basic reproduction rate less than 1. The management of a outbreak of infectious disease, in part, has to be seen trying to reduce the epidemic's peak.
Thus, the risk of overloading health services is reduced, giving more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.
Non-pharmacovigilance interventions that may be administered by a physician include personal preventive measures such as hand hygiene, the use of masks for face and self-care; Community measures aimed at physical distance, such as closure of schools and cancellation of events leading to agglomeration; Community involvement in order to stimulate acceptance and participation in such interventions; and environmental measures such as cleaning of contact areas; more drastic actions, in order to contain the noise, were taken in China when the severity of the Surto became clear. Whole cities, for example, were imposed in quarantine and bans on travel.
Other countries have taken various measures to limit the spread of the virus.
South Korea, for example, presented mass trial and localized quarantines. In addition, the government issued warnings about the movement of infected persons.
In Singapore, the infected received financial support when they carried out autoquarantine and, for those who did not do so, were severely punished.
In Taiwan, there was an increase in the production of masks for the face and those who stored medical supplies were punished. Simulations conducted in the United Kingdom and the United States show that the reduction (the reduction of contagion rate, without stopping the spread of the epidemic) and the removal (i.e. the revision of the growth of the epidemic) present major challenges.
Ideal reduction policies can reduce demand by health services in 2/3 and deaths by half. Still, this would result in hundreds of thousands of deaths, overloading at the same time health systems.
The removal may be the best alternative, but it must be maintained while there is the circulation of the virus by the human population or until there is the availability of a vaccine, if this happens before. On the contrary, transmission is about to happen as soon as the relaxation of the measures takes place.
A long-term intervention to remove the pandemic brings social and economic costs.
There is no approved antiviral medicine that is specific to COVID-19. However, there are efforts in the development of medicines, which include the existing drug test.
The use of refrigerated medicines that do not require medical prescription, sufficient liquid drinking and rest can help relieve symptoms.
Depending on the severity of the case, it may be necessary to use oxygen therapy, intravenous fluid insertion or respiratory support.
The use of steroids may improve the condition.
Several compounds previously approved to treat other viral diseases are under investigation to be used in the treatment of COVID-19.
The World Health Organization also stated that some "home and traditional" medicines can alleviate symptoms caused by the SARS-CoV-19 virus.
WHO describes the increase in capacity and adaptation of health care to the needs of COVID-19 as basic measures to combat drought.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, ECDC, and WHO office in Europe have issued guidelines for hospitals and primary health care services to allocate, at various levels, their resources, including the concentration of laboratory services for CVID-19 testing, the cancellation of non-binding procedures and separation and isolation of patients with a positive test for CVID-19, as well as the increase in the capacity of intensive care by training of staff and by increasing the number of beds and fans available.
There are different theories about the occurrence of the first case (the so-called zero patient).
The first case known in the new Coronavirus date of 1 December 2019 in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China.
In one month, the number of cases of coronavirus in the region increased gradually.
These cases were largely linked to the attacker market of fruits of the Huanan Sea. The market also sold live animals, which led to the theory that the virus came from one of these animals. In other words, it was believed that it had a zoonotic origin. On December 26, a group of patients were observed and treated by Dr. Zhang Jixian at the Hubei Provincial Hospital. The next day, the doctor informed Wuhan Jianghan Disease Prevention and Control Centre.
On December 30, a group of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital warned their colleagues about a "coronavirus of the SARS type".
Eight of these doctors, including Li Wenliang, were represented by the police for spreading false news. Another doctor, Ai Fen, was represented by his superiors for giving the alarm.
On 31 December, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission communicated to the population and informed WHO.
Cases of unknown origin pneumonia have already been reported to the Wuhan health authorities to generate an investigation at the beginning of January. During the first stages of the trip, the number of cases doubled to each seven and a half days, approximately.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus spread across other provinces of China, facilitated by the migration of the new Chinese year and by the fact that Wuhan is a transport centre, in addition to a main point of railway connection.
On January 20, China reported about 140 new cases in one day, including two people in Beijing and one in Shenzen.
Further official data show that 6,174 people had already developed symptoms by 20 January 2020. On 26 March, the United States crossed China and Italy with the largest number of confirmed cases in the world. On 9 April 2020, more than 1.61 million cases were reported worldwide; more than 97,000 people died, and more than 364,000 were recovered.
About 200 countries and territories already had at least one case.
In view of the pandemic in Europe, many countries which are part of the Schengen Treaty restricted free movement and established border controls.
The country's reactions included containment measures, such as quarantines (also known as domestic detention orders, domestic or lockdown orders) and collection attacks. On 2 April, about 300 million people (about 90% of the population) are in some way confined in the United States, more than 50 million people are confined in the Philippines, about 59 million people are confined in South Africa and 1.3 billion people are confined in India.
On March 26, 1.7 billion people around the world were already in some form of lockdown, which increased to 2.6 billion people two days later, about a third of the world's population.
The first confirmed case of COVID-19 was registered in Wuhan, on 1 December 2019. An unconfirmed report suggests a previous case, dated 17 November.
Dr. Zhang Jixian observed a group of patients with pneumonia for unknown causes on December 26, and his hospital informed the Wuhan Jianghan Disease Prevention and Control Centre on December 27.
Initial genetic tests, on 27 December 2019, in samples withdrawn from patients indicated the presence of a CRA-type coronavirus.
A communication to the population was issued by the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission on 31 December.
WHO was informed on the same day.
When these reports occurred, Wuhan's doctors were warned by the police about "scattering noises" on the outside.
The National Health Commission of China initially claimed that there is no "clear evidence" of transmission between human beings.
In late January, the Chinese government launched a radical campaign later described by the Secretary-General of the Chinese Communist Party, Xi Jinping, as a "war of the people" to contain the spread of the virus.
In what was described as "the largest continent of humanity's history", a health cord was announced on 23 January to interrupt journeys of departure or return to Wuhan, which was extended by 15 cities of Hubei, reaching about 57 million people in total.
The use of private vehicles was prohibited in the city.
The New Chinese Year's celebrations, on 25 January, were canceled in several locations.
The authorities also announced the construction of a temporary hospital, the Huoshenshan Hospital, which was completed in 10 days.
Another hospital, Leishenshan, was later built to care for more patients.
Together with recent hospitals, China has converted 14 other Wuhan facilities into temporary hospitals, such as convention centres and stadiums. On 26 January, the government launched more measures to cover the outbreak of COVID-19, including the issue of health statements for travelers and the expansion of the spring festival holiday.
Universitys and schools throughout the country were also closed.
The regions of Hong Kong and Macau have taken several measures, in particular with regard to schools and universities.
Remote work measures were taken in many regions of the country.
Restrictions on travel were made in Hubei and outside of it.
Public transport was modified, and museums throughout China were temporarily closed.
The control of public movement was applied in several cities, and it was estimated that about 760 million people (more than half of the population) had experienced some sort of restrictions of exit. After the drought entered its global phase in March, the Chinese authorities took strict measures to avoid the "import" of viruses from other countries.
Pequim, for example, imposed a 14-day mandatory quarantine for all international travelers who arrived in the city. On 23 March, mainland China had only one domestic transmission case in five days, in which case, through a traveler who returned to Guangzhou from Istanbul.
On 24 March 2020, Chinese Prime Minister Li Keqiang reported that the spread of domestic transmission cases had been largely blocked and that the drought had been controlled in China.
On the same day, travel restrictions were reduced in Hubei, except in Wuhan, two months after the lockdown had been imposed. The Minister for Foreign Affairs of China announced on 26 March 2020 that the entry of persons with visa or residence permit would be suspended from 28 March, without specific details on when this policy will be closed.
Anyone wishing to enter China will need to make the request for visas in Chinese embassies or consulates.
The Chinese government encouraged companies and factories to reopen on 30 March, providing packages of financial incentives to companies. The State Council declared a day of struggle, starting with a period of three minutes of silence throughout the country on 4 April at 10 a.m., corresponding to the Qingming Festival. However, the central government asked families to lend their homes online, observing the physical distance to avoid a new outbreak of COVID-19.
On 20 January 2020, the spread of COVID-19 from China to South Korea was confirmed.
The country's national health agency reported a significant increase in cases confirmed on February 20, largely attributed to a meeting in Daegu of a new religious movement known as the Church of Jesus of Shincheonji.
It is suspected that Shincheonji's devotees who visited Daegu came from Wuhan were from the east.
On 22 February, among the 9,336 followers of the church, 1.261, or about 13% of them, reported symptoms. South Korea declared maximum alert on 23 February 2020.
On 28 February, more than 2,000 confirmed cases were reported, reaching 3.150 on 29 February.
All South Korea's military bases were placed in quarantine after tests to confirm that three soldiers were positive for the virus.
The weather schedule was also affected and modified. South Korea presented what was considered the world's largest and well-organized programme in terms of population selection for the virus. The country also isolated infected people and traced and placed in quarantine those entering contact with them.
The trial methods included the mandatory individual report of symptoms for those who came from international travel through a mobile application, testing of the virus by drive-thru, with results available on the following day, in addition to the increase in testing capacity, which allowed up to 20,000 people per day to be tested.
The South Korea programme is considered a success in the control of the south, although it has not placed entire cities in quarantine. South Korean society was initially divided over the response to the crisis given by President Moon Jae-in.
Many Koreans have signed requests requesting Moon’s impeachment under the claim of ill government management of the island, or raising their response.
On 23 March, it was reported that South Korea had the total number of cases below in four weeks.
On 29 March it was announced that from 1 April all new arrivals from the outside should enter forty-two weeks.
Through reports from the media on 1 April, South Korea received requests for help with testing of the virus in 121 different countries.
Iran confirmed its first cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection on 19 February in Qom, where, according to the Ministry of Health and Medical Education, two people died that day.
Early measures announced by the government included the cancellation of concerts and other cultural events, sports events, and religious events on Saturdays, the closure of universities, higher education institutions, and schools.
Iran has five trillion of Riais for the fight against the virus.
President Hassan Rouhani said on 26 February 2020 that he had no plans for the quarantine areas affected by the south, and only individuals would be placed in quarantine.
Plans to limit travel between cities were announced in March, although a heavy traffic between cities before the New Persa Nowruz Year continues.
Chinese shrines in Qom remained open to pilgrims until 16 March 2020. Iran became the center of the spread of the virus after China during February.
In the context of claims to cover the extension of the South in Iran, more than ten countries traced their cases to Iran on 28 February indicating that the extension of the South could be more serious than the 388 cases reported by the Iranian Government up to that date.
The Iranian Parliament was closed with 23 of its 290 members with a positive test for the virus on 3 March.

The body stated that there is a greater risk of spreading the virus in closed institutions as detention centres, which also suffer from lack of medical care.
On 15 March, the Iranian government reported 100 deaths in one day, the largest number since the beginning of the country.
At least 12 politicians in practice or present and government officials died from the disease until 17 March.

According to an WHO representative, there should be five more cases in Iran than is being reported.
It is suggested that US sanctions imposed on Iran may be affecting the country's financial capacity to respond to the viral pandemic.
The High Commissioner for Human Rights requested that economic sanctions be released to the countries most affected by the pandemic, including Iran.
The tour was confirmed as having spread to Italy on 31 January, when two Chinese tourists tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in Rome.
The cases began to increase sharply, which led the Italian government to suspend all flights to and from China and to declare state of emergency.
A group not associated with COVID-19 cases was subsequently detected, starting with 16 confirmed cases in Lombardia on 21 February. On 22 February, the Council of Ministers announced a decree covering the land, including the 40th of over 50,000 people from 11 different municipalities in northern Italy.
First Minister Giuseppe Conte said, "In the outlying areas, entry and exit are prohibited.
The suspension of work activities and sports events had already been established in these areas. "On 4 March, the Italian government requested the total closure of all schools and universities by the country when Italy reached 100 deaths.
All major sports events, including the series A football games, had to be held at closed doors until April, but on March 9, all sports events were completely suspended for at least one month.
On 11 March, Prime Minister Count requested close to almost all commercial activities, except supermarkets and pharmaceuticals.

Since 5 April, there have been 128,948 confirmed cases, 15,887 deaths and 21,815 recovered in Italy, with most of these cases occurring in the region of Lombardy.
A CNN report indicated that the combination of an elderly population in Italy and the inability to test all who had the virus up to that point may have contributed to a high mortality rate.
The United Kingdom’s response to the virus first emerged as one of the most common brands of the affected countries, and until 18 March 2020, the British Government had imposed no social distance or quarantine measures on its citizens.
As a result, the government received criticism from the acknowledged lack of diligence and intensity of its response to the problems faced by the population. On 16 March, Prime Minister Boris Johnson made a speech recommending the interruption of all non-essential and social contacts trips, suggesting that people work at home as much as possible and avoid places such as bars, restaurants and theaters.
On 20 March, the government announced that all leisure facilities such as pubs and academies should be closed as soon as possible, and it committed itself to pay 80% of workers' salaries up to a limit of 2,500 pounds per month to avoid unemployment during the crisis. On 23 March, the Prime Minister announced more serious social distance measures, preventing agglomerations with more than two people and restricting free air travel and activities to the minimum necessary.
Unlike the previous measures, these restrictions were strengthened by the police through the issue of fines and the dispersion of agglomerations.
Most businesses received orders to close, with exceptions for business considered "essential", including supermarkets, pharmaceuticals, banks, iron shops, gas stations and car office.

Despite having done so, the United States had a slow start for the tests, which concealed the real extension of the east at that time.
The test was marked by test kits with a defect produced by the federal government in February, a lack of approval by the federal government for test kits that were not from the government (academia, companies and hospitals) until the end of February, and restrictive criteria for those who would be tested by the beginning of March (a medical application was necessary subsequently).

On the other hand, China's aid was well received in parts of Latin America and Africa. On 2 April, the World Bank launched emergency support operations for developing countries.
WHO commended the efforts of the Chinese authorities to manage and contain the epidemic.
The WHO noted the contrast between the outcome of SARS 2002-2004 where the Chinese authorities were accused of ignoring data that made it difficult to prevent and containment efforts, and the current crisis, where the central government "has provided regular updates to avoid the imminent panic of festivals in the new month.
On 23 January, in response to the decision of the main authorities to implement a transport ban in Wuhan, WHO representative Gauden Galea noted that "that was certainly not a recommendation of WHO" and was also "a very important indication of the commitment to contain the epidemic in the area where it was most concentrated". On 30 January, after confirmation of human transmission out of China and the increase in the number of cases in other countries, WHO declared the rise as an International Public Health Emergency (PHEC), the sixth PHEC since the measure was first invoked during the 2009 tsunami pandemic.
The Director General of WHO, Tedros Adhanom said that PHEC was invoked because of "the risk of global distribution, especially in low- and medium-sized countries without robust health systems.
In response to the implementation of travel restrictions, Tedros stated that "there is no reason for unnecessary interference in international and trade travel" and that "OMS does not recommend limiting trade and movements."
On 5 February, WHO called on the global community for a contribution of $675 million to finance strategic preparation in low- and medium-income countries, citing the urgent need to assist these countries who "have no systems in force to detect people who have contracted the virus, and even if it comes from".
Tetros made further statements indicating that "we are as strong as our weakest" and asked the international community "inviting now or will have to pay later". On 11 February, WHO at a press conference established COVID-19 as the name of the disease.
On the same day, Tedros stated that the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Antonio Guterres, had agreed to provide "the power of the entire United Nations system as an answer".
The United Nations Crisis Management Team was activated, as a result, allowing coordination of the entire United Nations response, which WHO stated will allow them to "focus on health response while other agencies can enter with their experience in the social, economic and social spheres of development resulting from the drought".
On 14 February, an WHO Joint Mission team with China was enabled to provide international specialists and WHO on land in China with assistance in domestic management and to assess "the severity and transmission of disease" through workshops and meetings with the main national institutions and to conduct field visits to assess "the impact of response activities at provincial and municipal levels, including urban and rural panorama". On 25 February, WHO stated that "the world should do more to prepare for a possible pandemic of Coronavirus", stating that although it was very soon to declare a pandemic, countries should also establish "a stage of preparation".
In response to an outbreak of development in Iran, WHO sent a Joint Mission Team to assess the situation. On 28 February, WHO officials said that the overall risk assessment of Coronavirus would be high from "high" to "very high", which is the highest level of alert and risk assessment.
Mike Ryan, executive director of the health emergency programme, warned in a statement that "This is a statement of reality for every government on the planet: OK.
This virus may be on its way and you need to be ready," stressing that correct response measures could help the world avoid "the worst".
Ryan also stated that current data did not allow public health officials to declare a global pandemic, saying that such a statement would mean that "we are essentially accepting that every human on the planet will be exposed to this virus."
On 11 March, WHO declared the outbreak of Coronavirus a pandemic.
The Director General said that WHO was "deeply concerned about alarming levels of distribution and severity, and alarming levels of inaction". WHO faced many criticisms about what was seen as an inadequate management of the pandemic, including the late declaration of a public health emergency and the classification of the virus as a pandemic.
The reaction included an application from the Director General of WHO, Tedros Adhanom to submit his resignation, signed by 733 000 people on 6 April.
On 26 March 2020, dozens of human rights specialists at the United Nations emphasized the rights of each individual during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The Group of Experts stated that everyone has the right to intervene to save life and that the government is responsible.
The group stressed that the lack of resources or health plan should never serve as a justification for discrimination against a specific group.
Experts noted that each individual has the right to health, including persons with disabilities, minors, elderly people, people with mental problems, disadvantaged people, those living under extreme poverty, prisoners, as well as refugees and other non-specific groups who need government assistance.
International government organizations are addressing the economic and social impacts of the COVID-19 crisis.
The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development launched a platform to provide timely and comprehensive information on policy responses in countries around the world, as well as views and advice.
From policies to strengthen the global health and economic systems to address the effects of restriction and restrictions on travel, the digital centre includes a Country Policy Tracer, which helps countries learn one another and facilitate a coordinated global response to the challenge of Coronavirus.
The Chinese government was criticised by the United States, by the United Kingdom Cabinet Minister Michael Gove, and by the son of Brazil President Jair Bolsonaro, Eduardo Bolsonaro by the management of the pandemic, which started in the Chinese province of Hubei.
Administrators of the province of the Chinese Communist Party (CPC) were dismissed because of their approach to the Querentina-related efforts in Central China, a sign of disappointment at the response of the political establishment in the east of these regions.
Some commentators believe that this action was intended to protect the secretary-general of the Chinese Communist Party Xi Jinping from public anger in relation to the east of Coronavirus.
Some Chinese officials, such as Zhao Lijian, rejected an advance recognition from the east of Coronavirus that began in Wuhan, favouring theories of conspiracy on COVID-19 originating in the United States or Italy.
The administration of the United States of Donald Trump referred to Coronavirus as "Chinese Virus" or "Wuhan virus" saying that China's censorship "supernuited a virus that has now become a global pandemic", which was, in turn, condemned by some critics as racism and "a way to break the failure in administration to contain the disease".
The Daily Beast achieved a government leader in the United States a detailed strategy of communication with emerging sources in the National Security Council, with a strategy being cited as "This is all about China.
It was recommended that we try and get these messages in any way, including press conferences and television show shows. "Canals such as Politicians, Foreign Policy and Bloomberg indicated that China's efforts to send help to countries affected by the virus are part of a propaganda for global influence.
The Head of Foreign Policy of the European Union, Joseph Borrell, warned that there is "a geopolitical component including a struggle for influence through a trendy and 'general policies'.
Borrell also said that "China is spreading aggressively the message that, unlike the United States, it is a responsible and reliable partner."
China also asked the United States to suspend its sanctions on Syria, Venezuela and Iran, while it was supposedly sending aid to those countries.
Jack Ma's 100 thousand masks for Cuba were blocked by United States sanctions on 3 April.
The authorities of the United States were also accused of refusing assistance to other nations for their own country.
And I hear disputes about masks related to other countries, such as Germany, Austria and Switzerland; and the Czech Republic and Italy.
In addition, Turkey confiscated hundreds of fans for Spain.
In early March, the Italian government criticised the lack of solidarity of the European Union with Coronavirus in Italy.
Maurizio Massari, Ambassador of Italy to the European Union, said that "China only responded bilaterally.
Indeed, this is not a good sign of European solidarity."
On 22 March, after a call with Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, Russian President Vladimir Putin prepared the Russian military army to send military doctors, special disinfection vehicles, and other medical equipment to Italy.
The Italian newspaper La Stampa quoted an anonymous "high-level political source" that 80 percent of Russia's supplies were "useless or of little use for Italy".
The source accused Russia of embarking on an offensive "geopolitical and diplomatic".
The president of the region of Lombardy, Attlio Fontana, and the Italian Foreign Affairs Minister Luigi Di Mayo delivered the media reports and expressed their gratitude.
Russia also sent a cargo aircraft with medical supplies to the United States.
Kremlin's spokesman, Dmitry Peskov said that "when offering help to American colleagues, [Putin] assumes that when American manufacturers of medical equipment and materials are in a good phase, they would also act mutually if necessary."
NATO's planned military exercise "Defender 2020" in Germany, Poland and the Baltic States, NATO's largest military exercise since the end of the Cold War, will remain on a reduced scale.
The Secretary-General for the Nuclear Disarmament Campaign, Kate Hudson, criticised the Dedefender 2020 exercise: "In the current public health crisis, this risks lives not only from the United States troops and the various European countries participating but from the inhabitants of the countries in which they operate." The Iranian government was strongly affected by the virus, with about a dozen members of the infected Parliament, as well as 15 political figures in exercise or ex-political.
The President of Iran, Hassan Rouhani, wrote a public letter to world leaders, asking for help on 14 March 2020, saying that his country is in difficulty to combat the drought due to lack of access to international markets as a result of United States sanctions against Iran. The latter led the United States to adopt common social policies in other developed countries, including universal health care, universal child care, paid family leave, and high levels of funding for public health.
Political analysts predicted that this could negatively affect Donald Trump's chances of re-electing himself as president of the 2020 elections. Diplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea deteriorated due to the pandemic.
South Korea criticised Japan's ambitious and passive efforts, after Japan announced that any person coming from South Korea would be placed in a two-week quarter in places designated by the government.
South Korean society was initially polarized on President Moon Jae's response to the crisis.
Many Koreans signed requests requesting Moon's impeachment in relation to what they called inappropriate management of the island, or praising its answer. The pandemic allowed countries to adopt emergency laws as a response.
Some commentators expressed concern that this could allow governments to strengthen their control over power.
In Hungary, Parliament voted in a way that allows Prime Minister Viktor Orbán to rule by decree indefinitely, suspend Parliament as well as the elections and punish those who are considered to have spread false news about the virus and the crisis management by the government.
Coronavirus has been responsible for several cases of shortage of supplies, resulting from the increase in the use of equipment in a global way to combat outlets, panic-induced purchases, and breakdown of operations in factories and logistics.
The Food and Administration of the United States issued warnings on the shortage of medicines and medical equipment due to increased consumption and interruptions by the supplier.
Several locals also experienced the event of purchases motivated by the panic which led to the empty plates of essential products such as food, hygienic paper, sealed water, including lack of supplies.
The technology industry in particular has warned of delays in sending electronic products.
According to WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom, the demand for personal protection equipment went up 100 times.
This demand led to an increase in prices up to twenty times the normal price and also caused delays in the provision of medical items for four to six months.
This also caused a lack of personal protection equipment throughout the world, with the WHO's warning that this would put workers' health at risk.
In Australia, the pandemic provided a new opportunity for Chinese buyers to sell Australian products in China.
The activity created a shortage of formulas for babies in some supermarkets and was subsequently banned by the Australian government. Despite the high prevalence of COVID-19 cases in northern Italy and the Wuhan region, and the resulting high demand for food, both areas were affected by a severe shortage of food.
Measures taken by China and Italy against the storage and illicit trade of essential products have been successful, avoiding the shortage of food that has been provided for in Europe as well as in North America.
The North of Italy with its significant agricultural production did not notice a significant reduction, but prices may increase according to industry representatives.
Empty food dishes were found only temporarily, even in the city of Wuhan, and Chinese government officials released pig meat reserves to ensure sufficient food for the population.
Similar laws exist in Italy, requiring food producers to maintain reserves for such emergencies.
A global economic damage was felt in China: according to a media report on 16 March, the economy in China was very affected in the first two months of 2020 due to the measures taken by the government to reduce the spread of the virus, and sales in the countryside fell by 20.5%.
As China Continental is a large economy and manufacturing center, the viral noise has been seen as a major destabilizing threat to the global economy.
Agathe Demarais of The Economist intelligence unit predicted that the markets would remain volatile until a clearer image emerged on possible results.
In January 2020, some analysts estimated that the economic impact of the epidemic on global growth could exceed the result of the 2002-2004 SARS.
An estimate of a specialist at the University of Washington in St. Louis indicated an impact of $300 billion on the world's supply chain that could last for up to two years.
The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) was supposedly "confused" after an emphasised decline in oil prices due to a low demand from China.
Global action markets fell on 24 February due to a significant increase in the number of COVID-19 cases outside the Continental China.
On 27 February, due to growing concerns about the north of Coronavirus, several U.S. box indexes including NASDAQ-100, S&P 500, and the middle of the Dow Jones industry have demonstrated its most expressive decline since 2008, with the fall of Dow in 1,191 points, the largest one day since the financial crisis in 2007-08.
All three other indexes ended the week with a decrease of 10%.
On 28 February, Scope Ratings GmbH confirmed the sovereign credit classification of China, but maintained a negative outlook.
The actions again fell on the basis of concerns with the coronavirus, the largest fall on 16 March.
Many consider it a possible economic recession.
Economist Mohamed El-Erian praised the emergency measures in time capable of the central states and banks.
The central banks are responding faster than they have responded to the financial collapse in 2008.
Tourism is one of the most affected sectors due to travel restrictions, closure of public places including tourist points, and the recommendation of governments against any travel around the world.
As a result, many airlines cancelled their flights due to low demand, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines, and Qantas, while the British regional airline Flybe collapsed.
The impact on the cruise sector was never seen.
Several train stations and balsa ports were also closed.
The epidemic coincided with the Chunyun, a large travel station associated with the New Chinese Year's holiday.
Several events involving large crowds were canceled by national and regional governments, including the New Year's annual festivals, with private companies also independently closing their shops and tourist attractions such as the Dineylandia in Hong Kong and Yangai.
Many New Moon events and tourist attractions were closed to avoid mass agglomerations, including the Prohibited City in Pequim and traditional temple events.
In 24 of the 31 provinces of China, municipalities and regions, the authorities extended the New Year's holiday to 10 February, teaching most of the workplaces not to reopen until this date.
These regions represented 80% of the country's GDP and 90% of exports.
Hong Kong increased its level of response to the infectious disease at the highest level and declared an emergency, closing schools until March and canceling its New Year's celebrations. The wine sector was affected globally, with reductions in the hours of the shops or temporary closures.
Visits to dealers in Europe and Latin America fell by 40%.
The sellers of North America and the Middle East observed a drop of 50-60%.
This also resulted in a decrease of 33-43% in demand traffic to commercial centres in March compared to February.
The World Trade Center operators have imposed additional measures, such as increased cleaning, thermal scanners installation to check buyer temperature, and the cancellation of events. According to the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, it is estimated that the pandemic's recession could leave between 14 and 22 million people in extreme poverty in Latin America what would happen in situations without the pandemic.
In January and February 2020, during the outbreak in Wuhan, about 5 million people in China lost their jobs.
Many of China's 300 million migrant rural workers were left at home in provinces of the interior or in the province of Hubei. In March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and sought government assistance.
The result of Coronavirus could cost 47 million jobs in the United States and unemployment rate could reach 32%, according to estimates from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. The restriction in India has left tens of millions of Indian migrant workers (which are paid on a daily basis) unemployed. A study by Angus Reid found that 44% of Canadian families have gone through some type of unemployment. Almost 900,000 workers have lost their jobs in Spain since the country adopted the quota in mid-March 2020.
During the second 15th of March, 4 million French workers applied for unemployment assistance and 1 million British workers applied for a universal credit programme. Almost half a million companies in Germany placed their workers under reduced-time work programmes under government-subsidised Kurzabeit.
The work pay programme with German reduced hours was adopted by France and Great Britain.
The performance arts and cultural heritage sectors were deeply affected by the pandemic, affecting the operations of the organizations, as well as the people - both employed and independent - worldwide.
Arts and culture organisations have tried to maintain their mission (often publicly funded) to provide access to cultural heritage for the community, to maintain the safety of its staff and the public and to help artists whenever possible.
In March 2020, the world and at various levels, museums, libraries, performance sites, and other cultural institutions were permanently closed with their exhibitions, events and performances cancelled or added.
In response, intensive efforts were made to provide alternative services through digital platforms. Another recent and high-speed impact of the disease is the cancellation of religious services, large sports events, and other social events, such as music festivals and concerts, technological conferences and fashion events.
The film sector also survived an interruption. The Vatican announced that the rites of the Holy Week in Rome, which would have occurred during the last week of the Christian Quaresma period, had been cancelled.
Many dioceses advised elderly Christians to stay home from Mass to Sunday; some churches provided services from the church via radio, streaming to live online or by television while others offer drive-in worship.
With the Roman Catholic Diocese closing its churches and chapels and the square of São Pedro empty without Christian pilgrims, other religious bodies also canceled services and limited public agglomerations in churches, mosques, churches, temples and garlands.
The Ministry of Health of Iran announced the cancellation of Friday's prayers in areas affected by the South and the Sanctuary were subsequently closed, while Saudi Arabia banned the entry of foreigners, as well as its residents in sacred places in Mecca and Medina.
The pandemic has caused the most significant interruption in the world's sports calendar since World War II.
Most of the major events were cancelled or postponed, including the UEFA Championships League of 2019-2020, the 2019-2020 Premier League, the 2019-2020 NBA season, and the 2019-2020 NHL season.
The Surto interfered with the plans for the 2020 Summer Olympic Games, originally scheduled to begin at the end of July; the International Olympic Committee announced on 24 March that the event would be "repatriated for a date after 2020, but not later than the summer of 2021".Cassins and other locations of world-wide games were also closed and presented poker tournaments were also closed or canceled.
This led many players to play online, with several online games sites reporting significant increases in their new registration rates. The entertainment industry was also affected, with several music groups suspending or canceling their tournaments.
Many big theaters like Broadway also canceled all the shows.
Some artists have explored ways to continue to produce and share their work over the Internet as an alternative to traditional live presentations, such as live shows with live transmission or creating "festivals" online for artists to present, share and disclose their work.
On-line, several memes on the internet about coronavirus are promoted, as many are looking for humor and entertainment in the midst of uncertainty.
Since the outbreak of COVID-19, an increase in preconceived, xenophobic and racism has been observed for people of Chinese or Asian descent, and against people of focus areas in Europe, the United States and other countries.
Fear, mistrust, and hostility were observed in many countries, especially in Europe, East Asia, North America, and the Pacific region.
Results from February (when most of the cases were still restricted to China) recorded racist feelings expressed in various groups around the world about the Chinese people deserve the virus or receiving a just punishment for what they caused.
Some countries in Africa have also identified an increase in the sense of anti-Chinese.
Many residents of Wuhan and Hubei reported discrimination based on their regional origin.
This has been supported by Chinese, both online and offline, and is directed towards those in areas affected by the virus.
After the rise in new focus countries, the citizens of Italy, the first country in Europe to experience a severe outbreak of COVID-19, could also be subject to mistrust and xenophobia. Citizens of countries including Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea initially signed applications under pressure to ban Chinese entry into their countries in an attempt to contain the disease.
In Japan, the hashtag #ChineseDontComeToJapan was for Twitter's Trending Topics.
The Chinese people, as well as other Asians in the United Kingdom and the United States, reported growing levels of racist abuse as well as attacks.
US President Donald Trump was critical of being referred to as the "Chinese virus", a term considered by critics as racist and anti-Chinese.
Protesters in Ukraine attacked buses transporting Ukrainians and foreign evacuated from Wuhan to Novi Sanzhari.
Students from the north-eastern India, who are bordering China, and students in the great cities of India have reportedly suffered persecution related to the outbreak of coronavirus.
The president of the unit in the state of the Bharatiya Janata Party in Western Bengal, Dilip Ghosh, said that the Chinese destroyed nature and "that's why God turned against them".
The comments were later condemned by the Consulate of China in Calcutta, who called him "misguided". In China, Xenophoby and racism against non-Chinese people were invaded by the pandemic, with foreigners called "foreign law" and "discarte" targets.
Many newspapers with payment access removed them from some or all of the cover over the coronavirus.
Several scientific editors have made available scientific articles related to open access.
Some scientists have chosen to share their conclusions as early as possible on preprint servers such as bioRxiv.

Laboratory analysis for the respiratory disease of 2019 (COVID-19) and the associated SARS virus - CoV-2 include methods that detect the presence of the virus and those that detect antibodies produced in response to the infection.
The presence of the virus in samples is confirmed by RT-PCR, which detects coronavirus RNA.
This test is specific and developed only to detect the RNA of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
It is used to confirm very recent or active infections.
The detection of antibodies (sorology) can be used for diagnosis and population monitoring.
Antibody tests revealed how many people had the disease, including those whose symptoms were very brandy to be reported or were asymptomatic.
A precise rate of mortality of the disease and level of immunity in the population may be determined from the results of this test.
Due to limited testing, in March 2020 no country had reliable data on the prevalence of the virus in its population.
On 23 March, no country had tested more than 3% of its population, and there were significant variations in the number of tests carried out in the countries.
This variation may still substantially affect the mortality rates of registered cases, which may be significantly overestimated in some countries.
Using the polymerase chain reaction with real-time reverse transcription (rRT-PCR), the test can be performed in respiratory samples obtained by different methods, including nasopharyngeal spray or saliva sample.
The results are usually available within a few hours or within 2 days.
The RT-PCR test carried out with fatigue of thefaring is only reliable in the first week of the disease.
Later, the virus may disappear in the throat as it continues to multiply in the lungs.
For infected persons tested in the second week, as an alternative, the sample material may be withdrawn from the background of respiratory pathways by a suction catheter or an explosive (secretion) material may be used.
One of the first PCR tests was developed in Charité, Berlin, in January 2020 using the polymerase chain reaction with reverse real-time transcription (rRT-PCR), and serves as a base for 250,000 kits for distribution by the World Health Organization (WHO).
The United Kingdom also developed a test on 23 January 2020. The South Korean Kogenbiotech developed a clinical type, a SARS-CoV-2 detection kit based on PCR (PowerCheck Coronavirus) on 28 January 2020.
He sought by the gene "E" shared by all beta coronaviruses, and the gene RdRp, specific to SARS-CoV-2. In China, the BGI group was one of the first companies to receive the approval for the emergency use of China's National Medical Products Administration for the SARS-CoV-2 detection kit based on PCR. In the United States, the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is distributing its innovative diagnostic panel for Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) of RT-PCR in real time for public health laboratories by the International Reagent Resource.
One of the three genetic tests in older versions of test kits generated inconclusive tests on the basis of fail-reactors, and an impediment to the CDC test in Atlanta; this resulted in an average of less than 100 samples per day being successfully processed throughout February 2020.
Tests using two components were not considered reliable until 28 February 2020, and from then on local and state laboratories were allowed to start the tests.
The test was approved by Food and Drug Administration under an emergency authorisation. Commercial laboratories started testing in early March 2020.
Since 5 March 2020, LabCorp has announced the national availability of the test for COVID-19 based on RT-PCR.
This Diagnostics also turned the COVID-19 tests nationally available from 9 March 2020.
No quantity restriction has been announced; the collection and processing of samples shall be carried out in accordance with the requirements of the CDC.
In Russia, the test for COVID-19 was developed and produced by the State Research Centre in Virology and Biotechnology, VECTOR.
On 11 February 2020, the test was registered by the Federal Health Watch Service. On 12 March 2020, Mayo Clinic claimed to have developed a test to detect the infection by COVID-19. On 13 March 2020, Roche Diagnostics received an FDA approval for a test that could be carried out within 3.5 hours on a large scale, thus allowing a machine to process approximately 4.128 tests for a period of 24 hours.
On 19 March 2020, the FDA issued an Emergency Use Authorisation (USA) for Abbott laboratories for a test in Abbott's m2000 system; the FDA previously issued an authorisation for the Hologic, LabCorp, and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On 21 March 2020, Cepheid also received an U.S. from the FDA for a test which takes about 45 minutes.
The FDA approved a test using isotermic nuclear acid amplification technology instead of PCR.
As it does not require a series of different temperature cycles, this method can generate positive results in just five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
There are currently about 18,000 of these machines in the U.S. and Abbott expects to increase production to provide 50,000 tests per day. A test using a monoclonal antibodies and the particular link to the nucleoceptic protein (N protein) of the new coronavirus is developing in Taiwan, with the expectation of delivering results in 15-20 minutes such as a quick flu test.
A literature review in March 2020 concluded that "torax radiographs have a lower diagnosis value in the initial stages, while TC findings, computerized tomography, can be present even before symptoms arise".
The typical features in TC include bi-lobar opena in dark glass with a later, peripheral and asymmetric distribution.
Subpleural domination, mosaic flooring and consolidation evolve according to progressive disease.
A study comparing PCR to TC in Wuhan at the point of origin of the current pandemic suggested that TC is significantly more sensitive than PCR, although less specific, with many of its image aspects matching other pneumonies and pathological processes.
Since March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends that "TC should not be used for triage or as a first line test to diagnose COVID-19". Since March 2020, the CDC recommends the PCR for an initial check.
Part of the immune response to infection is the production of antibodies including IgM and IgG.
These may be used to detect infection in individuals initiated 7 days ago or shortly after the occurrence of symptoms, to determine immunity, and in population monitoring. The tests may be carried out in central laboratories (CLT) or through remote laboratory tests (POCT).
The automated high productivity systems in many clinical laboratories will be able to perform these tests, but their availability will depend on the production rate of each system.
For CLT, a single peripheral blood sample is commonly used, although numerous samples can be used to follow the immune response.
For PoCT, a single blood sample is usually obtained by skin puncture.
In contrast to the PCR methods, the collection stage is not necessary before the test. On 26 March 2020, the FDA indicated 29 entities that notified the agency, as required, and from now on they are able to distribute their antibodies tests.
From 7 April 2020, only one test was approved by the FDA with an emergency authorisation. At the end of March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics received European approvals for their test kits, which can detect IgG and IgA antibodies for the virus in blood samples.
The test capacity is of several hundred samples in terms of hours and therefore much faster than conventional PCR tests of viral RNA.
Antibodys are normally detected 14 days after the start of the infection. In early April, the United Kingdom considered that none of the kits of acquired antibodies tests were adequate enough to be used.
Hong Kong organized a system in which suspect patients may stay at home, "the emergency department will provide a sample tube for the patient", they should send it back to the tube, send it back and get a short-term result. The British NHS announced that it is coordinating a system to test suspected cases at home, which removes the risk of infection of a patient if they are in the hospital or the need to disinfect an ambulance if something is used. In the COVID-19 drive-thru tests in case of suspects, a health professional collects samples taking appropriate precautions.
Drive-Thru centres have helped South Korea carry out some of the fastest and extensive tests in one country. In Germany, the National Association of Health Statutory Doctors stated on 2 March that it had capacity for about 12,000 tests per day in ambulance care, while 10,700 had been tested in the previous week.
The costs shall be borne by the health insurance when the test is requested by a doctor.
According to Instituto President Robert Koch, Germany has a total capacity of 160 000 tests per week.
Since March 19, drive-in tests have been offered in several large cities.
Since 26 March 2020, the total number of tests performed in Germany remains unknown, as only positive tests are recorded.
The first research laboratory revealed that since the 12th week of 2020 a total of 483.295 samples have been tested up to the 12th week of 2020 and 33.491 samples (6.9%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. In Israel, researchers from Technion and Rambam hospitals have developed and tested a method to test samples of 64 patients simultaneously, collecting samples and carrying out additional tests only if the combined sample was considered positive. In Wuhan, an improvised 2000 m2 laboratory for emergency detection called "Huo-Yan" (China: qaşõ, or "Fire Eye") was opened on 5 February 2020 by more than 10 thousand BGI samples.
With the construction supervised by the founder of BGI, Wang Jian, and five days later, the modeling revealed that the cases in Hubei would have been 47% higher and the corresponding cost of dealing with the quarantine would have doubled if this testing capacity did not have an online access.
The Wuhan lab was soon followed by Huo-Yan laboratories in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Pequim, and Yangai, in a total of 12 cities throughout China.
On 4 March 2020, the total daily performance was 50 thousand tests per day. Multiple open code models released by Origami Assays were launched as testing capacity up to 1.122 samples of patients for COVID-19 using only 93 trials. These balanced models can be performed in small laboratories without the need for robotic manipulation for liquids.
In March, lack of or insufficient response quantities became an obstacle to mass testing in the European Union, the United Kingdom and the United States.
This led some authors to study the preparation protocols of samples involving the heating of samples at 98 °C (208 °F) for 5 minutes to release RNA genes for additional tests. On March 31, it was announced that the United Arab Emirates are now undergoing more testing by residents in their population for Coronavirus than other countries, and would be able to increase the testing level and reach most of the population.
This was done by a combination of drive-thru capacity, and acquisition of a laboratory for mass processing of the Group 42 and BGI (inspired by its emergency detection laboratories "Huo-Yan" in China).
Built in 14 days, the laboratory is able to conduct tens of thousands of RT-PCR tests per day and is the first world on this scale to operate outside China.
Various methods of testing aimed at different components of the genetic profile of coronavirus were developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The World Health Organization has adopted the German method for the manufacture of kits sent to low-income countries that have no resources to develop their own.
The German method was published on 17 January 2020; the protocol developed by the U.S. Disease Control Centre was not available until 28 January; there was a delay in the tests available for the US and China and the United States faced problems with the reliability of test kits at the beginning of the day, and these countries in Australia were unable to provide sufficient kits to meet the demand and health test recommendations made by health professionals.
In contrast, experts say that the wide availability of South Korea for testing helped to reduce the spread of the new coronavirus.
The testing capacity, mostly in the private sector laboratories, has been consolidated for many years by the Government of South Korea.
On 16 March, the World Health Organization indicated the strengthening of testing programmes as the best way to delay the progress of the COVID-19 pandemic. The high demand for tests due to the widespread spread of the virus caused the delay of hundreds of thousands of tests in US private laboratories, and the provision of cotton and chemical reactors was affected.
In March 2020, China reported problems with precision in its test kits.
In the United States, the test kits developed by the CDC presented "failures"; the government then removed the bureaucratic barriers that prevented the individual tests. Spain acquired test kits from Chinese company Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but considered the necessary results.
The company explained that the incorrect results could be the result of a failure in the collection of samples or incorrect use of kits.
The minister of Spain said he would cancel out the kits that generated incorrect results and replace them with a different test kit provided by Shenzhen Bioeasy. 80% of the test kits bought by the Czech Republic from China resulted in wrong results. Slovakia acquired 1.2 million kits from China considered unnecessary.
Prime Minister Matovic suggested they would be deported to Denmark. At the time Kara of the Ministry of Health of Turkey said that Turkey's test kits bought from China had a "high error rate" and that they would not "use them". The United Kingdom acquired 3.5 million test kits from China, but in early April 2020 it announced that they were not useful.
The test, followed by the forty of those who tested positive and the monitoring of those with whom the positive SARS-CoV-2 contacted, had positive results.
Researchers working in the Italian city of Vo, the site of the first death by COVID-19 in Italy, conducted two test stages of the entire population of approximately 3,400 people, with a interval of about ten days.
About half of the people who tested positive had no symptoms, and all cases discovered were placed in quarantine.
With the move to the restricted community, it completely eliminated new infections.
With the aggressive monitoring of the contact, travel restrictions for the country, testing and quarantine, the pandemic of Coronavirus in 2020 in Singapore has advanced more slowly than in other developed countries, and without radical restrictions such as the mandatory closure of restaurants and sales facilities.
Many events were cancelled, and Singapore began to give serious advice to the inhabitants to stay home on March 28, but schools reopened within the scheduled post-hoop on March 23.
Many other countries have also administered the pandemic with aggressive contact monitoring, travel restrictions for the country, testing and quarantine, but with less aggressive lockdowns such as Iceland and South Korea.
A statistical study identified that countries that performed more tests, compared to the number of deaths, had lower mortality rates, probably because these countries are more able to detect those with no or no symptoms.
WHO recommends that countries with no testing capacity and have national laboratories with limited experience in COVID-19 send their first five positive samples and the first ten negative samples for one of the 16 WHO reference laboratories for confirmatory tests.
Of the 16 reference laboratories, 7 are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
In the following table, the "Possible in % of Tests" column is influenced by the country's test policy.
A country which only visits hospitals will have a higher percentage of positive tests than a country that has tested all citizens, whether they are present or not, the other characteristics are equivalent.
Washing hands (or washing hands), also known as hand hygiene, is the act of washing hands with the aim of removing sweat, fat, microorganisms, or other undesirable substances.
Washing hands with soap constantly in certain "critical moments" during the day prevents the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhoea and cholera, which are transmitted by golden-fetal route.
People may also be infected with respiratory diseases such as influenza or a common cold, for example, if they do not wash their hands before touching their eyes, nose or mouth (i.e. mucosa).
The five crucial moments during the day when washing hands with sand are important include: before and after the defection, after cleaning the child's pump or exchange fryes, before feeding a child, before meals and before and after preparing food or handling meat, franchise or crust fish.
If water and sand are not available, hands can be cured with gloves. The World Health Organization recommends manual hygiene:
Before, during and after preparing the food.
Before and after taking care of a sick person.
After you exchange fractals or clean up a child who has used the bathroom.
After sucking the nose, touch or breathe.
After touching animals, breeds or animals.
Clinical hygiene of the hands refers to hygiene practices related to medical procedures.
Washing your hands before taking medicines or medical care may prevent or minimize the spread of diseases.
The main objective of washing hands is to clean the hands of pathogens (bacterials, viruses, or other microorganisms that may cause disease) and chemicals that may cause damage or disease.
This is particularly important for people who are handling food or working in the medical field, but it is also an important practice for the public in general.
Washing hands has many health benefits, including reducing the spread of influenza, coronavirus and other infectious diseases; preventing infectious causes of diarrhoea; reducing respiratory infections;
and reduce the infant mortality rate in births at home.
A 2013 study revealed that better hand washing practices can cause small improvements in children under five years of age.
In developed countries, infant mortality rates related to diarrhoea and respiratory diseases can be reduced by simply introducing behavioural changes such as washing hands with soap.
This simple attitude can reduce the mortality rate of these diseases by almost 50%.
Measures that promote hand washing may reduce diarrhoea episodes near a third, which is comparable to providing clean water for missing areas.
48% of the reductions in diarrhoea episodes can be associated with washing hands with soap. Washing hands with soap is the most effective and economic way to prevent acute diarrhoea and respiratory infections (IRA), such as automatic behavior in homes, schools, and communities around the world.
Pneumonia, the main IRA, is the first cause of mortality among children under five years of age, leading to the death of estimated 1.8 million children per year.
The joint diarrhoea and pneumonia are responsible for nearly 3.5 million deaths of children each year.
According to UNICEF, changing the washing of hands with soap before and after using the bath in an arrears can save more lives than any vaccine or medical intervention, reducing the deaths by diarrhoea almost by half and deaths of acute respiratory infections in one room.
Washing hands is usually associated with other health interventions as part of water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH).
Washing your hands also protects against impetition that is transmitted by direct physical contact.
A less significant negative effect of hand washing is that frequent hand washing can cause skin injuries due to skin drying.
A 2012 Danish study found that excessive hand washing can cause a condition of decommissioning and irritation in the skin known as eczema or hand dermatitis, which is particularly common among workers in the health system.
The frequent washing of hands is also perceived as one of the symptoms of constipative obsessive disorder (TOC).
There are five crucial moments during the day when washing your hands with soap is important to reduce the fecal-oral transmission of diseases: after use of the bath (mixture, defection), after cleaning a child's pump (place frandal), before feeding a child, before eating and/or before preparing a meal or handling meat, fish or crust.
Other situations where the correct hand washing technique must be used to prevent the transmission of diseases include prior and after treatment of cuts or injuries; after breathing, tossing or sucking the nose; after touching animals or dealing with animals; and after touching in the dust.
In many countries there is a reduced washing rate of hands with soap.
A study on hand washing in 54 countries in 2015 found that, on average, 38.7% of families had the habit of washing their hands with soap. A 2014 study revealed that Saudi Arabia had the largest index of 97 per cent; the United States around the average with 77 per cent; and China with the lowest index of 23 per cent. Various methods for behavioural changes are currently available to increase acceptance of washing hands with soap in critical periods. The collective washing of hands for children in schools during certain periods of the day is an alternative in developing countries to induce manual washing in children's habits.
The "Essential Health Services Programme" implemented by the Department of Education in the Philippines is an example of a long-scale action to promote children's health and education.
Disappearance twice a year, complemented by washing hands daily with soap, brushing teeth daily with flowers, are at the centre of this national program.
He was also successfully implemented in Indonesia.
The removal of skin microorganisms is strengthened by adding soaps and water-detergents.
The main action of soaps and detergents is to reduce barriers to the solution, and increase solubility.
The only water is an ineffective cleaning agent for the skin, because fats and proteins, components of organic suction, are not easily dissolved into water.
The cleaning, however, is facilitated by a reasonable flow of water...
The sand in the bar, depending on its reusable nature, can hold bacteria accumulated from previous uses.
A reduced number of studies that analyzed the bacterial transmission of a contaminated soap into a bar concluded that the transmission is unlikely as bacteria are infected with the foam.
The CDC repeats "a liquid soap with automatic dosing commands is preferable".
Antibacterial sabotages were widely disseminated to the public conscious in terms of health.
To date, there are no indications that the use of antiseptics or disinfectants may lead to the selection of antibiotics resistant organisms in nature.
However, antibacterial soap contains common antibacterial agents, such as triclosan, which has an extensive list of organisms resistant strains.
Thus, although antibiotics resistant strains are not selected by antibacterial soaps, they may not be as effective as they are disclosed.
In addition to the surfactants and skin protection agents, complex formulas may contain acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lecoic acid) as regulator of pH, active antimicrobial benzoic acid and other hydrates for the skin (a true alee, vitamins, mangol, vegetative extracts). An extensive analysis of the University of Oregon School of Public Health indicated that common soaps are so effective in preventing diseases and removing bacteria from the hands as antibacterial soaps returned to the final consumer containing triclosan.
Hot water that is comfortable for washing hands is not hot enough to kill bacteria.
The bacteria grow faster at body temperature (37 oC).
However, hot water with soap is more effective than cold water with soap to remove natural oleosity that keeps sweaters and bacteria.
In contrast to popular belief, however, scientific studies have revealed that using hot water is not effective to reduce the microbian load in your hands.
A hand hygiener or antiseptic is a non-aqueous hand hygiene agent.
At the end of the 1990s and at the beginning of the 21st century, non-alcohol-based hand hygiene agents (also known as an alcohol-based hand hygiene product, antiseptic hand hygiene product, or hand hygiene) began to gain popularity.
The majority is made on the basis of isopropyl alcohol or ethanol formulated with a thickener such as carbomer (polymer or acrylic acid), gel, or ammizer, such as glycerin, liquid, or foam to facilitate the use and reduce the effect of alcohol cooling.
The addition of hydrogen peroxide increases antimicrobial activity. Hand hygieners with a minimum of 60 to 95% alcohol kill germs with efficiency.
Alcohol-based hygienizers kill bacteria, multiresistant bacteria (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis, and some viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, renovirus, vaccine, influenza and hepatitis) and fungi.
Alcohol-based hygienizers who contain 70% of alcohol kill 99.97% (a reduction of 3.5 logarithms, similar to a reduction of 35 decibes) of the bacteria in their hands, 30 seconds after their application and 99.99% to 99.99% (a reduction of 4 to 5 logarithms) of the bacteria in their hands 1 minute after their application. Hand hygieners are more effective against bacteria and less effective against some viruses.
Alcohol-based hygienizers are almost completely ineffective against the virus of the norovirus type (or Norwalk), the most common cause of infectious gastroenteritis. Antiseptics for hands or alcohol-based hygiene can be used to soften or cover well both hands.
The bones and palms of your hands, between your fingers and your limbs, are frozen for about 30 seconds until the liquid, foam or gel is dry.
The fingers should also be washed well, being frozen with both palms. The Disease Control and Prevention Center recommends washing hands with hand hygieners, especially when their hands are visually theirs.
The growing use of these agents is based on its ease of use and rapid exploratory action against microorganisms; however, they should not replace adequate hand washing unless they are known and water is not available.
The frequent use of alcohol-based hand hygieners may cause skin drying, unless emulsions and/or skin hydrants are added to the formula.
The effect of alcohol recovery may be reduced or eliminated by the addition of glycerin and/or other emulsions to the formula.
In clinical trials, alcohol-based hygiene caused significantly less irritation and dryness in the skin than sabonides or antimicrobial detectors.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact urticaria syndrome or hypersensitivity to alcohol or the additives present in the gloves on the basis of alcohol are rare.
The less tendency to cause irritative contact dermatitis became an attractive one compared to washing hands with water and soap.
Despite its effectiveness, non-aqueous basic agents do not clean the hands of organic matter, only disinfect them.
That is why hand hygieners are not as effective as water and sand to prevent the spread of many pathogens, since pathogens remain in their hands.
The effectiveness of non-alcohol-free hand hygieners is extremely dependent on substances and formulation, and has historically become very acute about alcohol and alcohol-based hygieners.
More recently, formulations using Benzalconium chloride revealed continuous and cumulative antimicrobial action after administration, different from alcohol, which revealed its reduced efficacy after current use, probably due to growing skin reactions.
Many people in low income communities cannot afford a soap and instead use rice or land.
Skin or soil may be more efficient than clean water, but they may be less effective than soap.
One concern is that if soil or ashes are contaminated with microorganisms the spread of the disease may increase rather than decrease.
Like soap, the skin is also a disinfectant agent, since in contact with water it forms an alkaline solution.
WHO recommends silk and sand as an alternative to soap when there is no soap.
The correct technique for washing the hands recommended by the U.S. Disease Control Centre to prevent the transmission of diseases includes the following steps:
Wash your hands with cold or hot running water.
Current water is recommended since fixed latrines may be contaminated, while water temperature does not appear to be relevant.
Wash your hands, frying them with a generous amount of soap, including the sides of your hands, the space between your fingers and under your fingers.
The soap removes the germs of the skin, and studies reveal that people tend to wash their hands more carefully when soap is used instead of clean water.
Swirl for at least 20 seconds.
The act of spraying is attractive, which helps to remove the germs of the skin, and spraying for a longer time removes more germs.
Swallow well with running water.
Washing on a foot can reassembly your hands.
Dry with a dry toilet or leave it to free air.
Soft hands or wet hands are more easily retraced. The most commonly forgotten areas are Poland, the pulse, the areas between the fingers and under.
Artificial and liquefied stems can cover microorganisms.
hydrating lotion is often recommended to keep the hydrated hands; dry skin can cause skin lesions that can increase the risk of transmission of infection.
Several low cost options can be made to facilitate the washing of hands where there is no running water and/or sand, for example, to pour water from a gallon or cane with suitable irrigation and/or use sand if necessary in developing countries. In situations where water supply is limited (such as rural schools or areas in developing countries), there are solutions to store water, such as "unprofessional tournaments" and other low cost options.
An improvised tournament is a simple technology that uses a stopper for a rope, and a walk-by-step walk to throw a small amount of water into your hands and a sandbar.
The effective drying of hands is an essential part of the process of hand hygiene, but there is a discussion on the most effective way for drying in public baths.
A growing volume of research suggests that toilet paper is more hygienic than the electric hand dryers found in many bathrooms.
In 2008, a study was conducted by the University of Westminster, London, and sponsored by the Toalha paper industry, European Tissue Symposium, to compare the levels of hygiene presented by Toalha paper, hand dryers with hot air and the most modern hand dryers with air jet.
After washing and drying hands with drying air, the total number of bacteria was considered, on average, 19.4% higher in the area of the palm near the teeth and 254% in the rest of the palm.
The drying with dryers with jet air caused an increase in the total number of bacteria, on average, 42% in the area of the palm near the teeth and about 15% in the rest of the palm.
After washing and drying hands with toilet paper, the total number of bacteria was reduced, on average, to 76% in the area of the palm near the teeth and up to 77% in the rest of the palm. Researchers also conducted tests to determine whether there was potential for cross-contamination between other users and the bathroom environment as a consequence of each type of drying method.
The air dryer, which projects air out of the unit at specified speeds of 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), managed to expel micro-organisms from the hands and unit by potentially pollinating other users of the bath and the environment up to 2 metres away.
The use of hand dryer with hot air spreads microorganisms up to 0.25 metres from the dryer.
Toalha papers did not present a significant distribution of micro-organisms. In 2005, in a study conducted by TÜV Product and Umwelt, different methods for drying hands were evaluated.
The following changes in bacterial count after hand drying were observed:
There are many manufacturers of different hand dryers, and hand dryers were compared to drying with toilet paper.
Washing hands with moistened gloves for hands is an alternative to lack of soap and water during trips.
Hand hygieners based on alcohol should contain at least 60% of alcohol.
The clinical washing of the hands became mandatory long after Hungarian doctor Ignaz Semmelweis discovered its effectiveness (in 1846) in preventing diseases in the hospital environment.
There are electronic devices that provide feedback to remember the hospital team to wash their hands when they forget.
One study found that infection rates decreased with their use.
The clinical washing of hands is for at least 15 seconds, using generous amounts of soap and water or gel to dry and freeze all parts of your hands.
The hands should be frozen simultaneously with the interconnection of the teeth.
If there are residues below the edges, a cover can be used to remove them.
Since germs can stay in the water in their hands, it is important to wash well and dry with a clean toilet.
After drying, the towel paper must be used to close the tube (and open the door if necessary).
This prevents the recontamination of your hands by these surfaces.
The objective of hand washing in the medical care environment is to remove pathogenic microorganisms ("germes") and avoid their transmission.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that the lack of hand washing remains at unacceptable levels in most medical environments, with a large number of doctors and nurses constantly forgetting to wash their hands before touching patients, thus transmitting microorganisms.
One study revealed that adequate washing of hands and other simple procedures may reduce the rate of infection in the blood stream related to catheter in 66 percent. The World Health Organization published a booklet demonstrating the standard of washing and frying of hands in the health system sectors.
The organisation's manual project for the hygiene of the hands can also be found on this site for comments.
An applicable review was carried out by Whitby et al.
Commercial devices may measure and validate the hygiene of the hands, if evidence of regulatory compliance is required.
The World Health Organization defines "Five moments" for washing hands:
after exposure to body fluids/sanguine
before an ascetic task, and
After treatment with the patient. The addition of antiseptic chemicals to the sabonite (sabones "medicine" or "antimicrobials") confers an extreme action on a hand washing agent.
Such extreme action may be desirable before performing surgery or in situations in which antibiotics resistant organisms are dominant. To "clean" your hands for a surgical operation you need to have a tournament that can be opened and closed without touching it with your hands, some chlorexidine or iodine antiseptics, sterile towels to dry your hands after washing, and a sterilized cover for cleaning and other sterilized cleaning tools under the feet.
All joys must be removed.
This procedure requires washing hands and forwards up to the elbows, usually for 2-6 minutes.
A very long cleaning time (10 minutes) is not necessary.
At the time of washing, the water on the front of the front should not run for the hands.
After washing hands are finished, hands are injected with a sterilized towel and the surgical bat is dressed.
To reduce the spread of germs, it is better to wash your hands or use an antiseptic for your hands before and after treating a patient.
For the control of staphylocococcal infections in hospitals, it was found that there was a greater benefit of hand cleaning in the first 20% washing, and a slightly significant additional benefit was obtained when the clearance rate exceeded 35%.
Washing with common soap more than triples the rate of bacterial infectious diseases transmitted to food compared to washing with an antibacterial soap. Comparing hand hygiene with an alcohol-based solution with washing hands with an antibacterial soap for an average period of 30 seconds for each revealed that the hygiene of the alcohol-based hands reduced bacterial contamination by 26% more than an antibacterial soap.
However, soap and water are more effective than alcohol-based hand hygieners to reduce influenza A, H1N1, and Clostridium strains difficult in their hands. The interventions to increase the hygiene of hands in hospital environments can involve the awareness of the team on hand washing, increased availability of hand hygiene on alcohol-based and verbal and written warnings to the team.
There is a need for more research on which interventions are more effective in different health facilities.
In developing countries, washing hands with soap is considered an essential economically viable tool for good health and even better nutrition.
However, the absence of reliable water sources, sand or resources for washing hands in people's homes, schools and workplaces makes it a challenge to win the universal practice of washing hands.
For example, in most rural Africa, hand washing tournaments near any public or private bathrooms are rare, although there are cheap options for the construction of hand washing stations.
However, low wash rates of hands can rather be the result of degraded habits and not of the lack of soap and water.
The incentive and protection of hand washing with soap can influence political decisions, raise awareness of the benefits of hand washing and cause a long-term change in behaviour of the population.
For this to work effectively, monitoring and evaluation are necessary.
A systematic review of 70 studies found that community-based approaches are effective for increasing hand washing in low and middle-income countries, while social marketing campaigns are less effective. An example for promoting school washout is UNICEF's "three-star approach" which encourages schools to take simple and cheap steps to ensure that students wash their hands with soap, among other hygiene requirements.
When a minimum level is reached, schools can go from one to the maximum three stars.
The construction of hand washing stations can be part of the promotional hand washing campaigns aimed at reducing child diseases and mortality.
The World Day for Hand Washing is another example of awareness campaign that tries to achieve a change of habit. As a result of the 2019-2020 Coronavirus pandemic, UNICEF has published the adoption of an emio for hand washing.
Few studies considered the overall cost/benefit ratio of hand washing in developing countries in relation to classification in DALY.
However, an analysis suggests that promoting washing hands with soap is significantly more profitable than other water and sanitation interventions.
The importance of washing hands for human health — especially for people in vulnerable circumstances such as mothers who just gave birth to light or wounded soldiers in hospitals — was initially recognized in the mid-19th century by two prefects of hand hygiene: Hungarian doctor Ignaz Semmelweis who worked in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, the English "founder of modern nursing".
At that time, people still believed that infections were caused by unpleasant odors called miasmas.
In the 1980s, food sources and infections associated with health care led the U.S. Disease Control and Prevention Centre to encourage more active hand hygiene as an important way to prevent the spread of infections.
The outbreak of swine flu in 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 caused increased awareness in many countries about the importance of washing hands with soap to protect from such infectious diseases.
For example, cards with "technicals for the proper washing of hands" were hung near the washroom in public bathrooms and in bathrooms of office buildings and airports in Germany.
The word "hands" means declaring the relativity in taking responsibility or being committed to something.
It comes from the Bible passage in Matthew, where Pontius Pilate washed the hands of the decision to cross Jesus Christ, but became a more general phrase of use in some English communities.
In Shakespeare's Macbeth, Lady Macbeth begins to wash her hands systematically in an attempt to clean up an imaginary defect, representing her conscience guilty of crimes she had committed and taken her husband to commit.
It has also been observed that people, after remembering or presenting antithetic acts, tend to wash their hands more frequently than others, and are accustomed to giving more importance to washing equipment.
Moreover, those who can wash their hands after such a vision are less inclined to perform other "cleansing" compensatory acts such as the volunteer.
Religions prescribe washing their hands for hygienic and symbolic purposes. The symbolic washing of their hands, using water, but they do not know, to wash their hands is part of a ritual washing of the characteristic hands in many religions, including Baha'í, Hinduism, tevilah and netillat yadayim in Judaism, the washing of the hands in Christianity, and the adoption in Islam. Religions also indicate the hygiene of their hands, especially after some actions.
Hinduism, Judaism, and Islam allow washing of hands after use of the bath.
And Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism and Islam allow washing of hands before and after meals.
Risk controls at work for COVID-19
Risk control at work for COVID-19 are the application of health and safety methodologies in work for risk control for the prevention of coronary virus disease in 2019 (COVID-19).
The appropriate risk controls at the workplace depend on the workplace and on the work itself, based on the risk assessment of exposure sources, the severity of the disease in the community, and the risk factors of individual workers, which may be vulnerable to the contraction of COVID-19.
According to the Department of Health and Safety at Work (OSHA), less exposure risk functions have a minimum occupational contact with the public and other colleagues, for which basic measures to prevent infection are recommended, including washing hands, encouraging staff to stay home if they are sick, maintaining a respiratory label and a routine cleaning and disinfection of the working environment.
On average exposure risk functions include those that require frequent or direct contact with persons on whom they are not aware of being contaminated or suspected of contamination by COVID-19 but may be infected due to current Community transmission or by travelling abroad.
This includes workers who keep in touch with the general public as in schools, high-density working environments, and in the wholesale market of large volumes.
Risk controls for this group, in addition to basic anti-infection prevention measures, include ventilation using high-efficiency air filters, protective coverings and the provision of individual protection equipment if a person is confirmed with COVID-19.
The OSHA considers that workers in the health and necroteries system who are exposed to people with COVID-19 confirmed or suspected are at high risk of exposure, which increases the risk of exposure to very high if workers perform procedures in people with COVID-19 confirmed or suspected of aerosol generation and collect or handle species of such persons.
Appropriate hazard controls for these workers include engineering controls such as negative pressure ventilation rooms and individual protection equipment suitable for the performance of the work.
The COVID-19 epidemic may have several effects on the workplace.
Workers may be absent from work because they are sick, because they have to take care of other people or because they are afraid of possible exposure.
Trade standards can change, both in terms of which products are in demand as well as the means of purchasing these products (such as buying out of the peak time or through delivery or drive-thru services.
Finally, the sending of items from areas severely affected by COVID-19 may be interrupted. A plan of action and preparation for infectious disease can be used to guide protection actions.
The plans address the risk levels associated with various workplaces and tasks, including exposure sources, risk factors arising from home and community, and risk factors for individual workers such as advanced age or chronic medical conditions.
They also define the controls necessary to address these risks, and the quota plans for situations that may arise as a result of epidemics.
Action plans and preparations for infectious diseases may be subject to national or regional recommendations.
The objectives for action for an epidemic include reducing transmission among officials, protecting people who are at greater risk of developing health problems, maintaining business operations and minimizing adverse effects on other entities in the supply chain.
The severity of the disease in the community, where the company is located, affects the actions taken.
The hazard control hierarchy is a widely used health and safety structure of work to group the risk controls by efficiency.
When the risks of COVID-19 cannot be eliminated, the most effective controls are engineering controls followed by administrative controls and, finally, individual protection equipment.
Engineering controls involve insinuating workers of work-related risks without counting the behaviour of the worker, and may be the most economic implementation solution.
Engineering controls are changes in the policy or working procedures that require the action of the worker or employee.
Individual protection equipment (EPI) is considered less effective than engineering and administrative controls, but can help prevent certain exposures.
All types of EPIs should be selected on the basis of the risk to the worker, adjusted properly according to the necessary (respirators, for example), used properly and continuously, inspected regularly, stored and replaced as necessary, and removed, cleaned and stored or disposed of properly to avoid contamination.
According to the U.S. Department of Health and Safety at Work (OSHA), jobs at low exposure risk have minimum employment contact with the public and other colleagues.
Basic measures for prevention of infection recommended for all workplaces include frequent and meticulous washing of hands, incentives for workers to stay home if they are sick and use the respiratory label, including shutting up the breath and tossing, preparing containers for lenses and joint washing, preparing for work or for scaled turns, if necessary, the disincentive of the use of tools and equipment of other workers and maintaining a routine of cleaning and disinfection of the working environment.
The rapid identification and isolation of potentially infected individuals is an essential step in protecting workers, clients, visitors and others at the workplace.
The U.S. Disease Control and Prevention Centre (CDC) recommends that employees presenting symptoms of acute respiratory diseases stay at home until they have no more fever, fever signs or any other symptoms for at least 24 hours without the use of medication to reduce fever or other symptoms, and also recommends that disease licensing policies be flexible, allow employees to stay at home to care for a patient in the family and that they have science of these policies.
According to OSHA, work at the average risk of exposure includes those who require frequent or direct contact of 6 feet (1.8 m) with persons who are not known to be confirmed or suspected with COVID-19, but may be infected by SARS-CoV-2 due to current Community transmission at the company's location, or because the individual has a recent history of travel abroad, in a country with a high transmission of COVID-19.
These include workers who have contact with the public in general as in schools, high-density working environments and some high-density wine shops. Engineering controls for this group and for higher risk groups include the installation of high-efficiency air filters, the increase in ventilation, the installation of physical barriers, such as transparent fronts of plastics and the installation of a drive-threat window for customers. Administrative controls for this group and groups of higher-risk guards include the incentive for workers to stay home, the replacement of meetings by virtual communication, the establishment of scaled turnouts, the cancellation of rims of the rims, the trawling of the trawls, the trawling of the trawl, the trawling of the trawl of the trawl, the trawl of the trawl, the trawl of the trawl, the trawl of the trawl and the trawl of the trajectoral trajectoral trajectors, the
Workers in this risk group rarely need breathing.
If a person is sick on a plane, adequate controls to protect workers and other passengers include the isolation of the patient from other people for a distance of 6 feet, with the designation of a member of the crew to serve the patient and offer her a facial mask, or request that the sick person cover his mouth and nose with tossing or breathing lenses.
The crew should use depleted medical needles when using a patient's passenger or when touching potentially contaminated body fluids or surfaces and possibly additional individual protection equipment if the patient is exposed to fever, persistent cough or difficulty breathing.
Luvas and other perishable items shall be disposed of in a bag for biological risk residues, and contaminated surfaces shall be cleaned and disinfected. For commercial transport, including cruise ships and other ships with passengers, hazardous controls shall include the addition of travel by the patient, self-insulation and immediate communication to the medical centre on board if someone presents fever or other symptoms during the journey.
The ideal is that medical follow-up takes place in the cabin of the isolated person. For schools and child care centres, the CDC recommends temporary closure for cleaning and disinfection if an infected person was present in the front, regardless of the spread of the virus in the community.
When there is a moderate minimum Community transmission, social distance strategies can be implemented, such as cancelling trips in field, assemblies, and other large groups such as physical or Korean education classes, or lunches in a chain, increasing space between tables, times of arrival and more rigid departure, limiting non-essential visitors and using a separate place of health care for children with flu-sympathic symptoms.
When there is significant transmission in the local community, in addition to social distance strategies, extended school expenses may be considered. For law enforcement authorities carrying out daily activities, the risk to immediate health is considered under the CDC.
It is recommended that police officers contact individuals with suspected COVID-19 or with confirmed disease follow the same guidelines as emergency medicine techniques, including the use of appropriate individual protection equipment.
If the direct contact occurs during the arrival, workers must clean up and disinfect their belt and other accessories before using them again using a home cleaning spray or common bread and follow the standard operating procedures for the content and provision of the EPI used and for the contents and washing of the clothes.
The OSHA considers certain health and necroteries workers to be in high or very high exposure risk categories.
High-risk exposure functions include drug delivery workers, medical assistance, laboratories and medical transport, which are exposed to patients with COVID-19 confirmed or suspected.
The risk of exposure becomes very high if workers perform aerosol generation procedures in patients with COVID-19 confirmed or suspected, or collect or handle species of these patients.
Aerosol generation procedures include intubation, induction procedures, bronchoscopy, some dental procedures and tests or invasive collection of species.
High-exposure necroters include workers involved in the preparation of bodies with COVID-19 confirmed or suspected of disease at the time of their death; the risk of exposure becomes very high if they perform autopsy. Additional engineering controls for these risk groups include insulation rooms for patients with COVID-19 confirmed or suspected of the disease, including when aerosol generator procedures are performed.
Specialised ventilation of negative pressure may be appropriate in some scenarios of necroteries and in the area of health.
Species should be managed with caution of level 3 of biosafety.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that patients entering the hospital be separated in two different waiting areas depending on whether they are a suspect case for COVID-19. In addition to other EPIs, OSHA recommends respiratory conditions for professionals working at a distance of 6 feet of patients with confirmed or suspected infection by SARS-CoV-2, and for professionals carrying out aerosol generation procedures.
In the United States, facial breathers with N95 particles filter approved by NISH or high-quality breathers should be used in the context of a comprehensive and written respiratory protection programme which includes adaptation, training and medical examination tests.
Other respiratory types can provide protection and improve the worker's comfort. WHO does not recommend the use of macacions, since COVID-19 is a respiratory disease, and is not transmitted by non-respiratory body fluids.
WHO only recommends a surgical mask for triage officials at the entrance point.
For professionals who collect respiratory species, treat or transport patients with COVID-19 without aerosol generation procedures, WHO recommends a surgical mask, facial protection glasses or protective glasses, surgical adventure and lungs.
If an aerosol generation procedure is performed, the surgical mask is replaced by a N95 or FFP2 respiratory tract.
Since the overall supply of EPIs is insufficient, WHO recommends minimizing the need for EPIs through telemedicine, physical barriers such as clear windows, allowing only those involved in direct care to patients enter into a coma with a patient with COVID-19, using only the EPI necessary for the specific task, continuous use of the same respiratory device without removing it while dealing with several patients with the same diagnosis, monitors and coordinates the series of EPI supplements and disables the use of masks by individuals with symptoms.

ASSURANCE: [Covid-19] Meeting the problems and preparing for the future
Date/time: 14 March 2020, 00:24 UTC
Licensing: CC0: No rights reserved
People are in unusual circumstances this month.
The COVID-19 epidemic is something that makes our global human interconnection and the responsibilities we have in relation to the other.
Its challenges have not gone forward, but we know that our best actions are accompanied by global empathy, cooperation and the creation of communities, which are the foundations of this organization.
The entrepreneurship and concern we have seen among all our colleagues through e-mails, links and conversations is a remarkable validation of the amazing human beings with whom we have the privilege of working.
I am extremely grateful and proud to have all of you as colleagues.
Last week someone shared with me their recognition for our work.
That person reminded me of how significant it is for the world to be able to access Wikipedia now, and how powerful it is that this essential resource continues online and available to all.
Your work makes it possible because you keep the active workplaces, pay our colleagues and maintain the safety of our communities.
The world needs the information Wikipedia provides, more than ever.
This is a time when not only do what we do but the way we do it will have a significant impact on the world.
Given the importance of this mission and its role in it, we will make important adjustments in the way we work together, starting next week.
You adjusted to our work and schedules
As Robyn mentioned earlier, team C met last night to discuss our approach and schedules for the next few days and months.
At this meeting, we consider what we think is an appropriate action for which we are living and the best way to keep the organization sustainable during this period.
We want to end stress and support our long-term mission.
If you need to stay away for a while, there's no problem.
For all employees, service providers and contract workers:
our daily work expectation will be 4 hours, or 20 hours a week, until the contrary is provided.
We are not declaring a holiday. If you can work in the normal time, it may be useful for our mission.
However, the world is unpredictable now, and if you need to care for loved ones, buy maintenance or go to the doctor, your well-being is our priority.
We're not monitoring your schedules.
If he's sick, don't work.
That rule would not have to be expressed, but we decided to declare it.
There is no need to be certified or paid. Just inform your manager of your team's help in reviewing the calendar and schedules to ensure that key areas of work are provided.
(If you are diagnosed with COVID-19, report to Bryan of the training and certification sector so that its sector can help you and ensure that your situation receives proper attention from management).
The staff working per hour shall receive the full payment.
We have already said this, and we are committed to honouring our commitment to our employees and employees working time.
All will receive their salaries on the basis of their normal working expenses under normal circumstances.
Salaries depend on whether you are sick and unable to work.
If you want to work, we give you full support.
Many people see work as a way to channel stress due to the current situation in the world.
The work we do can be incredibly rewarding, especially in times like these.
Remembering that your well-being is more important.
We just asked you to communicate with your manager so that we could know what to expect and we can help the activities properly.
Some functions are considered essential.
There are activities we must continue to perform.
The site reliability engineering teams, RH, Trust and Security and Funding (including others) perform essential activities that may require additional support.
We will start a process with all departments to assess the current objectives and change our focus to support what is essential for our mission.
There is much to be done for all of us, and we will focus our efforts on more important projects.
Dishesing now won't hurt us in the future.
We don't intend to "work twice to get the time lost" after the pandemic has ended.
It will not be expected that you work extra hours to meet times that are now improbable.
We accept that circumstances have changed, and we will work to define new targets and deadlines, as appropriate.
What will happen to the annual planning?
To adjust to our new reality and expectations of working hours per day, we intend to adjust the timetable for the delivery of our annual 2020-2021 Plan.
Our intention is to propose an extension of our 2019-2020 plan, which will provide more time for the budget, and that employees give priority to essential work, personal care and care for loved ones, while we accommodate those who need or want to work on a reduced day in the coming weeks.
The extension of the timetable greatly reduces current planning work load and pressure throughout the organization.
We will present our proposal to the Director next week and update the representatives and teams on the next steps as soon as we have confirmation.
We thank the annual Planning Team for its leadership in this process.
Status, exposure and cleaning of the office
Last week, we learned that one of our colleagues at work in São Francisco could have been exposed to COVID-19 virus.
In view of this situation, we are careful to use an antiviral cleaning team to disinfect all surfaces in the San Francisco office.
They used a special antiviral solution for hospitals to disinfect all surfaces, as well as the entrance corner and all lifters that give access to our walk.
The prejudice is using its own due diligence protocol using products that are safe for its participants.
We are relieved of the fact that the office will be duly prepared for our decision to return.
Our office in Washington is located in a WeWork, which shared its protocol to COVID-19 with me and all Washington officials.
Last week, our office in Washington changed to a completely remote configuration, in line with the shared guide with São Francisco.
As some of our colleagues in New York know, we are also discussing the location of a office in Brooklyn.
These discussions continue to take place, but they can be delayed.
Some of our colleagues are working away for the first time.
Our colleagues who have worked long ago know that it can be an adjustment, and they would like to offer some advice:
They shall limit the duration of the meetings to a maximum of one or two hours.
If sessions with greater duration are necessary, they are considered to be divided in several days.
They define the meeting, have a programming and send material before reading.
Use videos as default, with tools such as Google Docs and Zoom to facilitate real-time collaboration and connection.
They have a leader to facilitate meetings, someone who monitors questions in the chat and the list of participants, and someone to help make notes (or collaborative notes).
Send an e-mail to technical support if you need comfortable hearing phones.
Use your emergency aids to buy lenses.
Participate in the #remoties channel to talk to your colleagues about the remote work
The RH operation team is looking for ergonomic guidelines in the context of the webinar to help increase remote work in the Foundation.
Last week, we asked all community aid recipients to cancel public events funded by Wikimedia, such as the editing marathons, until WHO declared the end of the pandemic.
We warned them that our request for cancellation and other restrictions could prevent the completion of their agreed subsidy activities and that no one would be punished for prolonging or modifying their objectives.
In the coming week, we will continue with additional guidelines on Wikimania and other regional and thematic conferences for the community.
The general feeling in the world community seems to be sad with paralysis, but also with clarity and ability to keep focus on its own communities, in Wikimedia and in other situations.
The communication resource team is working on creating a page in Meta-Wiki to provide space for the community to monitor the impact and receive our communications to it.
Maintaining updated on issues related to COVID-19
We will send an invitation to your calendars for the next Thursday at 14:00 UTC/ 07:00 PT for a special meeting with staff.
We will use this time to share additional updates, answer your questions and spend some time connecting each other.
We're in this together and we'll help with what's needed.
Meanwhile, you can continue to find information about this email and all other information related to COVID-19 on the company's wiki.
The communication resource team will update these pages and all information in a single location.
We are also working to maintain regular communication with officials living in countries that are currently significantly affected.
If you have any questions about travel, events, a main workflow, or the coverage challenge, or anything else you may need to help, do not stop notifying it and working with the communication resource team.
We are here to help provide support and cooperation as needed.
If you have a confidential or sensitive matter, send an e-mail to Bryan Juden, Director of Global RH Operations.
None of these changes should be seen as leaving our work and obligations.
They are, however, a recognition that our work and obligations will probably need to be adapted in a way that we did not adapt in the past.
These are the steps we believe to be necessary as support at this time, so that we can continue working, providing our movement with the support they need and providing the service it depends on.
Our planned work will be our expectation when the time comes.
Therefore, it is time to support each other and create space for the important work that will be done in the weeks, and probably next month.
We need all of you to make this happen, so we need everyone to take care of themselves and their family so that they are in their best position when necessary.
Wash your hands and don't touch your face!

Angiotensin converting enzyme of type 2 (ECA2) is an enzyme attached to the external surface (cell membranes) of the cells of the lungs, arteries, heart, rim, and instincts.
ECA2 neutralizes the activity of the related angiotensin converting enzyme (ECA) by reducing the amount of angiotensin II and raising Ang (1-7), becoming a promising medicine directed to the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. ECA2 also acts as a point of entry into cells for some coronary viruses.
The human version of the enzyme is often referred to as HECA2.
Angiotensin converting enzyme of type 2 is a metaloenzyme that contains zinc located on the surface of endothelial and other cells.
The ECA2 protein contains a peptidase domain M2 N-terminal and a C-terminal transporter domain of amino acids and collectrin in the renal system.
ECA2 is a membrane protein of type 1 single passage, with its enzymaticly active domain exposed to the surface of cells in lungs and other tissues.
The ECA2 extracellular domain is cloned from the transmembrane domain by another enzyme known as sheddase, and the resulting solvent protein is released in the blood stream and finally excreted in the urine.
ECA2 is present in many organs: ECA2 is attached to the cell membrane of the main pulmonary alveolar cells of type II, intestinal enterocytes, arterial endothelial cells and venous venoses and bloodless muscle cells in most organs.
The expression of the ECA2 mRNA is also found in the brain cortex, striad body, hypothalamus, and encephalic trunk.
The main function of the ECA2 is to act as a countermeasure for the ECA.
ECA adapts to type I angiotensin hormone in type II angiotensin causing vasoconstriction.
ECA2 is also known as phenylalanine of angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolysis of vasodilated angiotensin (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-Gist-Pro-OH).
ECA2 also has several other peptides, including [des-Arg9]- bradicin, aplin, neurotensin, dinorphine A, and graine.
ECA2 also regulates transport by the member of the SLC6A19 neutral amino acid carrier and has been involved in Hartnup disease.
As a transmebrane protein, ECA2 works as the main entry point for certain coronary viruses, including HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (the virus that causes SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19).
More specifically, the binding of S1 Spike protein S1 from SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 to the ECA2 enzyme domain on the cell surface results in endocytosis and transfer of the virus and enzyme in intravenously located inside the cells.
This entry process also requires the preparation of S protein by the TMPRSS2 serum-protease host, whose inhibition is under investigation as a potential therapy. This led some to raise the hypothesis that reducing ECA2 levels in the cells may help fight infection.
However, several professional companies and regulatory bodies recommended continuing with ECA’s inhibitory standard and ARB therapy.
A systematic review and metaanalysis published on 11 July 2012 found that "the use of ECA inhibitors was associated with a significant 34% reduction in the risk of pneumonia in relation to controls".
In addition, "the risk of pneumonia was also reduced in patients treated with ECA inhibitors who presented a high risk of contracting pneumonia, especially those with AVC and cardiac failure.
The use of ECA inhibitors was also associated with reduced mortality related to pneumonia, although the results were less robust than for the overall risk of pneumonia".
It is believed that ECA2 human recombinant (rhACE2) is a new treatment for acute pulmonary injury, and it seemed to improve pulmonary hemodynamics and oxygen saturation in pigs with a acute respiratory distress syndrome induced by lipopoliscaride.
The mean life of rhACE2 in human beings is approximately 10 hours and the start of action is 30 minutes after the temporary evolution of effects (length) of 24 hours.
Many findings suggest that rhACE2 can be a promising medicine for those with intolerance to the inhibitors of the classic renin-angiotensin system (RAS inhibitors) or in patients where angiotensin II is high in circulation. The rhACE2 infused has been evaluated in clinical trials for the treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome.
Applications on COVID-19 are mobile software applications to help monitor in response to the 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic, i.e. the process of identifying people ("contacts") who may have been in contact with infected individuals.
A number of applications were developed or proposed, with the official support of the government in some territories and jurisdictions.
Several structures to create contact monitoring applications were developed.
Privacy issues were raised, especially on systems based on tracking the geographical location of the application users.
Less intrusive alternatives include using Bluetooth signals to record user proximity to other mobile phones.
On 10 April 2020, Google and Apple jointly announced that they would integrate functionality to support such Bluetooth-based applications directly to their Android and iOS operating systems.
In China, the Chinese government, together with Ayaha, implemented an application that allows citizens to check whether they were in contact with a COVID-19 carrier person.
He is in use in more than 200 Chinese cities. In Singapore, an application called TraceTogether is being used.
The application was developed by the local IT community, released as an open code and will be issued to the government. North Macedonia launched the "StopKorona!" application based on Bluetooth to track exposure to potentially infected people and provide a quick response to health authorities.
The application was developed by the Ministry of Communication and Technology and by the Ministry of Health.
Since April 14, 2020, the application has been awaiting approval by Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
On 12 April, the government stated that the contact tracking application was in advanced development stage, and would be available for distribution in weeks. A similar application is intended for Ireland and France ("StopCovid").
Australia and New Zealand provide applications based on the Singapore TraceTogether application and the BlueTrace protocol. Russia intends to implement a geographical delimitation application for patients diagnosed with COVID-19 living in Moscow, designed to ensure that they do not leave home.
Ross Anderson, professor of security engineering at Cambridge University, listed a series of potential practical problems with application-based systems, including positive errors and the potential lack of effectiveness if the application's acceptance is limited to a small part of the population.
In response to concerns about the proliferation of false or harmful "coronavirus" applications, Apple sets limits for the types of organisations that may add coronavirus-related applications to its App Store, limiting them only to "official" or otherwise respected organisations.
Google and Amazon have implemented similar restrictions.
Privacy defenders expressed their concern about the implications of mass surveillance using coronavirus applications, especially if the surveillance infrastructure created to deal with the coronavirus pandemic will be eliminated when the threat has passed.
The International Anistia and more than 100 other organizations have issued a communication requesting limits for this type of surveillance.
The organizations declared eight conditions for government projects:
monitoring should be "legal, necessary and proportionate";
extension of monitoring and surveillance should be subject to suspension clauses;
the use of data should be limited to COVID-19;
the safety and anonymity of the data should be protected and presented as protected on the basis of evidence;
digital surveillance should avoid aggravating discrimination and marginalisation;
any sharing of data with third parties should be provided for in law;
there should be protection against abuse and citizens' rights to respond to abuse;
the significant participation of all "relevant stakeholders" would be required, including public health specialists and marginalized groups. The German Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Frontiers (Reporter ohne Borderen) (RSF) also published checklists.
The plan proposed by Google/Apple aims to deal with the persistent surveillance problem by removing the tracking mechanism of its operational device systems when it is no longer necessary.
Some countries used network-based tracking instead of applications, eliminating the need to download an application and the ability to avoid tracking.
In Israel, network-based tracking was approved.
Network-based solutions that have access to gross location data have considerable potential privacy problems.
However, not all systems with central servers need access to personal location data; a number of systems that preserve privacy were created to use central servers only for communication (see section below).
In South Korea, an application-based system was used to run contact tracking.
Instead of using an exclusive application, the system collected trace information from various sources, including data from tracking mobile devices and transaction data with cardboard, combining them to generate warnings via text messages for potentially infected individuals.
In addition to using this information to alert potential interlocutors, the government has also become publicly available information on location, which is allowed due to changes in information confidentiality laws following the departure of MERS in the country.
This information is available to the public through a series of applications and sites. The countries, including Germany, consider using both the privacy conservation system and the centralised one.
The details were not yet published until 6 April 2020.
The tracking of contact preserving privacy is a well-defined concept, with a significant body of scientific bibliography returning to, at least, 2013. Since 7 April 2020, more than a dozen specialist groups have worked on solutions that respect privacy, using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to record user's proximity to other mobile devices.
However, the PEPP-PT is a coordination effort that covers centralised and decentralised approaches, and is not a single protocol. Decentralised protocols include Decentralised privacy- Preserving Proximity Tracking (DP-PPT/DP-3T), Temporary Contact Numbers (TCN, fka Contact Event Numbers, CEN) Privacy Sensitive Protocols and Mechanisms for Mobile Contact Tracking (PACT) and others.
In these protocols, identifiable personal data are never out of the device, and any combination is made on the device.
The Privacy Group at MIT Media Lab has developed Safe Paths, a platform for the use of privacy conservation techniques during the collection and use of location data or trajectory crossing to track the spread of COVID-19.
It is based on research from the technical publication "Applications play sujo: maintaining personal privacy in an epidemic" published in March 2020. Another similar effort is the SafeTrace platform of the Enigma MPC, a commitment that develops privacy technologies and originally based on MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrace uses safe hardware technologies to allow users to share sensitive localization and health data with other users and responsible users, without compromising their privacy.
On 5 April 2020, the TCN Global Coalition was founded by groups that joined around which was essentially the same approach and mostly with the overposition of protocols, with the aim of reducing fragmentation, and allowing global interoperability of alert and tracking applications, a key aspect of the overall success of the generalised adoption.
On 9 April 2020, the government of Singapore announced that the BlueTrace protocol, used by the official application of the government, became an open code.
On 10 April 2020, Google and Apple, companies that control Android and iOS mobile platforms, announced an initiative for tracking contact, in which they claimed to preserve privacy, based on a combination of Bluetooth Low Energy technology and encryption for privacy conservation.
They have also published specifications of the main technologies used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system provides for implementation in three stages:
development of tools to allow government to create official coronavirus tracking applications by maintaining privacy
integration of this feature directly into iOS and Android; Google and Apple are planning to face persistent and assumed surveillance problems by first distributing the system by operating systems updates, and later removing it in the same way as the threat ends.
Medicinal product subject to medical prescription (also known as drug reproduce, reperfilation, re-attached or therapeutic substitution) is the proposal for an approved medicinal product for the treatment of a medical condition or disease other than that for which it was originally developed.
This is one of the scientific research lines currently being adopted to develop safe and effective treatments for COVID-19.
Other research guidelines include the development of a convalescent plasma transfusion and vaccine for COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 has about 66 drug proteins, each with multiple binding points.
Analyzing these link points provides the reasonable project of developing effective antiviral drugs against COVID-19 proteins.
Among the most important proteins of SARS-CoV-2 are protein similar to papina, RNA polymerase dependent on RNA, helicase, S protein and ADP triphosphatase.
Hussein A. A., et al., studied several components of candidates who then perfected and analyzed their structural similarities with the most approved drugs in order to accelerate the development of a powerful drug against SARS-CoV-2 in its pre-clinical study to be recommended for a clinical study concept.
Chloroquina is a drug against malaria that is also used against some autoimmune diseases.
On 18 March, WHO announced that related chloroquine and hydroxyroquine would be among the four drugs studied as part of the clinical trial of Solidarity.
The governor of New York Andrew Cuomo announced that the tests with chloroquine and hydroxyroquine of New York State began on 24 March. On 28 March, the FDA authorised the use of hydroxyroquin sulphate and chlorocine phosphate through an Emergency Use Authorisation (EU).
Treatment has not been approved by the FDA clinical trial process and is only authorised by the EU as an experimental treatment for emergency use in hospitalised patients who cannot receive treatment in a clinical trial.
The CDC said that "the use, dosage or duration of hydroxyroquine for the prevention or treatment of infection by SARS-CoV-2" is not yet established.
Doctors said they're using the drug when there's no other option.
In Istanbul, a Turkish research team is conducting a small study on the use of chloroquine in combination with zinc, vitamin A, vitamin C and vitamin D.
Large studies are underway at Duke University and Oxford University.
The NYU Langone School of Medicine is conducting a study on the safety and efficacy of the preventive use of hydroxyroquine.
Chinese clinical trials in Wuhan and Shenzhen have shown that favipiravir was "clearly effective".
In Shenzhen, 35 patients tested negative within 4 days on average, while the duration of the disease in 45 patients who did not receive it was 11 days.
In a study conducted in Wuhan with 240 patients with pneumonia, half was treated with favipinavir, and half received imifenovir.
The Italian Pharmacética Agency reminded the population that the evidence available for embassies of the medicine is rare and preliminary.
On April 2, Germany announced that it would buy Japan's medicine to store it and use the army to deliver it to university hospitals, where it would be used to treat patients with COVID-19.
According to the South China Morning Post, Shinzo Abe has created openings for the administration of Trump on the purchase of the medicine. The medicine may be less effective in serious cases of the disease when the virus has already multiplied.
Its use may not be safe for pregnant women or women trying to pregnant.
A study of lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra), a combination of lopinavir and ritonavir antibodies, concluded that "no benefit has been observed".
The drugs were developed to prevent the replication of HIV by binding with protease.
A team of researchers at the University of Colorado is trying to modify the drugs to find a component that is linked to SARS-CoV-2. There are criticisms in the scientific community about directing resources to reproduce drugs specifically developed for HIV/AIDS.
WHO included lopinavir/ritonavir in the International Solidarity Test.
The remdesivir was created and developed by Gilead Sciences as a treatment for Ebola virus and infections by Marburg virus. The Gilead Sciences discovered after remdesivir presented in vitro antiviral activity against HIV, pneumonia, paramyx and coronavirus.
One of the problems with antiviral treatment is the resistance developed by mutations, which may cause more serious transmissions or diseases.
Some initial pre-tests suggest that remdesivir may have a high genetic barrier to resistance. There are several ongoing clinical trials, including two conducted by Cleveland University Hospitals, one for people with moderate disease and one for those with more serious disease.
There are three clinical trials with intravenous vitamin C in patients who are hospitalised and seriously ill with COVID-19: two of them are controlled by placebo (in China and Canada), while the other does not have control groups (Italy).
The state of New York began testing with azithromycin, an antibiotic, on March 24, 2020.
Japan’s National Centre for Health and Global Medicine (NCGM) is planning a clinical trial of Alvesco (cyclicalsonida), of Teijin, which is an inalienable corticosteroid for asthma. The goal is to treat pre-symptomatic patients infected with the new coronavirus.
Phase II of a study with a type of angiotensin 2 converting enzyme is ongoing with 200 patients, being recruited between the serious cases hospitaled in Denmark, Germany and Austria to determine the effectiveness of treatment.
At the moment, researchers from the Institute of the Heart in Canada are researching the function of colchicin in reducing pulmonary complications and inflammation in patients with mild symptoms of COVID-19.
The study, called COLCORONA, is recruiting 6,000 adults over 40 years of age, diagnosed with COVID-19 and with mild symptoms, which did not require hospitalization.
They were not included in pregnant women's tests, which are loving or do not use effective contraceptive methods.
Several anticoagulants are tested in Italy.
Heparin, low molecular weight, is being widely used in the treatment of patients, which led the Italian Medicines Agency to publish guidance on the use.
A multicentre study, with 300 patients, is analysing the use of sodium enoxaparin in prophylaxis and therapeutic doses. The study was announced on April 14 in Italy.
Because SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, the attention of the scientific community has been considered to give new purpose to antiviral medicines approved and developed for the treatment of previous outbreaks such as MERS, SARS and the West Nile virus.
Ribavirin: ribavirin was recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 according to the 7th edition of the Chinese Guidelines
Umifenovir: umifenovir was recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 according to the 7th edition of the Chinese Guidelines
Some antibiotics have been identified as being able to receive a new purpose for the treatment of patients with COVID-19:
Tocilizumab (anti-IL-6 receptor): approved in China.
There are also tests in Italy and China. See Tocilizumab#COVID-19.
The vaccine for COVID-19 is a hypothetical vaccine against the 2019 coronary virus (COVID-19).
Although there is no vaccine with the clinical tests completed, there are several ongoing attempts to develop it.
At the end of February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) stated that no vaccine would be expected against SARS-CoV-2, disease-producing virus, available for less than 18 months.
Five vaccine candidates were in phase I of the safety studies in April.
COVID-19 was identified in December 2019.
A major outbreak in 2020 led to significant investments and research activities for the development of a vaccine.
Several organizations are using published genes for the development of possible vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.
The initiative of the Coalition of Innovation in Epidemic Preparation, CEPI, stated in April that the requirements for the development of the vaccine are speed, manufacturing capacity, large-scale development and global access.
In April, CEPI scientists reported 10 different technology platforms being researched and developing during the beginning of 2020 to create an effective vaccine against COVID-19.
The objectives of the major platforms that advanced for phase I safety studies include:
nuclear acid (DNA or RNA) ( phase I developer and vaccine candidate: Modern, mRNA-1273)
viral vector ( phase I developer and vaccine candidate: CanSino Biologicals, 5-type vector adenovirus)
According to ECPI scientists reported in April, a total of 115 candidates for vaccines are in the initial stages of development, with 78 of them confirmed as active projects (79 according to the Milken Institute). Other 37 were announced, but with little information available to the public (considered as planning or planning).
A phase I-II test conducts a preliminary safety and immunogenicity test. It is typically randomized, controlled by placebo and multicentre, while setting more precise and effective doses.
Phase III tests typically involve more participants in a control group. They test the effectiveness of the vaccine in preventing disease while monitoring adverse effects at the ideal dose.
Of the 79 candidates for active development vaccine (confirmed at the beginning of April 2020), 74 had not yet been evaluated in human beings (the following preclinical study).
On 24 January 2020, in Australia, the University of Queensland announced that it is investigating the potential of a vaccine with a molecular gram, which would genetically modify viral proteins to stimulate an immune reaction.
On January 24, 2020, in Canada, the International Vaccines Centre (VIDO-InterVac) at the University of Saskatchewan announced the beginning of work in a vaccine, with the objective of testing in human beings in 2021.

in the development and manufacture of a vaccine.
The partners subsequently announced plans for pre-clinical testing and Phase I clinical studies in July 2020.
On 12 March 2020, the Ministry of Health of India announced that they are working with 11 isolates and, even at an accelerated pace, would take at least one year and two years to develop a vaccine.
On 12 March 2020, Medicago, a biotechnology company in the city of Quebec, reported on the development of a particle similar to Coronavirus under partial funding from the Canadian Institutes for Health Research.
The candidate for the vaccine is researched in the laboratory, with human tests planned for July or August 2020.
At the beginning of that week, The Guardian stated that the President of the United States, Donald Trump, offered CureVac "great amounts of money for exclusive access to the Covid-19 vaccine" in protest from the German government.
On 17 March 2020, the pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced a partnership with the German company BioNTech to develop together a vaccine based on mRNA.
BNT162, a candidate vaccine based on mRNA, currently in preclinical testing, with clinical trials expected to begin in April 2020.
In Italy on 17 March 2020, Takis Biotech, an Italian biotechnology company announced that it would have results from preclinical tests in April 2020 and its final vaccine candidate could leave for human tests in October.
In France, on 19 March 2020, the Coalition of Innovations in Preparation for Epidemic (CEPI) announced an investment of $4.9 million in a research group for COVID-19 involving the Institute Pasteur, Themis Bioscience (Vienna, Austria), and the University of Pitttsburgh, leading the total investment of CEPI in the development of the vaccine to COVID-19 to $29 million.
The other CEPI investment partners for the development of the vaccine for COVID-19 are Moderna, Curevac, Innovation, Novax, Hong Kong University, Oxford University, and Queensland University.
On 20 March 2020, the Russian health authorities announced that scientists began testing in animals of six different candidates.
Researchers at the Imperial College in London announced on March 20, 2020 that they are developing a self-amplifying RNA vaccine for COVID-19.
The candidate for the vaccine was developed within 14 days of receipt of the Chinese follow-up.
In late March, the Canadian government announced C$ 275 million in funding for 96 research projects on medical countermeasures against COVID-19, including several candidates for vaccines in Canadian companies and universities, such as Medicago and the University of Saskatchewan.
Almost during the same period, the Canadian government announced C$ 192 million specifically to develop the vaccine for COVID-19, with plans to establish a national "vacine bank" of several new vaccines that could be used if other sources of Coronavirus occur.
On 2 April 2020, researchers at the Pittsburgh School of Medicine reported the PittCoVacc test, a possible vaccine against COVID-19 in rats, stating that "The MNA delivered vaccines from SARS-CoV-2 subunit S1 that caused strong responses of specific antibodies to antigens [in mice] that were evident to have begun 2 weeks after immunization."
In Canada on 16 April 2020, the University of Waterloo Pharmacy School announced the development of a candidate for DNA-based vaccine as possible a nasal spray.
Using bacteria, DNA will be planned to reproduce within a human bacteria to produce non-infectious particles similar to the virus, which can stimulate the immunological system to produce antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
In March 2020, the government, industry and three U.S. universities gathered resources to access IBM supercomputers combined with Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft and Google cloud computing.
Some vaccines have heterological effects, also called non-specific effects.
This means that they can benefit beyond the disease she prevents.
A post-randomized test in Australia is trying to register 4.170 health workers.
It is possible that developmental vaccines are not safe or effective.
Initial studies to evaluate the effectiveness of the vaccine using specimens of specific animals for COVID-19 such as the ACE2 transgenic rat, other non-human laboratory animals and primates indicate a need for biosafety measures at level 3 to manipulate live viruses, and international coordination to ensure standardized safety procedures.
Vaccines against SARS and MERS have already been tested in samples of non-human animals.
In 2020, there is no cure or vaccine that protects against SARS that has been shown to be safe and effective in humans.
According to research documents published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of new vaccines and medicines to treat SARS was a priority for governments and public health agencies around the world. There is also no verified vaccine against MERS.
When MERS became predominant, it was believed that the existing SARS research could provide a useful model for the development of vaccines and treatment against MERS-CoV infection.
Since March 2020, there has been a vaccine against MERS (based on DNA) that has completed phase I of clinical studies in humans, and three others in progress, all of which are vaccinated by virus, two with adenoviral vector (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac), and one vectorized by MVA (MVA-MERS-S).
Social media publications promoted a theory of conspiracy claiming that the virus behind COVID-19 was known and that a vaccine was already available.
The patents quoted by various social media publications indicate existing patents for genetic sequences and vaccines for other strains of Coronavirus such as Coronavirus SARS.
The disease by Betacoronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a severe respiratory syndrome of Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and difficulty breathing.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhoea, throat pain, loss of olfactory and abdominal pain.
The time of exposure until the start of symptoms is about 5 days, but it can vary from two to fourteen days.
Although most cases result in mild symptoms, some evolve into a viral pneumonia and multiple organ failure.
Since 17 April 2020, more than 2.24 million cases have been reported in 210 countries and territories, resulting in more than 153,000 deaths.
More than 568 000 people have already been treated. The virus is spread mainly among people during direct contact, usually through gothicles produced by the toss, breath or speech.
Although these gothicles are produced by exploding, they usually fall on the ground or remain on surfaces rather than remain infected in long distances.
People may also be infected by touching contaminated surfaces and then touch their eyes, nose or mouth.
The virus can survive on surfaces for up to 72 hours.
It is more contagious during the first 3 days after the start of symptoms, although distribution may be possible before symptoms appear and in post-patient stages. The standard diagnosis method is due to reaction in the polymerase chain of real-time reverse transcription (rRT-PCR) of a nasopharyngeal swab.
The use of masks is recommended for people suspected of virus and for people responsible for their care.
Recommendations for the use of masks by the general population vary, where some authorities recommend non-use, some recommend use and others recommend use.
Currently, there is no specific antiviral vaccine or treatment for COVID-19.
The local transmission of the disease was recorded in most countries throughout the six WHO regions.
Infections with the virus may be asymptomatic or develop symptoms like flu, cough, fatigue and difficulty breathing.
Emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing, pain or persistent pressure in the chest, confusion, difficulty keeping alert, face or blue lips.
Less common, symptoms of higher respiratory tract than ghosts, snoring nose or throat pain can be seen.
Gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea were observed in different percentages.
Some cases in China initially presented only open in the chest and palpitations.
In some, disease can develop into pneumonia, multiple organ failure, and death.
This is the so-called incubation period.
The incubation period for COVID-19 is usually six days, but may vary from two to 14 days.
97.5% of people who develop symptoms will develop them within 11.5 days of infection. Reports indicate that not all infections will develop symptoms.
The role these asymptometics play in transmission is not yet fully known; however, a preliminary evidence suggests that they can contribute to the spread of the disease.
The proportion of people infected with no symptoms is currently unknown and is being studied, and the Korean Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reported that 20% of all confirmed cases remained asymptomatic during their stay in the hospital.
The National Health Commission of China began to include asymptomatic cases in its daily cases on 1 April; of the 166 infections on that day, 130 (78%) were asymptomatic at the time of the test.
Scatter and salva can load large viral loads.
Speaking high-free is more Gothic than speaking in a normal way.
A study in Singapore found that tossing without covering your mouth can make your gothicles reach 4.5 meters (15 feet).
Although the virus is not generally transported by air, the National Academy of Science suggested that bioaerosol transmission can be possible and air collectors located in corridors outside the rooms of people contain positive samples for a viral RNA.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and cardiopulmonary reanimation (RCP), may generate respiratory secrets that will be aerosolized and therefore transmitted by air.
Although there is concern that it can be transmitted via faeces, it is believed that the risk is low. The virus is more contagious when people are symptomatic. Although it is possible to have transmission before symptoms appear, the risk is low.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) states that although it is not fully clear how easily the disease is spread, normally one or two people are infected. The virus survives for hours or days on the surface.
In particular, it was found that the virus was detectable for one day in paper, up to three days in plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304) and up to four hours in copper 99%.
This, however, depends on humidity and temperature.
Savannah and detergent are also effective if used properly. Savannah products degradation the protective lipid envelope of the virus, dissipating it, in addition to removing it from the skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions, such as benzalconium chloride and chlorexidine glyconate (a surgical disinfectant), are less effective. In a study conducted in Hong Kong, saliva samples were collected on average two days after hospitalization.
In five of the six patients, the first sample presented the highest viral load, while the sixth patient presented the highest viral load on the second day tested.
The acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus that was first isolated in three persons with pneumonia that related to a group of cases of acute respiratory diseases in Wuhan.
All features of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus occur in nature, in related coronavirus.
Outside of the human body, the virus dies in contact with domestic sand, breaking its protective layer. SARS-CoV-2 is closely linked to the original SARS-CoV.
The lungs are the most affected organs by COVID-19 because the virus accesses the host cells by means of angiotensin 2 converting enzyme (ACE2), which is more abundant in the pulmonary alveolar type II cells.
The virus uses a special surface glycoprotein called "peplomer" to connect to ACE2 and enter the host cell.
Acute cardiac injury was observed in 12% of the infected people who were admitted to the hospital in Wuhan, China, and is more frequent in severe disease.
Cardiovascular symptoms rate is high due to systemic inflammatory response and immune system disorders during the disease evolution, but acute myocardial injury may also be related to ACE2 receptors in the heart.
ACE2 receptors are highly expressed in the heart and are involved in the heart function.
A high incidence of thrombosis (31%) and venous thromboembolism (25%) was found in ITI patients with COVID-19 infections and can be related to ruptured prognosis. Necropsies of people who died from COVID-19 showed spread alveolar damage (DAD) and inflammatory infiltrates containing lymphocytes in the lungs.
Although SARS-CoV-2 has a tropical to epithelial cells of respiratory tract that express ACE2, patients with severe COVID-19 experience symptoms of systemic hyperinflammation.
In particular, it was demonstrated that pathogenic T cells that secret GM-CSF have a correlation with the recruitment of IL-6 secretionary monocytosis and severe lung pathology in patients with COVID-19.
Lyphocytic infiltrations have also been reported in neuropsychiatric patients.
WHO has published several test protocols for the disease.
The standard test method is the reaction in the polymerase chain through reverse transcription in real time (rRT-PCR).
The test is usually performed in respiratory samples obtained through a nasopharyngeal swab, however, can be used a nasal swab or cataract sample.
The results are usually available within hours up to two days.
Blood tests may be used, but for this it is necessary to collect two blood samples with two weeks of difference and the results have little immediate value.
Chinese scientists were able to isolate a branch of coronavirus and publish its genetic sequence so that laboratories around the world could develop independently reaction tests in the polymerase chain (PCR) to detect infection by the virus.
Since 4 April 2020, tests through antibodies (which can detect active infections and if a person has been infected in the past) have been developing but have not been widely used.
The experience of the Chinese with the test showed that their accuracy is from 60 to 70%.
The United States FDA approved the first remote laboratory test on 21 March 2020 for use at the end of that month. The diagnostic guidelines released by zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University suggest methods for detecting infections based on clinical resources and epidemiological risk.
Foscic glass opacities multilobar bilaterally with peripheral, asymmetric and later distribution are common at the beginning of the infection.
Subpleural Dominance, mosaic flooring (seven lobbyists with variable alveolar filling) and consolidation may occur as the disease progresses.
There are few data available regarding microscopic lesions and COVID-19 physiopathology.
The main pathological findings during autopsy are:
Macroscopy: plurisia, pericarditis, pulmonary consolidation and pulmonary oedema
Four types of severity of viral pneumonia may be observed:
mild pneumonia: pulmonary oedema, pulmonary hyperplasia, large atypical pneumonia, interstitial inflammation with lymphocyte infiltration and formation of multinucleated giant cells
severe pneumonia: spread alveolar damage (DAD) with diffuse alveolar exudes.
DAD is the cause of acute respiratory discomfort (SDRA) and severe hypoxia.
treated pneumonia: organisation of exudes in alveolare veins and interstitial pulmonary fibrosis
Blood: dispersal intravascular coagulation (CID); leukoirrhoblastic reaction
Preventive measures to reduce infection chances include staying home, avoiding places with many people, often washing hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, practicing good respiratory hygiene and avoiding touching eyes, nose and mouth with without washing hands.
The CDC recommends covering the mouth and nose with a tossing or breathing lens, as well as closing the mouth with the inside of the neck if the lens is not available.
The proper hygiene of your hand after you touch or breathe is encouraged.
The CDC recommended the use of bread masks in public places, in part to limit the transmission by asymmetric individuals. Social distance strategies aim to reduce contact between people infected with large groups by closing schools and workplaces, restricting travel and canceling large public meetings.
The distance guidelines also include that people stay at least 1.8 metres (6 feet) away from each other.
There is no known effective medicine for the prevention of COVID-19. Since the vaccine should not be launched before 2021, a key point for the control of COVID-19 is to try to reduce the tip of the epidemic, also known as "curve arrest".
The CDC also recommends that individuals wash their hands frequently using soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom or when their hands are visiblely dry, before eating and after absorbing the nose, tossing or breathing.
It also recommends using antiseptic for hands alcohol base at least 60% of alcohol, but only when soap and water are not readily available. For places where antiseptics for commercial hands are not readily available, WHO provides two formulations for local production.
In these formulations, antimicrobial activity is given through ethanol or isopropanol.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to help eliminate bacterial spores in alcohol; it is not "an active substance for hand aspsychiatry".
Glycerol is added as softener.
People are treated with palliative care, which may include fluid therapy, oxygen support and support for other vital organs affected.
The CDC recommends that people who suspect they are with the virus use a simple facial mask.
The oxygenation of the extracorporate membrane (ECMO) was used to address the problem of respiratory failure, but its benefits are still being analysed.
Personal hygiene and healthy lifestyle and diet are being recommended to improve immunity.
Support treatments can be useful for those people with mild symptoms and early stages of infection. WHO and the National Health Commission of China have published recommendations for the care of people hospitalized with COVID-19.
U.S. intensive and pneumologists gathered recommendations for the treatment of various agencies in a free resource, the IBCC.
Until April 2020, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19.
For symptoms, some health professionals recommend paracetamol (acetamine) instead of ibuprofen for first-line use.
Caution should be taken to minimise the risk of virus transmission, especially in the health environment, when procedures are being conducted that may generate aerosols such as manual intubation and ventilation.
For health professionals caring for people with COVID-19, the CDC recommends placing the person in rooms with insulation of infections transmitted by air (SIIA) in addition to taking standard precautions, contact precautions and air precautions. The CDC summarizes the guidelines for the use of personal protection equipment (EPI) during the pandemic.
The recommended equipment is: hold of an EPI, breather or facial mask, visual protection and medical needles. When available, it is preferable to use breathers instead of facial masks.
N95 respiratory systems are approved for industrial environments, but the FDA authorised masks for use under Emergency Use Authorisation (USA).
They were designed to protect against air particles as dust, but their effectiveness against a specific biological agent is not guaranteed for undefined uses.
When masks are not available, the CDC recommends the use of facial shadows or, as a last resort, home masks.
Most cases of COVID-19 are not serious enough to require mechanical ventilation or alternatives, but a percentage of cases are.
The type of respiratory support for individuals with respiratory failure related to COVID-19 is being studied for people in hospitals, with some evidence that intubation can be avoided with a high flow or positive pressure on airways at two levels.
If any of these two brings the same benefits for those who are seriously ill, it is not known.
Some doctors prefer to stay with invasive mechanical ventilation when it is available because this technique limits that the aerosol particles spread, compared to the high flow nasal channel. Serious cases are more common in older people (those above 60 years and, in particular, above 80 years).
Many developing countries do not have hospital beds per capita in sufficient quantity, which limits the capacity of the health system to deal with the sudden scale in the number of COVID-19 cases or enough to require hospitalization.
A study in China observed that 5% were admitted to intensive therapy units, 2.3% needed mechanical ventilation support and 1.4% died.
In China, about 30% of the people in the hospital with COVID-19 were taken to the ICU.
Mechanical ventilation becomes more complex as acute respiratory discomfort syndrome (SDRA) develops in COVID-19 and oxygenation becomes increasingly difficult.
Ventilators with high pressure control and PEEP levels are needed to increase oxygen delivery as the risk of pulmonary lesions and pneumotórax associated with ventilation is minimised.
A high level of PEEP may not be available in older fans.
The study for potential treatments began in January 2020 and clinical trials with various antiviral medicines are being performed.
Remdesivir seems to be the most promising.
Although new medicines may last until 2021 to be developed, several of the tested medicines have already been approved for other uses or are in advanced phase of testing.
Antiviral medication can be tested in people with various diseases.
The WHO recommended that volunteers participate in the efficacy and safety tests of potential treatments. The FDA granted temporary authorisation for the use of plasma for convalescent people as treatment in cases where the person’s life is seriously and immediately threatened.
The clinical studies needed to show their safety and efficacy against disease have not yet been performed.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile application to deal with the outbreak of the disease.
Users are required to report their name and ID number.
The application can detect the "near contact" using monitoring data and thus the potential risk of infection.
Each user can also check the status of three other users.
If a potential risk is detected, the application not only recommends quarantine as well as alerts local health authorities. Big data analysis of mobile data, facial recognition technology, mobile phone tracking and artificial intelligence are being used to track infected people and people they contacted in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Government of Israel authorised security agencies to trace mobile phone data from people who are supposedly with coronavirus.
The measure was taken to strengthen the quarantine and protect people who can contact infected citizens.
In March 2020, Deutsche Telekom shared collected phone location data with the German federal government agency Robert Koch Institute to investigate and prevent the transmission of the virus.
Russia has implemented facial recognition technology to identify who buys the quarter.
The Italian regional health Commissioner, Giulia Gallera, has been informed by mobile operators that "40% of the people continue to travel this way".
The German government conducted a 48-hour hackaton at the end of the week with more than 42 000 participants.
In addition, Estonia's President, Kersti Kaljulaid, made a global appeal for creative solutions against the spread of coronavirus.
Individuals may experience difficulties in the quarantine, travel restrictions, side effects of treatment or fear of infection.
The BBC quoted Rory O'Connor, who said: "The increase in social isolation, solidarity, medical anxiety, stress and economic crisis are a perfect storm to harm people's mental health and well-being."
The disease may have a mild evolution, with little or no symptoms, similar to other common diseases of higher respiratory tract, such as cold.
Light cases usually recover within two weeks, as those with severe or critical illness can take three to six weeks to recover.
Pregnant women may have a greater risk of serious COVID-19 infection, according to other similar viruses, such as SARS and MERS, but lack COVID-19 data. In some people, COVID-19 may affect the lungs, causing pneumonia.
In those most severely affected, COVID-19 can progress rapidly to adult respiratory annuity syndrome (ARDS), causing respiratory failure, septic shock or multiple organ failure.
Complications associated with COVID-19 include sepsis, coagulation disorders and heart damage, kidneys and liver.
The coagulation disorders, specifically the increase in prothrombin time, were described in 6% of patients in hospitals with COVID-19, as the renal failure was seen in 4% of this group.
About 20-30% of people with COVID-19 have high hepatic enzymes (transaminases).
According to the same report, the median between the occurrence of symptoms and death was ten days, with five hospitalizations.
However, patients transferred to an ICU had an average of seven days between hospitalization and death.
In a study with early cases, the mean of initial symptoms until death was 14 days, with a total interval of six to 41 days.
In a study by the National Health Commission (NHC) in China, men had a mortality rate of 2.8%, while women had a mortality rate of 1.7%.
Histopathological examinations of post-mortem samples show spread alveolar damage with cellular fibromyxoid exudes in the two lungs.
Viral cytopathic changes were observed in pneumocytes.
The lung image examination seems to be a syndrome of acute respiratory discomfort (ARDS).
In 11.8% of the deaths reported by the National Health Commission in China, heart damage was detected due to high levels of troponin or cardiac arrest.
According to U.S. March data, 89% of hospitalised people had pre-existing comorbidities, and the availability of medical resources and socio-economic factors in a region can also affect mortality.
The estimates of mortality by comorbidity vary due to these regional differences, but also due to methodological difficulties.
Subnotification of mild cases may result in an overestimated mortality rate.
However, the fact that deaths will be the result of cases committed in the past may mean that the current mortality rate is underestimated.
Smokers were 1.4 times more likely to have serious symptoms of COVID-19 and approximately 2.4 times more likely to need intensive treatment or die compared to non-smoking. Concerns were raised regarding long-term symptoms of the disease.
The hospital authority of Hong Kong verified a decrease of 20% to 30% in lung capacity in some people who recovered from the disease, and lung tests indicated damage to the organ.
This can also lead to post-intensive care after recovery.
Until March 2020, it was not known whether infections had given effective and lasting immunity to people who recovered from the disease.
Immunities are seen as likely, based on the behavior of other coronaviruses, but cases were reported where the recovery of COVID-19 was followed by positive tests for coronavirus at a later date.
These cases are believed to be the worst of a prolonged infection rather than a re-infection.
It is believed that the virus is natural and has animal origin by means of transshipmental infection.
The real origin is unknown, but since December 2019 the spread of infection has become almost entirely driven by human transmission to mankind.
A study with the 41 first confirmed cases of COVID-19, published in The Lancet in January 2020, revealed that the oldest date of the occurrence of symptoms was 1 December 2019.
Official WHO publications reported the earliest date of the occurrence of symptoms as of 8 December 2019.
Several measures are commonly used to quantify mortality.
These numbers vary by region and with time and are influenced by the volume of tests, quality of the health system, treatment options, time from the initial exit and population characteristics such as age, sex and health in general.
At the end of 2019, WHO awarded the emergency CID-10 codes U07.1 for deaths from SARS-CoV-2 confirmed in the laboratory and U07.2 for deaths from COVID-19 with clinical or epidemiological diagnosis, without infection by SARS-CoV-2 confirmed in the laboratory. The mortality rate reflects the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed within a given period of time.
Based on the statistics of the University of Johns Hopkins, the overall fatality rate was 6.9% (153.822/2.240.191) on 17 April 2020.
The number varies by region. Other measures include the rate of fatality per case (CFR), which reflects the percentage of individuals diagnosed dying from a disease, and the rate of fatality by infection (IFR), which reflects the percentage of individuals infected (diagnosed and undiagnosed) dying from a disease.
These statistics are not limited to time and follow a specific population from infection to the resolution of the case.
Although not all people infected develop antibodies, the presence of antibodies may provide information on how many people have been infected.
In the eastern tip of Italy, Castiglione d'Adda, a small population of 4,600, 80 (1.7%) have already died.
In Gangelt, the disease was spread by Carnival festivals and spread among younger people, causing relatively low mortality, and not all deaths by COVID-19 should have been formally registered as such.
Furthermore, the German health system was not overloaded.
In the Netherlands, about 3% may have antibodies, as verified in blood donors.
69 (0.004% of the population) were killed by COVID-19 confirmed.
The impact of the pandemic and its mortality rate are different for men and women.
Mortality is higher in men in studies conducted in China and Italy.
The highest risk for men is in the 50s class, with the difference between men and women only approaching 90s.
In China, the mortality rate was 2.8 per cent for men and 1.7 per cent for women.
The exact reasons for the difference between sex are not known, but genetic and behavioral factors can be the reason.
Immunological differences due to sex, less prevalence of smoking women and the development by men of comorbidity as hypertension at a lower age than women can have contributed to greater mortality among men.
In Europe, 57% of the infected individuals were men, and 72% of the dead by COVID-19 were men.
By April 2020, the U.S. government was not tracking data from COVID-19 infections related to sex.
Studies have shown that viral diseases such as Ebola, HIV, influenza and SARS affect men and women of different kinds.
A higher percentage of health workers, mainly nurses, are women, and they are more likely to be exposed to the virus.
The World Health Organization announced on 11 February 2020 that the official name of the disease was "COVID-19".
The heads of WHO, Tedros Adhanon Ghebreyesus, explained that "CO" is of "corona", "VI", "virus", "D", of disease and "19" is since the outbreak was identified: December 31, 2019.
The name was chosen to avoid references to a specific geographic location (e.g. China), animal species or group of people, in accordance with the international recommendations of nomenclature to prevent stigmatizations. The virus causing COVID-19 was called coronavirus of severe respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-COV-2).
WHO also uses "the COVID-19 virus" and "the virus responsible for COVID-19" in communications to the public.
Both the disease and the virus are commonly called "coronavirus".
During the initial outbreak in Wuhan, China, the virus and the disease were commonly called "coronavirus" and "coronavirus of Wuhan".
In January 2020, WHO recommended "2019-nCov" and "a acute respiratory disease for 2019-nCov" as internal names for the virus and the disease, according to 2015 guidance against the use of sites in the names of diseases and viruses.
Official names COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were published on 11 February 2020.
Due to the limitations of capacity in standard supply chains, some digital manufacturers are printing health material such as nasopharyngeal spaghetti and respiratory parts.
For example, when an Italian hospital urgently needed a respiratory valve, and the supplier was unable to deliver on the necessary timetable, a local startup made reverse engineering and printed the 100 valves needed one day for another.
After the initial outbreak of COVID-19, theories arose of conspiracy, misinformation and disinformation regarding origin, size, prevention, treatment and other aspects of the disease, which were rapidly spread over the Internet.
Apparently, humans are able to transmit the virus to some other animals.
The study failed to find evidence of viral replication in pigs, rats and chickens.
No medicine or vaccine has been approved for the treatment of the disease.
International research on vaccines and medicines for COVID-19 is underway in government organizations, academic groups and industry researchers.
In March, the World Health Organization launched the "SOLIDARITY Trial" to assess the effects of treatment with four existing antiviral components with more likely efficacy.
There is no vaccine available, but several agencies are actively developing vaccine candidates.
Previous work on SARS-CoV is being used because both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 use ACE2 receptor to enter human cells.
There are three vaccination strategies being investigated.
First, researchers want to develop a vaccine with the whole virus.
The use of this virus, whether it is inactive or dead, is aimed at causing a rapid immunological response from the human body to a new COVID-19 infection.
A second strategy, subunity vaccines, aims to create a vaccine that sensitizes the immunological system to certain subunits of the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, this study focuses on the protein of the mirror that helps the virus enter the receptor of the ACE2 enzyme.
A third strategy is the nuclear acid vaccines (DNA or RNA vaccines, a new technique for vaccines).
Experimental vaccines of any of these strategies should have the safety and efficacy tested. On March 16, 2020, the first clinical test of a vaccine began with four volunteers in Seattle.
The vaccine contains a copied gene code of the virus that causes the disease. The dependent improvement of antibodies has been identified as a possible challenge for the development of a vaccine for SARS-CoV-2, but this is controversial.
There are more than 300 clinical trials in progress since April 2020.
Seven tests have evaluated already approved treatment for malaria, including four studies on hydroxyroquine or chloroquine.
The redirection of antiviral drugs consists mostly of Chinese research, with nine clinical trials in phase III of remdesivir in several countries due to a report of the end of April.
A dynamic analysis of the clinical development of drug and vaccine candidates for COVID-19 was ongoing in April 2020. Several existing antiviral medicines are being evaluated for the treatment of COVID-19, including remdesivir, chlorocine and hydroxyroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir and lopinavir/ritonavir combined with interferon beta.
There has been an attempt to prove the effectiveness of remdesivir since March 2020.
Clinical improvement was observed in patients treated with remdesivir for compassionate use.
Phase III clinical trials are being carried out in the US, China and Italy. Chloroquina, already used to treat malaria, was studied in China in February 2020 with preliminary results.
However, there are requests for peer review of the research.
Korean and Chinese health authorities recommend the use of chloroquine.
However, the Wuhan Virology Institute, although recommends a daily dose of one gram, warns that the good of this dose is highly dangerous and can be fatal.
On 28 March 2020, the FDA published an emergency authorisation of hydroxyroquin and chlorocine for doctors treating people with COVID-19. The 7th edition of the Chinese guidelines also includes interferon, ribavirin or umifenovir for use against COVID-19.
Preliminary data indicate that high doses of ribavirin are required to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
Nitazoxanide was recommended to be more in vivo after low levels of SARS-CoV-2. Studies have shown that the protein of the initial Spicle in preparation for serum transmembral protease 2 (TMPRSS2) is essential for SARS-CoV-2 through interaction with ACE2 receptor.
Studies on chloroquine and hydroxyroquine with or without azithromycin have significant limitations that prevented the medical community from taking these treatments without further studies. Oseltamivir does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and has no known function in the treatment of COVID-19.
The cytokine storm can be a complication in the post-stage stages of COVID-19 severe.
There is evidence that hydroxyroquine may have anti-temperature properties of cytokine. Tocilzumabe was included in the treatment guidelines of the National Health Commission of China after a small study.
A non-randomized test at phase 2 of the national level in Italy is under way, after demonstrating positive results in people with severe disease.
In combination with a serum ferritin blood test to identify cytokine storms, these developments are expected to neutralise, which are considered to be the cause of the death of some affected people.
Interleucin-6 receptor antagonist was approved by the FDA based on retrospective case studies on the treatment of refractory cytokine release syndrome to steroids induced by a different cause, CAR T cell therapy in 2017.
To date, there is no controlled and randomized evidence that tocilzumab is an effective treatment for CRS.
The transfer of purified and concentrated antibodies produced by the immunological system from which COVID-19 was recovered to people who need them is being investigated as a non-vacinal method of passive immunization.
This strategy has been tested for SARS, with inconclusive results.
Viral neutralization is the expected mechanism of action by which passive antibody therapy can mediate a defense against SARS-CoV-2.
Other mechanisms, however, such as cell cytotoxicity dependent on antibodies and/or phagocytosis, may be possible.
Other forms of passive antibody therapy, for example, use manufactured monoclonal antibodies, are developing.
The production of convalescent salt, which consists of the liquid fraction of the blood of recovered patients and contains specific antibodies to this virus, could be increased for faster implementation.
Coronavirus diseases, a highly related group of syndromes
Li Wenliang, a physician at Wuhan Central Hospital, who later contracted and died from COVID-19 after being aware of the spread of the virus.
