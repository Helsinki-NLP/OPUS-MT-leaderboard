Welsh Asemelli thinks he's "like a map"
Many of the Assembly members are reluctant to change their position in the MWP (Membra Ab The Welsh Parliament).
This key is proposed to change the name of Asembilly to the West Parliament.
Members of various political groups are afraid to focus on the change and face opposition.
A member of a Leverage Asemelli group said his group was worried that "it was like the Twp and Pwp of the new step."
For Welsh outside readers: Welsh, Twp's dumb and Pwp's mean.
A playmate Asemelli said as a group they had suggested "not happy" and the option.
A member of the Welsh Conzarvetiv Party said that the group viewed the change of the name as "open mind", but said that the difference between MWP and the scale was similar.
In this sense, the height of Weish Born Dubbleu is similar to the height of the U.S. English letter in Yorkshire.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently implementing legislation for the beginning of the name change process, said: "The members will have to make an urgent decision about what will be done by the Assembly members."
The Government of Wales Act 2017 grants Welsh Asemelli the right to change their name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a census where the proposal to change the name of Asembilly was widely supported by the Welsh Parliament.
With regard to the role of Asemelli members, the Commission supports the Welsh Parliamentary Membership or WMP, but MWP has received the highest support in the country.
Apparently, Asembilly members suggest different options, but it will be difficult to reach the same level for Elin Jones, the leading officer, who has a few weeks to pay tribute.
There will be various changes in the approach of the Assembly approach, including the disability of the Assembly members and the design of the committee.
After the debate on this issue, the Asemelli members will be given an opportunity to vote in favour of what they should do.
Macedonians vote in a referendum on the change in the country's name
They change their country's name to "Republic and Northern Macedonia will vote on whether the vote will take place.
This popular vote is being held in a ten-year-old conflict with neighboring Greece, whose territory is Macedonia.
Athens has long been claiming that the name of the northern neighbours is a symbol of the opposition on their territory and that this is why the country's European Union and Nato have responded to the call for members.
Macedonian Prime Minister George Ivanov, who opposed the referendum on the change, said he would reject the referendum.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Joran Jaev, feel that the change in the name appears to be a necessary step towards joining only the European Union and Nato.
The churches of Harlem will be at the bottom of St. Martin's fruit.
"I spoke to the indigenous people that there was a church and penshala in every corner of history," said Mr. Adams.
"There's nothing today."
He said that it would be possible to understand the matter of going to school.
People's social communications are now being "in a different way".
"The pensions are no longer the local residence where everyone goes on a regular basis."
As for the priest, he thinks that the money sold will not go away as long as the leaders think, "But today and tomorrow, they will return to where they started."
He also said that the apartment building and condominium could be built in the area of the church where all people who would not help the rest of the area would be able to live.
"All these buildings are going to buy condoms," he said, "but they will be surprised at the day when these churches are closed because most people who come to the condominium are likely to become members of the church."
Harlem was established by the two Church of Schbetang Congregations before becoming a farm town, the Metropolitan Community in 1870, and a decade after St. Martins.
In 1930 the congregation left the church.
A farm congregation in the vicinity takes possession of the building.
Under the Riverend, John Howard Johnson has a farm congregation in St. Martins, which has led an old shop against vendors – which is a key route for Harlem Canecata because of refusing to hire and subsidize farmers.
The building was badly damaged by a fire accident in 1939, but the Parisians of Padar Johnson planned to rebuild it, and they managed to build the trailer.
Rev. David Johnson, the son of Padar Johnson and St. Martin, who is responsible for the pregnancy, gave Carolon "the hour of the poor man".
Last July, he called it "a historical resource" and "an incomplete historical environment."
Specially, the University of Michigan's Tiffany Rule also stated that it is a first-time carillon in the world around the cornfield, Bazaan Dionyo A. Lind, who was appointed to play a major carillon by the Riverside priest 18 years ago.
Mr. Merieveder said St. Martins didn't replace him.
In the past few months, what has happened in St. Martin is a sad story of the tranquility and addressees who are held by the general leaders of the Church or by the Episcopal Diocese.
Westry – Paris' government body, which was established with ordinary leaders – told them in July last year that they thought the "Who will move the costs" of the Diocese Westry, even though it was not linked to the maintenance of the diocese and the administration of the addressees.
Several members of Paris accused Diosse of being inexplicable.
A 13 - year - old girl in California was attacked by a gun after being shot at by a 13 - year - old girl in the United States
A 13-year-old boy in Hong Kong was attacked on the first day of the Song of Solomon.
The attack took place seven mornings later near Encinitas.
Chad Hamel San Diego's KSWB TV told his friends that he would be able to take him out of the water for about half an hour to listen to the baby's cry for help.
Hamel said, at first he thought the boy was crying out for a Christmas ring, but then he said, "You can see that the kid was saying, 'I've got it!'
'He hit me!'
Her throat was broken," Hamel said, he came to see the boy.
"I look forward to coming up from the water for all, and say, 'There's a hole in the pante!'" adds Hamel.
The boy is being sent to San Diego’s Eddie Childrens Hospital, where he is in critical condition.
The people of the attacker Hanar are not known.
Lifegarde, Captain Larry Jills' report Briefing said that weeks ago there was a famine in this area, but it was found not to be a dangerous nation.
Jills adds that the attacker has suffered a serious injury on part of his attack.
The workers have been banned from accessing and security at the airport for 48 hours from Casablad's bridge to Encinita's Soami.
Jiels reports that there are more than 135 people in Hong Kong who are not most vulnerable.
Seinsbury is planning to enter the U.S. market
Censburys Butts, Superdrag and Debenhams are going to be opposed in the case of the docks, which are organised by the Department Store's representative and expert assistants.
The U.S. $2.8 billion market is part of the biggest effort to access the market, which will be carried out in 11 countries and, if proved successful, in another market, where the United States market has grown, where there is a market of needed materials in fashion and home markets.
The solution comes in Rupcher because supermarkets are sometimes looking for new ways to fill their pockets with TV, microwaves and household furniture.
Censburys said it would double its size and make up 3,000 lines, including the first time it would be given to Revolon, Ezi, Tuzarman and Doctor.
There will be a wide range of places, such as Lareal, Mebelin and Barts, where there will be different places for brands like boots.
The Supermarket is running a book backup race so that most of the lines are Vignan Friendly – which has become very popular among young authors.
On the other hand, the perfume vendor's version of France's Dream will be tested by two censorships, the first of which was held in South London's Kraden last week, and the second will be run by Seli Ok of Bergingham this year.
The online market and the local market for small amounts of food are trying to boost the market's ability to reach its customers.
Mike Cooper, head of censorship, said that aircraft should be viewed as Department store because the Supermarket China Aldi and Lidley are opposed to the port of departure, and there will be more service and food.
Two years ago, Argos and Habitts were sitting in the hundreds of shops after buying two, and opened some habitts, which increased the sale of soft paper and claimed that the company had made more profits.
The previous attempt to set up the Supermarket and the pharmaceutical sector failed.
Seinsburys examined a joint project with Bots for the first time in the 2000s, but this project has been blocked by the conflict on how to get some leftovers from the comic book in the supermarkets.
Seinsburys is opening up this new council after they sell their 281 drug pharmaceutical business to the owner of the Lods Farmer.
The company has announced that by adding a multi-stakeholder rating to the Skinkaera brand, Lloyds will play a role in the project, including La Roche Poze and Visie in the four doors.
Paul Mills-Hix, a business manager of Sensburys, said: "We have changed our minds to improve the environment for our artists.
We've arranged for those who will be there to give advice, despite particularly trained workers.
Our brand Range has been designed to meet all kinds of needs and we have now become an independent approach that will challenge the old ways of Kenya."
Peter Jones' "Agnisherma" is turning away from 11 million pounds of gold.
To focus on the new agreement with Willowie Marx and Spanser and ITV, Dr.
There is no time for Willowby for their home materials and tracking brand trollies.
Ginnett Paltro's group brand is compared to this joint business.
This Murning presentation, 37th, announces his departure from instagram.
H.E. Willowby Dragons Dan's daughter, Peter Jones, encouraged her to return from their attractive lifestyle brand business – which aims to focus on her new left hand deal with Marx and Spencer and ITV.
In fact, Jones Reggs became a "firemaker" when, in a meeting of his business government in Marlo in Beijing on Tuesday, he admitted that he had no time for his new debt – which cost him up to 1.5 million pounds — because of his home materials and his tracking brand truck.
The business was compared to Ginnett Potter's secret brand, and it was expected to double the amount of 11 million pounds of Willowby's assets.
After willoby, 37, informed of his departure from Truley from Instagrame, Jones left Britain for his early days at jet planes.
One of them said: "Truley has so far been on top of the first list of Hali.
It was part of his long-term future plan, which was a necessary financial measure for the next few decades.
The decision to reject him has once rejected all of them.
No one could believe what happened last night, and the project was about to start very soon.
Marlor's description contains a yellow cloth made for sale."
Experts believe that Dish Morning's representative, one of the most reliable figures in Britain at present, may have lost the millions of pounds of the farm due to his departure because they have already sold large quantities of furniture, clothing and household items, and will contribute to the damage as soon as possible.
And this could lead to a long-term friendship.
The mother of three children, Willoby and her husband, Dan Baldwin, were pregnant with Jones and his wife Tara Cap.
Willoby started his trip with Cap in 2016 and joined him as President in June, March 52.
There are 40 per cent shares of the small catan and baldwin TV industry in Yugoslavia.
Willoby will be a Brand Ambassador of EMAS and will replace Anton Macparttlin as the representative of the IIAM of the ITV Celibre event.
One of Jones' best comments last night, "We're not going to comment on his business London."
JTAL discussion 'And then we'll fall in love'
He joked that he had a negative opinion about North Korea's leader and a comment that some people would consider "non-governmental" to be.
Why did President Tramp leave so much?
The trauma says his mother's "reporter" on the site.
"I didn't leave anything."
He said he wanted to meet at least a second time after their first meeting in Singapore in June, and the trauma claimed that their first meeting was a major step towards establishing North Korea's standards.
But there's been a wave of bans on Tom.
More than three months after Singapore's conference, North Korea's head of Kuwaiti Ri Yong Hoo of Sanibar National Assembly announced to the world leaders that the North Korea had no "related response" to the United States' previous construction measures.
However, he said the United States has imposed bans on the use of pressure.
When she gave her comments to Ali, the trauma released more interesting views.
"We are in a good position with North Korea," he said.
"We were facing war in North Korea.
It could have killed more than ten million people.
Now we have a good relationship."
He claims that his efforts to improve communication with Kim have led to significant results – which has led to the completion of the rocket test, the release of prisoners and the return of the remaining US workers.
And he has supported the unusual five ways to talk about Kim.
"It's very easy to act as a president, but instead of trying to get 10,000 people out of this country, only 200 people would sit here," the trauma pointed out to the right person in front of him.
In Indonesia, a holy island, hundreds of people were killed by tsunamis and earthquakes
After the Lombe earthquake, for example, foreign government organizations were told that they did not need help.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombe's people have been displaced, no national disaster has been announced, which is an advance for international aid.
"In many areas, unfortunately, they have made it very clear that they are not asking for international assistance," said Mr. Zambang.
Although a group is working together to go to the Sev de Children, it is still uncertain whether foreign workers can work on the ground.
Mr. Sutopo, the head office of the National Organisation for Corruption, said that Indonesian workers are assessing the situation of palm trees to determine whether foreign organizations should be allowed to participate immediately.
The country has also been emotionally unprepared for this type of aggression in view of the events of the regular earthquake in Indonesia.
Although the Sunami Security Centre has been established recently, it is difficult to find security centres in other maritime areas.
Despite the warning situation, Sunami’s unexplained warning of Siren is likely to have had an impact on Hani’s life.
When it's too good time, many islands of Indonesia travel to Challenging.
The nature of the damage has been further reflected in the communication system.
Lombe is heading to a hospital in order to heal the victims, but it will take at least three days to get to the scene of this new accident.
President Joko Vido Indonesia's development of the state-of-the-art industry has been central to his election campaign and he has spent a lot of money building roads and roads.
But before the next year's reelection, Mr. Jokor has taken over the government.
Mr. Joko is also under pressure from the long-term civil revolution in Indonesia, where Muslims have adopted more protective lives of their religion.
More than 1,000 people were killed by Christians and Muslims, and more than ten thousand were homeless, killing two groups of people on the streets with your wealth and other Russian weapons.

A policeman's face-to-face confirmed that the victim of the murdered woman's Barkenhad and her lashe were found inside a house.
Today, friends who think this woman knows them ask where she's been found this morning.
The investigation is under way and the police have reported that they are trying to spread this news to women's neighbors.

New chapter of the debate on the 'History Rewrite' image of the convention chromewell
It will be removed by the necessary justice after the destruction of many cultural and religious symbols in England by its opponents.
But Mr. Cromwell Society has called the advice of the Creek and the "Strengthening of History."
The chairman of the Cromewell Society, Jean Goldsmith, said: "It was impossible to see the image of Oliver Cromwell outside the Western House in the current debate on the removal of images.
The iconoclasm or sign of destruction during the war of the British House was neither edited nor edited by Kramowell.
In the last century, the image of the wrong chromewell will be eliminated in its early tomes.
The extraordinary statue of Cromwell, made by Mr. William Hamo Thornikrft, is a 19th-century reflection of the opinion and part of a historical story that many people consider to be worthy of inspiration.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Many people think that Cromwell is the guardian of the assemblies in the face of external pressure, in his view, against the pressure of the government – which is now the exception of less people.
But it's part of the ongoing historical debate whether it's a complete picture of that time.
What is certain is that the 17th century conflict has shaped the next development of our nation and that Cromwell is a well-known Christian who has represented one side of this category.
As Lord Protetor, his money is worthy of use and memory."
He's been killed by a very dirty Chinese farmer.
According to a local media report, a pig killed a farmer in a South-West China market.
The person whose version is only known as "Yuan" is known to be found in a report from the Ravibar South Saina Marning Post in Lupansu Province, South China, South China.
In May 2005, China's Chinese Chinese country, China, is preparing sugarcane for cooking on a sugar plantation.
He was reported to have come to the market 15 times from the nearby Union country with his brother Fufato.
The next morning his half brother drank him dead and saw that he had opened the door of a sugar cane next door.
He said there was a big man who was bleeding in his face.
A French study confirms that 550 pounds of rice has killed the farmer by attacking him, reports the report.
"My mother, my brother's feet were bleeding and injured," said Fupatto, whose version was known as "U", reporting by Guyang Yvining News.
The security camera's feet show that Yuan enters the market to feed his chickens in 4 to 40 minutes on Wednesday.
About an hour later, he'll be able to get his ass.
It's not the man who killed the guy or his half brother.
An administrator of the market told Yvining News that the police are gathering in Alamat and that the sugar has been kept separate so that it can't attack anyone else.
Yuan's family and market authorities are discussing how much damage he has suffered for his death.
Despite the violence, there has been an incident that has taken place in the past.
In 2016 a woman and her husband were attacked by a tsunami in Massachusetts so that people would be seriously affected.
Ten years ago, a 650-pound chicken ex-Walsh farmer was placed in his truck until his wife came in to scare him.
In 2012, after a farmer in Oregon had eaten his sugar, a Manitober farmer told CBC News that sugars are not usually aggressive but can act as "trigger or hotzer".
"They only hate it.
They're doing little work, very interesting animals... but they don't try to take care of anyone.
But you have to understand them enough," he said.
Hariken Rosa will create heavy rains across the southern United States
According to the past, the spinal cord is weakened when the water is flowed over the drylands of northern Mexico by Hariken Rosa.
Despite the day before, Russia will be responsible for the north-west of Mexico and the south-west of the United States.
Today, at the 5th anniversary of the Eastern era, Rosa was a category 1 Hariken whose speed was 85 miles per hour, and was located in the southernmost 385 miles of the Gulf of Mexico.
It's about going north of Rosa on Wednesday.
On this point, a system has begun to take shape in the Pacific and is heading east towards the West Coast of the United States, which will be attacked by the Russians in California on Saturday morning as a result of a massive storm, which will lead the deep coral reef north to the southwestern United States.
Because of Rosa, it will rain up to 10 inches per day in different parts of Mexico.
Then, along with the system of deep-fashioned drought, the South-West would create the next day’s heavy rains.
Locally, from 1 to 4 inches of rain will create a potential landfill due to the accidental flow of flash currents or agglomerated formations, the atmosphere of destruction and the soil
Due to severe severe droughts, there can be up to 2 to 3 inches per hour of rain in different areas, especially in various parts of South Nevada and Arizona.
The various parts of the South-West region may grow from 2 to 4 inches, especially in most areas of Arizona.
Flush flying and very fast conditions can be reduced because of the rapid rain.
It's a very stupid thing to get out in the back of my face with the threat of a hurricane.
Because of heavy rain, the canyon can become a terrible river and there will be a violent storm with the dust.
As a result of the earthquake, heavy rains will take place locally in various parts of southern California.
The amount of rain can be up to half an inch, which can cause a drop in the streets to cause the last rain.
It will be the first flower in the region in the spring.
From Sunday night to Saturday morning there may be some spectacular autumn rains in Arizona, and then the rain will rise and spread throughout the region from Saturday night to Sunday.
This heavy year will be on the way to the Forthirsty Spring and will continue until dawn.
In October, there may be a number of mild changes in the United States in various areas as Arctic temperatures are shrinking, but tropical temperatures are still rising.
As a result, there is sometimes a slight change in temperature in the distance.
There is an excellent example of the relative change in temperature in the region of the United States of America.
Kansas City, Misoryri and Omaha, Nebraska and St. Louis and Des Mines, are about 20 degrees of temperature in Iiwa.
The next few days will try to increase and expand the temperature in Greece.
In most parts of the United States, the beginning of October is rising, where temperatures are as high as 80 in the area from the south to the north.
In the morning the temperature in New York City can reach 80 degrees, which is about 10 degrees above the temperature.
Our long-term weather forecast shows that in the first half of October the United States is likely to be much higher than its average temperature.
Over 20 million people have seen Bret Kavana's hearing.
Christine Blazi Ford, who was charged with assaults against him by the Supreme Court, was charged by the Supreme Court's brilliant Brit Kavana and the Supreme Court, which took place in Motabek in the late 1980s, saw more than 20 million visitors of the television network on its website last Saturday.
On the other hand, political opposition has been halted, the publishers are halting regular events due to the last few months of January: an agreement was made by the President of Arizona's Senator Jeff Flicker, who will have a week's time to investigate Motobek AFIA's complaint.
Ford Sinnet told the Judiciary Committee that he was quite sure that Kawana would hand in his body as a drunk in a high school party and try to open his clothes.
Cavanaugh witness said she was quite sure that it didn't happen.
It is possible that more than 20.4 million people have seen this event in the Nilsen report.
The company counted the size of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC visitors.
The other networks that the operation has announced were not available with the number of visitors, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Networks.
And Nilsen usually faces problems with the quality of visitors who sit at the office.
The number of viewers of the program was similar to the number of football players from the Academy Awards.
The Fox News Channel, which strongly supports Kawana's opinion by the event's representatives, has attracted the most large number of viewers in all of the networks of audiences throughout the day, which was 5.69 million, says Nilsen.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS sees 3.1 million, NBC sees 2.94 million, MSNBC sees 2.89 million and CNN reports 2.52 million visitors, Nilsen.
He was interested after the hearing.
Flek was in the central history of Natker today.
After he announced his vote to Kavana, she was taken to CNN and CBS's camera on Friday morning when she went to live in order to get to the hearing of the Judiciary Committee and protestors.
He was standing in front of the protesters for a few minutes, which CNN directly proclaimed.
"I'm standing right in front of you," said one woman.
"Do you think Kawana is telling the truth?
It says, "You have the power when many women are helpless."
Flake said his office gave a statement and said before the elevator was closed, he said there was something else he wanted to hear from the committee.
Later, when the Commission of the Judiciary took the vote for the full Senate vote, all of the cables and media networks went straight.
But Fleck said he would vote on this condition that the FBI will investigate the case against a psychotherapist in the next week, whose request was made by a number of Democrats.
After Flickr became king, his conversation with a friend of the Democratic Center Chris Con has been partly affected.
After speaking to Con, Flek talked to several other senators and took his decision.
Fleck's decision was weak because it was clear that the Republicans did not have a vote to approve Kawana except for the investigation.
President Tramp Kavana has conducted an FBI investigation on the basis of the charges.

I was happy to vote, but I saw my father coming to my mother's eye, but now we're trapped."
Despite the important but decisive victory in the country's presidential election last December, Catalonia's liberation groups have struggled to keep their pace, where many of their well-known leaders are waiting for a seat or arrest for their organisation's role in the declaration of freedom in the future.
A 42-year-old Mechanic Joan Poig, who is recording the protest on his phone in support of the police, said both politicians have created this opposition.
He added, "Day is fast."
A Catholic leader, who was not in prison on Saturday, announced to the end of last year that he would participate in the European Parliament's election next year.
He said "The best way to combat the scourge and the scourge from the Spanish government is to stand up for European elections."
London: Men arrested after the car conflict with the house.
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 were arrested after being hit by a car in a house in London.
The event took place in the Balinagaard Christiant in 1930 minutes during the summer of Bangladesh.

Menger Goll wins between 1 and 0 of Livingston's against Rangers.
The first round of Dali Mengar wins as Livingston.
Steven Gerard has been awarded a second prize in 18 games as director of the Ibrax Club, with the encouragement of the downturned Livingston Rangers.
Dili Mengar was shocked by the fact that Gary Holt's team had joined the Heberians in a second round.
As a result, Jérard's team left this museum without ever winning any Away and will face the Hearts they are headed for, which are eight points above them.
Earlier on Wednesday, the European League will host the Epidemic of Rangers.
Livingston has already expanded their lives in six games in the division, and no one has been able to win the prize since last month.
Livingstone misses a lot of chances against their religious opposition.
They should have gone before the attackers, for their aggressive attitude caused all kinds of problems for the Rangers!
Scott Robinson is trying to save, but he can't succeed, and Alan Lithago can only run his effort on the same way after the slide to match Craig Holket's head.
Set pizza guests may be shocked to know that hosts were going to play in front of the Rangers themselves.
And that's where the important hole came from.
Renjars is a free-key conceived and opens up Livingston Goll's account. Declan Gallagher and Robinson Manga are gathered to set up a tape from the centre of the box.
In this case, the Reinzars claimed that they knew how to defend the volunteers, and that was determined most of the time by the protector Liam Kali.
The process was still under way, even though Alfredo Morlos Keller had set up a stake.
Scott Pittman was taken to the foot of Alan McGregor, the treasurer of Ranger, and another set of pizzas for Livingstone from Lithago Way.
The cross came to the next Livingston box and gradually became clear, although the two panel's advocates - option Glen Middleton - were hired after the Hallet's holidays and for handball.
"Unbelievable" Cynthia Livingstone
Alasdayer Lament Toni McCarney Arena, B.C., Scotland
Livingstone has an extraordinary performance and results.
To one person, they were sad, leaving everyone at high speed.
After their return, their game type and the player has changed a lot, but thanks for coming to Holt after he has arrived, he has joined the team.
He had a lot of money.
Captain Holket was unusual, he made a poorly organized defense, and Menga Con has always kept the Goldson and Jo Warl safe.
Even though the Rangers were less spread.
The good they were doing under Jerard has been worth it.
They didn't want to say their finals -- they just opened up the welcome -- and it's a warning to the Rangers, who are now in the middle of the table.
Egyptian Gulf of Erdogan Colon
On Saturday (September 29th) the Turkish and German leaders were very pleased to meet up with Brexit in Berlin.
It's the last day of the German voyage that President Erdogan's protested - which took place to establish contact with Nato Zot's supporters.
They argue about human rights, freedom of the press and the joining of the European Union in Turkey.
After this, Erdogan traveled to Colon for a big new mosque.
This city is the home of the best Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police have made security efforts to prevent some 25,000 people from joining the Mass, but prominent supporters have come to see their President.
A century anti-Ardogan protesters - many of whom were Kurds - heard of Erdogan's policy and his decision to welcome him in Germany, were sentenced to two sentences.
This conflict proves that one viewer praised by German Turks as old and condemned by others as self-governing.

There are over 300,000 people living there, "Rad Cross has announced in a statement, and has added that workers and volunteers are going to the damaged area."
"It's already a tragedy, but it can be worse."
Sunami Palu has been criticized for not providing this information, even though the workers have said that the guards had arrived at the time of the warning.
A person sitting on the floor of the street in the social media shared in the streets has been shown to look at the people on the street below and listen to the warning from Sunami.

He said, "It doesn't mean the message has been sent."

China West: This business has been named by him here.
Ruper Kein West keeps his name here in the palace.
He announced this change on Saturday, he wrote on Twitter: "The officially known Chinese West."
West, 41, was also known for a long time and used the name as its source.
The change of the name is in the setarde Night Live. It was already published where he hoped to release his new album Yandi.
The event operator said he was replacing the singer Aryana Grande, who canceled the event "for a serious reason".
The West had previously said that the word was full of religious urgency, as well as a short form of the name of his current side.
At the beginning of the West year, radio operator Big Bay said in his discussion on the title of album, "I believe 'YE' is the most used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you'.
"That's me you, I'm us, it's us.
It's said from China that, which means only one person, represents our good, bad, our corruption, everything.
This album is more than a record of our identity."
He's one of a number of business people who have changed their name.
Secombus is known in various ways as PFD, PD or DD, but this year he announces that he prefers the name of the recipient and the browsers.
A former assistant from West worked with J.J., and H.I.A. and the president.
Mexico's EML has sworn not to use military forces against ordinary citizens.
President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez, Mexico's 50th anniversary of the bloody attack against students, has sworn that he will not use military force against violent people.
Lopez Abrador promised Tlateloko on the beach "Don't use military power to torture people in Mexico."
On October 2, 1968, soldiers were engaged in a peaceful protest that killed 300 people when the left-wing student movement in Latin America took its place.

The United States of America should offer two examples of artistic wisdom.
China has become more active in artistic wisdom, doubles its business in this area of research in the United States and should be said to have been done by K-Fu Lee, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
This expression came from various parts of the government, U.S.A., which announced that there is an organizational consensus in the artistic wisdom of the United States.
China has already launched its new plan last year: its goal is to replace the number 1 with artificial wisdom in the mid-30s.
Lio added, "In the study of artificial wisdom, two budgets will be a good start, where most countries are far behind in this area and we are looking for further steps to progress in artificial wisdom."
The United States of America can double the potential for great artistic wisdom money, Li said at a CNC meeting this week.
Lee, whose book "All Super Pwars: 'China, silicon Valley and the New World Order' is the lead author of Houston Miflin Harcourt, the leading founder of the Sinaitovation Vendinger, who has been awarded the China's most-final artistic wisdom organization Fas++.
In the 1980s, Carnegie Melen worked in a artistic intelligence system at the University of Milan, which hosted the most famous American player in Hong Kong, and later he was the founder of the microsoft resource and head of the Chinese chess team in Google.
Lee's improved research project, like the Robotics Challenge of Agents, has agreed with the US government's previous commitment to choose the next step.
In the United States, researchers are about to work hard to win government tax, Li said.
"China doesn't move academic leaders; corporates do," Li said.
Facebook, Google and other professional organizations have been using the university to work in artistic wisdom in recent years.
Lee says that changes in the housing policy can help increase this effort in the United States.
"I think Green Card should be offered automatically to PISCD in artistic wisdom," he said.
In July 2017, the State Council of China announced its next birth's artistic wisdom development plan.
China's National Foundation for Natural Science, such as the People of Academic Organizations, the National Science Foundation and other government organizations are using the U.S. researchers, but it has a low value of academic work, Li said.
At the beginning of this year, the U.S. Department of Defence has set up a joint cultural centre, which is linked to the involvement of artists and students, and has announced the election committee on the wisdom of the White House.
And this month, the DPRP announced a $2 billion deal in a venture called AI Next.
As NSF, it currently shares over $100 million each year in artificial intelligence research.
On the other hand, the US law, which tried to build a National Security Commission on artificial wisdom, has not made progress within a few months.
Macedonians vote in the audience on whether to change their country's name
The people of the Republic of Northern Macedonia voted in a referendum on whether to change their name and hold "Republic of Northern Macedonia", a step that would resolve a few decades of previous conflicts with Greece that would hinder the European Union and NATO's efforts to find membership.
Greece, where there is a territory called Mesedonia, is represented by the northern part of its territory as a representative of its territory and has given rise to the entry of Nato and the European Union.
On the basis of a new name proposed by two governments, nationalist opposition believes that this change will reduce the national identity of the people of Macedonia's Slavic ethnic group.
President George Ivanov said he wondered whether he would not vote in the referendum and whether he would fill at least 50 percent of the tournament outside in order to ensure that the vote was valid.
The question in Gonvot Ball was: "You have an agreement with Greece for Nato and members of the European Union."
Supporters for the change in the name of Prime Minister Jordan Jaev have expressed their commitment to the value of joining the European Union and Nato as the most important Macedonia in the countries affected by Yugoslavia.
"I have come to vote for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia to survive in the European Union because it means a safe life for all of us," said 79-year-old Olivera Georgievska Scopze.
While not mandatory in the law, enough members of the council said they would vote in favour of the outcome of the vote by decision-making.
To rename, congregation needs two-thirds of its population.
The National Electoral Commission said there was no information about the illegality of 1 Nagad.
However, only 16 per cent of the national elections in 2016 voted in comparison with 34 per cent of the national elections, when 66 per cent of the recorded voters voted.
"I have come to vote for my children, we have our place in Europe," said José Tenevsky, a voter from the President of Skopje.
Prime Minister George Jaev of Macedonia voted in favour of the change in the country's name to the Gonovot in Macedonia, which will open the way to join Nato and the European Union on 30 September 2018.
In front of the Skopje Parliament, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavadarkov was preparing a small field, and he pointed out that those who were to vote against them were to be placed in front of them.
"We are at Nato and the European Union, but we are not at the door of the service, but we want to raise our head and join," Kawadarkov says.
"We are a poor country, but we are poor.
If they don't want to be our Macedonia, we can go to others like China and Russia and be part of the Euro-Asian settlement."
Prime Minister Jaev said Nato will provide the necessary resources in Macedonia, where there will be more than 20 per cent of the cost of unemployment.
"I believe it will be on the side of the bill because more than 80 percent of us are citizens of the European Union and Nato," Jaev said after he gave his ball.
He said that a "yes" result would be our "certainty of the future."
A survey published last summer by the Institute for Police Research in Mesedonia stated that from 30 to 43 percent of the votes required for the tournament outlet will take part in the vote.
Mesedonia's telema TV has seen another increase, with 57 percent of the respondents planning to vote on Wednesday.
Seventy percent said they would vote yes.
The vote must be more than 50 per cent in order to be successful.
The failure in the referendum will represent the first deadly attack on the Western Government's principle since the last month of May.
Look: Enter the full Briton defenses for the Surjio Fireplace of Manchester City
George Brighton Defension of Manchester, Manchester, England's Histhad Stadium, has reduced George Aguiero and Rhim Starling between 2 and 0 of the Manchester City.
In 65 minutes, Aguiro made it easier for him to see his score.
At the beginning of Scuence, a pass was found in Midfield by Argentina Street.
Before going to open, he ran through three Briton Defenders.
Firero was surrounded by four superheros.
Before leaving a few more on the front of the Briton box, he turned to a defender.
Then he took a path to the left, which he was looking for.
In the English forard box, he returned the ball to Aguiro, who used his right button to push British guard Matthew Ryan to the right side of the street.
"Aguiro is struggling with some problems," the city manager's Pope Gardiola told reporters.
"We've been talking about his game for 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We're lucky he just made a hole."
However, Starling Skye Bluz has given priority to the fight against the Premier League.
That ball came in 29 minutes.
Aguiro found the ball in the heart of the Briton area.
He sent the ball to Liroy Sen on the left side on a beautiful road.
Sen took a few tats before taking Starling to a distant post.
The ball hit the wall just before Skye Bluz went to the front of the border.

Traps in West Virginia
When speaking about the importance of the Republican vote in the mid-election, President Bret Kavana, who had been elected by his Supreme Court, quickly pointed out the situation around him.
"All we've done is in shock in November.
Five weeks away from our most important election for life.
It's a big, big -- I'm not running, but I'm really running, so I'm all around to fight bad people," he said.
"You see this fear of Democrats, the Adical Group of Fear, you see it happening now.
And they promise to regain their strength in whatever way they need, you see this modesty, gratitude.
They have to go behind their backs to get power and control, they don't give up anything, they just want power and control, we won't give them it."
He said that the Democrats are on the mission "to combat and ban".
"And you've seen it in the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats "regent and inferior and thankless and unfaithful."
He named Dan Finstein, a democratic senator of the Senate's judicial committee, who received high titles from visitors.
"Do you remember his answer?
Did you save the group?
Ah, ah, ah.
No, no, I'm waiting -- it was really bad bad bad bad bad longues -- the worst bad bad bad guy I see."
Lebar is no longer a free organization.
Those who think they're not here to say what they're saying.
When my country's employees voted against me, it wasn't like it was a mistake.
Because, you don't have to say goodbye to the character of your mind here -- I was the last one on the list to announce it.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan had a similar attitude because he stood firm against the Jewish-Inquiry.
In my case, it was my fault to have sex with Jeremy Cobbin.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on European and national security and on similar issues, on which Jeremy was not in agreement with former leaders.
"We want the meetings to be content and productive," said Ntingham East Lebar to the meeting on Friday.
In my eighth year as a local laboratory MP, this first Friday night's JC meeting was almost the same.
Unfortunately, today, it is not that meeting, and the promise of "Dielu, Medieval" politics has long been forgotten, if it really ever begins.
It has been consistently observed that there are no differences in the Liberian party and that it is considered acceptable for the group leadership.
After Jeremy's leadership, it started to happen that I thought with my colleagues that I knew the same political viewpoint that they were hoping to bring me U-Torn to me and to take a place where I wasn't in any condition - be national security or a single market.
I've always spoken openly – and even though I'm not going to say anything – there's a call to remove me by social communication, the centre's politics is being condemned, and I'm told that I shouldn't be in my lab party.
And it's not just my experience.
In fact, I know I'm happier than some of my colleagues, because the comments I have been given are also political.
I've never been ashamed to see all my colleagues face the challenge of maintaining their peace and order on the basis of the daily link.
The most disturbing side of politics this time is how Galagali's inequality has become normal
Jeremy Kobyin claimed last week that the Liberian party had built a culture of tolerance.
In fact, we are no longer a free organization, and we refer to the change of the vote or election rule.
For the past two years, I've been advised by many people to keep my head up, it's not fair and I'm either "right" or "right".
But I didn’t want to get involved in politics.
When I joined Lebare 32 years ago as a school student, we were reminded by the government of the Thachar government that destroyed our extended school classes in a literal way, and I tried to provide the necessary government service for those who needed it as local councillor or government minister.
I never kept my politics secret with the last election.
No one in Ntingham East has ever been confused about my position and the areas of conflict with the current leadership.
I will only say to those who have been preaching this initiative yesterday that when the country is moving towards a rocket that will damage families, business organizations and our public services, I cannot understand whether I will be loyal to the leader of the Liberian party and whether I want to spend my time and energy.
But I really don't have any message for Ntingham Momentum, whether it's with my electoral centres, whether or not or not: I'm proud to serve you and I promise I won't stop me from believing what I believe is best for you.

"We've been tested every game so far and we're still busy, so I should be happy."
Melrose's Rabbi Cristy said: "They've done better than we can."
The 14 minutes of Grant Anderson’s effort, transformed by the French climate, led to Air, however, was a stupid card by Rery Hughes of Scotland’s player, who was excommunicated by Wariers, gave Melroz a degree degree, and Jason Baggot tried a failure.
Climo paneled the air crew, just before he, during Haftime, he jumped into one effort and turned into 17-5 seconds.
But Melroz started the second round with a good start, and Patrick Anderson's effort to transform the baggot into five points
A long time ago, the game was stopped because of a major hit by the Ruyal Nott, which went on record and continued much more after the game started again, through the encouragement of St. Ford McDowell, who transformed the climate.
At the time, Hlud Card Drinking and another game of deadly pressure at the end of a game, Bruce Colvein of Melrose's attempt to win the Air.
Although the volunteers came back right, and when Strayan Hachinson saw the lead card for the Mocabelle, he took the lead in bringing the wind from the Penalti Line out to MacFarson Tashdown.

'The Sea Is Ours': The Earth's Bolivia hopes to reopen the way to the Court's calm moon.
The Nabiks offer a regging clothes table on the La Paz.
Public buildings are running a massive blue flag.
Lake Titicaca is founded by the basic "We have the right to the sea"
It is a restorer of a "" task
Most of all, in Bolivia around the world, the memory of the instrument is still clear – it is also a practice to travel to the Pacific Ocean once again in the war on a blood asset of the 19th century.
These hopes are probably the highest in a few decades, as Bolivia is waiting for the International Court of Justice on 1 October following its five-year discussion.
"Bolivia has the speed, unity and regular attention, and we are sure to expect the outcome with a realistic view," Bolivian Kuwaiti Barbarto Kalzadilla said.
Many of the Bolivian Iszie will see a large screen with a large screen, hoping to go to the Himg's Tribional Bolivian claim that - after a few decades of discussion - Chile is obliged to give a public airport to the sea.
Ivo Moreles, Bolivia's Karasimatik former President - who will face a controversial struggle for re-election next year - is also dependent on the sombar era.
"We are very close to going back to the moon," he promised at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that it is impossible to decide with the court in Bolivia - and if so, it will change very quickly.
The Dutch National Association has failed to allow Chile to provide land and has announced that they will not be able to determine the outcome of the discussion.
ICJ's report only six months after hearing the report indicates that the case was "not silent," said the expert page of the Chilean International Law.
And it can continue for more than four years to take the cause of Bolivia.
"The issue of access to the sea has now been raised by Bolivian administration," Zerete said.
Moralse's anti-war statement, he said, has given Chile a great deal of courage.
Bolivia and Chile may be able to speak for a while, but then it will be very difficult to discuss.

Calzadilla also denied that Morales - the most popular Latin American government - is still using Maritime Isuti as a political spy.
"Bolivia will never leave the right to enter the peaceful months," he adds.
"The vision is the opportunity to see that we have to cut our past."
North Korea said the nuclear ban would not be allowed to trust the United States.
North Korea's prime minister, Riy Yong Hoo, said that his people would not be subjected to nuclear weapons if they did not believe Washington.
He makes this statement at a general session of the National Association.
He called for the launch of what he promised to the US during a summit of opposition leaders in Singapore.
His comments came when U.S. Foreign Minister Mike Pompey of the United States seems to be on the way back to Singapore's three months after Kim Jong was born.
Ri says it's a "Pype Dream" that keeps the bans out and will bring North Korea back to North Korea in response to the end of the Korean War.
Washington warns that Pinginging may not act as a first-mentioned ban.
Both Kim and President of the United States, Donald Tramp, wanted a second convention.
However, there is a lot of reason that Paingingang is about leaving an army, which Syria is probably the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompey wants to travel to Beijing next month to prepare for the second Kim-tramp meeting.
Paris fashion shows the last line of the Great Headway along the way to your next High Street
If you want to increase your laptop or completely lock the sun, you no longer need to see it.
The designer Valentino and Thom Brown Rwanway have created a set of over-sided head guides for their SS19 collection, which has given Paris fashion set on the week of the façade.
This Greek has become a very immoral topi facility and these designers have sent catawatts to their eyes.
Valentino's most recent creation was an over-the-counter-to-to-peak ball that was lined up with a wide-ranging mountain that was lined up on the top of the models.
Among the other supersedes are the bluefin tuna, including an orange - but they are not designed to keep your head up.
Tom Brown also published a selection of the subject mojos -- and at the right time for Halloween.

John Edward: Language skills needed for people around the world
Scotland's free schools are playing a track record of academic excellence, and this has resulted in another unusual test in 2018, which is based only on personal and combined success in the efforts of music, art, music and other communities.
With over 30,000 students in Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Dependent School (SSIS), are trying to identify their students and parents at the best level.
Foreign schools are aimed at preparing their places for their students more and better, their chosen country and the world as citizens.
As an educational field that can be designed and applied by a special school curriculum, we see today's language as popular and favorite.
Nelson Mandela said: "If you speak to someone in a language that he understands, it goes to his head.
If you speak to her in your own language, she'll be in her heart."
It's a powerful reminder that if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries, we can't rely only on English.
As a result of this year's latest test, we see that languages are in the highest-ranking levels in private schools.
Of foreign-language students, 68 percent of the students were enrolled in a higher grade.
The data collected from 74 members of the school of ASIA shows that 72 per cent of students in Mandarin received higher grades when 72 per cent of German students, 69 per cent of French students and 63 per cent Spanish students were enrolled.
It proves that Scotland's foreign schools support foreign languages as the most important skills that will undoubtedly be needed in the future for children and young people.
The language is now in the same way as the literature of the private school and any other subject (Scientific, Professional, Professional and Digital).
The EU Commission for Implementation and Schools has seen a review in 2014 that 17 percent of the respondents have been responsible for their language skills.
More and more, language skills have become inadequate to prepare young people for their future careers.
Those who need language to be able to do more work, these skills are needed in a reliable world.
If they are learning a second language, they will be able to do so with their life skills in the future.
The ability to communicate directly with foreigners automatically prevents a multilingual person from competing.
According to a survey of over 4,000 adults in Ukraine in 2013, 75 percent could not speak well in any foreign language during the conversation, and French was the only 10 percent language, 15 percent.
That is why language education is now important for today's children.
More than one language, especially in developing economic languages, will give children a better chance of finding a full-time job.
In Scotland, each school will be different in its own language.
Many schools will focus on other classical languages today, while others will appear to be most important to the U.S., such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child wants, there will always be a lot of languages to choose from in private schools, with a special teacher in this area.
The Scots Institutes of Social Affairs have provided a learning environment that will prepare children and build them with the necessary skills to be successful in the future.
It cannot be denied that languages play an important role in the future of the country, so it should certainly be reflected in the field of education.
In fact, today's languages should really be considered as "International Communication Skills."
The private schools will offer this preference, variety and enthusiasm for young people in Scotland.
It needs to be done.

I'm going to show you the lab at San Diego.
The wait is almost over to see the Goddess begin their first journey as Los Angeles Lakes by Libron James.
Lakes Coch Lock Walton announced that the Russian Prime Minister Opener James against Danver Nagats in San Diego.
However, it is not yet set how many minutes he will play.
"It's going to be more than one and less than 48," said Walton on Lakes' official website.
Leckers' reporter Mike Trudel tweeted that James would probably play a limited minute.
After following the start of this week, James was asked about his plan for the six-to-six-six-six-six-six-square-six-square-square.

When Allie of West Virginia was in the tramp, YouTube channel
President Donald Tramp of West Virginia was conducting a campaign tonight in Huilling.
It's the first of five Tafsile conventions in the following week, in a friendly place with Tenesi and Mississippi.
The Supreme Court's election is in a standstill to ensure its election, with the aim of providing support for the mid-term election in the future, since the Republicans are in the process of losing control of Congress after the vote in November.
What is the time of the West Virginia convention tonight, and how do you view it online?
It is scheduled to be held at 7:00 p.m. on Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can see the West Virginia convention of the lower tramp via the YouTube Live Stream.
The trauma is likely to be related this week to the hearing of the Supreme Court's opinion of British Cavanna, which has been raised by a possible syndicate vote during the investigation of the FBI.
However, the primary goal of these conferences is to help the face-to-face republics to win some speeds in November's election.
Thus, President Tramp's accusation that the five Ra's aim next week was "to force citizens and supporters, as the Republicans are trying to protect and expand their numbers under the Senate and the representatives," Reuters said.
"The control of Congress is so important to its agent that we will travel to the country as far as possible with the poor propaganda," said a press release on the name of the unexpected tramp.
Huilling is defined for Wesbenoco Arena, today's conference "can bring back supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania and offer cover from Pittsberg media," according to West Virginia Metro News.
Since last month, like the second time in West Virginia, the state has won over 40 percent points in 2016.
In front of the tramp election, a petitioner from the West Virginia Republican Senate is trying to help Patrick Morrisi, who is behind bars.
According to Reuters, political leader Simon Hedar of West Virginia University said, "Maris has no good idea that the president should try to encourage him to vote more,"
Riyadh Cup 2018: Team U.S.
At the end of the three-time session, the need for this driver's cup was for a hearing bill.
The fall of the monumental pendulum is a full-fledged act, but players really believe it, and the most important in this national conflict.
So where are they going to say?
"They were a member of a six-point and now four, so I think we have a very similar moment now," Jordan Smith said to leave for that day.
Europe has the right to, of course, four points forward to the rest of the game.
As Spyth said, the Americans think there is some help on their way and they can be encouraged from many things, especially the form of Spitha and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and took three out of four points.
Spita was mortal from the beginning to the end and guided from the front.
He was even more violent with his rounds when he and Thomas were behind two points after two scorers, which were as important as taking a four-point scale mask.
The match he won on 15th was of the same kind, which tells you many that he believes the American team isn't out of it.
"You really have to go deep and think about your own body," Spith said.
This is what each of these players has.
It's 18 marks.
Spith and Thomas were the only players who got more points in the past two days than they were, but only Francisco Molinary and Tommy Fleetwood, the headmaster of the Rider Cup.
Europe's strange but worship can't go wrong from four to four.
"Moloud" was the only juice that didn't shoot any bogies on the TV, but they threw them into the back of the house in the morning, in the morning, and in the morning.
The Raan, and their strengths, seemed to have been driven by this exciting crowd, and they seemed to be the most popular players in the Arab world, and there was no other popular player except Flywood or Millinary with the sun on the Red Cross.
It's good if both of them are at the same time in different directions.
Although European dignity goes away from time to time.
Bob Watson and the Web Simpson made some problems for George Garsier when he was dating Alex Norren.
In the first nine, a bogey and two double Spaniards and Sweden were thrown into a cave where they could never get up.
On Wednesday, though, there's no one to get you out of your room.
The mutual lies between the walls, they suggest that they do not offer advice and that the council can change gradually because of the violence and forsam near them.
Europe has played well as a group so far and has taken an important lead on the final day, but this forum has also proved that the team of U.S. has been worried about the fight, especially the stateside.
Europe has 10-6 leagues on the Rider Cape Final Day
On the hard day of the Rider Cup, the European Health Organization will be allowed to take 10-6 members of the U.S. from Saturday's Forbelle and Forsam Mass.
Encouraged by jute Tommy Fleetwood and Francisco Molinary, the two Tiger Woods are in the fight against smoking twice as well as twice as in the Gulf National.
The European team of Thomas Journeys is fighting to recover the traffic that was lost two years ago in Hazelatin, which has won between 3 and 1 in the morning by spreading the wrong American side of the morning.
The U.S. has offered further resistance to Forsam, but they have not been able to complete the strike.
To recover the truck, we need eight points from the 12th Mass on Sunday.
The first European Ruki and he and Molinari, together with the "Mold" four points, were the first four points in the history of the radar coffee after a very unusual week.
Woods and Patrick Reed were forced to leave behind the lost Woods and the American Ruki Brison Decambius to be more fiercely jailed by 5 and 4.
On Saturday, two masks were lit between the ledge and the tape, but now he's lost 19 masks and Tana seven between his foreball and forasam.
Justin Rose came back to the Henry Stanson of Forsam for breakfast at Dustin Johnson and Brooks Cooker on pages 2 and 1 - one and three in the world.
It was a monument to the south-west of Paris, even though it was not to itself in Europe on the day of the wind.
The three-time main winners Jordan Spita and Justin Thomas set up a table for Americans on two points on Saturday.
They won 2 and 1 powerful victory against the Spanish John Ram in Forbele and Jan Polter and returned to the Polish and Russian mackerel after two years.
A group of four points has just come back in the history of the Rider Cup, although as a result, only the drive is needed to recover the immediate traffic.
After the second good for two days, it seems to be going to leave them with a lot of ruby attacks.
The North Korea said no one would ever be banned except 'No way'.
North Korea's Prime Minister Senibar told the UN that the existing ban on the United States is further deepening its faith and that in this national situation there is no chance of leaving their nuclear weapons alone.
R. Yong Hoo of the World Organization's annual general session said North Korea took a positive step like closing the nuclear and nuclear tests last year, breaking the nuclear test, and promising not to increase the scope of nuclear and nuclear weapons"
"So we couldn't see any similar response in the United States," he said.
"If we don't trust the United States, we won't trust our national security, and there's no way to block us from this national situation."
Although Ri described North Korea's complaint against Washington's "level" approach on human trafficking as a result of the slow action taken in North Korea, his statement was timely because he did not once ignore the "capitalization" since Beijing has done so in the past.
R. 12 stated a joint statement by Kim Jong Won and Donald Tramp at the first meeting between US President and North Korea in June Singapore, when Kim promised to work on "improvement of Korea's recommendations" and when the trauma guaranteed the security of North Korea.
North Korea is looking for an organizational end to the Korean War 1950-53, but the United States says that Beijing must first leave its weapons of mass destruction.
Washington, North Korea, has also responded to calls for severe international bans.
They are also fighting against the declaration of the end of the war, as the bans on the money they intended to pay for their obligation have increased their pressure, even against the declaration of the end of the war.
"The bans may bring upon our land this idea of us a little dream for those who don't know.
But the problem is that our faith is becoming more and more deeply eroded by the constant ban."
R. Kim and Tramp commented on the plan for the second summit that was held in the United States for the first week.
In place of Mr. Mahoday, Mr. Kim and President of South Korea, quoted three meetings between Mr. Man Jain as saying: "If South Korea had not been in the United States, the ban on the Korean peninsula would not have come so quickly."
However, Rei's speech was quite different from last year's, when he told the U.S. general teacher that he was being bullied by North Korea's rocket when "Mr. Evil President" traumatized "Rockt Man" Kim.
In the nation this year, Trapp, threatened to "damaged as a whole" North Korea last year, commended Kim for her courage to take the steps of disarmament, but said that there would still be much work to do and that the bans would remain until North Korea would be banned.
The trauma said there was no time limit for it, he said, "If it takes two years, three years, or five months, it doesn't work out."
China and Russia have agreed that Pingingang should be awarded to the U.S. Security Council
However, the U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompey announced to the United States: "The Security Council's prohibitions must be effectively enforced until we are fully checked out."
Since 2006, restrictions on North Korea have been increasing since 2006.
Pampeo met with Reir in Asempeli, a general representative of the League of Nations, and then said he would travel back to Beijing next month to prepare for the second assembly.
Pompey has already traveled to Korea three times this year, but his last trip was not successful.
When he left Beijing in July, he said that some progress had been made, only hours before he was sentenced to "probably like gondals" in North Korea!
North Korea has promised to meet with Mon in this month a missile site and a nucleary complication to fail if the United States adopts the U.S. "Informal system."
He said Kim was looking for the "consolidated steps" that he was looking for was the security guarantee in the tramp Singapore and his security warrant that he had come to normalize his relationship with Washington.
Harvard's students are getting enough rest.
This year, Harvard University's new Cafino-Zibalani course reminds all of her students of the most orderly way to get more sleep for the night of the "night's" reading.
A student has discovered how students in a number of universities around the world tend to be confused about how they take care of themselves with very basic things.
Harvard Medical School's sleep therapist and Brigham and Women's Hospital Specialist Charles Cijilla have created this course, which he believes is the first time in the United States.
After giving a talk about the impact of sleepless learning, he decided to start the course.
‘ At the end of this, a girl came to me and said, ‘Why did you tell me this this day, my leader came in?’
He said that anyone or anyone had never told him about the importance of sleep - which made me angry, 'He told the Telegraph.
This course, which began as early as this year, explains how the good practice of sleep helps academics and Athletics to improve their general health.
The headmaster of the Harvard Medical School’s mental health teacher and director of the University’s health service department, Paul Bareira, said that after the students had gone to bed for a week, they decided to run this course at the university.
For an hour, there's a task to be done in the long course.
In one section there is a picture of a student room where students will click on coffee cup, screen, teacher and books and learn about the effects of caffeine and light and how the Athletic Performans Sleep has been affected by the noise and the importance of a bedtime routine.
On the other hand, participants are told how long-term sleep exercise can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer
An interactive icon map of the campus, then encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
'We know it won't immediately change the behavior of the students.
However, we believe that they have the right to know - such as your decision to eat cigarettes but also the right to know the health implications of it, 'The professor added the sailor's sailor.
He said that there is still a culture of pride "to be awake in the evening," he said, because of the increasing pressure on modern technology and the students to sleep.
A student should be a 'secret weapon' to fight stress, clientiness and anxiety to make sure that you're good enough to fight stress, anxiety, and anxiety, he says - even the sleep's noise makes the headache dangerous, and their behavior gets worse."
19-year-old Raymond Soo, a 19-year-old professor of physical and biological sciences in California, helped design the course, including a class during his first year in Harvard last year.
He said the course opened his eyes and made him broadcast for a campus-Wide course.
In the next step, he hopes that all high school students will be asked to complete such a class program before joining the Contest.
Professor Sijiller suggested that the students should consider setting up a alarm for their arrival and when the students should go to bed, and that they should be warned about the harmful effects of the 'Blue Light' determined by the magic screen and the AIDS light, which may destroy your Sardinian flag, and thus show the problem of going to sleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Master of Mangar Golger Gerard.
Dr. Megger saw the other Away Mache party because of the fact that the Steven Gerard Elomelo group had been present in Livingstone between 1 and 0.
In St. Johnston, February 4-1, the Ibrax team was looking at another victory, but Gary Holt's team gave him the second floor of Gerard as manager of 18 Machei, which took him eight points away from the top of the Ledbrok's prime capital.
Menga was attacked seven minutes ago in Haf-time, but the hopes of the Rangers Line Up never gave up on them.
Renjars has now gone down to the station, Livingston has gone up third and left Hibernian on the other side of the Goll.
And there may be other problems for the Rangers because the Linsman Calam Spanish has to be treated for something that's too difficult to deal with.
The group changed eight times, which took Air to the Betfried Cup seminar.
Holt, on the other hand, went with Levi 11 who took a point from Harts last week and was proud of how his team seemed to oppose the opposition.
Livingston has done more than they say.
The first time the manager sent Scott Pittman to the Leof Alan McGriger, they should have been scored in just two minutes, but the Midfielder lost his great chance.
A long-standing free-cooked Krag Hulket from Kagan Jakobs was able to kill his defence partner, Alan Litogo, just in the back post.
The Rangers control was reopened, but there was more hope in the final store than in their game.
Alfredo Morlos must have felt that he and Steven Lelles had to find his pen in the Quarter-Aware, but Referi Steven Thomson had ignored the request of the Colombians.
The Rangers can only record two cents on the first month, but the head of Liam Cali Lasana Kubali and Ovi Azeriya's share of the U.S.
The 34 minutes of Livir's excitement may have been against the source of the game, but no one can deny that they are the threat of their planned game.
The Rangers Jacobs couldn't handle the dip set-ups again.
Dekan Galagar Scott Robinson has not responded to the attack by Scott Arafid, who has held his head to choose Menga for a common term.
Gerard took action at the time with Ryan Kent to replace the Kulibli and was almost working with the change since the Hungarian was in Moral, but the unusual Kelly took her off the line.
However, Livingston’s viewers started to play the right kind of game, after Litho and Halket said long words.
Holt's team could move on to their league at the end, but McGregor's efforts to destroy the Jacobs had been put to death before he was taken away from Lithog's coroner.
Thomasson again turned his face to the understatement of the Ranger's underground Glen Middleton, which claimed to be with the hot news with Jacobs.
Almanac: The inventor of the gay counter.
And now on our "Sande Morning" page, Almanaka: 30 September, 1882, today, 166 years ago... the day the scientist Jones Wilhelm "Hans" was born in Gigaer, Germany.
The guitar activity has created a way to detect and measure it, a discovery that is known as the guitar accounter to the end.
Since then, a fundamental science has become the basis of a pop culture of the guitar counter, in 1950 at the "Bels of Coronado" film, which appeared to be the most likely Cuban scientist Ray Rogers and Del Evans:
Man: "What else is this?"
Rogers: "It's used to find techniques such as Uranium.
When you turn off these phones, you can hear the effects of the evidence from the media."
Evans: "Is that what it says?"
"Hans" guitar died a few days before his 63rd birthday in 1945.
But his so-called discovery is still alive.
The vaccine for new cancers can teach the immune system to detect damaged cells.
The vaccine of the new cancer can teach the immune system to detect and kill weakened cells.
The vaccine teaches the immune system to identify weakened cells as part of a treatment
This procedure includes removing anti-smoker cells from the patient and changing them in the lab.
Then they can use a common ‘see’ protein for many cancers and then re-enter.
A test vaccine has shown promising results for patients with various levels of cancer.
A woman who has been treated by the vaccine, who teaches the immune system to detect weakened cells, has seen the cancer of her lungs disappear for more than 18 months.
In this way, anti-smokers are taken from the disease, converted to tests so that they can see the common protein of many cancers called HER2 and then forced to re-enter the cells.
"Our results show that we have a very promising vaccine," said J. Barzfsky, director of the American National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland.
HER2 "Brest, Demobash, Fusfus and Coloric Cancer are growing in various types of cancers, explains Professor Barzfsky.
It has also done the same way to treat patients with leukemia for "study" and "How to Target Cancer Cells".
After a MAGA summit, the pro-tramp dispute was fought in the Canary West SS.
It didn't work out.
Canyea West was placed in a studio after a long parade in September, where he praised the US President Donald Tramp, who said he would stay alone in the year 2020.
After playing his third night song called Ghost Town, where he had a Mac American Great Cap, he condemned democracies and renewed his support for the trauma.
"Sometimes when I talk to a white person, they say, "How do you like the tramp, he's a writer?"
Well, if I was worried about the story, I'd come out of America a long time ago," he said.
So started with a sketch at the SSL Matt Daemon, where Hollywood's high-quality Christine Blazi Ford was playing with Bret Kavana's witness to the Senate's Judiciary Committee on the Prevention of Yion.
Although it has not been announced, West has been uploaded to social media by the foot-and-mouthed actor Chris Rock.
It's not clear whether Rock tried to play West by the post.
In addition, West soldiers accused him of having to face problems with his head.
"They put me in the backyard.
They said, 'Don't go out after the crowd.'
They've got me!
And then they said I'm in a dump, according to Washington Xsaminer's list.
West says, "Do you want to see the place?" It says he'll read his Superman Cup because it doesn't mean what you're gonna do to me. "Do you want to see the world move forward?
Then try with love."
His comments were doubled from the audience and the members of the SNA Costas were widely aware of the woman, where one person announced the publication: "The whole studio had penpton humility."
West was considered an option for the Gayca Aryana Grand, whose former lover, R.A. Mac Miller died a few days ago.

The West Security Group TPUSA's chief Canadian Turner, who tweeted: "Thank you for standing up against criminals."
However, Toxcho's representative Karen Hunter tweeted that West was "what was it and he was bad at the same time."
"So I have chosen not to reward someone (in support of his music or dress or his art") who are setting up and spreading harmful patterns to my people.
He's free.
And so do we." He added.
Earlier on January, Ruper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and now he's "as an organizationally known as Cany West."

Kit Harington is known for its military role as the Central Fantasy Series Game of Thrones.
However, 31-year-old actor Maso Nai says about the stereotype of Maso Naike, which means that having a national role on the screen means that young boys think they have to be hard to get.
When talking to the Times Calchary in Sande, Kitt said, "Something's gone wrong," he believed and asked how to deal with the problem of the toxic masculinity in #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married Rose Lesley at the age of 31, admitted that he had a strong sense of the problem.
'I personally, I feel very strong now - where are we going wrong with men?' he said.
'When men were growing up, what did we teach them that we are now facing this problem?'
Kit believes that television may be partly responsible for the growth of the toxic mass of human beings.
He said, 'What's simple, and what are we learning?
What does it teach on television and on the street that children feel that they must follow this specific path if they want to be men?
I think it's really the biggest question of this time -- how do we change it?
' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' '
At the meeting, he further admitted that when the next Greek serial is renewed, he will not perform any game oftrons in practice or cycival, he said he has finished the life of 'war area and race'
Since November, Kit Sam Shepard will be restructured to the Tru West, which tells a film user and his brother.
The actor recently announced that he viewed his wife Roz as a good thing to get out of the game oftrons.
'I've met my wife in this hearing, so it has given my family my future life
The Roz Amy Award-winning Fantasy Series has been awarded as the most popular novel in the history of Kitts.
In June 2018, this couple was married to a family in the state of Leslie, Scotland.
HIV / AIDS: China has released 14% increase in new events.
The number of HIV and AIDS attacks in China has increased by 14%.
There are more than 820,000 people in the country, Helth officials say.
About 40,000 new events have been reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
Most of the new cases were caused by the violence, which has changed since the past.
Historically, HIV infection spread rapidly across China for blood operations.
However, in this way the number of HIV attacks has been almost zeroed, China’s Helth Officers said at a meeting in the Union.
Although every year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
The HIV- attacks by youth are a major public problem in China's Algebra community.
China was validized in 1997, but Elzbi is still considered to be a prosecutor against people.
Because of the country's security values, it has been estimated that between 70 and 90% of men associate with men and then marry women.
Many of the disease attacks come from insufficient security in this regard.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised the public access to HIV as part of Mokabella's efforts.
Max. Waters Gupi's data source does not accept 'unusual lies' and 'senseless lies'
The U.S. Federal Republic of China denied that one of its employees posted personal information on the Wikipedia page of the lawmakers of three U.S. Republican senators.
The Los Angeles Democrat strongly claimed that these claims are being published by "Altra-right Wing" and on websites.
"A lie, a lie and another hate lie," said Waters on Twitter.
The published information says that the U.S. senators' home address and phone number are included.
This information was published online last Friday, a prominent member of the Supreme Court posted an unknown person in the capital when he heard of the arrest warrants against the Supreme Court's petition against British Kavana.
After the three senators questioned Kavana, the solution came in a few seconds.
A security site such as the Gateway and the Redsite announced that the IP address of the post's source was connected to the Waters office and that any member of the Waters workers had published information, Hill reported.
"This baseless charge is completely false and a false lie," Waters says.
"A member of my staff - whose identity, personal data and security have been exposed to this cruelty and false charges - was not responsible for the loss of this information.
This baseless charge is completely wrong and a false lie."
Waters' description of the quick White House's old press, Schib Arr Flescher, has been answered online by many.
"This objection is rejected," Flesher wrote.
"It says that Congress does not have the will to be a member of Congress.
When accused of anything they didn't do, they won't be angry.
They're not going to argue.
They should certainly not be questioned about the purpose of the prosecutor.
They must be at peace and with one another."
Judge Kavana compared Waters' response to the democrats' response to the debate, Flesher, the former president, felt that he was very upset.
Republican prayerr Omar Navaro, who has chosen to register Waters in the mid-election, has also voiced his opinion on Twitter.
"It's big if it's true," he tweets.
In his statement, Waters said that his office warned "adjusted authorities and law enforcement organizations about these claims.
"We will ensure that the criminals are exposed," he insisted, "but any member of my staff and all members of my staff will be legally responsible for all their acts of destruction and destruction."
John English Strikes Age Review - Poor Ryan Atkinson password
It is now possible to see Brexit in a new picture with British Trik, and it seems to be useful for the restoration of Jean-English-Commedy Spof French - which was started by John English in 2003 and returned to the life of John English River in 2011.
Clearly, how many poor nations will make that self-sustained issue a new opportunity?
In any event, Pope-Swedish, Rabar-Shii-Shii has the license to create a new thing like the second time in English - which means that his name indicates that he is a wide-ranging little creature designed for the world of languages other than English.
He was certainly a fool's secret representative who, despite the intense nature of the masked poet, made a note in the 2012 Olympic's exciting event regarding the theme of fire in London, one of Mr. Bin's dash and one of his hats.
He based primarily on the truck and attracted the people of international secrets to the post of atkinson's blackboard TV news that once went missing, spreading the controversy over the news.
The last time JY outing has one or two bad moments.
I'd like to see John English come to a helicopter in connection with the light of the light of the middle age.
The gifts of Atkinson for physical combat are shown, but the Russians feel very low and surprisingly, especially in 2007 and the Mission Impsibelle film brand is now offering Kuttuk as an element of self-confidence.
The reality seems to be that it has been aimed at children more than adults, and I don't think it's as natural and central as the actors in Atkinson's low-scene player in the surprise of John English.
Mostly, the topikal foundation is the Great Britain issue.
A cyber hacker of Britain has entered a very secret web network, a small role for some Eldon, unfortunately to bring to the attention of all British agents in the field, to discourage the responsible agent.
It's the last confidence of a prime minister who has already lost a full sense of political opposition, he is weak and vulnerable: My Thompson has devoted himself to this post-theresa, but there is nothing more to work in the script.
His goanda consultants told him that each active secreter had to be taken out of custody.
And it means renting John English, who is now appointed as a school teacher in some other institutions, but how does he learn about his next work outside the record: there are some good things here, since English offers a school of gondagiri's rock-type academics.
He returned to the English White Hall for the necessary briefings and was reunited with his former long-standing sidewalk in Ben Miller's apartment.
Boo is now a married man, married to a submerin commander, a role of a water-hokey-stick in which a certain part of the private paper was chosen.
As a result, Batman and Rabin returned to action to make a fatal mistake in the Har Majesty's Secret Service, Ologa Kurelenko's wife, Ophelia Bolitovar, came back.
In the past, Prime Minister Karishmetic has been heavily involved in the magic of a qualified billionaire, who has claimed that he can solve the problems of British computer: Jack Lassie, a special criminal Jason Volta.
English and Bow start their amazing high-speed voice: They fire a flash French restaurant along the water; they push themselves on Voltaire's billboard and start maramari; and they try to use the virtual Realty headset to get to know themselves inside the English Voltaire's house.
All the steps have certainly been taken for the final order, but it has a lot of children's TV on the whole issue.
A lot of mean staff.
And I can't be like other John English films: Can't British film artist Ryan Atkinson have any role to play that really judges his face?
Lebar denies that it is planning to work four days a week for Britain but will be paid for five days
Jeremy Kobin's Liver Party will consider a major project that will see British work four days a week - but it will be paid for five days.
According to the report, the organization's owners want to share a few more days of work through artificial wisdom (AI) development.
It will see workers enjoy their three days' short days - but it will still pay the same price.
The group's financial message will be 'Fit' and there's a plan to move the country to the workers.
The Trade Union Congress has approved a four-day transfer as a way of getting an opportunity to change the economy of the workers.
A reporter from the Liberian party told The Sande Times: 'A policy is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
"It won't happen tonight, but four days' workdays are an invitation to join the work force's substantive art community in order to keep the team involved in economics."
Not the first to support this national opinion, the Green Party promised four working days during its 2017 general election.
The invitation is not currently actively supported by the Labour Party, however.
A letter from the Liberian party said: 'The four-day working days party is not a principle and it is not considered by the group.'
Chado Chancellor Macdnal used last week's workshop to publish his views on a social crisis in the economy.
Mr. Macdonell said he was determined to give back power from 'unknown managers' and 'profits' to the offer organisations.
The current shareholders of the Shado Chancellor's plan could even get their full share back because the government could give some 'best' due to the misdemeanor.
He also confirmed the plan to keep employees on board and to build an in-house building for 10 per cent of the government's employees, whose annual profits amounted to $500.
In Lindsey Graham, tell the Canadians "60 minutes" whether Kavanna can change their mind.
Justice Bret Kavanna's investigation into the charges against the Supreme Court of the FBI has delayed for at least one week as a result of his assessment, and has raised questions as to whether the search for Burro could turn back their support to a republican senator.
At a meeting on Wednesday, the "60 minutes" reporter Scott Pelly asked the Republican senators about whether the Canadians and the Linghams who were able to find out if the FBI could do something to change their mind.
Canada was more open than her partner from South Carolina.
"Man, of course," said Kennedy.
"I told you to go to the hearing, I said I spoke to Judge Kavanna.
After this incident I called him, brought out the charge, said, 'What did you do?'
He was a strong, uncomplicated man."
Graham's vote, of course, seems inevitable.
"My mind has been drawn upon about my bride Kavanna and a very important charge will be needed to change it," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know that Bret strongly rejected it," said Christine Blasie Ford, adding Graham.
"And they couldn't check whose name he said.
It's 36 years old.
I can't see any new changes."
What is Global City Festival, and what has it done to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will be a global city festival, an annual musical event that has a bad line-up of their peripherals and an equally exciting mission; the end of the world's poverty.
Now in the seventh year, the Global City Festival will not only see thousands of people turn to Central Park Lent in order to enjoy such activities as Janet Jackson, Cardie B and Jean Mendes, but it will also be more careful in view of the event of the end of extreme poverty in the mid- 1930s.
Global City Festival, described in 2012, is an expansion of a global poverty project, which is an international group that looks forward to an increase in the number of people actively involved in the fight against poverty.
To get a free ticket for the event (if you don't want to pay for the VIP ticket), the concertgoers had to do more than one job or "activation" such as a service provider, an e-mail to a believer, a phone call or any other way of helping to increase their target.
But how successful has the global citizen been in keeping his goal for the rest of 12 years?
What is the real step of promoting people's participation through concerts, or another case of so-called "clicktivism" - where people think they sign an online invitation or send a tweet to the truth?
Since 2011, Global City says it has recorded more than 19 million more "actions" from its supporters, leading to various targets.
It says that these measures have helped global leaders to announce more than $37 billion of the same promises and principles that will affect the lives of 2.22 billion people during the 1930s.
By the beginning of 2008, the group had quoted 39 pledges and declarations that had begun since its trial, of which at least $10 billion had already been distributed or offered.
According to the group, the safe shelter has still affected nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the main promises are that the participation of U.S. fundamental managers and realists will "help children increase their full potential" and that Rwanda will continue to consume 35 million people after receiving more than 4,700 global tweets.
"With the help of the U.S. government, employers, national governments and global citizens like you, we can become the subject of the past's social injustice as a subject of history," said Tracy Ulman of the State of New York in April 2018.
The group further said that after more than 5,000 actions were taken in the United States to improve the mother and children's child welfare, the government announced a financial contribution for a project, The Pawa de Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children manually.
"What do you think we can do to end poverty?"
The Global Citizens replied: "It will be a long and strong path - we will never read and fail.
However, we will succeed, as we have great civil rights and anti-racial events, because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, The Week, John Mendes, Cardie B, General Monni New York, is the most in this year's event that will be held by Debora-Le Farnes and Hyu Jacman.
The U.S. Air Force can use the ship to "stop" the Russians to stop the Taliban.
Washington can protect his ship's shipyard in order to prevent Russian sailors from arriving in the countries of the Middle East, according to the Washington Examiner's description of the United States internal satellite Jink.
Jink accused Russia's fight in Syria - of course, where it works at the invitation of a legitimate government - of a dislike to see a new green market.
"I believe that the reason for their early position is that they want to improve the environment like the South European centre," he said.
And according to the authorities, there are ways and means to accept it.
He said, "The United States has the power to keep the sea free and, if necessary, to prevent their villages from entering the market."
In the United States of America, Ginke spoke of participants in events organized by a diverse group of conjugates.
He compared Russia and Iran to using Washington in the same way.
"Irran and Russia's economic options are less favourable and more likely to replace them than the Russian economy," he said.
This information is provided in place of tramp management in Europe for many European citizens in order to reduce the amount of natural gas emissions.
In this way, US President Donald Trampe, with the authority to manage the tramp, is trying to get Germany itself from the "appropriate" North Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to the tramp, has been trapped by Berlin Moscow."
Moscow Barbar insisted that 11 billion US dollars' North Stream 2 pipelines, which doubles current pipeline capacity, are ready to take 110 billion cubic metres - it is a fully financially reliable project.
Cremlin's agreement is that Washington's violent opposition to the project is nothing more than economical, and it is an unprecedented example of opposition.
"In my belief, we agree that we cannot be used as a force for printing and should have the power to select the most successful recipients," Mr. Alexander Novak of the Russian Party said after a meeting with US Prime Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
As a result of the position of the United States of America, the president agreed with Germany, re-assisted the German project.
In the area of art, the former German Federation of German Industries (BDI) told the United States to stay away from the bilateral agreement between the European Union and Berlin and Moscow.
"Angela Markel, Chancellor of Germany and President Vladimir of Russia after the recent meeting of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), said the chief dictator of the German India (BDI) said that there is a major problem with our third country's support for the Third World.
Elizabeth Warren, president of 2020, said in prayer, "I'm going to see you," said the Senator of Massachusetts.
Elizabeth Warren Senibar, Senator of Massachusetts, said he would "open the prayer for the President's foot" after the election.
Warren is a tune of the Halley of Massachusetts, making sure he's in opposition.
"The time has come for women to go to Washington and correct the government we read about, and this includes women's absence," he says.
"After 6 November, I will call the President's opposition. "
Warren Town is now publishing as President Donald Tramp, who is driving the country in the wrong direction.
"I am very concerned about what Donald Tramp is doing to our population," he said.
The advice of the Supreme Court of Waren Traps and Traps was presented in a discussion of Bret Kavanawagh.
In a Twitter newspaper last Friday, Warren said, "We need an FBI investigation before we vote."
A survey published last week, most of Warren's voters do not think he should fight in his election in 2020.
The political research center/Boston Globe of the University of Safok says that the "probably" five-percent voter in Massachusetts is not supposed to fight against the senator's vote.
He supported hundreds of fighting.
The survey shows that the former Governor's Devil was more supportive of the fight against Patrick's vote, where 38 per cent supported the possible fight and did not make 48 per cent.
The other high profile democratic names discussed in the 2020 vote include former Vice President Jo Byden and Bernie Sanders, St.
Associated press announced that Byden will decide organizationally between January.
PTSD of the track pole in conjunction with all of the Palin Donald Traps
The 26-year-old Track Palin killed Iraq a year after listing in September.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence on Friday night
"She compared to Oklahomar says to visitors at a meeting of Donald Tramp, "I can understand other families who can understand the consequences of anything that PTSD and our soldiers have brought back."
Palin calls his arrester "home hand" and says about his son and other war-experts, "They're back, they're strong, they're back, they're thinking, do they think that the military and aircraft and other military members of the country that he has given to those fellow workers?"
He was arrested this morning in Alaska City and was charged with family violence, arms trafficking and drug trafficking against a woman, according to Dan Bennet of the Police Department.
18 U.S.A., U.S.A., supports the New Security Policy Challenge
The arrests support Inni Challenges against the new U.S. government and the district of Colombia, who refuses to protect the victims from gang violence or family violence.
The NBC News announced that in order to support a security lawyer who calls the principle, 18 representatives from the state and districts owe a friend-of-the-art letter to a court in Washington on Friday.
The full name of the sea was not published in the case of Greece V. Sessions, which was charged against the U.S. Civil Libertize Union Federal Policy in August.
He said his partner "and his violent gang boys" gave him galli, but US workers rejected his safety request on July 20th.
He was arrested in Texas.
The Athenians of the states that support Greece provide examples of El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, as a country that faces the problem of gangs and family violence, from where many seek refuge in the United States.
The 2014 decision of the new U.S. Security Officer Apple Board to allow for the security of unauthorized residents for family violence.
In a statement by the District of Columbia, General Carl Resin said that the new principle "has ignored the state, federal and international laws of many decades."
A friend-of-the-court briefing says, "This federal law should be judged on the basis of specific information and circumstances, and this national ban is contrary to the original objective."
The statement further argues that the principle that citizens are denied access has been violated in the U.S. economy, because they are more likely to be employed and they "excessively work."
Attorney General Jeff of the Immigrance Justices of Athens ordered that family violence and non-refoulement be avoided by the perpetrators of gang violence.
"The nation, religion, nationality or certain social group may be deprived of membership or political opinions or may be protected from fear of those who have to leave their own country," said the principle of the session on June 11.
To say safe is never the solution to all problems - even all fatal problems - that people all face every day in the world.
Two deaths and two deaths in Plauto
The response was terrible for the survivors.
"Risa Kusuma, 35-year-old in the city's security centre in Palu, said to comfort her pregnant child," it was very interesting."
"Ambulance is dying every minute.
There's no water to wash."
In an effort to find out what is found in the water, residents have found themselves lost.
Hundreds of people were injured and 7.5 were injured in hospitals.
A man with dui Harris who has broken his leg and legs has been put out of Palu Armi Hospital, is being treated under the sky for the next surgery.
While sitting in a five-bedroom hotel with a woman and a canary, she was surprised to talk about the feeling of a terrible earthquake.
"There's no time to save them.
I had an accident in the middle of the breakup, perhaps," Harris told the press representative that they had come to the city for a wedding.
"I hear my wife's cry for help, then humility.
I don't know what happened to her or my children.
I hope they're safe."
U.S. Ambassador to China accused "Propaganda Declaration" of "Galagali"
A week after a government newspaper published a four-page announcement to China's state newspaper, China's US Ambassador Beijing accused the US of using the US press to launch a targeted campaign against China's Beijing.
U.S. President Donald Tramp mentioned the Ped Supplement to the China Daily Des Mines Register of the Great Lakes of the past decade and made a deliberate attempt at China's election on November 6th in the US Congress, China rejected the charge.
Tramp's charge is that Beijing is trying to help with the US elections, which US workers tell Reuters about a new attempt to force China.
It is a natural event that the foreign government will announce to the press, but Beijing and Washington have now been sent to the commercial war, which has resulted in increased wage increases in imports.
China and the United States experts say that this trade was designed to destroy protesters in the country, such as Iawa, who supported the coup d'état in the first place in the war.
China's US angel and the former governor of Iowa, Teri Branstad, who is a major producer of agriculture in China, says Beijing has damaged American workers, farmers and businessmen.
In a post at the Das Mines Register of Branstad Rabybar, China says that "that old man has now doubled with our own propaganda of disobedience."
Branstad writes, "The Chinese government has adopted the immoral history of freedom of expression and free news in the propaganda of the Dese Mines Register."
"On the other hand, as far as Beijing is concerned, you will find a limited countermeasure in New Zealand, and you will not see the image of the Chinese people who are at odds with the economic path of China, because the media is here at the hands of China's Communist Party."
He added that his letter "has refused to print a major newspaper in China," although he did not mention the name of the newspaper.
The Republicans want to keep Kavanf's debate away from women's voters before the midterm, the analysts warned
In the face of several accusations of persecution by the Republic of the Republic of the Republic of the Republic of Korea, the Supreme Court's minority Brit Kavanf stood by the Supreme Court and the analysts warned to hide that they would be able to see a response from women in the upcoming midterm elections.
The issue has grown rapidly around, and most Republicans seem to want to go ahead with the vote already.
In a report published on Saturday, Maxwell University's national science teacher Grant Rihl said, "They can't come back in any way."
Rihar said that he wondered if the pressure of Senator Jeff Flick (Ar-Arizona) would calm down the pressure on the FBI for the investigation.
According to Washington D.C. magazine, the pro-promoted Movoon Group's advice and the National Women's Primary School Carin-Pier said in January, "Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget it in the future and November."
Despite the testimony of Dr. Kristin Blazi Ford, Kavanf's board of directors of the Kavanf's board of judges decided to move ahead of the republics on Friday morning when the protesters protested about the Senate.
"Direct political analyst Stu Röthenberg told the news site," the past of the digital economy and distribution accounts will be over.
"People say there's already much more; it's true.
But it can be even more, especially among female voters in particular in the city and among young voters between the ages of 18 and 29 who do not vote because they do not like the president."
Even before giving a witness to the Ford against the Supreme Court's opinion on the charge of violence against the petitioners, researchers suggested that if the Republicans continued to do so, they might respond.
"It has been a vital issue for GYOP," said the former Chairman of the National Committee of the Republican before last week, Chaerman Michael Steel NBC News.
"It's not just a committee vote or a final vote or a café, but how the Republicans have taken the issue and how it has been used with it," said Preoritis U.S. Group, who are helping Democrats with the vote, told their director gay Social News Channel.
However, some Americans felt confused about who should believe in Fords and Kavanf's testimony, and then they were confused.
A new survey in Yugoslavia revealed that 41 per cent of respondents believed in the testimony of Ford, where 35 per cent said they believed in Kavanf.
Also seen, 38 percent said they thought Kavanf probably lied when he received his witness, and only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
Following the pressure from Flickr, the FBI is currently investigating the charges against Debora Ramirez for Ford and one of the most charged charges, the Guardian report.
Ford testified before the judicial committee last week that he had been murdered by Kavanf Nasher at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court showed him in a party during the 1980s when he was reading Yele.
Google and Facebook have planned to launch a new Internet project on the World Wide Web to connect with Google and Facebook.
The World Wide Web team is launching a startup to fight against Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The last project, Inupt, of this technology, will create a company that will create a source platform solid on Burners-Lil.
Solid users have the right to choose where their data will be collected and which information will allow people to access.
At a single meeting with Fast Company, Burnars-Le admitted that Inrapt's real purpose is "World Authority".
"We have to do it now," he said about the startup.
"It's a historic moment."
This feature allows you to create P and D or "Personal Online Data Store" using the Solid technology.
It can include contact lists, to-do lists, calendars, music libraries and other personal and page tools.
It's like getting Google Drives, Microsoft Outlooks, Slacks and Spectifs all on the same browser and on the same one.
The other thing about your personal online data store is that it will depend entirely on the user - you can access any type of data.
The company named it "Personal power through data."
According to the organization Cio Jun Bruce, the idea of Inrapt will help bring all the resources, processes and appropriate skills to achieve stability.
The organization has now set up a security platform for Burnars-Lee, Bruce, ABM, with a group of agreed non-staff developers and sequential coders.
At the beginning of this week, skilled developers worldwide can create their own focused applications using the tools available on Inupt's website.
Burners-Le said he and his team were not talking about "to make a complete change with Facebook and Google where all their business models will be completely changed at night."
"We don't want permission from them."
In a post published on Saturday, Burners-Le writes that "the aim of the report is to protect the safety and quality of the new web created on solid"
In 1994, Barnars-Le Maschusets Institute of Technology established a World Wide Web Consortium and changed the internet.
In the past few months, the network's defence dispute has emerged as a powerful pillar of Barnars-Le.
The Burners-Le World Wide Web Consortium, Web Foundation and Open Data Institute will also be the founder and director of this project.
"I'm incredibly disappointed about the coming era of the web," Barnars-Le added.
Bernard Van: The Victoria Cross Clarification of First World War
The century of the city of Adi was celebrated by the only priest in England who won the Victoria Cross during the first world war.
Lieutenant Cornel de Reverend Bernard Van was defeated on September 29, 1918 by Belenglis and Lehankot.
In any case, he was killed four days later by a terrorist, and he never knew he had won the most British military respect.
On Saturday in the Northamptonshire of Russia, two of her aunts in Kushkawazee celebrate her memorial.
His aunt Michael Van said it's "extraordinaryly complete" that this monument is being celebrated 100 years after his grandfather's funeral.
According to The London Gegett, Lieutenant Colonel Van of September 29, 1918, led his battalion by the famous Gon Kuasha and Field and Mesingan Golls" during the St. Quantin Channel Peronna.
Then he went down to the firefighting line and led the line with the "Most Courageous" and led only one field song along with three enemies.
Lieutenant Colonel Van Van died on October 4, 1918, just a month before the end of the war.
Michael Van, 72, says his grandfather's actions "What I could never do and what I could fear."
He and his brother, Dr. James van Kuscawaz, who was the leader of the Brandwood Imperial Youth band, gave the best.
Michael Van said, "I understand the fear of parting in Paradise," and he added, "The length of a real beer is shown in the support of the real people."
M.M.'s candidates woke up all night to see 206 Bellot, but instead they got Pepa Pig.
Imagine that you've been awake all night to see a good player 206 and didn't show the original event.
The original ticket from San Jose had 13 tickets with six tickets and the U.S. channel 5 shows all night life.
Early in the morning, when Gegard Moussey and Rey McDonald were preparing to face each other, the government changed Pepa Peg and murdered the visitors of the United States.
In particular, they were awake to the water, so some people were worried.
On Twitter, a petitioner described the birth of a child in Cartoon Hall as "some kind of naked reality".
"It is not appropriate to show this kind of event in the morning under government law at 6 a.m. they were obliged to give the children's card to the court," Mr. Dave Schwarz, co-president of Belatto, answered the question.
"Papa de Pig," yes.
President Scott Kocker of Belato's organization said that the future of the United States visitors will work on creating a time line.
"Maybe we can solve this in time of play," said Koker.
"So now there are six Sunday mornings and our lunches, and I can't do this until Friday.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when it's done, there's a huge message coming later and they weren't very friendly.
We were trying to fix it, we thought it might be a technical mistake.
But no, it was a matter of government.
I promise it won't happen again.
We're going to reduce it to six instead of five feet -- as we usually do -- when we're trying to give more fans, it's gone.
It's a bad situation."
Dezart Island Disc: Tom Deli became "inseparable" because of his jealousy.
Olympic Driver Tom Delly said that as he grew up, he was humiliated because of his youth -- but it has made him successful.
The 24-year-old said he didn't know before he went to high school, "Not everyone like me."
When speaking to the first radio 4 dezart Island disc, Lauren Lavern, he announced that he had spoken about the right to provide "asha" to others.
He also said that after the birth of the child, his Olympics had lost their minds.
This long-term regular event, attended by Christy Young, has taken a few months because of illness.
Deley, who was in his first community at Lavern's first event, said he understood "small" more than everyone else, because "the children's favorites were socially unacceptable."
He said, "To this day, the thought of being a child and having a different sense of self-esteem has really brought me strength and strength to succeed."
He said he wanted to prove himself "something" so that everyone could know about his youth so that everyone would not be disappointed.
Two-time Olympics are named after the Bronze P.E., the Hii Profile Elzibi has become a publisher and has been working in Australia this year in order to invite more countries to acknowledge the compatriot.
He said he opened his face, because he felt happy to live openly and wanted to give others "a hope".
This three-time World Championship is about reading a man's love -- American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, who was shown in 2013 with what -- "I was surprised."
Deli married this assailant, who was 20 years older than he, who said there was no problem during his life.
"When you were so young," he went to the first Olympic at the age of 14 and killed his father three years later in cancer -- he said that it was difficult to find a young man who had seen so much response in life.
This couple gave birth to a son named Robert Ree Black-Deley in June and said that his "full vision" had changed.
He said, "If you asked me last year, I said, 'I have to win a gold medal', that's what I thought.
"In fact, there is something bigger than the Olympics.
Ruby is my Olympic master."
His son's name was Robert, who died in Moscow's cancer at the age of 40.
Dale said his father had never admitted that he was going to die, and he had asked until the end whether London was sure of their ticket for 2012 - because he wanted to stay in the first row.
"I have never been able to say, 'You won't be in the first row anymore," he said.
"When his faith stopped, I held his hand and left his trust until he died and I didn't admit that he was innocent," he said.
The following year, Deli took part in the 2012 Olympics and won the Brochure.
He said, "This was my whole life dream -- giving up the Olympics in front of my visitors, it doesn't make any sense."
It also aroused his first song's taste - the prewood of Hyder Smmel - which was accompanied by an Olympic preparation and which is still playing in his song.
BBC Radio 4 is a Deart Island disc on Wednesday 11:15 BS.
If off-form Michaelson will be sitting next to the six-month-old driver
The US Phil Miquellson Ravibar will record his 47th racer cap match, but if he does not want it to be bad, he will have to return his form.
Michaelson, who has been recorded 12 times in this bilateral event, has been replaced by Captain Jim Furick at the Forebble and Forsam on Saturday.
Instead of being at the centre of the lead, which he was playing in the United States, the 5-year-old winner of the five-year-old game has quit working as a cheerleader and has been busy trying to find his own game.
Not always safe among drivers at the top of Keria, this 48-year-old title is not suitable for the golf national course, where the long race has almost ruined the long track.
And if the course isn't bad enough for itself, Michaelson, 9th March, is facing the British Open Championship Francesco Molinary, who has won four matches this week with Ruki Tommy Fleetwood.
If Americans who are at least four points below the start of a 12-syngels match can start well, Michaelson's mass may be important.
Furick showed confidence in him, even though he didn't say much.
"But today she's fully aware of her role, holding my hand and saying she's ready for the day."
"And he has strong faith in himself.
He's one of the ones who gave the team a lot of money during the summer and summer and this week.
I probably didn't think he'd play two matches.
I was hoping for more, but that's what happened and we were thinking about moving on.
He wants to name the place, just like everyone else."
The most player cap match records in the Rabbar Mace Mikkelson Nic folder will be released.
It can already hit the radar cap in Korea that doesn't even follow his personal record.
Michaelson's team has 18 winnings, 20 winnings, and seven hafs, although Furic says he's alive the team.
"But nice people, ammuds, smarts, people in love, like being in a team room and a good person," he said.
"I think the new players enjoyed playing with him very much this week, which is very good to see.
He's only giving more than playing."
Europe's Captain Thomas Buzern knows that a big lion can be invisible.
Thomas Buzern, European Captain, from experience, knows that the last day of the driving cap on large lead can create a state of disillusionment in Senegal.
Dan's self-evident march, which took place in Valdaram in 1997, where the Governing Body of Savi Balesteros won five points to the Americans, but only in some way won the Finishing Line in the shortest part of March.
"You must remember that we had a big lead in the future; we had a big lead in Brooklyn, where we died, and in the future, where we won only in the middle of the name," Bezburn says, in the picture, he sees it last Friday and last two days at the Gulf National 5-3 in 2018.
History will show me and all the team that it hasn't ended yet.
It's a full day of zeal.
Name the place and do the right thing.
It's not over until we get a point on the board.
We have a goal, it's to try to get trophy jeta, and that's where our bird's eyes will be.
I've always said I'm looking at my group's 12 players, but we're very careful about who's next."
Bezron adds, I am glad to see our players do what difficult golf courses have done. "I will never be too confident about this.
Tomorrow's a different war.
Time will come in front of the private performens, and it's a different thing.
When everything goes well, it's good to be with the partner, but when you're alone, you're a golfer.
This message must be delivered to all players, which will have a good time.
Now you'll have to throw your partner away and take better care of him."
On the contrary, the opposite Jim Furick will be looking at what players as a group have played personally in order to play better, on the other hand, by Jordan Smith and Justin Thomas, who have taken three points from four points.
As part of the victory team in Har and Brooklyn in the "Olden event" that took place in Europe, Furic himself shared the experience of the two sides of the new post-transformation on the last day.
In the last day of 1999, Professor Ben Cransh, before his name was named, told his players how he wanted to know about it, he said, "I remember every word."
"We have 12 important masses tomorrow, but you'll want to get rid of starting as soon as Brooklyn and Madina.
When the game is over, there is a lot of pressure in the middle of the game.
We'll build a line-up by that and we'll call the boys as we think, we'll actually want to do some magic tomorrow."
Paul Cassie, Justin Roz, John Am, Tommy Fleetwood and Jan Polter were given the responsibility of directing Thomas against Europeans, who will face the first mass massacre of Rory Maclari.
"I've arranged this group, because I think it'll cover all of this," Bezron said about his election.
A new German warship stopped again
The local media reported that it was about to run with the German Neville least group in 2014 to replace the former German war-war fleet, but it will not be until at least next year because of the wrong system and the use of Snowballing.
The US headline was quoted in the Daily jet newspaper, and the first half of this release of the new Baden-Wartemberg-Shirin was stopped until the first half of 2019.
The ship was about to join the Navy in 2014, but this global project was a problem due to the issue of delivery.
In 2007, the four Baden-Wartemberg-class frigates will be replaced by the old Bremen-class frigate.
It is known that they will have strong kmana, anti-aircraft and anti-ship equipment, such as irradiated radar, infrared and acoustic signals.
Other important features include long-term maintenance periods - new frigates can be monitored for more than two years from the country's building.
In any case, it's an unprecedented slowdown of warships - which is going to be done in the name of the water, the news of the day jet.
Last year, the F 125 frigate came under title when the German Navy refused to carry the ship back to Hamburg's Bloom and Voss Shipyard.
This was the first time that a ship was sent back to Shipbilder after the ship's delivery.
The reasons for the return have been very low, but the German media have pointed out a number of important "software and hardware errors" that will cause the ship to fail in the war.
The software is particularly important, as the Baden-Wartemberg-class ships will be run by nearly 120 prophets - half the people of the former Bremen Freegates.
In addition, it has been shown that the ship will be too heavy to reduce its capacity and will create obstacles to joining the ship's future upgrade.
During the second world war of 7,000 tons of Rainland-Falz, it is thought to be two more heavy than the same group of German ships.
There has also been a problem with the entire project with the training of the wrong hardware.
The first level of 2.2 billion pounds is surprisingly worth 3.1 billion pounds ($3.6 billion).
The recent warning that Germany's nuclear power is being combined has become increasingly important for the new frijets.
At the beginning of this year, President Hans-Peter Bartels of the German Congress Protection Committee admitted that "Moutaen's suitable ship is flying" in the ship.
The worker said the problem was spread over time, since no representative of the former ship was taken away.
He laments that no ship was able to join the Baden-Wartemberg team.
I don't know what to do. I don't know what to do. I don't know.
A new study is being carried out at an asterisk in the Scotish coastal area to learn how to use landfills in search of food.
It is hoped that research will shed new light on the behavior of this other highly respected animal and will help with future conservation activities.
National Trust for Scotland's scientists are investigating simple and soprano pipelines and the Invarium Garden in Western Russia.
A special recording area will be positioned around the main area to track all the events of the entire museum.
NCS workers and agents will also use portable detectors.
The experts will study all the sounds of the recordings and make a call to the outside company and inform the public about what they are doing.
Then a visual map and a report will be produced to create a global map of their behavior.
It is hoped that NTS's type of storage advice will show that the most important areas of residence are the most important and how it is used by every nation.
This information will help to determine the effectiveness of living arrangements, such as the protection of habitats for third-country and third-country nationals and others.
In the past century, the number of refugees in Scotland and the United States has dropped dramatically.
They are in danger of building and developing jobs that damage their bedrooms and housing.
Air-based turbines and light may also be dangerous, such as some of the fliers and construction equipment, which may be dangerous to the surrounding surfaces.
It's not really dark.
However, their ears are more effective than their eyes at night when it comes to learning about the nature of the school.
They use an improved representation-place council to identify dangers and obstacles along the way.
ITS, which is responsible for the preservation of more than 270 historical buildings throughout the country, 38 important Ugandans and 76,000 hectares of land, has been important to the refugees.
Ten of them are trained professionals who regularly check, visit the sleeping area, and never rescue.
The organization has also set up the first and only registered storage site in Dumfriz and Triv Astate of Gallo, Scotland, where the ten of Scotland are located in eight different countries.
Astat Manager David Thompson said this is an area for refugees.
"There's a good place for fugitives in the Trive," he said.
"There's an old building here, there's a lot of old trees and all the good places.
But there's still much more to be done about the storm, so we'll help us understand what we need to save them here and elsewhere."
He stressed the importance of saying that abortion is important before protecting property, because it would have caused the destruction of 400 mothers and children by the destruction of a mother’s home, and could guarantee the total number of abortions.
The law prohibits killing, killing, killing or stopping animals or destroying their habitats is illegal.
He encouraged Elizabeth Farel, former storekeeper of Trust, to help the general public.
He said, “We still have much knowledge of the unknown, and we do not know how many generations will live.”
Ronaldo rejected the prosecution and the lawmakers were taking action against the German newspaper
He declared the charges against him "false news" that people wanted to "increase their identity" by his name.
Its legislators are ready to deal with the German news shop de Spigel, who have published this complaint.
In 2009 an American woman named Catherine Majorga was charged with investigating a hotel in Las Vegas against Portugal and Juventes Forvard.
He was accused of giving him $375,000 to keep secret about this incident, reported in the report of the Spigel of Sugar D.
A few hours after this statement came out, 33-year-old Ronaldo commented on the report when he spoke to his 142 million Flora in his Integral Live video.
"No, no, no, no.
They're telling lies today," Balon D'or's winning camera said.
"They want to get to know themselves using my name.
It's a simple matter.
My name means they want to hurt themselves, but it's a part of life.
I'm a happy man and everything's going well." The player smiles more.
According to Reuters, Ronaldo's legislators are preparing to deal with Dr. Spigel's charges, which they call "the unsubstantiated report on privacy".
The legal Christian Sheikh says that "for moral damage to a player's moral character according to the importance of longevity which is likely to be one of the most important disregards of personal rights in the recent period", the player needs to be punished.
The event was reported to have taken place in Las Vegas in June 2009 in a suite at Pams Hotel and Casino.
According to the paper charged to the Navadar Clark County District Court, Ronaldo and Mayorga are said to go home after a night club has met him.
Majorga claimed that after the incident, Ronaldo applied and told him that he was disappointed by "99 percent" "good people", "one percent".
The document claimed that Ronaldo confirmed that they compared John, but it was similar.
Mayorga further claimed that he had gone to the police station and had been photographed of his attack at the hospital, but later he became king of the court because he was "afraid of vengeance" and was afraid of "public humiliation".
The 34-year-old said he was trying to re-establish the verdict because he was mentally disturbed by the incident.
Ronaldo Manchester from the U.S. during his crimes was in the process of adding to Real Madrid, and in this case he added 100 million dollars to the famous Club of Italy.
Brexite: The U.S. will 'for ever' lose position as car manufacturer.
Minister of Business Greg Clarke said the United States "will burn forever" in the first place in the world after Brexit.
He adds that it's a "dangerous" that the U.S. Toota Bibisi told the U.S. that if Britain leaves the U.S. without any agreement, they will temporarily stop their production in the Bernese factory.
"We need a deal," Mr. Clark said.
The Japanese car manufacturer has announced that if it is broken without an agreement, people can go to work for a limited period of time.
Burnston's factory - which is manufactured by Toyota Aris and Avannis - has produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, with about 90 percent of them being exported to the rest of the European Union.
In Bernstein, Managing Director Marvin Cook said, "I think that if Britain leaves the Union at the end of March, the production could be stopped in our garage."
Honda, BM Dublou, and Jagwar Land Rovars have published a focus on how other vehicle manufacturers in the U.S. will operate without any agreement on how to operate without the European Union.
For example, BM WB said they would close their mini plant in Oxford within a month after Brext.
What car manufacturers say about the main purpose is the failure of Supplay China to break the agreement.
The Twitter production line is based on "jast-in-time" and a 37-minute drive from both UC and UU users for the prescribed vehicle.
If the United States leaves the U.S. without any agreement on March 29th, there may be a conflict within which the instrument can be slowed down and the instrument can be seen as a result of a coup d'état.
The organization says that it is not possible to store more than one day's value in the Twitter distribution plan because production can be stopped.
Mr. Clark said that in the future, Therse May's check-up plan "has been properly implemented to take this kind of check at the limit."
"We need a deal. We want to make a good deal that will not only succeed but also enjoy the possibility of future progress," she said in the event on Radio 4.
"Not only the tea, it is also evidenced by other producers that the success of Supplay China is very important."
It is impossible to say how long the tobacco production will be stopped, but they have insisted that the long-term cost-effectiveness of the factory will slow down and can lead to much work.
A 24-year-old worker working in Bern and the Unit calls Peter Suvalaris on this planet said his members are putting on a job: "They won't come back once in my experience.
A government spokesman said: "We must have a specific and reliable plan for the future with this EU."
Hoyt House has announced that the tramp meeting with Rozenstein may be more slow.
Among the Tanapodrens with the Supreme Court Nominee Bret Kavanf, Donald Tramp and Deputy Attrin General Red Roxstein announced that a high-performance meeting could be held "in another week" with the top parity meeting.
In the election, Russia's handcuff, the association between the trauma assistants and Russia and the President's possible restriction of trial, Special Adviser Robert Mueller interviewed the work.
Whether the tramp depute will release General Attrell and it will lead to the question of Mueller's freedom is going on in Washington, D.C., a few months ago.
At the beginning of this month, Russia reported on the use of secret Mike to record talks with New York's Times trauma and on the possibility of removing the president by a 25-year-old solution.
The report was rejected by Russia.
However, she was leaving, and she was told that she was going to the White House last morning to report this kind of report.
Instead, it was announced that the meeting with the tramp was held by New York.
Tramp said he would "not like to throw Rosstein out," but Kavanf and a woman charged with misconduct against him, Dr. Christine Blazi Ford, both of them at the witness's house, was late for hearing of the Senate's trial.
On Friday, Tramp Kavanf ordered a week's investigation by the FBI, for which the whole Senate voted more slow.
The tramp's press secretariat is all Sanders Ravibar Fox News.
He said about the meeting with Russia: "No date is right, it may be just this week, it may take another week for all the other things in the Supreme Court.
But let's show up and I always want to know the media."
Some journalists will object to this statement. After Sundays 10 September, there was no press briefing in the White House.
Driver Chris Wallace asks why.
Sanders said that the reason for not keeping a briefing was not to "show people" to journalists, although he said, "I don't deny that they've shown people."
He then suggests direct communication between the tramp and the press.
"The current president has more questions than any previous president," he said without any evidence saying, "we have decided that number."
The briefing will also take place in the future, Sanders says, "It's better to talk to me than to the media if it's possible to question the President of the United States directly.
We are trying very hard to do this, and you've seen us do it a few weeks ago and have been talking directly to the President of the United States instead of press briefings."
The trauma regularly takes place when you leave the White House or when you attend a special session or when you attend a press conference with special guests.
A single press conference is very low.
New York may have seen the president this week why he can show concern in front of the press group and in the middle.
Health Minister N.S.S.A. wrote a letter to the U.S.
Health Minister NHS of Scotland thanked European Union workers for their work and expressed a desire to stay in their post-breaking state.
Jean Freeman M.S.P., U.S.A., sent a letter six months ago.
The Scottish government has already promised methamphere to work in the U.S. government departments.
In his letter, Freeman wrote: The debate between Yu and UU on the whole of the Gressian Union is closed, which can be expected to result in this situation.
However, the U.S. government is also preparing for possible unconstitutional situations.
I know you're all running out of time for this.
That's why I want to remind you again how valuable their contributions are to me, especially the nationality of each member of the staff.
The whole European Union and its outside employees have brought valuable experience and skills that have strengthened and improved health care and have benefited the patients and our communities.
Scotland is your country and we want you to stay here."
Christian Ebarkremby's urgent weaponry after shooting at the head
Tenesi's Mike Organ announced that the Christian Ebarkremby Sanderbilt Comodores of Tennessee State Tiggers was forced to take over 31-27 after the attack.
The state's chief Kosovo Red Red Red reporters announced that the attack had taken place a few minutes before Haftime.
Reed said, "He came to the sideline a little too much."
The teacher and the medical staff gave Ebarkremby oxygen as far as the sideline is concerned and then brought him back for further testing.
A member of the Tennisi state told Chris Harris of the Dablu SMV at the Tennisi National University of Tennessee that he was outside the Abarkrby gunhouse at the Wandabilt Medical Center.
Harris adds that "there is no description of the type of attack yet" and he is trying to announce the time of the state attack.
After moving from Ilyna, the second year of the Red Chart student, Ebarkremby, played the first mossum with the Tenesi State.
Before he left the game, he had five sets of tactics, 18 of which he took.
Foreigners must pay more stamps when they buy any property in the United States
As a result of the Tori project, when foreign investors buy new property in the United States, they will have to pay more stamps and use this extra money to help the homeless.
This action will enhance the success of the Cuban campaign to attract young voters.
This stamp will apply to those who don't work in the United States.
Trezary hopes that more income will be available to help the homeless every year up to £120 million.
When foreign investors buy some property in the United States, they have to pay more stamps -- and this extra money will be used to help the homeless, Theressa will announce it today.
This action will further enhance the success of the Cuban campaign to attract young voters with the promotion of housing and high standards.
This stamp will apply to people and organizations who do not work in the United States, and the government will have to work with the rest of the household.
In addition to the current stamp seal, it may be more than three percent of the damage to the second house and the house of employment two years ago.
Trezary hopes that the income will increase to £120 million a year.
New London's newly built collective property has purchased 13 percent of the United States' external residents, which has increased debt and has made the situation more difficult for first-time owners.
Most of the country's province - especially the capital - has become a "unknown city" in the face of foreign creditors who have been forced into exile for most of the time.
This new principle was introduced a few weeks after the New Year's Eve's call for the New Year's Eve.
He claims to increase wealth by not buying land against major construction organizations and calls on Ms. Mace to cancel the amount of value-added housing in order to solve the "Absolute problem" of Britain.
Mr. Kobin announced an interesting series of proposals for the housing version, which included job control and the end of "non-Flot".
He wants to give the council more power to build a new house.
Miss May said: "For the last few years I have said that I will renew my British Prime Minister's dream - which should be more beautiful for every new generation.
And what he means is he's going to go to the market in the house.
Britain will always be open to those who want to stay here, work and live.
However, it cannot be right that non-United States foreign and non-governmental organizations will easily buy wealth as hard-working British citizens.
Many people have gone far from home owners' dreams, and the problem of homelessness is real.
Jack Russ: 'My immediate dream is to take over Scotland'
Sandland Bus Jack Ross said his "extreme interest" is to be a future manager of Scotland.
This 42-year-old Scottish citizen is currently enjoying the North-East Club's recovery calendar, which is now third in Ligwan, after the first three points.
In the past month, St. Marian returned to the Scottish Premier.
"I wanted to play as a player in the country.

This former Aloa Athletic bus said that he had rejected the offer of a large club name, such as Burnsle and Epswich Town.
"This moment will be a success for me 'Can I bring this club back to my favorite league?'
It's certainly a favorite league because of this club's taste and ease," she said.
"It's not easy to get there, but I'll probably see myself as a success if I can get the club back there."
The person who lives in Dumberton and has been a cosinating staff for 15 months is only three years old in the life of the manager of Russia.
He then helped to recover Alaa from unemployment to third level and later transform St. Miren into a champion's champion.
And Russia says he's now happier than Clyde, Hartpole, Falcock, St. Miren and Hamilton Academics.
He remembered taking care of Alora, saying, "It was probably a real Milton."
"I really believed that management was better for me than gambling.
It's amazing to hear it because I did the right thing, I lived my own life and I enjoyed some success.
But the game is a draw
You have to go to the big things every week.
I still feel the same kind of pressure on the job, so the management seems right.
I've always wanted to manage it and now I've done it, it's the most enjoyable thing I've ever had in my life."

Air and major social or violent events are the most affected on the market outside of the house.
There is no denying that the market will be in a difficult situation, but this 4.8 percent of the annual sales will be particularly painful.
Food operators can't come from a long and hot climate and tell them if the cold weather will bring some relief."

The Internet has divided its view into an announcement by a state-of-the-art bombing organization to compare children's mothers to pregnant babies.
What is said is "The first single-vote bomb in the world," an Elvian expert on technology published a beautiful music video to show the freedom that the new pump gives today's mothers.
The mother of four truth doesn't play with a piece of shit in the neck, which includes a song, "Yes, I'm my own prayer, but I'm not ashamed" and "If anyone sees it, they're not a bunch of animals, they're my foot."
Coras continues: "Bump it up, pump it up, I eat the kids, blow it up, I pray for my friends."
However, the information that has been released on the company's Facebook page has created an online dispute.
In 77,000 views and six-month comments, the video was received by viewers from Egypt, many say it highlights the "fear" of dual art.
"It is a very bad decision to use force in the knowledge of this text.
They need to be pregnant as we are to produce drugs and give birth to their children, except that their children are stolen from them in a few days of their birth," wrote one.

Another commented: "It seems safe for both mother and child.
But why don't you use them in the announcement of the bridge pump for those who keep their children safe?"
Another said, "It's a very uncomfortable announcement."
Others stood by the science, a woman admitted that the song had become her "happy".
"I think it's an idea.
If I ate the baby, I wouldn't have one.
You think you're serious when you're pumping.
The information is a little crazy, but I'm good at it.
It's an interesting line," one wrote.
Another commented: "It's a full statement that he's looking for mothers who blow up (usually at their place of work or toilet) and he thinks they're "gru".
This announcement doesn't praise or revamp the Daily Art."
At the end of the video, a group of women announced that they had all taken the bomb hidden in their brother.
It is based on the idea that many women feel as serious as they are when they are pumping.
Although Elve’s pump has no sound, it has no TV or TV, and it has a beautiful footing between Nursing Bridge, which also allows women to hold their hands, keep their children up, and even out of the way.
Anna Ballerin, Mother's partner and ICD said: "Elve pump is a global line that should start with courage and enthusiasm.
We want to take a photo of women and dual-striking gavillians at the Ston pumping and all its challenge spouts, a fun and related way that the new pump will bring about the incredible freedom.
Elve's pump hasn't taken place in the first news yet.

Several citizens have been taken to a prison camp at a hidden text limit
The number of children living in the camp has increased, although the monthly limit is relatively stable, as it has made it more difficult for children to keep the rules and principles in place.
In fact, most Spaniards are afraid of losing their own home country without their own paper and children.
This is increasing in June when the federal authorities announce that possible sponsors and other adult members of their families will be given fingerprints, and the information will be shared with the local authorities.
In the past week, a lawyer for housing and welfare has testified before the Matthew Albens Congress that this agency has arrested several dozen people who have been asked to provide for orphans.
The agency later announced that 70 percent of the people arrested had no past criminal history.
"About 80 percent of members of Spanish or Spanish families are illegal in the country and most of them are foreign criminals.
So we're looking for them," Nister Albens said.
In an attempt to force children into a more fast society, workers have introduced new rules to be taken to court within a month of arrest, which was 60 days ago.
Many residents will not be personally present at the video conference in order to present their case to the local judge.
Those who are considered unworthy of justice will be arraigned.
According to security centres and reports published by the system in recent months, children will be in a safe haven for as long as 20 days, which may lead to more anxiety or frustration, which may lead to violent events or accidents.
Supporters said that the main focus of such projects as the Tornilo is more intense, where children are shown to be more concerned, more likely to be ignored, due to its size.
They also said that when children are taken to the center for not being mentally prepared or leaving their friends out of time, many may be able to increase the number of traumas so that they are already hungry.
The United States of America, France and Turkey have been told to leave Syria shortly.
With regard to the general prosecutor, Foreign Minister Walid-Al-Moalam has called for the return to Syria's Syrian capital, although Tana has been fighting for eight years.
Moalam, also the prime minister of the country, says that foreign forces are in the country's territory without any resistance to the attacks, and "We will take the appropriate regime."
"You have to go now without them," he said to the priest
Moalam insisted that Syria's "war against stress is almost over," where more than 360,000 people have been killed since 2011 and millions have been forced to leave their homes.
He said Damascus would keep "war until all Syrian lands are cleansed" against the two rebels and the "unlawful foreign presence".
There are about 2,000 military members in Syria, the President Bashar al-Assad, to provide both Kurdish and Syrian Arab soldiers with the main training and advice.
There are more than 1,000 French military members in this war country.
Moalam said that the situation was suitable for their return and that he owes "some Western country" "to spread temporary fear" which he has urged to keep away.
"We have called on the international community and human organizations to help in this return," he said.
"They're political with the whole human problem"
The United States and the European Union have insisted that Syria will not be helped until there is no political agreement between Asad and the opposition to end the war.
Cotonists of the United Nations say that the last major attack on Idlib has allowed Russia and Turkey to move forward through the current political debate on a buffer zone.
The Russian-Turkey Agreement has been opposed by the Russian-supported Syrian army in this area by a major attack, where three million people live.
However, Moalem insisted that the agreement had "a clear time limit" and he expressed the hope that this military action would act against Al-Qaeda-Kaeda-computer Nassaris in the French war against Jihads, who "will be executed."
The United Nations national envoy Stefan D Moustler is expecting to call on the first meeting of a new committee with government and opposition group members to make plans for the post-war organisation and access to the path of the election.
Moalam has insisted that the Syrian government participate in this committee, saying that the panel's work should be limited to "reviewing the details of the current constitution", and he warns against the indiscriminate action.

In the middle of the selection, money goes out like water
It is not surprising that the 17 votes in Pennsylvania have been won, since two candidates are fighting for the same outcome in favour of the reconstruction of the Congressional District.
The recently rebuilt city of Pittsberg District Pitts has led to the fight against the Democratic representative's Lamb of Cana, who has won a special election in the past.
Lamb is fighting against the Republican Keith Rothfas, who is now represented by the 12th district of ancient Pennsylvania, many of which are part of the new 17th district.
In January, Pennsylvania Supreme Court stated that the old districts are systematically organized according to the republicans, which has resulted in a resurgence of the map.
This election of the new 17th district was written by the main groups in favour of reading money between the Sacha Democratic Campan Congressional Committee (DISC) and the National Committee of the Republican Camp (NCS).
The 18th Congressional District of Marche Pensylvenia has only been contacted by Lamb after victory in the special election, which was announced in connection with the 18th Congressional District of March.
More than a decade ago, the Republicans had the right to vote, and President Donald Tramp won 20 points in this area.

Read history
The following countless events may be related to a report by Robert Muller on the possible restrictions of Mr. Tramp, which now contain sufficient evidence in the public record.
In the election, Mr. Tramp was told that he had any contact with Russia in connection with Mr. Muller's investigation.
If the Congress's hand is changed, Mr. Tramp will have to take responsibility, just as he is preparing to go back to the voters and may have to go to the jury with his colleagues until the end.

That's how American history has been.
What should we do if Mr. Tramp depute deputizes General Rod Roxenstein, who will determine the part of Mr. Muller's investigation.
Since last year it has been published in the paper, there have been dangers in Rosenstein that he has secretly advised the President to record and admitted his disability.
Mr. Rosenstein said the news of the Times was false.

The women's night's sleep is about to disappear
Despite how the participants are going to deal with it, very few people have talked about it with their family members.
Half of the participants said they talked to their husband or wife about the long term ministry.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their children about it.
"People want a family member to think about them, but they're not taking action to do this," said Vice President Holly Sneider of the life-cycler of Naziwaid.
Find out where to start.
Tell your husband or wife and children: If you do not have sufficient time to make your wishes known, you will not be able to prepare your family for the ministry.
To discuss where and how you want to take care of it, work with your advice and contact your family, as your choice of business is also important.
Talk to your financial advice: Your advice can help you find solutions to these costs.
For long-term ministry, you may like to have a long-term service plan, if you have money - a hybrid life-value flight policy or self-defence by yourself.
Solve your in-law documents: Try to stay away from the fight.
Provide a proper health service so that you can care for your medical ministry and that you will not be able to contact the world so that you will be able to comply with your wishes.
And, keep an eye on getting someone to talk about your property.
Choose a trusted person to make your financial decisions and make sure that your bill is made correctly.
Don't forget the details: Think your elderly father needs some emergency treatment and is being taken to the hospital.

The Russian Grand Prix: Luis Hamilton Assistant Service Hotel went to the world's food store to win the prize
This was made clear when Saturday Valteri Botas Luis Hamilton announced that the command of the Marsidize team would play an important role in this process.
Botas from Poland has been well-initiated by Hamilton and has taken the first two lefts in place and invited Vatell to attack his own team player.
Put White Hamilton in the back of the road and go into the pit, which could be a trap.
The Marsisidez driver stepped on his back and came after the hotel, but went after the Hamilton Tantan battle to see the driver double-mowed and left the door empty with no chance of getting away.
Max Verstapen began his 21st birthday and was seven after the first lap.
Then he has many parts of the race first, and then Kimmy Ryconen puts the fourth place behind the bad tiara.
He hit on 44 numbers, but he couldn't increase the speed of the remaining eight, which resulted in the reiconion going to fourth place.
It was a hard day because Valteri fought all week long and worked like real heroes.
The group is working hard to take the first place," Hamilton said.
It was a very bad language.
President Donald Tramp presented the Senator Dean Finstein at a meeting on the claim of President Donald Tramp on the case against the Supreme Court's No. Bret Cavanf.
In a meeting in West Virginia, the President did not talk directly about the matter, but he said that what is going on in the movie is a "noble and thankful and lying" attitude.
"This is something that could happen and that beautiful thing was going on in China a few weeks ago, you'll be angry when you see a nice and grateful and lying man," he said.
"Oh, I didn't.
Oh, I didn't do that."
Do you remember?
Dean Finnstein, did you save it?
Remember his answer... did you save the document? "Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't save."
Wait a minute.
We saved...no, we didn't," he said, copying the senator.
The letter was sent to Ford Finstein with a description of the charges against Kavanf last July, and the letter was released in September – but Finstein refuses to release the letter from his office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's charges, I didn't save anything," said the Finnish committee, reports The Hill.
"He told me to keep it secret and I kept it secret according to what he said."
But he didn't mind the president's words, he opened his eyes at the end of the Saturday night: "What I said was a very bad language.
Maybe he didn't, but I've never seen anything worse than that."
Three women who have been accused of sexual misconduct by the Supreme Court of Nominee, the President said that Democrats are using accusations for their own purposes.
"They want power back at any cost.
Look at the attitude, thank you, don't force them to attack, don't change their power and control," said the President.

The hundreds of lives on the ground in exchange for their lives were assured by Air Traffic Controller
One of Indonesia's air traffic controllers was killed after hundreds of thousands of passengers left to help fly and die.
Because of a large earthquake, more than 800 people were killed on the island of Sulawesi on sugar and many were found.
In the Joralo-based company, the local barbaric company is on its way to the end of the disaster.
But despite the fear of all colleagues, 21-year-old Antonios Gunawan Palu Mutais have not left control at Cise Al Zufri Airport.
From him, he made sure that Batik Air Fleet 6321, which was then in Ranway, was safe enough to fly.
Then he jumped down because he was afraid of reading the control tower.
Then he died in the hospital.
Indonesia Air Navigation's headline, Johannes Siritt, says that this decision may have saved several people's lives, reports Australia's ABC News.
We're taking a helicopter from the village of Kalimantan to take him to another hospital.
Unfortunately, this morning the helicopter died before the flood.
"This news has broken our hearts," he added.
In the past, the government's fear that the number of deaths could be more than a thousand, unlike Mokabila Agensi, has announced that there has been limited communication between the city of Dongala, the Sigi and Butong.
"It is believed that the number of deaths has increased dramatically, because many bodies are trapped under the fate of the bodies that have not yet been reached," says the Egensi magazine Sosoo Old Nougroho.

Jan Gelfand CNN, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, said: "Indonesian Red Cross is going to help people, but we don't know what to see there.
It's already sad, but things can get worse."
The Indonesian president, Joko Vidodo, went to Pala and told the country's military members: "I am asking you to stay here for your day-to-night rescue.
What are you doing?" CNN's report.
At the beginning of this year, Indonesia's long-distance land was flooded to more than 550 lives.
Micronesia's plane crash: Air New Guinea known as a search for an aircraft in Laguna.
When one of the planes landed in the Pacific League of Micronesia, they had previously reported that 47 passengers and workers had been rescued from deep air, and now they knew that someone was missing.
A report by Air Newgini heardby Beckel says a man cannot be found.
The airline reported that they were working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators.
Aerlin immediately refused to disclose details such as the passport and nationality of the trip.
The airport helps to rescue local passengers and workers when trying to name the airport.
The workers announced that seven had been taken to the hospital.
The airline reported that six passengers were in the hospital on Saturday, and they were all stable.
The reason for the accident has not yet been clear about it.
The airline and the U.S. Navy both said the plane was on water before they arrived in Ranway.
A number of observers thought the plane had passed by Ranawa.
American traveler Bill Jens said the plane was very low.
"That's a very good thing," said Jance.
Jens said he and others had crossed the line and reached the airport in the early hours of the morning.
He said the airmen were shooting at him and he had a slight stroke on his head.
The U.S. Navy knows that it is close to helping rescue the Nabs who are busy in Syria. They brought people into the air before the plane hits 30 metres (100 feet) in water.
According to the Aviation Safety Network, the last two decades have killed 111 people in the PNG-bound airline, but no accident has occurred in the Air New Guinea.
Researchers have been able to track down a live woman during the event
In 2014, a woman in Egypt was sentenced to life and death by a person charged with retrialing her.
U.S. Justice Analyst Paul Raulett Goanda has testified for several hours as a specialist in the investigation.
He describes how 29-year-old Asami Quentin Telis and 19-year-old Shikar Sembers make his death nighttime event.
Raoulett said he had recovered a number of cell phones that revealed that on the night of his death, Telis and Chambers were together, which was against the previous duty of Teless, Clarion Laser's report.
It is reported that at the time he was with his cell phone Chambers, although he insisted that he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police spoke to Sanford.
Sanford revealed that he wasn't in town at night.
When the Coulsuls asked if Teles was telling the truth that he had Sanford's track that night, Sanford replied, "It's a lie, because his track was in Nashville that day."
Another misunderstanding was that Teles said he knew him two weeks before the death of Chambers.
From the cell phone record, they know each other for just one week.
Raoulett said that after the death of Chambers, Teles dedelegates text, call and contact information from his phone.
"He's getting rid of his life," Haley said.
A list of the last parties to the case is kept in orbit.
The judge said the case was expected to go to his next jury.

Another farm?!
New York Nani has accused a couple of working on the "responsive" text.
A woman in New York's former husband is accused of being called "one of the farmers" for a controversial text from a mother.
The couple refused to be able to sign up and wanted to file a "julum" complaint.
Two children's mother, Nancy Plasco-Falxman, expressed her disappointment after arriving at work on the first day of 2016 after learning that Gigel Morris is a new nurse of the child.
Ms. Plasco-Falxman wrote her husband a text message.
Anyway, he sent Miss Maris twice instead of sending her husband.
Later on realizing his mistake, the "unbelievable" plastic-Falxman released Mrs. Morris, who said that their former African-American sister had been hoping for a Philippines because she had done something wrong, a New York Post report.
Miss Morris was given a day's drink and then sent home to Ubar Dek.
Maris is now in charge of getting damage to a marriage against her husband and wants damage as a daily 350 dollars for six months, although she was first hired as a maid without a contract.
"I want to show them, look, I can't do this," he said to the post several times, and he added, "I know it's possible."
The couple said against the claim that Maris was a legitimate act that would not believe him after he was accused of being accused.
"My wife didn't want to say what she sent.
He's not a writer.
We're not a celebrity couple," says husband Joel Plasco Post.
"But will you leave your children with someone who you have abused, even if it's wrong?
Your natural child?
Say it."
On "Julum" charges, Plasco said his wife gave birth to a child just a few months ago and was in a 'very difficult situation'.
"Would you like to fight someone like that?
It's not a good thing to do this," said the exchange bank.
In order to keep the case under control, the couple's conduct and their opposition to the war are strongly condemned in the social media of the public court.
Padington's publisher has expressed concern that readers may not be able to contact themselves with the good to speak, published in the new paper
Band's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born after the book was born, says about the letter: "It's hard to tell what's going to happen first.
After the great success of Padington, it's a very fun thing to know.
His father, who worked as the cameraman of the BBC before sending the book to the children from the small game, said he was desperate to refuse his work, and he also said that the 60th anniversary of his death was "almost" to him.
Padington, who he described as "the most important member of our family," said his father was very proud of his immediate success.
"He was a secret person, and he wasn't a stupid person," he said.
"Then Paddington was so real to him that your child made a success of it: you're proud of it, although you don't have any role.
I think he saw the success of Paddington.
Although it was his own creation and imagination, he always thanked Pandington himself.
My daughter was on her way to death and I had to get married on the phone.
Shortly after the shipment, his daughter was taken to the Niss Hospital, Loui Pau, where doctors tried to save her life.
"Nade used to call me regularly saying it's very bad, and she won't save her mind," said Ms. Ednan-Laprojoz.
"Then I got Nad's phone and I knew he'd die within two minutes and I had to tell him to leave.
And that's what I do.
I say, "Tashie, Darling, I love you very much.
I'll be right there.
I'll come to you.
The doctors slowly stopped working on his body and went outside.
He died a few minutes ago and then everything ended.
There was no way to wait in my seat, you know.
I couldn't cry or cry because I was transformed into a family and a human being.
I should've kept myself."
Finally, Ms. Adnan-Laperoz, when his daughter died, went to the airport near the other passengers - she was different from this difficult situation.
No one knows," he said.
"I would lift my head, my eyes would be filled with water."
It's impossible to describe it, but I was a member of Ned's illegal operation at the airport.
He needs my love and compassion.
I know how good he was.
Unfortunately, this woman posted a card to stop suicide.
Two women, who lost their loved ones in death, work to stop the suicide of others.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Hamfries Bridge post cards with encouraging messages and keep the phone number where people can call for help.
Miz Davis' son Tyler has been depressed since he was 13 years old and killed himself at 18 years of age.
"I don't want my father to feel what I represent," he said.
Miz Davis, 45 years old, who lives in Lithuania, says his son was a promising boss and was the right to attack.
"Everyone knew her for her smile.
They all said, "The house is bright and bright."
Anyway, he quit his job before he died because he "was really gone in the dark."
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 years old, was found dead.
Mr. Davis said, "I'm worried that this effort will fail."
Mr. Davis wrote a card, "I can tell everyone that there is someone you can talk to, he can be a friend.
Don't sit down. You need to talk.
Ms. Hamfries, who for many years lost his 15-year-old partner Mark after his mother's death.
"He never said that his mind was bad or that he was sad or something," he said.
"Two days before Christmas, I'm making some changes in her use.
"Christmas' day was so bad that when children opened their gifts, he didn't even look at them."
He said that his death had been a great psychological blow to them, but it was broken: "It created a great void in the family.
He broke us apart.
But we must walk and fight."

In front of Bret Kavanf's future question to start an F.B.I.
"I thought if we could give him what he wanted -- because the time of the investigation was limited, the opportunity was limited -- we could probably bring something together," said Mr. Flak heardbar, and he also said he was afraid that the committee might "fall into trouble" in the face of this vicious act.
Why did Mr. Kavanf and his Republican supporters not want an F.B.A.?
It's about their commitment to time.
On 6 November, only five weeks left for the mid-election - if the Republicans do something bad, the country's highest court will be very weak.
George Dubliu Bush calls the senators and investigates them to support Mr. Kavanf working in the White House under Mr. Bush, through whom he met his wife Ashkel, who was the personal guardian of Mr. Bush.
What will happen after the FB report is posted?
There will be a vote in China where there are now 51 republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Kavanf would be able to get at least 50 votes in the Senate, so that Vice-President Mike Pens could guarantee him the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean gangs under Kim is "crazed"
Seven years ago, Kim Jong-un had been in power to reduce the number of North Korean troops, a law lawyer from South Korea said.
Park Byang-Seg, quoting data from South Korea's Ministry of Integration, said the last year's group number was 1,127 - 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said the main reason for the heavy border control between North Korea and China and for human rights abuse.
Piathing has no public opinion on this.
The number of civilians coming from North Korea has become the population of South Korea.
Saul reported that more than 30,000 North Koreans have been illegally overrun since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most of them have fled to China, which has a long border with North Korea and is easier than to be able to get the most secure unguarded zone (DMZD) between two Koreas.
China, not as the founder of these goods, but as an illegal citizen and often forced them back to their country.
The relationship between North and South Korea - which is still in the war - has been significantly improved in recent months.
At the beginning of the month of the march, the leaders of the two countries gathered to discuss in Pyongyang, which was at the centre of the traditional ban.
This was followed by a historic meeting between US President Donald Tramp and Kim Jung-un in Singapore when they unanimously agreed to work for the creation of a nuclear-weapon-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Prime Minister R. Yong-ho blames US ban on the progress.
In a language commonly spoken by the United Nations to New York, Mr. Rey said, "If there is no confidence in the United States, our national security will not have any confidence and we will not compromise ourselves in any way at first."
Nancy Palosie Bret Kavanf called him "histeria-Grest" and said he was unable to perform the duty of the Supreme Court.
The House's number leader Nancy Pelosi Supreme Court Nomini Bret Kavanof identified "historic-grest" and said he was actually qualified for the Supreme Court's responsibility.
Palosi heardbar Austin, Texas, commented on this at a meeting at the Texas Trebion Festival.
In front of Cavanf's testimony before the Senate Thursday evening committee, he said about his reaction to Kavanf's testimony, "I don't think I could have thought that if a woman had ever done this, she would have been called "histeria-grest".
Kavanf Zohr denied the charge that he had betrayed Dr. Christine Blazi when they were both young.
Kavanf was busy talking about his family and school life during his first speech, and he went to a safe distance.
He strongly condemns Democrats on the committee and charges against him with a "Udual and Compulsory History", organized by Liberals, that this is done by the 2016 presidential election of Hilary Clinton.
Pelosi said he believed Kavanf's testimony proved that he was not worthy of the Supreme Court, because it showed that he was against democracies.
"I think that he has given his explanation and how he has prevented Clinton and Democrats from proving himself inappropriate," he said.
When he is asked if Kavanf is sure and if Democrats are in the house, he will criticize him, while Palosi makes another announcement.
"I'm going to say this -- if he doesn't tell Congress or the FBI the truth, he's not the only one who's not worthy of the Supreme Court, but the court that he's now in," Pelossi said.
Kavanf is now Judge of DC's Circuit Court of Apples.
Pelosi adds that as a Democrat, he is concerned that Kavanf Afordabel Qaar will oppose Act or Ro V. Wood because he is a Conservative Justin.
When he heard of his conviction, Kavanf asked whether he would change some of the Supreme Court's decisions.
"It can't be allowed to be a historical-grandsome, repentant person to go to court and say, 'It's not good," Palosi said.
And women should control it.
It's a fair debate, months and years later, and he can't be in jail.
"Let's go back to bed," Mr. Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's weird, what do you say?"
He also said, "A woman who helped me a lot, who said she was crying too, but she chose the five which when she started crying, she said to the one you were talking to, "You think I'm sorry because I'm crying.
I'm really tired."
Then he walked away.
I thought it was strange."
In other words, they act as an expression of anger, because they are basically mistaken in their understanding.
One of the first things I remember from a job, a man-principal office, where I once saw myself screaming in an unbelievably rage, an elderly woman took my scarf -- a terrible manager I was always a little scared -- who took me in a wheelchair.
"Don't let them see that you're crying," he told me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're upset, and they'll be happy to see you."
Patrick Schroeder, then Colorado Democratic Congressman, worked with him during the election of Gary Hart's president.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart landed on a ship called Manki Bisness in the area of foreign marriage and left for Nongra's work, he was deeply disappointed that his president had no reason to pray.
"It wasn't a very anxious decision," he said to laugh 30 years later.
"There are already seven others fighting, and no one else wants.
One said, "Sno Hoyt and seven left."
When the campaign began to slow down, he was behind the construction of the temple and therefore vowed that he would not collect $2 million in this road.
It was the war of war.
He saw that a supportive man was only paid $250 if he was paid $1,000.
"What do they think I'm going to get worth?" he said renouncingly.
When he announced that he would not do organizational preaching, he became very angry and became very grateful to his supporters, which made the system more difficult for the economy than for the representatives, and became sick of the linkability.
"You might think my snowball has happened," said Mr. Schroder, remembering the media's response.
"You might think Clinex was my corporate sponsor.
In my mind, I thought, where would they put me?
"You're crying?"
How the U.S.-China Business War Can Go to Beijing
The first mountain of the U.S.-China military war was full of chaos, and when the war ended, the two countries' bilingual conflict could be a long time ago, like experts.
The President of the United States, Donald Tramp, first warned about the construction of the solar panel, the Espat and the main Chinese raftani with Aluminum at the beginning of this year.
The most significant response this week, when nearly half of China's total imports from China, amounting to about 200 billion dollars (150 billion pounds), are new.
Beijing has responded as often as they do - they have recently increased from five to ten percent of the US$60 billion.
China has decided to fight with its eyes, and the second largest in the world will not be able to see this economy as soon as possible.
Washington claimed to be behind, but apparently China's Chinese president Shi Jinping will be very disappointed with the US.
However, experts say that if Beijing can play cards properly, the pressure of the US trade war on both economies can significantly reduce its dependence on China for a long time.
"The economic situation in both countries can be triggered by a rapid political decision by Washington or Beijing, which is much more dangerous than the U.S. House of Commons," says the Central American Security Research Institute, a researcher named Abigail Grace, who talks about Asia.
Syria 'prepared' said the Foreign Minister to take his goods back.
Syria said the country was ready to return to the Soviet Union, and for seven years they had asked for the war to resurface the holy country.
While the United Nations is generally speaking, Foreign Minister Walid Al-Moalem says the country is making progress.
"The progress towards combating terrorism is stable and secure today," he said.
Rehabilitation has been delayed by the government to restore normal conditions in areas that have been destroyed by protesters.
The situation is now similar to that of people who are forced to leave their country because of the economic and social conditions of the country.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million have fled from Syria since the start of the war in 2011.
The remaining 6 million people from the country need human assistance.
Al-Moalam says the Syrian government welcomes all assistance in rebuilding the country.
However, he also insisted that no aid would be accepted under any circumstances or that the aid from the country of aid to the attackers would not be received.
Paris Rider Cup winner Europe
Team Europe outside Paris, with 16.5-10.5 high scores in the Gulf of Paris, has lost the team U.S. and won the 2018 Rider Cup.
The U.S. was buried in Europe on Saturday afternoon, and after 1993 they won no radior cap.
The team reached 14.5 points needed to defeat the United States and restore the title, as well as the title.
The American Taka Fill Michelson, who couldn't play well in most of the tournaments, died at -316 when his T-shirt was dead, and died in his pocket at Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinary is one of the only 4 people scored in 4 since the current format of the tournament began in 1979.
The American Jordan Spita, at the top of the European team, was awarded to the Danish tournament Olsen at 5 and 4.
The world's top-level player, Dustin Johnson, died to the English Yan Politer, who may have played his last driver's cap.
The experience of the eight-year-old Rider Cape, Sergei García, Spain, was the greatest winner in Europe for 25.5 career points.
"I don't usually cry, but I can't now.
The year's gone very bad.
Thank Thomas for choosing me and for trusting me.
I'm so glad to get the coffee back.
As a result of this group's success, I wish I could help," European Jay Abgaplut said to Garcia.
He owes his country's brother Am, who lost US Lieutenant Tiger Woods in the Rhab in two and one.
"I lost Tiger Woods too proud to see her grow up," says 23-year-old Am.
Woods France lost his four masks, and his record was on the radar. 13-21-3.
It's the best player ever to play with the Beman statistics, which only Jack Niklas won after 14 main players.
The team of U.S.s has been eating together for weeks except for the Patrik Ride, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau.
U.S. Colonel Jim Furick said after his group's disappointment, "I'm proud of them, they fought.
This morning we put a lot of pressure on Europe.
We couldn't.
Congratulations to Thomas.
He's a good student.
His 12 players played very well.
"We'll stand back, I'll work with the U.S. PJ and the Reider Cup Committee and move on.
I love these 12 people and I'm proud to be their students.
You have to tell them about it.
We didn't play."
Red-Sroiting: Pinellas, Manatty and Sarasota
A recent report by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission has seen a general decline in red flows in the Tampa area.
According to F Dublin C, Pinellas, Manatty, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier County have seen the state of the peachy flower - which is a sign of an earthquake.
The red stream's volume ranged from the north panel to the south Li County with about 130 miles of tool line.
Hilsoboro County can be seen at about 10 miles away, but it is less visible than last week.
Red flows have also been observed in the Pasco account.
In the past week, the Pinellas account has received information about the height of the average depth, the height of the Hilsboro account, the height of the manta account, the height of the balance sheet and the distance of the account, the height of the average depth of the account, and the height of the li of the account, and the height of the column.
There are still reports of serious problems from Pinellas, Manatty and Sarasota, Lee and Kolya's account.
Last week, there is no significant problem with North-West Florida.
