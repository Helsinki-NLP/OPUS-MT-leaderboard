Triumph of the law-enforcement police in Austria, totalling 29%
A terrible weakening of both sides of the so-called great coalition and a significant strengthening of the legal populist parties led to the first preliminary results of the proposed parliamentary elections from Sunday in Austria.
In particular, the Austrian People's Party (OVP), where the position of former President Wilhelm Multer, has been taken seriously.
On the contrary, the president of the Association for the Future of Austria (BZÖ), Kärntner Landeshauptmann Jörg Haider, is preparing for a triumphal return to the federal policy.
As a result, the social democracy (SPÖ) remains the most powerful in the country, with 29.8% of the votes cast, but 5.5% of the votes lost in 2006 compared with the last elections.
Even worse, the OVP is cut off, which loses nearly nine percent of the votes by 25.6 per cent.
These are the worst results of these two great parties in the Austrian post-war history, and especially in the People's Party that had sought the aforementioned elections, this is a truly disastrous result.
At the beginning of July, when the OVP was expelled from the coalition, the People's Party had a significant lead before the SSP.
However, the voters have probably punished the party for letting the government down.
Already in the first responses to the results there were speculations about a possible return of party president and former Vice-President Wilhelm Multer.
Observers believe that this could already be at an extraordinary meeting of the President of the Party on Monday.
Such a development would probably pave the way for the most likely way out of the electoral base, thus a renewal of the great coalition from SPÖ and OVP.
In view of the strengthening of both law-p populist parties - the FPÖs - were granted 18 per cent, the BZÖ 11 per cent of the votes - but at the same time the Social Democrats expressed their fear that 1999 could continue when the People's Party had agreed with the populist parties (at that time the FPÖ was still united, she had resigned from the BZÖ in 2005 with regard to a common government, which even imposed sanctions on the European Union.
It is clear that Jörg Haider, who has already stated, is ready to work with each party and leaves a return to Vienna to the Austrian Federal Policy.
In addition, the Green Party was introduced into Parliament, which, however, suffered slight losses and collapsed under the Austrian political parties from the third to the fifth place.
No other party has probably mastered the four-percent threshold and therefore did not join Parliament.
Blackenberg: Relations with India can cool down
If it is not possible to solve the problem with the Czech scientists who have been charged in India for the illegal collection of cases, it could, in the opinion of the Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg, come to a certain retirement of the Czech-Indian relations.
This was stressed by the Minister of New York after today's meeting with his Indian secretary, Pranab Mukhardshi.
"If this is not clear, then sure, it will come to a certain relaxation," he said after a meeting that took place on a Czech initiative.
Mukhhardshi said after the talks, in judicial matters, the executive could only act seriously.
Nevertheless, he pointed out that, in the case of Petr Švácha, who was released from the charge and received a fine, the central government wants the local government in Dardjiling, in whose case the matter falls under law.
"His problem could be explained," said the Minister.
For Emil Kučera, who was sentenced to three years of imprisonment, it would be best if he went to appeal at a higher court.
He could therefore seek release on bail and wait free to his trial, as the Minister said.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his partner was present at negotiations.
"He recommends an appeal at a higher court, then comes for him with a charge in question," said the head of the Czech diplomat.
The only way and way in which the Czech side can intervene in the whole matter is to let the condemned "competent legal support" be sought by the Indian Minister.
At the same time, he said that such help would already be offered by the Indian side.
"We have a great interest in getting good contacts with India that have a long-term tradition.
The interiors also give it to," Schwarzenberg pointed out.
At the same time, he confirmed that the Czech Press Agency ČTK, in front of his partner, the Czech Republic, was very important to the problem of Czech entomologists.
"We really think it's a big mistake to arrest and accuse these Czech scientists," he said.
One answer to the question whether he received the offer from the Indian side to deal with the matter is the Minister's fault.
"We've already had a lot of promises," he just said.
A check on the ring around the bottom of the sea
It is located on an electronic map, in Australia and adjacent maritime areas.
However, he is not interested in the continent, but a small point, lost in the blue of the ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia and together with it is the bordering sea base.
The area is as large as the continent itself," says Italian jurist Luigi Santosuosso, who is a member of the thirty-first United Nations Division for Oceans and Sea Law.
His head, the head of the Division, the Czech jurist Václav Mikulka, follows the explanation and supplements it.
This is where we work together and enjoy it.
As far as the sea is concerned, there is only a few known worlds that are rich in natural sources.
This is where oil is to be found, additional hormones and other non-industrial raw materials, but even unknown living organisms, such as the key to the development of anti-cancer medicines.
A seabed greater than the fortress
Today, the coastal states reported their claim to the new areas of the sea.
According to a UN convention, they made use of their rights which they joined in 1982 in Montego Bay in Jamaica.
This is particularly true of the area of the so-called continental slope, which often reaches up to a hundred miles from the shore of a country into the sea.
This country follows the Convention with an exclusive claim to all sources of continental shell.
"It is simply expressed that the part of the seabed and its shells, which represents a natural continuation of the continent under the surface of the sea, is considered as a continent.
He oversteps the boundaries of the Ufer Sea, often also the border of two hundred sea miles of the so-called exclusive economic zone," explains Mikulka.
The application submitted by the Commission to establish the external limits of the continental shelf by the country concerned must be based on extensive scientific and technical documentation based on many cost-intensive studies and measurements.
It is the result of many years of preparatory work.
"One of our tasks is to provide the Commission with legal and technical support.
The Commission has been negotiating up to five applications, including from Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
So far, only the three last-mentioned countries have succeeded," adds Mikulka.
At an international echo, Australia’s success was a short time ago, which could significantly increase its maritime areas as the first country.
However, New Zealand is also a winner - the extension of the seabed that was granted to the country last week by the Commission is about 1.6 million square kilometres, which means about six times the size of the actual country.
Both countries have invested millions of dollars in research.
The gain they will receive in the future from the use of the seabed will be as they promise to have an invaluable value.
Other countries will also submit their applications in a step-by-step manner.
You can do this for ten years from the moment they ratify the Montego Bay Agreement.
Where the continental slope ends, the area of the ocean floor, which is referred to by the Convention as "the common heritage of mankind".
There's no state in here anymore.
The right to promote in this area is granted by an international institution established by the Convention.
"The seabed is not a land of gold," says Director Mikulka with some overhaul and adds, "the individual areas are precisely defined and the system is contractually blocked."
Chechnya in the Pacific
A part of the Mediterranean is also part of the Czech Republic today.
It shares it with other states of the former East block within the common organization "Interocean metal".
This was achieved in 1991 by means of the Convention, as well as by investors from a few other countries, the status of a so-called "traffic investor".
The organization has the right to promote in the area of ClarionClipperton in the ocean style between Mexico, Hawaii and Kiribati.
The area to be investigated by the investor is much larger than the former Czechoslovakia.
The seabed is located there, it's about a kind of tatra on the seabed.
"In addition, there is a total area of 75,000 square kilometers.
The area is a wide base of polymetallic concretes containing nickel, copper, cobalt and mangan," says another lawyer, inger Pakshi Rajan.
The Macedonian staff of Division Rober Sandev brings with it such a concrete as a pattern.
It reminds you of a small cardioflage or, with some fantasy, of the alleged damage caused by the legend after the golem to life.
German special forces were at the time of fire release in front of the site
The Egyptian government had requested assistance from Germany in solving the gas crisis - the experts came.
When it became serious, the special units were ready, but they didn't get used.
The conditions of release of 11 European tourists in Egypt are becoming more and more detailed.
The rescue action also involved German Special Forces, as indicated by the Ministry of Defence and Interior.
However, both federal specialists and GSG 9, the Federal Police Flight Station, the Federal Criminal Service and logistics experts of the technical assistance work at the place of release.
However, as speakers from the ministries continued on Monday evening, the German forces were not needed because the hostages let their prisoners go and fly when they had recognized signs of violent liberation.
The Egyptian government has adopted the aid offered by Germany to join it as support forces.
"This has not been the case, unfortunately," said a speaker from the Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
On September 19th, the group of five Germans, five Italians, a Romanian, and eight Egyptian accompanyers had taken place in the south of Egypt.
After the exodus in a desert area in the south of Egypt, the treasures in the border area between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad were moved into and over again.
The identity of the buyer remained unclear until the end as well as the details of the exemption or possible ransom payments.
The rescues have arrived in Cairo between wells.
Steinmeier said that the freed geisles were in the obbhut of the German message.
For details of the release, he did not hesitate.
In Berlin there was no information at first when they returned to Germany.
According to the "Image" statement, the five vacationers and the special forces are to be evacuated with an airbus of the aircraft and enter Germany on Tuesday.
U.S. representative house emptys the rescue package
The first room of the US Congress has made the 700 billion dollar heavy relief package for the financial markets very close.
The Dow Jones broke into the depths.
With 206 votes to 227, the US House of Representatives rejected the Government's rescue package for financial markets.
Despite all the calls by US President George W. Bush and leading politicians, there was no majority of the programme that should be included in the financial markets.
In a dramatic action, the sponsors had been reluctant to convince the critics of the 700 billion dollars hard packages.
Barney Frank, one of the democratic negotiating leaders, had called on the MEPs to agree, even if the plan was unpopular.
"It is difficult to get political recognition to avoid something that has not yet been introduced," he said.
In the course of the vote, the Dow Jones introduced more than six percent or 600 points.
There was reason for concern by the contractor that the State aid package could be broken.
He got back shortly before the end of the vote, and then, after the announcement of the chairman, he withdrew again.
Experts now count on further difficult turbulence on international financial markets.
For an entry into force of the programme, it is necessary to approve both the House of Representatives and the Senate.
Organisers record increasing booking numbers
It seems to be a good winter for the German travellers:
In travel bookings for the coming months, sales have increased significantly over 30 per cent compared to the previous year, according to a study - even for the winter season.
Despite weak conjuncturing prospects, the loss of German travel continues to follow a study.
In the winter season bookings, the travel offices recorded a sales plus 31 per cent compared to the previous year's period, as the German travel association (DRV) reported on Monday in Berlin.
As a result of the investigation by the GfK Market Research Institute, booking rates have already been increased for the autumn months.
Thus, the sales surplus of the travel offices for October amounted to about 11 per cent compared to 2007, shared by the DRW.
The basis for these results is the number of GfKs that assess monthly booking data from 1200 German travel offices and are higher for the whole market.
The travel bookings made until the end of August 2008 are recorded.
Because of the weak dollar course, travel to the United States was requested, the DRW shared.
Here the booking growth is about a third.
In addition, Spain, Turkey and Greece, as well as the domestic films of the Germans, were specifically requested for travel purposes.
Especially during the course, DrV President Klaus Laepple said.
In view of increasing costs for energy and food, the costs are "more quantifiable for customers than for individual organised holiday".
Money could be saved by consumers, among other things, by breakfast discounts or all-inclusive offers, Laepple explained.
The summer months were also very well booked, so that by the previous year, it would be a sales plus - although a further study says the number of Germans who took a trip decreased compared to the previous year.
My first time in October
Ballermann-Apres-Ski-Hits in the Endless Schlief, beer from liter circles and Promis in Designer-Dirndln.
A wise-debt.
Susanne Kron sugar and I don't really have much together.
She's a blonde, television moderator and wears a measly dirndle.
I have dark hair, I'm a student and my dress is a second hand.
But one thing connects us: almost three minutes on the screen, the photographers are already staring at us and cutting the memory cards completely - very funny and that on my first visit.
That's how you make friends.
The Billig-Dirndl seems to fulfill its purpose.
When Wiesn-Touri and actually north of the white-word square, the feeling of well-being remained at the border until that day.
But once it's arrived on the ground, everything's so bad.
Almost everyone wears Dirndl or leatherhosn; no sight is affected or painfully - everything is completely normal.
A rare look at the Scokobanan station is just my mouth scarf.
A münchner noticed that I had falsely tied the shoes: "Links host free, middle young woman, forgive right, pushed back."
Secretly, I'm getting rid of my back to my left.
"Pass," say it and laugh.
Others make less room for subtle flickering techniques and wear bright filaments on which "To drink to get dressed!" stands and stretches an unsolicited behind.
The young man with the exhibitionist attitude is Bob, comes from England and also visits the October party for the first time.
He finds it "gorgeous" with a long-distance "oooooo".
This is what he tells me after he has removed his previously drunk measure.
Right next to one of these hydrogens, everyone thinks he's a mole.
So Bob's one of these famous "Wild Biellers".
Others do not have the happiness of releasing alcohol in this way.
At eight o'clock in the evening, health workers run through the fast place that needs to take care of the poor lockers.
The hospital carers are always on the edge of the wheelchair - always four times on once a roof is covered with a cloth from Zelt to Zelt.
This works like most visa visitors: empty, full return.
Whoever is in the Promille-Sarg under the planet, you can't see.
"These are the ones who pack gorillas," one of the nurses called me to ask and disappeared in the mud.
Police reported the accident victim's name
The name of a 63-year-old female pedestrian who died in the hospital after being driven to Essex by a vehicle was announced.
Carole Paulson, who lives in Chelmsford Road in Brentwood, participated in the accident on Friday afternoon on Shenfield Road in the city center.
She was taken to Queen's Hospital in Romford but died later.
A 51-year-old man was arrested after the accident because of his suspicion of light driving.
In the meantime he was released from prison.
Turkey expands the diplomatic horizon
Long before Turkey wanted to join the European Union, the European powers were interested in entering Turkey's country.
On the eastern side of the Bosporus, perhaps just 20 steps within Asia, is one of the most beautiful remains of this separated, imperial effort.
The Hydarpasha railway station was designed by two German architects Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu in Neo-Renaissance Style.
That's at least what the tour guide tells you.
The building sits at the end of the railway track with a tower on each corner of the front and looks like some provincial German Rathaus.
The stone's drunk.
The whole building falls like
But if you are once inside the wheeled driver, there is no doubt about the acquisition of the project, whose most western access was this.
The railway station was opened in August 1908 by a German Consortium, Anatolia-Bagdad Society.
Germany, which was a latecomer in the imperialist game, had before its ambitions to dominate the Middle East by means of an approach to Damascus, Baghdad, and beyond what is today Saudi Arabia.
However, Germany's imperialist projects were approved during the first world war.
His railway ships were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his Arabs.
The relative isolation of its surrounding region, created by the inviolable limits of the cold war, has disappeared.
British forces withdrew from Egypt and forced the Turks and their German allies from Palestine and Syria
And there were also bad news for the Hyderpasha train station.
In 1917 an ammunition train flew into the air, destroying the artificial roof.
Turkish sources say it was sabotage.
Since then it has slowly fallen, far from history.
Today, however, this railway line, at least symbolicly, serves as an anatollian tower and all east of it to promote the expansion of the diplomatic horizon of Turkey.
The ruling Justice and Development Party, the AKP, has introduced a series of new foreign policies for the country.
The relative isolation of the neighbouring regions, caused by the limits of the Cold War, has disappeared.
A policy of approach now prevails.
In particular, the Turkish Government has good relations with Israel and Syria, the Palestinian splitter groups Hamas and Fatah, Iran and Iraq and of course with the European Union and the United States.
In order to assess the exact data of this new foreign policy, I have spent the night in the Turkish capital Ankara to visit one of the leading foreign policy experts of the AKP, Turkish-led Suat Kiniklioglu.
The next morning, about ten and a half hours later, after a long drive to glaciers that produced the same progress of the old world in the famous documentation "The Night Mail", I came to the Turkish capital, which will be seen as a new city, for the new world state projects, the Osmanian past.
However, the AKP, known for its Islamic roots, represents a paradigm change in the Turkish unit
This has solved some of the mysteries in the West, especially in Washington.
A taxi has led me to the main business of the AKP, a specially designed, ultra-modern stone and steel construction in a developing city surrounded by half-made shopping centers and knots in which middle managers are involved in drawings, both men and women, to finish the first business of the day.
Suat Kiniklioglu could be a middle-law politician from almost any other political party in Europe.
Come on, Krawatte, I'm sure he's packed a blackberry.
"The aim of the party's foreign policy is now to reintegrate Turkey with its immediate neighbouring countries.
The Cold War was an exception," he tells me.
Turkey was cut off from its backland.
Today they have to look to the East and the West at the same time.
There is neither one or the other.
You had to do both.
"But I'm sure Turkey could ever decide," I asked, "to be forced to decide?"
"The Turkey," he said, "did not want to make this decision."
He then made a point, which almost everyone I spoke to here said, almost routinely: Turkey's relations, not only to the Middle East, but also to the Caucasus and around the Black Sea, are of the same benefit to Europe and the United States as they are to Turkey.
With Turkey on board, it seems that the message can, in the transferable sense, travel Europe as a whole on the same rail rails in the eastern direction of Asia and the Middle East.
Back at the Hydarpass train station, after a much more sleepless night, I thought of these two German rulers Mr. Ritter and Mr. Conu, who had been looking forward to building this building 100 years ago.
How surprised they would have been to learn that Europe's ambitions in the Middle East could now, too far, be in the hands of Turkey.
And when I was waiting at the train station, which should bring me back over the Bosporus, I reminded me that in those days Turkey was always called "the sick man of Europe".
At least at that time there were few doubts as to which continent should have a claim on this fascinating country.
In memory of Vernon Handley and William Woodruff.
Mark Brown writes: As Guildford's musical director since 1962, Vernon "Death" Handley was responsible for the Guildford Philharmonic and Chor.
As part of his music program for the city, he founded his great youth choir, Proteus in the following year.
He was thought of as young as 21 years of age, but when the choir in 1979 was the last time some of us were already at the end of 20 - we refused to leave the choir.
The name "Proteus" (the mythological form exchanger) was for the preparation and ability of the choir, any music that was presented to him, whether it was a medal or from the Messiah, whether a capella or full orchestra.
The musical diversity of such a young choir was often surprising, always uplifting and lasting alone and thanks to the inspiration of that man and his enthusiasm for the music that has never been left behind over years.
How often did death cause us to "let the music speak for themselves".
He insisted, "The composer knows what he wants."
It's all in music.
It's also song!"
His nature of the director was absolutely clear and precise, but never superfluous but never superfluous.
As high as the musical level was always, he always demanded a higher level.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If any director were to be killed by the knight, it was Vernon Handley.
I knew him well during the last two decades, from 1962 to 1982, in which he led the Guildford Philharmonics.
In the last 40 years, I have been writing criticisms for over a hundred of his concerts and I can honestly say that I have never been disappointed by a single person - often I was inspired by them.
Death Handley was the rare combination of size and personal consciousness.
He accepted the authorities who, according to his words, simply "went home with one or two known sheep horses in the world."
So many of us will miss him.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
In your call for William Woodruff (September 25, 1946), you write that "in 1946 he took over the teaching of economic history in Oxford again and in 1950 he received a Houblon-Norman research scholarship ... while studying at the same time for a BSC, MA and a doctorate.
This is a conclusion from an author's comment in Woodruff's book "Jesseits von Nab End", however it does not agree.
From 1946 to 1953 he was a professor of economic history at the University of Nottingham and during this time he wrote a doctoral work on the British rubber industry under the care of Professor J.D. Chambers, who later published as "The British cotton industry".
He was in the United States from 1950 to 1951 at a Houblon Norman scholarship, and spent the summer of 1952 at the universities of Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953 he finally left Nottingham and went to Illinois.
It is not known why Woodruff wanted to exchange this part of his career.
J. Vicente Resino at the Phylological College.
"I recommend the exhibition by José Vicente Resino `Flamenco and Life', because his photographs in black and white, in documentist style, are fantastic.
They made me pay attention to them because of their blindness and the power they express, how they always deal with the protagonists with respect.
An exhibition that shows a lot of feelings.
Resino knows to find the magical moments.'
Second round of the great sale at Honda.
In November Honda began marketing the second generation of Honda Jazz.
While its predecessor model had a large internal space, these large spaces offer a much larger one.
This includes the technical features that make it possible to save even more convenient vehicles and petrol.
Changes before the previous revolution.
That's the second generation of Honda Jazz.
Although, asthematically, the new jazz shows a similar line to its predecessor, the changes made in these large limos were numerous.
Among other things, the innovative design, the new space flexibility, the larger dimensions of the car and the new mechanism should be emphasized.
However, before you start analysing the new model, you have to say that this new jazz appeared six years later after the first generation appeared on the market.
Following the first observations, Honda, compared to the other manufacturer, managed to restore this model for a short time.
Although the Honda Jazz in Europe is less known, this model is a phenomenon with respect to its sales on the other markets.
This is a case in Japan, in the country where jazz is the most sold car of the year 2002 and also in the course of this year 2008.
After jazz appeared on the market, a million models were sold in Japan alone.
The second market was the old continent, with about half a million cars sold in six years.
However, Honda is trying to increase the sale of the new jazz model within the segment.
In this way, while Japanese companies sold a total of 83 000 models by Jazz in 2007, the expected estimates are 10 000 cars, 17% of the growth that has been taken on the European market.
As far as the Spanish market is concerned, since 2002, Honda has sold 8,000 jazz models as a whole. That is 6.7% of the total sales in Honda in Spain.
With regard to the new generation of the model, the directors of the branch in Spain expect to sell 2,000 jazz models per year.
In particular, it allows the appearance of the new Honda Jazz model to exchange the sales discount in Spain.
In fact, the leaders of the brand hope to end the year with total sales of 22,000 models. That is 4 000 cars less than in 2007, a decrease of 16%.
Despite this increase in sales, Honda has increased its market share in Spain by 1.8% compared to the previous year (1.6%).
At the same time, the Japanese company hopes to reach 2% in 2010.
To achieve this share, Honda puts on the appearance of a new model.
It is about seeing a hybrid car with 5 doors and compact size of 4.7 meters long, the Japanese company hopes to sell some 200,000 models per year throughout the world.
According to the Japanese manufacturer's market estimates, 50% of Insight models are sold in the United States, while other shares are distributed on the old continent and Japan.
The appearance of the market view is expected for the first month of the year, for the first time his public presentation will take place in Valencia in January.
With regard to the first generation, the new jazz grows in all its sizes.
Its length is 3.90 meters (plus 5 cm ) and its width is 1.69 meters (plus 2 cm) and the distance between the axles is 2.50 meters, which leads to the admission that it has grown to 5 cm.
The height, however, does not change and remains 1.52 meters.
Along with increasing the dimensions, the interior is also enlarged.
This success is, on the other hand, the new space flexibility programme and, on the other hand, the central position of the fuel tanker, a solution that was also used in Jazz's previous model.
The capacity of the coffee area, which has a system of double load area, also reaches up to 339 litres, which means 19 litres greater than the capacity of the coffee area of the first generation.
It must be stressed that these measures are available in the version with a 1.4 litre of petrol engine because the capacity of the Honda Jazz coffee area is 1,2 litres of petrol engine 379 litres.
Among other improvements, in addition to the additional equipment elements such as leather seats or the possibility of building panoramic windows, better access to seating places is offered.
The opening angle of the rearwards is 80 degrees, with the first jazz had only 67 degrees.
The engines of the second generation of Jazz are also new.
At the beginning of its marketing it has this small model 2 performances of petrol engines: 1,2 and 1.4 litres.
Both variants have i-VTEC system, which enables low fuel consumption and lower CO2 emissions, has excellent technical performance and at the same time has a dynamic performance for the entire engine.
The first variant with 1.2 litres achieves the performance of 90 PS at 6000 speeds with maximum speed of 114 Nm at 4 900 min ?1 .
This petrol engine - the leading model of Jazz reaches 78 PS - has 5.3 litres of petrol consumption and 125 grams of CO2 emissions.
With regard to the driver engine that reached 83 PS at the previous generation, he is now able to reach 100 PS.
The Jazz 100 PS model 1.4 has 5.4 litres of petrol consumption and 128 grams of CO2 emissions.
'Auto-Bine', avoids collisions
In order to advance the development of the technologies for disaster prevention, Nissan was inspired by nature this time, specifically by the bees.
The Japanese company has developed a robot whose flight back to the warm behavior of bees and avoids accidents.
This robot is a bio-mimetic Car Robot Drive or BR23C and represents the first step in the technologies for disaster prevention.
The engineers from Nissan Motor Co.'s Technical Development Centre have developed these small robots in cooperation with Research Center for Advanced Science and Technology of the renowned University of Tokyo (Japan).
According to Kazuhiro Doi, the Head of Technology-PR and R&D-Brand Management, the BR23C represents an extension of the four Nissan security shield.
This robot should ensure that the cars of this brand are able to avoid collisions.
During the flight, each bee builds up its own oval-shaped flight, which is very similar to the Nissan safety shield.
But the most important thing is the facetwaves of the bees that can see over a angle of 300 degrees in all directions, which allows them to fly without interruption in their personal airspace.
In order to train the circular perspectives, the technicians developed the so-called Laser Range Finder (LRF).
It detects obstacles that are before the BR23C at a distance of up to 2 metres and is located on the 180 degree radius, calculates the distance up to the object and sends a signal to a bordered microprocessor that is immediately translated into a signal for the avoidance of the collision
`At the moment when the obstacle is observed, the small robot will imitate the bike flight and immediately change direction by turning its wheels around 90o or even larger angles to avoid collision.
The greatest difference to other popular systems is that this surplus is absolutely instinctive.
If it were not so, the robot could not be able to respond with sufficient speed to avoid obstacles,' Toshiyuki Andoh, the director of the laboratory for mobility and the leading engineer of this project.
In contrast to a bee, the robot cannot either go up or down, but neither can he cross; he can only move on two dimensions and move towards the direction that enables him to turn his wheels and not into the infinite directions and in an infinite way how it makes the bees.
For this reason, Nissan has used rotational functions in addition to acceleration and deceleration functions so that the small robot avoids collisions.
`This device only needs to process the information every few seconds and act on this information.
There is no need to store the information or intuitative logic of the manoeuvres taken, so it can continue to work with just a few thousand KBs of the storage space.
This sounds surprising, but it's not about the GBs and not even about the MBs of the storage space.
This is the first step in the development of technologies for the immediate prevention of collisions, a technology that Nissan is predicting in the next ten years at the serial car.
The robot works with Lithium polymer batteries that are lighter and longer than the range of Lithium ion batteries.
Another possible application of this technology in the future could be the integration of the unit with a GPS navigation system by satellite to lead to the goal and avoid obstacles along the way.
She's on her breast before she's put on a mortgage.
It must be noted that the US Ministry of Finance has sufficient liquidity to provide support, but is not without assistance.
Before the crisis and in order to avoid the development of US citizens in mortgage stories of the supposedly eligible banks, a sustainable and informative game for Internet surfer was developed: 'Bad Credit Hotel', that is.
Or maybe the 'Hotel of the Bad Credit' or the other one.
The third aspect of this accommodation and especially its receptionist is to think about one, two and up to three times whether it is the moment to ask for no credit.
And especially where you can do it, which is probably the goal of the game.
I'm sure she has useful information, but no details.
This is rather a page for teenagers than a place for all viewers.
What happens when the game is expanded?
Well, if there's a dreamy room in the hotel.
At least something, because it's not about buying a better house.
Morgan Stanley makes its capital available for MUFG
Morgan Stanley announced the introduction of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG) into her company, which would be the first bank in Japan to issue nine billion dollars and will take up 21% of its capital, a innovation that will be reimbursed to a high rate of her profit.
One week after a provisional agreement was made public, the two banks stated that MUFG would buy 9.9% of Morgan Stanley’s stock at a unit price of $25.25, which would result in a total of three billion dollars.
The accepted price is less than 19% of the share price from 31 August.
MUFG will invest additional six billion dollars in the acquisition of convertible shares that will guarantee its 10% profit and can be reselled at a price of 31.25 dollars.
Morgan Stanley stated that the global business will be carried out on the basis of a single average price of $29, which means 28 % above the current price.
However, Morgan Stanley's share declined by 17.00 GMT by 6.79% to 23.07 dollars.
"This strategic connection is an important opportunity to speed up the transition of Morgan Stanley to the status of a Holding Bank," said John Mack, Director General of the American Group.
Morgan Stanley adopted this status last week, which would allow him to expand his business in new areas, but under the supervision of the Federal Reserves.
Her connection with MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis forces the biggest names of Wall Street to take a much more predictable attitude than before.
The modalities presented on Monday also show that the agreement was changed over the last few days: last month Morgan had made it clear that it would sell up to 20% of its shares for about 8.5 billion dollars to Japan.
'A week ago' stated in Tokyo Toshihide Mizuno, Managing Director of the MUFG, 'we thought that the participation would be made entirely out of strains.
But in view of the current economic and market situation, we wanted to reduce the risks and secure ourselves.'
Based on a balanced average price, MUFG will pay for its Morgan Stanley shares 7% below their price.
And the business will be replaced by a reduction in profit by about 20% per share.
The agreement provides that in one year, MUFG can convert half of its forwards into stocks if, within a given period, the latter is replaced by more than 50% over the sales value, which means about $47.
Morgan Stanley ensures that the money provided by MUFG will enable him to use investment opportunities to increase his balance and increase his sales.
However, a press speaker of the group refused to make more specific information on the strategic objectives of the two new allies.
Following the investment by MUFG, Morgan Stanley should be able to buy a payment capacity of about 15%, one of the best in this sector.
Morgan stated that his balance has been ‘very low’ since the end of August.
The last weeks were hard for the group that had to look at how their exchange rate returned about half, while the price for insurance against payment capacity accelerated to the height.
This price went back on Monday, but remained at a high level, at about 12%.
Goldman Sachs, the only other ' Survivor' of the major investment banks at the Wall Street after the competition of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the purchase of Merrill Lynch, announced last week, $15 billion, part of Berkshire Hataway, Warren Buffett's group.
Rafael Correa this month in Quito.
The Republic has re-founded the socialism of the 21st century.
This is how the joint projects of the Venezuelan Hugo Chávez, the Bolivian Evo Morales and the Ecuadorian Rafael Correa.
The third was that on this Sunday, following the example of his family and friends, he chose the plan of a new constitution.
The mission is fulfilled because according to 80% of the voter's public results, 64% agreed with 'Yes' in the referendum.
As a result, 28% agreed with 'No', 7% of the list was invalid and 0.7% were given empty.
In order to adopt the draft Constitution, more than half of all votes cast must be put to the vote.
On Sunday, two interviews were conducted at the end of the election hall and a number of non-governmental organizations announced a clear victory for 'Yes', and 63% to 70% of them spoke.
On the night of Sunday on Monday, Rafael Correa asked for the victory of his constitutional project.
In Guayaquil, the "Creation has triumphed over," he has guaranteed and congratulated the Ecuadorans in the seat of the government 280 kilometers south of Quito.
Of course, Rafael Correa was welcomed by Chávez and Morales, but also by his Chilean equivalent friend Michelle Bachelet.
The choice, which was maintained under the observation order of the Organization of American States (OAS) in style, was based on an existing text of 444 points for the protection of 'new socialism' for which the President was responsible.
The draft Constitution confers State power on the economy by giving it the sole right to 'development plan' in a country, which is largely based on land aid by foreign companies and the currency sent by immigrants to the country.
The project, carried out by the selected Correa in 2006, is also a comprehensive power for the Head of State to be able to carry out up to two consecutive mandates every four years and will have the opportunity to resolve the National Assembly.
Correa has already announced that he will make use of this power and will pursue a new mandate in February 2009.
The Constitution also ensures the principle of free medical care and education that the President has already begun to bring into this country with 13.9 million people living below the poverty line in 50% of the population.
Finally, it also proposes to prohibit the presence of foreign troops, which will prepare an end to the agreement between Quito and Washington to use an Ecuadorian support point as the starting point for American anti-drug plants.
The 19 Geisels were released in Chad
An Egyptian command launched the attack on the 11 tourists and their eight companions who were arrested ten days ago.
You're in Cairo.
The 11 European tourists and their eight Egyptian companions who were held in the wilderness for 11 days were brought back to Egypt’s capital on Sunday afternoon.
The next morning they were released from an Egyptian command in Chad.
Apparently in good condition, the missiles reached the al-Maza military support point right next to Cairo's international airport at 15.30 p.m. on board a special aircraft.
They were directly unable to speak to the press, brought on board a helicopter into Maadi Hospital, a foreign district of Cairo, to be investigated there.
They enjoyed all 'best health' and 'no money was paid', Egyptian tourism minister Zoheir Garanna said on the role field.
After she was arrested on 19 September at a land car Safari at the foot of Mount Ouanat in the border area of Egypt, the Sudan and Libya, the group of geisels was again brought back by 35 unknown drivers from a hiding place.
There are 11 tourists - five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian - and eight other Egyptians: two leaders, four drivers, a border guard and the director of the agency of Egypt, the organizer of the Safari.
An Egyptian security officer stated that 30 members of the special units, from board of two helicopters, launched the attack at night, shortly before dawn.
"On both sides, shots and half of the driver were killed, the rest of the flights," said those responsible who wanted to remain anonymous.
He stated that 150 members of the Egyptian special units were sent to the Sudan, where they received support from German and Italian commands.
The Italian diplomat Franco Frattini reported from Belgrade where he was right there, about the role played by the secret agents and elements of the Italian specialities.
"We must recognize that we have achieved this result through the professionality and performance of our men from the secret service and from the special units," he explained without further details.
He also argues that a ransom was paid.
On the night before, the Sudanese army had claimed to have stopped a land vehicle at a patrol where six of them, including the leader from Chad, killed and took two hostages.
The army stated that they were associated with a rebel group from Darfur, the movement Liberation du Sudan-Unité (SLA-U), which is currently fighting this movement.
Letter - The quiet majority of culture
A debate on the financing of culture makes lines of dispute and is central to the current election struggle.
That's better.
But a part of our cultural life remains in ruins.
Who will rise up and call for the warm sums that will be supplied to the small museums, archives, archaeological excavations or national historical sites that cause complaint?
What politicians will it take to remind the Federal Government that it neglects its monuments and its culturally important works?
That there are no right laws in Quebec, as well as in Canada, which effectively protect our cultural heritage?
Did you know that the French Government has 3.5 million euros alone and only available for the restoration of the Chinese castle in Loiretal?
In our American neighbours, it is written in the Constitution of their country that the protection of cultural heritage belongs to American culture and that this cultural heritage must be protected by all citizens, officials and all government districts, in contrast to one another.
In Quebec, in the association of the historical companies Quebecs, at least 40,000 honour officials gathered in 211 historical societies are trying to deal intensively with history to save the numerous private archives and to receive the archaeological remains.
They are also often the guards of our cultural heritage who protest with the power of confusion when promoters and decision makers release their bulldozers on our old stones and forgotten peace towers.
When will there be a stage for history and culture?
Benelux governments Local shares of Fortis Bank
In part, the Benelux states of the Belgian and Dutch Fortis Bank affected by the US financial crisis in Turbulence would want to take over the arms: the three states would provide the Bank and Insurance Institute, which is also available in Hungary, totalling EUR 11.2 billion.
The governments of Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands have consulted with the Presidents of the European Central Bank and the European Commission's Competition Authority on weekends.
In the eurozone, Fortis is the first victim of a year-old international financial market crisis, which could lead to decisions that may now be taken with regard to the bank.
In the light of the decision taken on the Sunday evening, all three countries buy their share of the bank by approximately 49 per cent.
The Bank will probably sell part of its shares, all of the insurance activities purchased by the Dutch ABN Amro last year.
The shares of the Fortis began last week a series of talfhards, which in the second half of the week had already emerged from serious crisis scenarios.
However, analysts agree that the bank is too large with its 85,000 employees for a plot.
The Institute's securities fell by 12% on a 14-year-old basis on Friday.
Since men, the value of the shares has fallen to more than two thirds.
In view of the current share rate, the market value of the group is EUR 14 billion, which is based on business management but is unrealistic.
According to the management, the USD 700 billion of your US rescue package and the uncertainty that it has created on the markets is due to the wage of the Fortis shares.
On Monday, however, the courses were slightly higher.
On Friday, Filip Dierckx was appointed the new Director General of the Bank.
The money institution was also looking for a private buyer, but it was not interested in a business offer.
The Belgian government was trying to calm down - no employer should sit around his money, he said.
There was no panic among the customers until the bank's branches were broken.
In Hungary the Fortis has its own branches, but it also calls Leasing companies its own.
Fuchs in the oven
Because of the drug consumption of a person, in America, life and health insurance often avoid conclusion of a contract with a customer.
Data protection experts fear that the data market could become uncontrollable.
"There are data protection programmes that link the use of the medicinal product data in any case to the consent of the person concerned.
These should be in independent hands, otherwise we trust the bird's nest" - quoted by Washington Post Richard Dick, the developer of the program for the follow-up of description data.
Insurers shall determine the fees and payments in the event of damages depending on the customer’s health and should the risk be underestimated, the insurance shall not be completed at all.
The customer was previously sent to a medical investigation, and the contract was concluded only in the knowledge of the results of the investigation.
Ten years ago Dick found a much more cost-effective method: using the customer's identification number, he refers to the data of the last one and a half years of the apothecaries, which preparations were purchased, and the program calculates the disease of the customer and its health status.
For example, if he regularly buys low amounts of cholesterol, it would be a result of his blood fat level being untreated, which would automatically select him in a higher risk group.
There are several versions of the program in the course of - some even define a risk multiplier, so insurance must only be carried out more than the paper frame, but there are smaller difficulties.
One of the consequences is that many medicines can be taken for various purposes, such as migraine and hypertension, but also depression.
The latter is a high risk factor from the perspective of the insurers, while the above are not mentioned.
For the question and processing of data, companies have formed their own companies who, before they relate the data, ask patients for their consent.
In the meantime, they must do so by law, even though they have not been granted exemptions for so long.
Some companies even process the results of laboratory studies and connect them with the data on the drug consumption, thus providing a more accurate picture of the patient’s health status.
More and more companies have access to data, and monitoring their use becomes more difficult at the same time.
Although there is a specific health data protection law, its effect is limited to services in the health sector and insurance sector.
The draft legislation was already submitted to the Congress, so the authorities could also control data processing companies.
Dick Richard notes that this is too small, so he wants to develop his program so that the data can be given only with the understanding of the person concerned.
Another question is of course that the person concerned may hardly deny access to his data, as insurance does not otherwise conclude a contract with him.
And so the hounds are left just somewhere behind of the grace of the führer.
Global Marseille Food Plan
The European Union and India double trade
Since the European Union and India are both leading trading partners of each other, this was the main issue in addition to other global problems at the ninth summit.
Today the French-Indian summit is also taking place, where cooperation is discussed mainly on the nuclear energy sector.
Although the European Union recognizes that India is an emerging, democratic power which should be given more votes and right to speak at international events, Member States have not yet been able to demonstrate whether they should support the continued membership of the UN Security Council or not.
This question was not discussed at the last nine summits in Marseille yesterday.
The French President and current EU Council President Nicolas Sarkozy, as well as Commission President José Manuel Barroso and Chief Diplomat Javier Solana, received an agreement with Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh.
In view of the fact that the exchange between 2000 and 2007 has increased from 25 billion to 55 billion, this objective is not even so ambitious.
In this respect, the 26 existing civil aviation agreements with India have also been legally incorporated into an agreement so that in the future air transport will also be flown.
By 2009, India wants to sign the Free Trade Agreement with the Union.
Sarkozy promised to speed up the pact.
The objective is to create a balance between the current uneven relationship between the EU and India: while the Union of the partners is a number of India, New Delhi is only nine among the EU partners.
The gyppel was dedicated to the global facilities.
These include the situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan, in relation to terrorism, which has been condemned on both sides. The introduction of a UN conference has also been called upon.
The Doha Rounds should also be closed, where both sides bear responsibility for the skiing.
The EU stressed that its energy and climate programme, which means that waste emissions should be reduced by at least 20% by 2020.
As a result, India agreed, as with the proposal, to conclude a global compromise at the coming climate crisis and to reduce greenhouse gas production by 50 per cent by 2050.
The price increase in food should also be fought, so both support the introduction of an international conference on the subject of financial crisis.
The Indian Head of Government is today visiting the French capital, where he will sign an agreement on the peaceful use of nuclear energy at a bilateral meeting.
In Paris, it is expected that it will be EUR 20 billion for the construction of nuclear reactors in India on orders from French companies.
According to Agency reports, the agreement should be concluded for 15 years.
More than 300 Italian lenders in Frankfurt
Strong presence of Italian lessor at the International Frankfurt Book Fair.
Over 300 Italian prosecutors will be present at the 60th Bachelor, the most important international event for law enforcement.
The International Frankfurt Book Fair is expected for the current event of over 7,000 exhibitors from 101 countries. They will be distributed over the 171,790 square metres of the fair and present over 403,000 titles. Turkey will be the most honored event.
The Undersecretary for the Ministry of Culture and Cultural Activities Maria Giro will be represented by the Italian government during the opening ceremony in the exhibition hall: Italy will be represented by the 264 km large exhibition room "Punto Italia".
A press conference will be held near the room structure in the exhibition hall 5.0 of the book fair: at this time numbers, trends and perspectives will be discussed around the exhibition in Italy.
According to the data, the importance of the books of foreign writers in general, especially in the adult and youth parties, is taken away.
One year ago, the lost little plane of billionaire Steve Fosset was found again
The small aircraft from Steve Fosset, which disappeared on 3 September 2007 on a flight over the wilderness of Nevada, was discovered.
The individual parts have been found on a 3,000 m high platform in the area of Sierra Nevada Mammoth Lakes between the United States of California and Nevada.
However, there were no human remains within the aircraft.
The Sheriff of Madera County, John Anderson, fully confirmed the last doubts during a press conference: "The aircraft has been located on which a team has been sent. Now we have the security that it is about the aircraft with which Steve Fosset flew on the day of his departure."
Mr. Anderson also confirmed that no human remains were found in or near the aircraft.
The 63-year-old billionaire was declared dead in February.
The U.S. Transport Safety Agency (Ntsb) informed that a man was sent out a few hours after the aircraft's appearance, which identified the machine: it was about the Bellanca 8kcab lost on 3 September 2007, after Fosset was launched in Yerington in Nevada for a 3-hour flight.
Finally last night in California, not far from the border to Nevada, some of the personal items of Fosset were found from a couple near their home at the Mammoth Lakes.
It is about two examples of the name Fossets, which were both issued by the Federal Aviation Administration of Illinois, Bar money and a Jack.
The search for Fosset was given a month after these disappearances.
The billionaire had taken over a place in history through a long sequence of records.
In 2002, he became the first person to cross the world ball in a winter balloon: a two-week, one-week flight.
Three years later he circled the world into a single flight without interfering with an aircraft.
Among its different records is a 15445 m high flight over the other, however, with a co-pilot.
Cool, the advertising you don't expect.
A suve that falls through its original design and the special line direction, which falls off the surface and its clear angle from the traditional scheme.
Mercedes-Benz has tried to introduce the new spirit sector with this offer.
Just because of its extraordinary characteristics, the idea of the Suv Glak will also come out unconventional, which will be seen from 17 October in the Mercedes-Benz showroom.
In this way, the advertising noise, accompanied by the appearance of the new model, will also appear in new clothes, i.e. in the form of a 3D campaign – this is a news in the car sector in western Italy.
A project with a high-end project to be carried out in various phases, which will be taken by central shopping miles of Milan, will be carried out by Corso Como until 15 November.
The first phase will consist of the presentation of the car in form, where 3D glasses, which are distributed near Corso Como, should give the whole a special perspective: the new Suv will thus appear in its almost real dimensions as a three-dimensional model.
In fact, the car will appear from the poster on which it is painted.
With the help of the Elumina8 technology of the new glk at different times in all its details, it will be illuminated to reassemble it as a whole.
There is no doubt that Mercedes’s installation with this advertising is to introduce a new type of auto advertising in this earlier stereotype field.
But will it be possible to travel the interest of future buyers? We will see.
Now it's clear who the Italian Hooligans are
They come from the Triveneto – now they risk being banned
Who are only these 150-200 boys and girls who are all over Italy now? They are part of the group "Ultras Italia", which has been traveling back for years from the Italian National Mission and which, frankly, has not yet caused serious problems.
Never came to meet with hostile fans before.
The origin of the group is in the right environment.
The promoters come from the Triveneto.
From Verona, Padova, Trieste and Udine.
These include other smaller groups from campaigns and apuliens in Sofia.
They wore the tricolors on which the cities of the militants appeared: but they were removed on Saturday to avoid identification.
Your models are the English fans.
In Bulgaria it now came together with a real right-wing radio fan, from Levski.
From the Figc, the Italian fan was placed 144 cards for the game: all were named and thus easily controlled.
In fact, they were also controlled by the Viminal: no one was among those who traveled to Sofia with an ongoing stage ban procedure.
Four fans of the Italian Mission, which had already been charged in this regard, were also denied the ticket and travel to Bulgaria.
The Viminal is now waiting for the reports of the Bulgarian police to take further steps: in this case the arrested or identified typhosis can be counted with a stadium ban for at least five years.
This is an international ban which prevents access to the stadiums throughout Europe.
So our hooligans will no longer put one foot in a stadium.
Good luck.
But now, of course, there is a fear of those who may be following them a little more than 150.
"This fire must be executed immediately, and that such behavior does not in any way give the opportunity to justify it" means the Viminal.
Therefore, "Look above all with a view to the game of the National Mission on Wednesday in Lecce."
Because in April there is a small core of the Italian Ultrasound.
In the morning, the osservatorio (Sport Supervision), which can be counted on a part of the Asia, is the secret services that deal with the problem of the stadium violence.
"Duce-Duce Rufe and the raised right arm during the Hymne of Mammel? In Bulgaria this is no punishment..."
This is the thought of Domenico Mazzilli (expressed with no joy), who has been the director of the Osservatorio on the Viminal (he has taken over the posts of Francensco Tagliente and Felice Ferrizzi).
Earlier, Mazzilli was the police president of Trieste, where a core of Ultras Italia's support was now established in 2002.
It is true that in Bulgaria it is not against the law to praise the Duce, but there is no doubt that the conduct of these 150-200 people was a shame.
"I am not a sociologist – adding paragraph 1 of the observatory – crimes are committed in the country of their action.
Until then, this group had remained in the Zaum, but now it has to be discovered what has happened and will happen.
But we also talk about the pimps during Hymne Mamelis: this is not a punishment, but they allow me to do so, but there is no training ...."
