I promised my neighbor a ride.
I made a show to the neighbor.
I promised my neighbor I'd beat him.
I promise, it won't happen again.
I promise I'll see you soon.
I asked for your hand.
I pressed a bad button.
I'm making cream for coffee.
I'm making tea on my coffee.
I'm sorry.
I've got a date.
I took my jacket off the other side.
I put the rest in the heater.
I put the food in the hottest.
I ate fast.
I'd like to repeat what I said, which I've been translated into other languages.
I've been running all this morning.
I ran as I tried, but I dropped the last line.
I've got it.
I ran into your brother on the street.
I ran over to my mother.
I'm reading a book while I'm home.
I'm reading the letter.
I've read so many times.
I read something in a book.
I read this story in a book somewhere.
I appreciate your cooperation.
I really don't know where to start.
I'm telling you I can't judge him.
I'm not very good at it.
I really don't want to do this.
I was having a really good time tonight.
I really like being alone.
I like city life very much.
I really like the holiday, actually, this is my favorite week of the year.
I'll be there for the girl.
I really like your website.
I got a letter from my mom last night.
I got his letter without delay.
I got your message.
I recently met an old friend of mine.
I recognized his face.
I suggest you learn French.
I grew up like a paradise.
I rejected the offer.
I was sorry to see you in Australia.
I'm sorry.
I remember both of them.
I remember that too.
I remember the day we first met.
I remember Tom wearing a brown hat.
I reminded her of her duty.
I respect Tom.
I'm going to rest in four years.
I put my ass at risk for you.
First take these needles out.
I'll run you faster.
I'm running five miles a day.
I'm running.
I've got the horse, sir.
I said that, but I didn't mean it.
I told you this wouldn't be good.
I didn't say that.
Thank you.
I sat down and kissed.
I was there with her.
I got to think about it.
I got to think about it.
I sat next to the driver.
My paradise is fruitful or green?
I was sitting on the ground.
I saw a bear drive.
I saw a truck carrying a truck.
I saw a very good movie last week.
I saw Dana.
I saw her a week ago.
I saw it.
I saw John in the library.
I've seen more than Tom knows.
I saw one.
I saw something.
I saw it.
I saw it as the car exploded.
I saw them.
I saw Tom dance with another girl.
I saw Tama today.
I saw your name on the list.
I had a little smile.
I was hoping this would happen.
I stole it.
I secretly photographed her.
I see a house.
I see a Russian.
I see a man and a woman.
I'll see you soon.
I see this.
I understand what you're thinking.
I took a risk.
I gave you flowers.
I've served Tom with special strength.
Six main parts of my desk.
I've got six.
Is everybody okay?
Is everybody here?
No, Tommy, you're not that important.
It's all right at the office.
Is everything ready?
The fast coffee really isn't healthy?
Harder French than English?
It's hard to say French?
Are you in school teaching French?
Do you speak French?
Youtube's murder crime?
Is he sick or a doctor?
America?
Sir?
He's my friend?
He's tall?
I broke my hand with Tom, and I went.
I scratched my head.
I should go there.
I should've asked Tom first.
I should have asked Tom for help.
I should have been a movie star.
I should've been at the meeting.
I should've been there at the meeting.
I should've been more comfortable.
I should've been a lot more precise.
I should have been a lot more basic.
I should have been there sooner.
I should've brought more food.
I should have come here first.
I should've done that last week.
I should've done this somewhere else.
I should've done it with you.
I should have helped Tom do that.
I should never have come to Boston.
I shouldn't have said anything.
I should've known I'd do it.
I should've seen it coming.
I should've stayed out of it.
I should've tried something else.
I shouldn't have left you alone.
I should've thought about it.
I should have followed your advice.
I should have said I don't feel it.
I'm crying, but no one's listening.
I just want to know what it's all about.
Is that a bear?
Is it okay if I call Tom?
Is that a faggot?
Is there cold in Germany?
Is that dangerous?
It's easy to learn to speak experientially?
You're done?
Will you eat tomorrow?
Is it hard to speak English?
Is that mandatory?
Is that normal?
It's okay if I stay here?
Esik?
Is that too late?
Is it true that Tom committed suicide?
Is it true that Tom killed himself?
It's true that you've been studying for a week on an experiential?
Is it true that you've opened up for Tommy's daughter?
Is it true that you like sweet coffee?
Is it time?
Is it more taxable than coffee?
I'm really hungry, I'm hungry.
Laurie?
I'll sleep with two pairs.
I slept about an hour after midnight last night.
I woke up. I was late for school.
I slept nine hours.
I was with my boss.
I've got your ass up.
Mary Tom's mother?
Cigarettes.
Will the weekend be okay?
Do I understand?
I got a picture.
I got into the house.
I ran into the house.
I was shocked.
Right now?
Didn't you have enough to ruin my life?
Isn't he a drug dealer?
But they slowly gave it to him.
Sometimes I'm sad.
Sometimes my stomach hurts.
I sleep sometimes.
Where's Paris?
I'm talking about getting some sleep.
I'll talk to you in Hungarian.
I'm talking a little English.
I speak English a little bit.
I'm talking about a little rose.
I'll talk to you in a little bit.
I'm talking Russian.
At least I speak French every day.
I speak French and English.
I speak Spanish.
I've been with her all day.
I've been with you all day.
I spent all my money.
I spent all my money.
I moved all the money I had to buy the book.
I was lucky for an hour until I realized where I had to go.
I spent my early life in the incubator.
I spent my early life in the incubator.
I spent the afternoon with my friends.
I've spent the whole day banging in front of my machine.
I've been sitting down for three years for a crime I didn't even follow.
I've been sitting down for three years for something I didn't even follow.
I said too soon.
I've got some lemons waiting for me.
Is it dangerous for the rainwater?
Is Russia part of Europe or Asia?
Is he so important?
Is she your mother?
Is there really close to Sicily Malta?
I've been carrying papers all day, and I'm tired now.
I began to question her right to stand.
I'm staying.
Is tea more expensive than tea?
Do you have permission?
That's the combination?
Titok?
Is that right?
Is that fate?
Is the air in the picture or is there a photo?
Is the air in the picture or is it on it?
Is that my stomach?
Did they get caught up in the mall?
Is that a problem for you?
Is that real money?
Is there a scientific basis for this?
Did you count on anything like that?
Is that hard to understand?
Is this the problem?
Really?
But isn't it?
Is that what everyone wants?
Is the mask in the chair, or is it under it?
Clear the party?
Is the competition so bad?
Is the microphone connected?
Is the museum open today?
Do they have doctors at the hospital?
Do you have any room?
Is there a subway in your city?
Is there an elevator here?
Is there any doubt?
Is there any more of this?
Is there anything between you guys?
Is there anything else you want to know?
Do I have to do something?
You want to say something, Tom?
Are you okay?
Is there a place to stay?
Is there life before death?
Is there something you're more interested in?
Is he in Iran?
Is the cook alive or dead?
Is this the baby boy or girl?
What's going on?
Isn't it ethical?
Is this a fake?
Is this still alive?
That's a salesman?
Is that a salesman?
Is that it?
Is that my place or yours?
Is that really an alcoholic?
Is that really Jankovics Tamás?
Is this seat free?
Is this the right word?
Is this a kind of fun trip?
Is that what you want to be?
Is that hard to understand?
Is this the key you're looking for?
Is that worth it?
Is this love for you?
You call it home?
Is she your girlfriend?
Is this your money?
I still don't remember anything.
I still can't tell you why.
That was seven or eight years ago, exactly where were you?
I still don't understand anything.
I still don't know why you did it.
I still have a lot of time to have fun.
There's one or two more things you need to put in your skin.
I have to get up in the morning.
I still think it's the best choice.
Tom's Christian?
Tom's a good boss?
Tom's a good cook?
Tom's a good teacher?
Tommy's alive?
- Tom American?
I don't know, I'll call and ask.
Tom's dead?
Is Tom here?
Are you kidding me?
Did Tom forget?
Tom Mária's son?
Tom's ready?
Is she still sick?
I stood by her.
I came to you today, but you weren't home.
I stopped talking.
I've been studying it for two hours every day.
I'm studying hard at school.
I suggest you talk to Mary.
I suggest you talk to Tom.
I think you're already busy and ready to move.
I'm sure I've heard this sound somewhere.
I swear they're carrying it.
I'm going to wash regularly.
Two and a half miles a day.
Does your daughter feel better?
Are you doing a dangerous job?
Is your mom home?
Is your mom home?
I don't think he's a man.
It affects everyone.
It's not always over until we're over it.
I'll take your place.
I'm going to work every day.
I talked to Tom a couple of times.
They're just gonna hang on to you.
It's nothing.
You might be better off with your sister.
This goes with the love I feel for you.
It's much more complicated than I thought it would be.
The price is two euros.
It might be a problem.
It could be expensive.
It would be a shame to see all the work done in pain.
Of course he's out of the way.
It didn't hurt.
I wasn't wrong.
That didn't help much.
He didn't stop fighting.
There's no way to stop fighting.
It's cold to let you come.
You don't do anything!
Everything that started and why.
They don't seem so confused anymore.
That doesn't seem right.
You're learning Chinese.
It's like I've been hit by them.
I just realized I was scared of him.
The other day, it's gone.
Thank you for coming.
Thank you for your confidence in me.
This happened at the beginning of last week.
This is exactly what happened on our wedding day, dear.
There had to be a reason for this.
It happened suddenly.
It happened when he was out.
It happened to me several times.
Sometimes it happens.
We'll go with everyone.
It's not good.
He's got his own value.
It's been raining since you loved it.
I think it's supposed to be a whole lot of people studying.
I think everyone's hungry.
I don't think he can help you.
I think you're gonna be all right with your neighbors.
I'll find her mother-in-law.
I think he picked up some movies.
I think I'm capable of it.
I wouldn't think I'd be able to kill you.
I don't think I can kill.
I don't think I understand.
I feel better.
I think I got the answer.
I think I'll take Tom.
I think I'm gonna die.
I think I'm starting to lose my head.
I think I'm ready to change.
I think I need more time.
It's like I've seen a package.
I think I still have time to do it before Tom's here.
I think it's better.
I think it's right.
Very little probability, I think you'll be able to do it from yourself.
I think he's gone.
I think it's time for a career change.
I feel like it's time to keep going.
I don't think that's fair.
I think so.
I think Tom was the one who helped Mari.
I think it'd be better if you left now.
I think it's better than I thought.
I think my neighbor might have died.
I think you're gonna be all right with your neighbors.
I think there's someone at the door.
I think something's wrong.
I'll find the cops.
I think he's home right now.
I think it's better than I thought.
I think he's coming.
I think Tom said something else.
I think you should forget this.
I think that would explain everything.
I'm thinking, so I'm drinking.
I'm thinking, I'm going to exist.
I don't think it makes any sense to try to convince him.
I think they've done a great job.
I think that's exactly what Tom wants.
I don't think that's gonna be enough.
I think this medicine will do you good.
I think time will solve this problem.
I think Tom was there already.
I think Tommy's amazing.
I think Tom's still unemployed.
I think Tom's definitely hungry.
I think maybe Tom's older than me.
I think Tom needs more.
I think Tamás wants to do it tomorrow.
I think Tom's gonna be able to help.
I think Tamás won.
I think we're gonna hang out with him.
I think we should be patient.
I think we've turned into a bad direction.
I think we should be careful.
I think we're safe now.
I think you're all fucked up now.
I think you called a bad number.
I think you know him.
I think you know the rules.
I think you know our friend's name.
I think you're gonna be fine.
I think you look great.
I think you'd like it.
I think you're scared.
I think you should go in on your own.
I think you're the best girl I've ever seen.
I think you're the only one who needs help.
I think your job is very good.
I think you've got a nice drink.
I don't think you were convincing enough.
I think you were right.
I was thinking about Tom.
I thought if we were going somewhere to eat, we'd find her.
I thought I could trust you.
I thought I'd go with him.
I thought I knew him.
I thought maybe something was worth it.
I thought it was clear what I wanted.
I thought my head was going up.
I've been thinking about my future.
I had a good idea of holding the key under the leg, but it didn't prove it.
I thought Tommy was still living in Boston.
I thought you trusted me.
I thought Tom was coming.
I thought Tom was still home.
I thought you were him.
I threatened my neighbor to kill him.
It hurts!
It hurts.
I stand under its influence.
It had a lot to do with me.
It's dangerous!
It's a historical color.
It's hard to get past the practice he was talking about.
It's hard for everyone to get into it.
It's hard for everyone to do it for his brother.
I have doubts as to whether it's gonna work.
It's getting too late.
He's gone.
We're half an hour after night.
Some people are hard to understand.
Best time to start a new business.
It's important that we promote our language in every way possible.
I mean, it's your fault.
It's in the kitchen.
That's great!
They're on the sun.
This is my bedroom.
We need to prepare for the future.
You need a good night's rest.
It's never too late to learn.
I'm glad to see you again.
It's not easy to solve the problem.
The trigger can't be shut down.
This isn't the best solution.
This isn't the right solution.
It's not too much to say he's a genius.
It's not a secret.
I'm not the one with Tom's problem.
It's not that expensive.
It's not the 19th century.
It's not your 19th century.
It doesn't work.
Maybe he's lying.
It's not like talking out loud.
It smells.
He's still moving.
Uh, it's really bad today.
Oh, my dear!
Three meters long.
It's time to go to bed.
It's too easy for him.
Get out of here.
It's a useful information.
It's a big heat night.
It's very important that you wash your hands thoroughly after you cut off your baby's scarf.
It just didn't work.
It's gonna be dangerous.
It'll be fun when we get home.
You'll be ready when you need it.
It'll be ready until you have to.
It'll take you a little while to get your eyes up.
It's gonna take ten minutes.
It'll work if I get rid of the polarities.
As a result, it looks bigger.
It looks good.
Looks like I don't need you here.
I'd like to take a break.
Looks like you don't feel anything good here.
Looks like you've been thinking about everything.
That makes me sad.
That's it.
It can take a long time.
Maybe it's a trap.
It can save your life.
Maybe we'd enjoy it if we tried.
Maybe I'll be ready.
You have to move.
You have to report something.
It must have been my love.
They must've been stolen.
You need to improve.
He never existed.
It should never have happened.
But I lied to him that I didn't want to.
I told him I'd do the best I could.
I told him to come.
I told Tomina not to give up.
I told Tom where I got my bike.
I told you, but you didn't listen to me.
I told you I'm fine.
I told you not to go.
I told you three weeks ago.
I told you Tommy'd like you.
I'd have a question.
I'm so tired.
I've been in the cage for a long time.
I arranged it.
I went on my 58th trip.
I was sure you were on our side.
I took my cat to the zoo yesterday.
I took my shoes off.
I absolutely forgot.
It'd probably be cheaper somewhere else.
The rain broke yesterday.
I'll see you tomorrow.
There's so much to eat.
I'll eat two hours a day.
I've traveled all over Russia.
I entered the United States in search of money.
It's actually working.
It's really sad.
I tried everything to keep him alive.
I tried to forget.
I tried to help Tominak.
I'd like to take my life.
I'm trying to keep you informed.
I'm trying to get my thoughts together.
That's a nice surprise.
Big-ass mask.
It's a little early for drinking, isn't it?
It's a terrible word.
It's a comfortable situation.
It's a dictionary.
Good plan, paper at least.
It's a dry stone building.
It's a pet dog.
It's half an hour.
It's a spring day.
It's a kitchen.
Kint's completely dark.
It's all mine.
It's all right, it's over.
It's good and good in mind, but will it work in practice?
That's all your fault.
It's seven hours.
It's already in progress.
It's been ten o'clock tonight.
One of my dreams was that I was living next to a platoon.
It's always the same note.
Environmental disaster.
It's an oxman business, Watson, an oxman, a dangerous business, and the more I see, the less you like.
What a pain!
I'm glad I'm late.
I'm glad Tommy's leaving.
It's a pretty big freak.
It's a miracle.
That's ridiculous.
It's just as art as much as science.
That's the past.
She's in school.
It's a very dangerous sport where a small error can lead to serious injury.
It's a very old book.
Money laundering.
That's a weird question.
That's terrible.
It was a crazy week.
It was a long day.
It was a wonderful trip.
It's a hot day.
It's a tough day today.
That's what happened before.
It wasn't a week ago.
It's been two years since she left.
That's better.
Better to break the law by night.
Fire source.
Me.
It's cheaper to get to the bus.
It's Chinese to me.
It's closed in spring.
It's closed every Sunday.
It's Friday night.
It's closed on Sunday.
It's cold at home.
It's cold.
It's cold.
Why don't you get a tip?
It's related that the bear loves the size.
It's all about whether Tom did it or not.
It's totally normal.
All right now.
It's dangerous here.
It's deep.
That's great.
It's over!
It's not easier to start than to quit.
It's easy to be brave from the desert.
It's easy to understand why Tom doesn't love Mari.
It seemed to me like an eternity.
Looks like the bus's over.
That sounds completely ridiculous.
Looks like it's just yesterday that we went to school together.
Looks like nothing's changed.
It's very weird.
Looks like it.
Looks like he's lying.
Looks like Tom's not sick.
It's like you don't want this to happen to me.
I think you're worth it.
I think you're wrong.
Looks like we're going to be an extraordinary guest.
It's Chinese to prepare for a date.
That's exactly what they want.
Darling.
It's fair if they get the same pay for the same job.
It's not perfect either.
There's plenty of the idealist.
It's yours.
You know, it's funny.
Let's get out of here.
Start getting serious.
It's gonna be hard on us.
It won't be easy.
Good to see you.
It's good to be happy.
It's good to learn.
It's great she could've come.
That's good, you'll probably name it.
It's not hard to get to that conclusion.
It's hard to believe it's been clear and it's been a long time.
It's hard to write.
It's hard to find a way to sleep in this city.
It's hard to say.
It's hard to say.
It's hard to steal a towel.
It's pretty pretty.
He's got a big head.
Magas.
The kids are in bed.
You're already down with the money.
It's more than usual tonight.
That's illegal.
That's important.
It's important for parents to be on one side when the line is raised.
It's important that we help those who are in trouble.
That's impossible for me.
You have to fill in here.
You can't get air in here.
It's impossible to meet your expectations.
It's impossible to get enough of your terms.
I don't know what's coming tomorrow.
Unbelievably, you know?
That's inevitable.
It's inspiring.
It's just a feeling.
It's just faster.
It's just a matter of time for Tom to get in trouble again.
It's just a phone.
I just don't want to die today.
It's pretty hard.
That's pretty important.
It's really nice of you to go home.
It's nice to say that.
It's too late.
Today's fun.
It's like a coastal field, and its technology, its branches and its branches have gone down like flying creatures.
It's locked.
It's me again.
It's me again, Tom.
It's me!
It's me.
It's funny how he lives.
It's too cold to swim.
This is my horse.
This is my life!
This is my life!
That's what I think.
It's my skin.
I'm on the line now.
It's never too late to be what you could have been.
You're welcome.
It's not a bad idea.
It's not a bank.
Not as cautious as it sounds.
He didn't even bother.
That's not enough.
This isn't gonna happen.
You're not going to change Egypt.
It's not mine.
It's not my fault.
It can't be negotiated.
It's not that far.
It's not that simple.
It's not the 19th century.
It's not your 19th century.
Not what it looks like.
It doesn't matter what you do, it's how you do it.
It's not worth making a joke.
I didn't talk to you.
I didn't tell you.
I didn't tell you.
You don't make any sense if you don't testify against the pope.
It doesn't make sense to be late.
Let's go.
He's obviously broken up.
Of course it's impossible.
It's obviously weird.
It's obviously very painful.
It doesn't matter if they're kept in custody.
It's okay if the man's gone.
- It's been three months, and Tommy says she's been talking to France. - Well, she's got a piece of shit. - What's the piece? - Dunning-Kruger effect.
Just three days.
The park's on the other side.
It sounds good!
It's over, isn't it?
It's over.
It's personal.
It's like I'm gonna take a shower.
He's got his scars.
It's amazing.
It's convincing.
It's pretty simple.
It is quite clear that the idea of this melancholy aims to be expressed in the work force's assessment, apart from the responsibilities of imperialism under the responsibility of blood war committed by him, and to deny himself the idea that the inexhaustible wars are the acts of aggression against man.
It's urgent.
It's raining in my heart.
There's a little big box in Japan.
It's true, isn't it?
That's a really big number.
He's gone.
I don't know how much to ask someone you're looking for.
They say they like Czech girls.
They say they'll soon leave Tokyo.
Shit!
It's just disgusting.
This is the moon.
He's on his way to Boston now.
It's so good to stay home!
He's still moving.
It's suicide.
It's technically possible.
This is the best book I've ever read.
This is the least I can do.
It's mentally possible.
It's the same for everyone.
The same old problem.
You still have to answer that.
It's time for us to take our tent.
It's time for us to get out of here.
It's time to go.
Time!
It's time to treat the problem.
I should like my hair off.
It's time to get some rest.
It's time to tell the whole truth.
It's time for us to do something about it.
Tom has his birthday today.
That's Tom's decision.
Tommy's word is against Mari's word.
It's too dark for us to blow up.
That's sweet to me.
It's too bad now.
It's too late.
It's too late to worry about this.
It's been a long time.
It's a terrible thing to do.
