Father Joseph Witko: I saw Jesus in the white room
He's a charismatic.
His holy temples of liberation and healing are flowing down the plains.
He was a few decades old when things were going on in his life that he didn't understand.
Today, by means of the French people, they're experiencing this other way.
On behalf of O. Witko, St.
Sometimes his parents came to him with a 7-month-old baby who had a 7.5 mm hole in his heart.
It was supposed to be overloaded.
Joseph’s father prayed about him.
The same day the boy was confined to the hospital on his way to the hospital.
The wise doctors said: "Operation is not necessary, the stay is only 1.5 mm".
My parents were crying for happiness.
After the next prayer, the French wall disappeared completely.
The spiritual activities of the Creator began to experience as a youth.
In dreams, pure souls came to him asking for help.
I was awakened at night and prayed for the dead and those who died at the moment – the memory.
He also experienced the presence of a wicked spirit.
And he had a vision of what's going on with a man who's committing a deadly sin.
“My body began to change.
I lost my human character and began to get the animal look," she says.
The invisible force pushed him up, he couldn't get out of his voice.
He felt he was lost.
Then God showed him the victory.
"I was immersed in the waters of the rivers of symbolic baptism of the Holy, I was released and returned to human status..." she says.
He didn't tell anyone about these strange experiences.
There was a call in him.
He was 16 when he entered the French.
He did not just want to tell us about Jesus.
He wanted people to experience him alive.
Members of the Charismatic Community of the Holy Spirit
Many people are involved in the health care campaigns carried out by Father Witko, who count on the removal of the disease.
However, the spiritual focus is, not physical healing, but spiritual healing.
First victory of Kolpinga FRAC Jarosław
Today (Saturday 26th September) the team of Kolpinga FRAC served as the current master of Poland Dartom Bogorie Grodzisk Mazowecki under the 3rd LOTTO Supergli Tennis Table.
The report in this personal set, which they presented to the peasants, has no chance of winning with the sovereign leagues.
He's been showing this one with Dart Bogoria.
She's still missing in the team, calling the leader of the team, Chen Jingqi.
It may be that there would be a third of the triumf series in the new season.
Young Asian Qiyao Han has not yet been able to win with such prizes as Greek Panagiotis Gionis or Czech Paul Sirucek.
Not even with one of the most promising Poles, or Mark Badowski.
Hellady was the largest star in the MosiR Hall at the Sikorsky Street in Jarosław.
At the age of Qiyao Hann and Kou Lee were a class for themselves.
Three units Colping FRAC conducted 2:1.
Which Lei must have won by Mark Badowski, and Daniel Górak after the exciting, five-year battle – Paul Sirucka.
Then it was worse.
Gionis didn't give Lee a chance.
There may have been hope of winning in two points, but Qiyao Han didn't leave Badusky.
There will be no further studies for seniors.
Why?
According to Raphała Trzaskowski's orders, a free trial programme for 70- and 80-year-olds was to be introduced in Warsaw.
However, the idea will not be introduced because it has not received the approval of the Ministry of Health and is subject to the Agency for the Protection of Medical Technology and Tariffs.
The Agency reasoned that the target group had been badly affected.
‘The above measures may therefore affect the detection of individual disease units, which may contribute to increased difficulty in accessing NFZ certificates and adverse effects on the patient due to anxiety and discomfort associated with false positive results of studies’ is written.
The decisions of the Board of Directors are not understood by the President of the House.
“The money is ours, we have planned the money for it.
Only the government is afraid that if people examine themselves, they will later go to a doctor, which is absurd, because it is just about to lead to a situation in which prevention can be done faster.
All experts know that this helps when it comes to burdening the health system, because it helps to quickly detect disease and in a healthy way.
The court has a very strange position here that I don't understand," said Rafael Trzaskowski.
"It's hard for me to imagine that escape specialists say: We don't worry because they'll be longer than doctors, and if such specialists advise the government, I'm not surprised there's a health service in this state," added PO policy.
Palestine responds to Israel: We will conclude all the long-term agreements
Palestinian President Mahmud Abbas announced at the UN General Assembly on Thursday that any agreements concluded with Israel would be concluded if the next country's government is trying to comply with Benjamin Netanyahu's order on the anaesthetics of the occupied Palestinian land.
"If the Government of Israel, which is to come, joins in the implementation of this plan, we will respect all the agreements signed (with Israel) and we will break all the commitments taken," he said.
"We reject the entire plan completely and completely," Abbas threatened.
"It is our duty to protect all our rights by all possible means – little matter what will happen – by fully engaging in the implementation of international law and in the fight against terrorism," said the President of the Palestinian Autonomy, who made similar statements in July.
Netanyahu, now Israel’s prime minister, was reappointed after the elections on 17 September.
A week before the elections, he ordered that if they were won, he would announce the anaesthesia of the Jordan Valley and intend to include all Jews in Israel throughout the West Bank.
In the early 1990 ’ s, Israel and the Palestinians, led by Jaser Arafat, signed a series of peace agreements sponsored by the United States.
84-year-old Abbas also promised at the United Nations General Assembly to hold a general election on Palestinian countries.
They last happened in 2006.
"After my return to the country, I called for local elections in the West Bank, the Gaza Strip and East Jerusalem and all those who would oppose them will have to answer for their actions before God and the international community," the Palestinian President declared.
Abbas also defended the rights of Palestine, treated as a permanent observer in the UN, to benefit from the powers of “full-time members of the UN and all its bodies and institutions”.
The Palestinian leader concluded his speech by calling on the international community to " force Israel to comply with all the provisions of the United Nations".
Israeli Ambassador Danny Danon responded briefly to Abbas, stating that the Palestinian leader "does not want to join the UN in the efforts of the Palestinian Autonomy directed against Israel rather than fight against the calls for terrorism in Autonomy under its leadership".
However, Danon, as the agencies point out, did not link the anaesthetics of the Palestinian land occupied by Netanyah.
Soldiers want defibrillators at neo-ralgic industrial points
History from border crossing shows that an automatic AED defibrillator can save human life.
The leader of the Prefecture Station of the Industry wants such equipment to be located in the neural points of the city.
Officials have received free diplomas from the Military Training Training Station in the Industry for their position.
Applicant Daniel Cyrnek, senior applicant Grzegorz Bal and Commissioner Jacek Wojczyk are staff of the Under-Carpack Office of the Scarbowe in the industry.
On August 28, they completed the service at the Polish-Ukrainian border crossing in Medica. The servant of the Celno-Scarbowe Service noticed a man lying in the sandy area.
The Chinese activist died in the arrest as a result of torture.
He wanted to benefit from the rights guaranteed by the Constitution
To Cao Shuxia, an activist's wife, he called on the Communist Party Secretary from her family village on 23 September to inform him that his husband had just died in a military hospital in Hengyang.
What was the cause of death – he did not reveal.
At Cao's bones, she saw the body of a masquerade man, not to be recognized.
"His eyes, ears, nose and mouth were all in the blood," said the woman.
"They didn't allow me to take the cells with them, and there were many police officers who couldn't get close to Wang."
The police insisted on signing a statement that the husband was seriously ill and died as a result of “an accident. ”
105 million zł for company from industry video from the National Research and Development Centre
Nearly 105 million were affected by the financing of a company from the gambling industry, creating innovative solutions.
The National Research and Development Centre announced on Friday the results of the GameINN edition.
Among the nearly 30 projects supported by the NCBR were the development of ground games based on the AR engine, creating a real world map together with an application that allows users to send data; a test-training platform to verify practical skills in job creation and professional performance using VR and AI; an innovative game that simulates the management of real production processes using a innovative world-based model based on virtual interaction with the world's real use of data; the NBR's concept is presented in the NBL industry's 4.
The goal of the GameINN sector programme is to increase the competitiveness of the Polish producer sector by playing video on the global market by 2023.
As NCBR reports, today the Polish sector plays video growing at 10% per year.
According to government data, the value of the Polish market video game in 2016 was 1.85 billion bad, while the forecast for 2019 was 2.23 billion.
"The especially prepared agenda of the GameINN researcher and already 300 million ECU of support for entrepreneurs under this sectoral programme are an important impetus for the further dynamic growth of the Polish gamedevu," we read in the Communication.
The video game industry is a perfect example of the effective use of the potential we have in Poland.
"The government's incentives for business innovation, such as B+R debt, skills enhancement programmes, IP box or NCBR support programmes, promote innovative business and enable them to be more effective in the highly competitive market," says the Deputy Prime Minister, Minister of Education and Higher Jarosław Gowin, quoted in the Communication.
The Head of the Research Centre notes that innovation money not only deals with innovatives in the form of project financing but also remains in their challenges – three fourths of B+R in 2018 used more than a year earlier.
‘The estimated costs for B+R activities amounted to 1.7 billion evil, resulting in over 300 million injury to companies benefiting from this debt.
This is the equivalent of the support provided by the NCB in the three editions of GameINN," the vice-president stressed.
The Director of the NCBR, Dr. Wojciech Kamienecki, also recalls that in two previous competitions for financing of a total value of more than 211.2 million zl were awarded 78 innovative projects.
The huge interest in competition III and the diversity of proposals shows that the video game industry has ideas and competencies to further develop and increase its competitiveness.
“In particular, the fact that the projects produced – as in previous editions – are located on solutions that serve not only interests but also industry-related 4.0” adds.
In the third competition GameINN on financing even 20 million evils could be applied to entrepreneurs, business associations and business associations with scientific units.
The NCBR had 87 proposals for the total amount of funding approximately 317 million ECU.
The tender budget at the time of the announcement of the tender was 100 million bad, but it was increased by nearly 105 million bad financing for 27 projects.
Detailed information on the results of the GameINN competition III is available on ncbr.gov.pl.
The GameINN sectoral programme is implemented under the Intelligent Development Programme.
The NCBR launched a programme in 2016 in response to the initiative of companies associated with the Polish Games Agreement, including companies such as CD Project, Techland, CI Games, Bloomer Team or 11 bit studios.
Lamine Diaby-Fadiga committed to the robbery of the Kaspper Dolberg
It's September 16th.
Dolberg, who finally arrived from Ajaks amsterdam to Nice by the end of August, focused on training that his flag had disappeared.
It wasn't like it because it's worth 70,000 euros.
The next day, all Danishs did not appear to be interested in the interpretation of brutal problems.
Right from the beginning, it's been a big deal.
Pillars on the site have private security and the club field is monitored.
According to the AFP agency for theft, Diaby-Fadiga was finally granted.
At 18 years of age, Dolberg and his other teammates and coach Patrick Vieir have already asked.
He also promised Dunci to return money for gambling.
Diaby-Fadiga is one of the most promising young generations in France.
He went to Nicei as a teenager three years later so he could play in the first group three years later.
In this season, he's been out in seven matches.
He recently signed a professional contract, but, as L'Equipe said, the club will probably develop it with immediate effect.
At the same time, he initiated a disciplinary action against his lawyer.
Nice, at least officially, refuses to comment on this.
Check if you're sure you're gonna wash your hands.
We all know that there must be corn (e.g. after coming home or before dinner).
But not everyone knows that if you really want to get rid of the injuries, you have to do it in the right way.
It's especially important now that there are serious infections.
It takes at least 30 to 40 seconds to remove dangerous bacteria and viruses from our lungs
And most of us are short!
Enough hot water and common honey – it’s not true that it has to be antibacterial (many doctors are breast cancer).
By washing, we wash not only the floor and the hands of the hands, but also: the ends of the fingers (connected or single) – wash them with cylist movements inside the other arm, space between the fingers (pay your hands, hugging your fingers), the girls – each girl includes the other arm, and in this way we turn them around for a moment in the right and left.
In an emergency situation (when it is impossible to wash our hands) we should wipe out our hands with a wet, and then use the antibacterial desire (in drugs, from 5 oz).
After using the public toilet, do not touch your hands with clasps or doors (recommendation of the Chief Sanitary Inspectorate).
Open them with a paper handle.
Iran's President says he has rejected the US conversation proposal, Donald Trump refuses
Tehran did not speak with the US side during the UN General Assembly in New York, despite the US's offer of sanctions, said Iran President Hassan Rowhani on Friday.
U.S. President Donald Trump commented that the Iranian side had asked for restrictions on what he did not agree with.
According to President Iran Hasan Rowhanie, the US proposed the abolition of all the sanctions imposed on Tehran in order to negotiate a new international agreement.
It should regulate both the Iranian nuclear programme and the ballistic pressure-building programme.
Rowhani: Iran will not talk in the atmosphere of maximum pressure
The President of Iran said he did not agree to these talks because of the "toxic atmosphere".
He said he met American diplomats because he was in charge of France, Germany and Great Britain.
He stressed, however, that Iran would not take talks in the "maximum pressure" atmosphere.
"And even if we want to negotiate with the Americans in 5+1, no one is able to predict what the final outcome will be," Rowhani said.
The Iranian leader said earlier that he did not exclude talks with the United States, and the European nuclear deal party rejected the US sanctions on Iran.
He added that the sanctions imposed on Iran after the US nuclear agreement "are an initial condition which does not allow" for dialogue.
If we are able to cope with this condition early and if America suffers from sanctions and maximum pressure, then of course we can talk to America – he has declared it.
He added that he did not exclude the meeting with President Donald Trump, although he did not agree to such a discussion during the United Nations General Assembly last week.
Trip: "Ian asked, I said no"
Donald Trump wrote on Twitter that he rejected the request from the Iranian side.
"Iran wants me to impose sanctions on them so we can meet.
Of course I said no to the President of the United States.
Atmospheric pressure in the background
France, Germany and the United Kingdom are trying to ease the tension between Washington and Tehran in some way to save an agreement with Iran in 2015, which were signatories.
It stated that, in order to eliminate economic sanctions, Iran would withdraw from the nuclear-weapon-building programme and the nuclear sector would be subject to the control of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).
Since the withdrawal of the agreement in May 2015, its signatories have repeatedly confirmed that they want to keep the agreement in force.
Well, it didn't work out.
Washington uses a maximum pressure release tactic for Iran, and sanctions also include a full embargo on Iran's slave trade.
Tehran said that if he did not receive a source export authorisation which would limit his obligations resulting from the agreement for 60 days.

The Court of Justice of the Warsaw Administrative Court and the husband of Emili Heiter, who, according to her words and screens from WhatsAppa, participated in the meeting with the judges, was returned to the middle of the investigation by NSA.
The reason: there has been no disciplinary action against him and therefore there is no basis for the support of President Wojciech Mazura's board of President Wojciech.
Judge Jerzy Chromicki, a counsellor at the NSA, initiated an exposé against Smydta at the end of August, but it was not translated into action against him by this time.
Despite the fact that the NSA, which acts as a disciplinary court in such cases, must take the decision of the President of the WSA within a month of its release.
In this case, a judge who has publicly told his wife about the mental problems of his wife to discredit her, who has been removed from the KRS office because of suspicions of participation in the Heiter group, will return to trial and will issue a judgment on behalf of the Polish People's Republic.
Judge Smydt refuses to participate in the Heiter Group.
He says there's no evidence on it except the distorted screens and his wife's words that he's divorced with.
That's exactly what the other judges are saying about "Kasta": they're all innocent, there's no evidence.
And it's quite possible that they're on their own.
Because the prosecutor didn't push his finger to protect evidence from their electronic carriers, he's also quiet about the content of Emili Smydt's phone that stopped it in June in another case.
The police did not push their fingers to protect the devices of the persons who were sent as escorts to bring to justice Waldemar Žurek.
There's no evidence – there's no evidence, there's no evidence, there's no "Kasty".
There is also no case of Chief NIK Mariana Banasia for renting a container truck and concealing revenue.
The CBA will check his property statements.
And check when you check.
Once again, the Commission of Ethics of Poland will not take care of Banasem because Seym is suspended (but the Committee of State Control has somehow come together to take a decisive decision on the withdrawal of the representatives of Banasia and the appeal as his lawyer, although the law does not provide for such an extraordinary combination).
The whole reminds me of a new movie, an American mistake about how a wife goes home and a man with a boyfriend stays in bed.
She's so confused and confused that she can't express her words.
She's standing in the door, and in this time she's coming out of bed fast and she's crying and coming out.
And the husband made a bed.
When the wife picks up her voice and shouts: "What is it?"
Who's this woman?
A man's quiet question is, what's the woman, love?
It's just that "Kasty" or "Banasia" is part of the state family.
And it's not funny at all.

Kamila Numberwinko at the end of the jump up
Formerly returning to the falsifying season after the death of the mother-in-law, the world's leading medalist from London 2017, in the first attempt, won 1,85 and 1,89 and the second 1,92.
1,94 managed to get it in the third way.
“I am glad.
I showed that I was able to fight because the first attempt was totally unsuccessful.
In the end, I will have to jump more technically," admitted the Eurosport Licwinko camera.
In the eliminations, American Vasti Cunningham and Biolorosinka Karyn Demidik – 1,94.

Cornel Moraviacki lives in a hospital in a state of severe depression
He went to the hospital, and his doctors determine his condition as serious.
We need to add he's quiet and aware.
“We believe that it will come out that it will win next time.
We all pray for him to come back to health," said an anonymous close friend of Cornell Moravia in a conversation with the "Super Express" reporters.
In the next election, the Prime Minister's father is applying for Senate.
"I have the closest family and politics in my life," said Cornel Morawicki in a report he gave two weeks ago to the newspaper "Super Express".
In January, Super Express reported that the 78th-year-old Cornel Morawwicki was studying at the Military Hospital in Wrocław.
“I was struck by strange, disturbing symptoms and I reported to the hospital.
It turns out I've got a gold ring.
But the worst was in front of me.
When the computer tomography research was conducted, it was said that I had a brain tumor...," the father of the prime minister told him.
A few days later at the MSWIA hospital in Warsaw, Cornel Morawwicki underwent a serious operation.
As Morawicki said, President Andrzey Duda sent his personal capelin priest Zbigniewa Krass to the hospital.
The operation lasted about three hours and walked mentally.
“I know that many people have prayed for me for what I am very grateful for.
Luckily, I don't have any breaks.
I don't know if I'm gonna go through chemotherapy yet.
I'm giving myself to doctors of specialists who are better-thinked.
In the event of this serious operation, I have to go back to some state of utility.
I hope everything's going to be okay," Cornel Moraviak said in January, in a discussion with "SE".
“If I were to conduct a study later, it would be tragic and I would already fall into it...”, he added.
Cracks: 14-year-old lost
Officers from the City Police Command in Krakow are looking for 14-year-old Nel Stoklos.
Anyone who has any information about the missing shall be requested to contact.
The missing 26 September evening came from the place of residence and she did not return or contact her relatives until now.
The last time she was seen was at the Old Guest House in Krakow.
Nel Stoklos is 14 years old, weighs 167 cm, has blonde hair and brown eyes.
When she was last seen, she was dressed in blue, shit and boots.
Any person who has any information about the missing person is requested to contact the police under Tel. 12 61-52-911, 12 61-53-616 or 112, 997.
It's a wave of wave jumps.
The title of the relationship from amateur sports professions, which took place on Sunday, September 15, at Oleandri Street in Olava, may be for some liars.
To the real power of the road, I'm far away, but that's exactly what I'm saying.
The competition for jumppower is to be carried out by the driver and horse ever higher obstacles, which in the most prestigious international professions exceed even two metres.
It is worth adding here that the long and still endless record of the world, which was established in 1949 by Chilean Albert Larraguibele, on the horse "Huaso", is 247 cm.
So high in Olava, of course, no one jumped, but the result of the best local amazones at 135 cm level is also not worth the worst...
The works organized by undisputed Jan Seenkiewicz and other JKS "In the seat" were a demonstration part of some of the previously published "Foreign Railways" on page 22.
There were eight amazones trained to ride in the WKS.
Four competed on the hooks and four on the big horses.
In the first group, Nikola Szołdra, who was a crazy "Sprinter", wrote best.
This small, but as a dynamic hole began from the opening of a 40 cm barrier and ended just when it was stationed with a top white distance of 125 cm from the ground.
However, it was not easy and only after three further objections were rejected by the competition authorities since further liquidation.
The second place in the huts was Amelia Pavlak, dating "Fami", and the third Lena Borun on "Harmiderze".
Ambitiously she fought the youngest tournament participant - Inga Aksman, a galloping and jumping by obstacles on the small "Carmen" key.
More emotions accompanied start-up Amazons and I see during the competition with large horses.
The terrible outbreaks of Paulina Szewczyk, documenting the "Declaration" and Abramenko Anastasia, which went to "Lotce".
Fortunately, except for small shells or Amazons or horses, nothing bad happened, so they continued to participate in the competition.
Several problems with the introduction of the young "Wineta" key to the park had a fascinating Veronica Luckiewicz.
There was either a coach's ass or another horse to a pair of horses that was a little crazy about "Wineta".
After counting the obstacles from the parking lot, she also had a full taste, so for a few moments in the boxes and on the refrigerator she was dangerous. "It's all under control!" Jan Seinkiewicz calmed down a bit of these frightened visions, especially those of the younger ones.
From the start of the big horses' competition, Martha Massalska wrote a great note on the parking lot, which is beautifully presented by "Whiskey".
This suitable key, in a couple of experienced Amazons, followed by a second approach in the final phase as the first exceeded 135 cm and was the best result of the professions at the time.
At the same time, however, Paulina Szewczyk also won the "Declaration", Veronica Luczkiewicz on "Wine" and Anastasia Abramenko on "Lotce".
So all these professionals went out together to decoration and after they received the prizes as a driver's equipment, and finally, together with the Amazons on the cats in March Radecki performed an effective round of honor, completing these interesting and exciting professions.
Thank you.
Travellers The Sports Club "In Sidle" warmly thanks the sponsors of the competition for the power of jump during the XVI "Technical Jezdecks": The City Office in Ålava, the Water Station and Canalization in Ålava, the Old Age and the company "Mustang".
Max Colonko from KWW Patriotic Revolution Maxa Colonko
KWW Patriotic Revolution Maxa Kolonko is the name of the electoral committee under which political formation #R Revolution Mariusza Maxa Kolonki had to go to parliamentary elections in October.
The revolution directed its proposal in particular to young voters on the right perspectives.
Before the elections, Colonko had ordered collaboration with Mark Jacubiaki or Paul Kukisz, but none of these coalitions had succeeded, and KWW Patriotic Revolution Maxa Kolonko himself was unable even to collect enough signatures to issue letters in any electoral area in Poland.
Now Colonko has informed Twitter that he has completed collaboration with KWW Patriotic Revolution Maxa Colonko.
"I will expect from the KWW to define my name by name.
Please accept my person's absence from the mentioned entity," he added, adding that more information was provided in a short time.
At the same time, we do not know whether the journalist will continue his work or whether it is the end of the formation of the #R Revolution.
On 4 July, on the American Independence Day in the United States, journalist Mariusz Max Kolonko reported on the establishment of a new political formation - #R Revolution.
In recent years, Colonko has ended up running the YouTube channel Max TV on which he commented on the events in Poland and the world.
“We have enough politicians, enough of your expensive games, enough of your amateur governments.
It is time for the government to take over the nation and rule for the good of the people," said the Colonco.
The programme included matters relating to jurisdiction (should be selected in general elections), tax changes (equivalent to free tax for all), military repairs (in the form of military assistance for NATO countries in the east, with particular regard to Poland), referendums on the possession of weapons, restrictions on the number of missions or the introduction of uniform electoral circuits.
A few days after a new political formation was announced, Mariusz Max Kolonko joined Mark Jacubaiaki.
At the end of July, Kolonko posted on his profile in social media information suggesting that #R will connect forces with Kukiz'15.
However, none of these coalitions finally succeeded.
BB: Gold near the point of balance
"The euro course will last in the next few months around 4.35 bad to join will be weak connectivity on global markets," Michael Bollinger from BBW Wealth Management.
"Awaiting a stable pace of economic growth and a stable monetary policy is talking about stabilising the notes of gold on the current pillar," an expert assessed in a discussion with Bankier.pl.
Its view is that despite the clear pressure of the monetary policy Council, it does not decide on the tops of the environment, in which most central banks make policy easy.
"If gold is properly valued – notation of the euro should be maintained in the next few months in the context of the 4,35 evil – the Polish bonds are so attractive.
Much more profitable rentals than Polish paper offer bonds from emerging markets," says Michael Bollier, head of asset allocation on the emerging market in the company of BBW Wealth Management.
According to the specialist, the main threat to the Polish economy is the worsening of the con juncture in the world.
"The global relief can still deepen, but should not get into severe recession, which is at least slightly below zero," Michael Bollinger says.
"Investment should not undermine global actions that could damage the lack of prospects for a solution to the US-China trade conflict and other geopolitical risk factors, including the Donald Trump and Brexit impeachment procedure.
The most relatively weak share markets should be Europe," the results of the latest list to the investors of the lead management BBW Wealth Management Mark Haefele.
"The actions of the euro area countries should be worse than those of the US, as they are more taxable under the conditions of higher uncertainty about global trade and pre-deployment concerns," we read in the document.
According to Michael Bollierer, after the hossa on the markets of the most dangerous countries has increased the ten-year-olds' profitability even to less than 0.74%, it is still possible to increase the drop in profitability.
However, in a longer-term perspective, long-term securities should no longer be rescinded, but only short-term, in order to ease the monetary policy of banks.
The largest field to the bottom of the foot has Fed, which should lead to a decline in American currency in the horizon for the next few years.
The long-term balance sheet for the euro notes is US$ 1,29, which would mean a 19-percent boosting of the common currency to the dollar.
We expect further cuts in Fedu's feet, which will result in a reduction in the world's monetary policy.
"The maintenance of the dollar force in the long term may not allow deficits in the current and budget accounts," Michael Bollier says.
Bundeswehra's losing his gun.
German MON’s Pofny Report
Since the beginning of 2014, Bundeswehra has noted the disappearance of 39 parts of weapons, 39 parts of weapons, and 19 445 parts of ammunition – the result of a complete installation in the RFN defence reserve.
Information was provided by a pig belonging to the media group EditionsNetswerk Deutschland (RND).
According to a document from the Parliamentary State Secretary's Office at MON Peter Taubera (CDU), two pieces of weapons, one piece of weapons and 3474 pieces of ammunition have been re-designed.
Among the military equipment still missing are six MG3, 11 automatic G3, four automatic G36, six signal guns and two P8 guns.
In addition, 30 lufs are missing for MG3 machines.
The concern was expressed by the Vice-President of the Lewica Party, Martina Renner.
According to the RND journalist, the number of missing pieces of arms and ammunition is "instinctive".
More importantly, the results of the investigation have only been found in any part of the lost equipment.
Martina Renner summarized the effects of these actions as "national balance".
It also criticised the fact that it did not show whether there were any weapons found during the investigation against Lieutenant Bundeswehry Franco A. In December 2017 the Federal Prosecutor in Karlsruhe accused him of preparing a serious act of violence against the security of the State and violating the provisions of the law on access to firearms.
Officials are calling for the preparation of closures on German school policies from extremely fair and racist initiatives.
On his "black list" of objectives which had fallen into the hands of the prosecutors, heiko Maas of the SPD, Claudia Roth of the Green Party and Anetta Kahane, the former Minister of Justice of the Amadeu Antonio Stiftung Foundation in Berlin.
Franco A. entered illegally with four pieces of fuel, more than 1000 pieces of ammunition and more than 50 cargo of explosives.
The crying children in the plane.
How to avoid them?
There is a solution
The carrier of Japan Airlines has recently applied a function designed for persons whose travel in the company of a crying child is a nightmare.
The website allows you to check the location range on the plane.
If the connection is to travel for the second year of life, the child’s end shall appear on a specific reserve reserved by the parents or guardians of the seat.
The same person using the transporter’s services has the option of choosing a place away from the small one.
The BBC indicates that the lines have already been informed of the failure of this solution.
"Children's icon" shall not appear at any time when the ticket has been booked by a third party or if there has been a change in aircraft at the latest.
As you can imagine, the idea divided the internet.
Some Twitter users point out that the problem of visiting children who are crying can be solved with the help of voice-reduction listeners.
They're kids. We used to be them.
"We need to learn tolerance because soon we will need maps of places to sit for breathing lips or drink," wrote user G Sunder.
Some of his Internet users noticed that he had been interrupted by crying children on the plane, but he changed his mind when he became a parent.
There is also a need for the solutions introduced by Japan Airlines.
"Thank you for warning me against screaming children during a 13-hour trip," wrote Rahat Ahmed.
Major number of losses after the bank office of Thomas Cook's trip
More than 25 thousand foreign tourists will not arrive in October at the event in May, as a result of the announcement made on Monday by the travel office of Thomas Cook.
As the independent representative of the Balearic government Marc Pons announced on Friday, among the 25,000 temporary residents who would not be able to benefit from the October event in Majorce, there were also persons who were to travel with the companies directly related to Thomas Cook, e.g. Neckermann.
Pons explained that 80 per cent of the expected temporary residents, who had to give up their stay in Majorca in the coming month, were German citizens and Scandinavian states.
However, as Pons says, due to the fact that Thomas Cook did not guide tourists on the Balearic Islands during November, losses for the local economy will be smaller.
He revealed that the Balearic government had already begun negotiations with international operators on "the entry into the market of Majorki" after the bankruptcy of the British operator.
The newspaper Diario de Mallorca estimates that in October, due to the tourist crisis in Majorca, more than 1,000 people lost their jobs.
About 800 are fired by Thomas Cook's office staff in Palmia.
The rest of the people are losing their jobs mainly in the hotel sector.
On Monday, along with the announcement of the collapse by Thomas Cook company in many major hotels, the owners of the property asked the guests to pay for the extra night fee.
This situation has been experienced by several hundred tourists from Poland.
The Balearic Council estimates that by Thursday, tens of thousands of hotels in Majorce had stopped their activities by the end of October in connection with the announcement of Thomas Cook's fall and his company's cooperation.
From the fifth round of the Diario de Ibiza newspaper shows that most of those working at Ibiza hotels working with the Thomas Cook group are not intended to close their seats in the next few weeks.
The newspaper recalls that the British bankrupt has cooperated with 42 hotels on this Balearic island.
The Balearic authorities announced that they would return to the Government of Spain to support the region’s amount of EUR 100 million to cover the loss caused by a banknote announcement by the travel office of Thomas Cook.
They found that the most damaged tourist archipelago, about 36,000 people, is located in Majorce.
According to the Balearic government, Thomas Cook is a local tourist company, mainly hotel operators, for the implementation of agreements for the July-September 2019 period of about EUR 5 million.

‘Rz’: The government has been defeated by Smog
"The effects of the Clean Air Programme are zero, and the carbon five will be as cold as if it were never anything," we read on the first page of this page of "Reszpospolitie".
For this time, 82 000 applications for a total of 2 billion evil were submitted under the Clean Air Programme, from which 48 thousand decisions were positive.
The applications received refer in sum to an amount of more than 915 million zł", says "Rz", referring to data from the Minister of the Environment.
As the paper points out, only part of the costs incurred is returned from the programme.
The results of the random programme are considered as "low".
Self-governments, quoted by "Rz", look at the "Clean Air", i.e. too much bureaucracy.
"The programme should be much simpler: electronic communication, e-mailing, possible performance control.
This would improve the operation," says the mayor of Lidzbark Warminński Jacek Wisniowski.
In the first year of action, the Polish Smog's activists also noted that less than 1 per cent of the target of exchange of 3 million broken bones was achieved in the first year of action.
As Rz notes, although the programme budget is 103 billion bad for 10 years, or 10 billion bad for a year, this amount is virtual.
"In the budget of the National Environment and the Water Economy, 1.4 billion evil has been reserved for this year," we read.
Congress agreed on F-35 for Poland
Bachelor: Now the price negotiations
The US Congress agreed to sell Poland 32 of the latest F-35 flights.
"This is one of the last steps before the conclusion of the contract, but not the end of our work," wrote Mariusz Bláščak on Twitter.
"We will be negotiating hard to achieve the most useful price," the Polish minister added.
Agreement on the Polish F-35
Poland's Air Force Force Force has a total of 32 F-35 Lighting II thoughts produced by the Lockheed Martin Group.
In September, the Department of State of the United States expressed its agreement on their sale to Poland.
The Communication stressed that investment supports national security and foreign policy by improving NATO's security, which is an important force for political stability in Europe.
According to information from the State Department, Poland is expected to pay $6.5 billion for thinkers.
But it's not the final price.
The Department of State has noted that the contract will also include supply of replacement and repair parts, training equipment, engineering, logistics and framework services and related elements of logistics support, programme and staff training.
Thinker Lockheed Martin F-35
The F-35 Lighting II thinker produced by the Group Lockheed Martin is a single-time and one-strengthened thinker of the fifth generation.
Samilot is capable of carrying out a mission of close support, bombings and typical mental tasks of air combat.
Thanks to the use of steelth thinking technology, it is undiscoverable for radars of close range.
A recent thinker F-35 bought Belgium under a contract worth $4.55 billion.
The Belgians want to replace the old F-16.
The purchase of American warplanes should also be considered by other US allies, including Finland, Switzerland and the United Arab Emirates.
Barbie against steroids.
_Other Organiser
Manufacturer Barbie placed a series of neutral sexes on the market.
He wants to fight stereotypes in this way.
Manufacturer Barbie placed on the market a series of neutral sexes
In addition to Barbie with different colors of skin, figure or hair, Mattel’s company has introduced neutral sex pills.
The "Creable World" series of games wears pears.
So children can decide whether their Barbie has short hair or long hair.
Their garden consists of both the floor and the kitchen.
A girl can become boys and vice versa in the blink of an eye.
They are also available in different colors of skin and with different clothing.
It has also been rejected by emphasising the characteristics of genders – general twins no longer have full mouth, long legs and long legs or, in the case of Kena, wide arms.
The company believes that children don't like their babies when they have abandoned sex standards, and some parents and feminists are convinced that toys made with the idea of a particular gender are ambiguing girls' ambitions and strengthening traditional stereotypes.
"The new kids will let all children feel free," says Mattel.
Lalka Barbie, who appeared on the market in 1959 in a high-speed hairdressing machine and boots, was repeatedly criticized for promoting “unblemished women steroids, ” such as non-natural proportions of the body.
The group has responded to criticism and has already placed on the market sheets of different colors of skin, as well as more round shapes.
There's also been lightning in the sky.
Zandberg: The circle or club Together can have several jobs
Zandberg, asked in ZET radio , his party can get to Seyma from the list of left-wing groups (KW SLD whose list starts candidates to Seyma SLD, Wiosny and Lewice Together, starting with the common logo "Lewica"), replied that this depends on the results of the Committee.
"I believe that Levicy's outcome will be very good, because we feel that people are bound by the hope that Levica has not only the right thing but also the power," he said.
According to Zandberg, the left may have 60 to 80 jobs.
“This may mean that the circle or club together will have a number of jobs.
But it depends on Poles and Poles.
I'm not going to talk about it and tell you how it's gonna happen," he said.
Asked whether Lewica will have a separate circle, Zandberg replied: “We are promised that we are different, and we will not be convinced that this diversity does not exist.
I think this diversity of Poland has been rewarded because we have shown that we have been able to agree on a common programme."
The question is whether the greatest beneficiary of the joint venture is the leader of SLD Vladzimirz Czarzasti, Zandberg replied that his view is that the largest beneficiaries are centralist and left-wing.
In view of the fact that this SLD will get the full subsidisation, he said that "the political party's aim is to represent its voters".
Zandberg admitted that in the elections to Seymmu, he was voting for himself.
In the case of the elections to the Senate, he said he was thinking.
"The offer is different and in this offer there are candidates and candidates who are closer to my heart, but there are also those to which my heart continues," he said.
"I will say, however, very frankly and clearly that if I were to find myself in line No. 44 senate, I would take the election certificate and vote elsewhere," the policy stressed.
"I don't think I would have tried to vote with Minister Kazimierz Vaszvodska (KO-PAP candidate)," he added.
In this area outside the Roadway, RP Mayor Pavel Kasprazak and Marek Rudnikki from PiS are starting.
Dakar: Open up the largest game in West Africa
Tens of thousands of people from all over Senegal gathered on Friday at the capital for the opening of a large game, considered the largest in West Africa.
The Muslims arrived by bus, car and track to the Bopp district, where there was a new game that could accommodate 30 thousand believers.
The facility was built by Brother Mouride, who belongs to the Sufi-Nurt of Islam, who rules in Senegal.
Work on the project began ten years ago in the sub-area of the area of six hectares of land distributed by the government.
The name of the game Massalikul Jinan ( "Royal Roads") comes from the title of the version of Ahmado Bamba Mbacke, the 19th-century brother-in-law named by the confessors as holy.
The match is equipped with a career marble and has five mines.
It's 78 meters high.
A match in the middle of a room of 15,000 faithful, and the other may be on the outside floor.
In the rich interiors you can admire the decorated dome, the giant dining halls and decorations made by workers from Morocco.
Buildingists say that the game is the largest in West Africa, but there is no comparison between the games in other regions.
In Morocco the game of Hassana II in Casablance can accommodate 105 thousand faithful.
The building project, which cost more than EUR 30 million, was financed by private grants.
In addition to the land, the Court has established lighting, sanitation and has financed road jobs of EUR 10.5 million.
Trainer Brake: Our problem is not Slösk, only us
Eight legal matches without the victory of the Corona Pillars are trying to break up at a fifth meeting with the Swedish extraclasses.
"It's not our problem of turning back, only ourselves, we have to work on what we play," stressed the trainer Mirosław Smyła.
The crowns last and this time the only victory in the people were noted in the first row when 1:0 binamin of Raków used to play.
Later they recorded two remixes and six victories, and on Tuesday they won 0:1 with the Lubin Deep in 1/32 Puchar Polski final.
"I am impressed by the fact that in the last seconds of the soccer game, they've been fighting on their shoulders, they've been trying to reassemble.
Their fall on the wall after the last storm did not result from destruction; it was only a fall of evil, because they were so close," said the Voice.
As he noted, Switzerland has a very strong cross-section, so it will be a team on the side of the forest sectors.
"We have awareness of the quality of the opponent, but we also look at what we want to play," said the trainer.
In the 5th game in Koron, there is no doubt that the gold cards of Ognjen Gnjatic are overhauling, including Jacob Zubrovski and Michael Gardawski.
Rather, it is a message from a few players who want to play.
"We have a headache, it has recently seemed that he won't be, and now it is," said the Voice.
Colonel Daniel Dwniel stressed that Slovakia will not be an easy rival to break the eight legal battles of a series without victory, but in the extraclasses everyone can win with each other.
“We are a good team.
In the last few weeks we may not show it in the woods, but the moment will come when we will win and we will believe it will be Friday," said the archer.
After nine extra-classes of Korona with five points, point 15 shall be taken.
He gathered about 12 more. He's on the other side.
The fifth game in Kielcach will start at 20.30.
These trees can completely disappear from Europe
"42% of species of trees belonging to the European forest are threatened", the International Union of Nature Protection (IUCN) alert, published on Friday, "The European Green Paper".
There are also castaneous and jarzabin on the sides of the list.
The IUCN, an organisation based in Gland, Switzerland, publishes a list of endangered European species for the first time.
It has been developed by experts who, on the basis of research, have proposed that 42% of the 454 species of trees in Europe (and in other parts of the world) are "high-risk".
Among the causes of the Red Paper is the rapid growth of urban agglomeration and global climate change.
However, the most dangerous are the trees and the blood that occur only or mainly on our continent.
In the case of a typical European tree, it is estimated that 58 per cent of IUCN species are threatened and 15 per cent of 66 species of trees and blood are at risk of extinction.
Among the main causes of deforestation is the Red Paper exchange of errors in the exploitation of wood, rapid urbanization, too intense wood cuts, and further forest fires and changes in the European ecosystem.
According to the authors of the report, there is also a strong threat to the existence of many European blood, mice and crops.
"The follow-up of human activities leads to a gradual decline in European plant species and creates a risk of the disappearance of important and unappropriate alternatives that are the basis of European ecosystems and have an impact on the health of our planet," recalled the report by Luc Bas, which is headed by the European IUCN Office.
Grzegorz Schetina: I don't promise 600+
"Today, Pis wants to buy Poles, offering them the freedom of extension to credit, which will have to be paid for future generations," says Grzegorz Schetyn in a report for "Rzeczpospolitaj".
He thinks the whole Pis policy is pizza.
At the same time, policy promises that "what is given will not be banned".
Shetina, in her conversation with Jack Nizhinkiwicz, makes sure he has an idea of breaking the Law and Justice.
It's about the mobilisation of the electoral uranium.
In his view, the opposition has a greater potential in this area than the Kaccinian party.
"Today people who know who want to live in a normal state are more than PiS licensees, a party that has turned against popular values, such as humility, modesty, transparency," says Schetyn.
The Head of the Civil Coalition and the President of the Civil Platform have also highlighted the basic principles of the KO's electoral programme.
"Firstly, no data will be collected, but there is a need for a future guide because PiS is only about the situation here and now, there is no plan for Poland to see after dramatic low investments," he said.
Secondly, it is "the energy consumption of Poles, aid and investment in those who work hard - and those who are entrepreneurs".
Shetina explains that the KO programme included a project that at least cost Poland more than 614 gold on hand and more expensive – even after several decades.
The policy has also indicated that he does not want to go further.
As he said, do as much as he can, but don't promise 600+.
"I will never allow a Greek variant where the rulers have applied themselves to the long term until the financial country finally falls apart," he stressed.
The report for "Rz" also stated that Jarosław Kačinski and Mateusz Morawecki were afraid to debate with him and Malgorzat Kidad-Blonski.
"We would try their hypocrisy and propaganda," he said.
"The foot steps before the fall.
Kachinski is a man like Banas is Christian," he added.
Leader PO also said he hasn't decided whether he'll be asked to take the platform.
Argentina: Six Dead Condors of Great Britain · Global Voices
In the Argentine province of Santa Cruz, six large condors were found – informs TVN24.
Experts believe that human activity has contributed to their deaths.
Large condors are likely to have been opened up by means of a means to kill predators such as bees, leaves, or wild dogs.
Animals could eat a toxic trap.
In addition to one young person, the rest of the dead condors were grown.
"This is a great loss for the environment as the condor must reach 10-15 years to be fruitful and able to expand.
So we're losing a protected cat, a endangered cat," says Luis Jacome, Director of BioAndina Foundation, an Argentine environmental protection organization.
“I think that the use of toxic and toxic substances not only affects this species at risk, but all other forms of life, including human health,” he adds.
'Rz': They want to swear to the President
They've been working on the recognition of the head of the state of the drug chain.
The idea is supported by Chancellor Andrzey Dudy – we read in "Rzeczpospolitaj".
As a translator of the newspaper, it is about the gold chain of the Order of the White Orlés, the royal insignia officially known during the Middle Ages.
The last time he used it was probably President Ignacy Mousticki.
"Rz" says that soon such chains can be found on Andrey Dudy's shoulder.
The Senate of the Commission on Human Rights, the Rules of Procedure and the Petitions voted in the middle of a proposal to work on the renewal of the Law on Orders and Remarks to restore it.
The newspaper says it's not the first attempt to return this chain of states.
The Senate has already proposed such an amendment in 1992, but it has passed by one vote.
This time, the work's blushing.
At the beginning of August, the senators devoted a few minutes to this matter, acknowledging that they were in charge of the President's Office's opinion.
This one came in half a week.
"I inform you that the Chancellor of the RP President does not take note of the position presented in this request," wrote President Andrzej Dera.
In the middle of the case, the Senate continued and once again devoted little time to the matter.
"The Chancellor of the President answered us briefly: it's for us to return it," said Commissioner Robert Mamutov of PIS quoted by "Rz".
He submitted a proposal for legislative work supported by the Commission.
Police will teach drivers how to drive by crossing
The police action will be carried out at the crossing of the Cieplinski al. Piłsudski.
Munduran activities have a number of links with recent complaints by city authorities to managers who are not always able to deal appropriately with crossings.
On Friday, 27 September, the police will launch a “Pride Crossing” preventive action in the Russian Federation.
It is about eliminating current difficulties: crossings without driving ability, not being applied to light signals or road signs.
"We often think we're on our own to cross, and we're really trying the lives of other leaders," said Marek Ustrobinski, Vice-President of the city a few days ago.
His words were echoed at a press conference in which the city authorities presented examples of the inappropriate movement of cars after crossings, which, in effect, created a course.
At the time, the President appealed to passengers on the road, including faster movement on the lights or non-recording of text messages during the course of the train.
The issue has been taken up by the police officers who have since launched the "Precise cross-section" campaign.
What's going on?
The aim of the action is to eliminate the phenomenon of the limitation of traffic over crossings by drivers travelling on the road without the ability to continue.
This is often an exhalation that contributes to the swelling of the muscles and the formation of the joints.
It is threatened by a mandate of 300 zl and 2 points of grain.
In addition, global attention will be paid to the lack of use of light signals or road signs and incorrect parking in the crossing area.
There will also be a lack of traffic flow, late movement under signals, free passage of crossings and too much distance between vehicles.
What crossings will take place?
M.in on the ul. Lisa-Kuli on the ul. Jajellonńska; al. Cieplinski on the al. Piłsudski; ul. Targowe on the ol. Pilsudski; Place of Şreniawit on the ul. Döbrowski or ul. Hemanski on the ul.
This type of action in the Subcarpathian capital will be carried out on the following Friday of October.
They controlled the waste disposal company from "Czejki"
"The officials of the Division for the Protection of the Environment of the Volominian Environment and the Construction Inspectorate checked on Friday's installation in the Zielonka Gmine, where wastes from the clean streets of "Czajka" in Warsaw are being exhausted," told the director of the Volominian Karol Szyszko.
Inspectors of the Volominian Age carried out checks at the plant in the lakes belonging to the Zelenka tribe.
The Dar-Trans Private Trade and Transport Agency, under the Agreement with the Czejka-based Cleaning Walls, is carrying out the management services of plastic waste.
"The maintenance of the installation has been approved and the company has also been asked to provide documentation relating to its activities," Szyško said.
He added that the audit report would be submitted to the Military Environment Inspectorate in Warsaw.
The last control in Dar-Transe was carried out by the Defence Inspectorate of the Environment in Warsaw from 29 December 2015 to 11 February 2016.
However, it was found that the company did not carry out sampling, measurements and groundwater studies, nor did it have the results of the studies of established municipal railway stations from the clean streets of "Czejka".
After the control of WIOS, Darius Sobota was invited to stop the breach of the terms of the decision.
The DAR-TRANS private transport firm Dariusz Sobota is one of the companies that collect waste in the form of fixed municipal railway stations with the cleaning of "Czejka".
According to the decision on waste disposal in the manufacturing field, wastes of up to 60,000 tonnes are processed annually in the cereals range.
The Warsaw City Water and sewerage Company announced on Thursday, November and December 2018 that the operation had been turned off by STUOS, which was related to damage to one of the fuel equipment.
According to MPWiK, their monthly export costs are 1.7 million gross (based on export costs from 01.01.2019 to 31.08.2019).
Lech Valėsa supported Malgorzat Kidad-Blonsk.
"You have taken up a difficult task, you can count on my full support," said Lech Wałęsa to the Kidaw-Blonski Małgorzat on Friday.
"Mr. President, this is very important to me," said the candidate for the Civil Coalition of the Prime Minister, the leader of the KO list in Warsaw.
The President stressed that when it comes to the situation in Poland, it's now "only a bit of an exit."
Malgorzata Kidawa-Blonska met with former President Lechem Valās in his office at the Gdańsk European Solidarity Centre.
In a short conversation behind closed doors, the son of Valęsy, Jarosław, also participated.
"You have a difficult task," he said after the Lech Wałęs meeting.

very important words
Kidawa-Blonska thanked you for your support.
"Mr President, this is very important to me because no one like you can speak about freedom, the constitution and know what it is important," she said.
"Let us show that we can make another wise policy together, but in accordance with the Constitution, in accordance with law, according to respect for others.
You did this your revolution, and we want to change Poland," Kidawa-Blońska stressed.
Cubic and Emeryturus
He said in his interview with the journalists that he is now "only a bit of an emeritus."
"Of course I look at it.
I hope we're going back to the event, we're going back to what was good, checked.
The third part of the power is the most important, the Constitution is the most important, the courts are necessary.
And that's all we need to clean up, that's all we have to do back to normal action, and I believe we're doing this together.
Because if not, it's waiting for us street criteria," Lech Wałęs said.
"It is therefore so important for the Polish people to go to the elections, stop and decide on their own.
And that's the most important thing," said Kidawa-Blońska.
"The last chance we'll fix the map's situation in Poland," the president replied.
"We must build on a new foundation"
The question of the most important changes for her in Poland, Kidawa-Blonska, said: “The President has said very well.
We have to build a new foundation on which we can do all the other things.
Since there is no third-party authority, since the constitution is not respected, we must return to the beginning and bring it to light and everyone knows that Poland will not move or step forward."

The Senate has decided on key laws
The Senate adopted, without amendment, the law on the disclosure of the property of the most important public officials and the fleet of the most important persons in the country.
After the renewal of the law on the property of state officials, 52 senators were voted, 14 were against, and three abstained from voting.
Similarly, the senators decided to reject 12 amendments submitted during the environmental debate by Senator PO Slavomir Rybicki.
According to the amendments, the law had to ‘inciliate’ and limit the scope of the information provided in the declaration on the situation of own children, married children and children eligible for cases in which children remain in the home economy with the person obliged to submit the statement.

According to the relationship between the people involved, the teacher of the teachers of the world was undernourished.
As assistant assistant to Heynna Michał Mieszko Gogol, this, together with the main task, was not the same as training of networking elements.
“We went to the hall, but in most cases it was time for the team.
It was about spending more time with him than training him.
Talk, imagine how to build it all up as a team," he said.
He confirmed that the semi-final defeat was a painful lesson for both professionals and training staff.
"We have been brutally taken to the ground.
Without two reasons, we're disappointed.
We still believed we were going back to this game.
We talked about this game between ourselves at the station, and the coach talked to the professionals.
As two main reasons for defeat, I would show ineffectiveness in the attack and much worse than the usual encounter with the situational bullets.
The words were much better in this respect than we are," he analyzed.
In his view, the "White-Red" obstacle was not an obstacle to the event against the voice-supported and numerous publicity of the tournament's co-economics.
He admitted that the masters of the world could have done something to calm down the cold road to the semifinal.
“Maybe if we had won a victory in a similar style during the group phase, we would have been able to reanalyze this lesson sooner and later we would have played in the next stage of the tournament.
But it's just a joke," he said.
Gogol hopes that the evil associated with the 4th battle of Poland will be able to turn into aggression in the race.
"I hope we will show our real faces at the same time.
It's about what to do.
Last ME medal we fought in 2011,," he recalled.
Paris is the fifth city, and France is the third country visited by the Poles during these exercises.
During the group phase, they took advantage of Rotterdam and Amsterdam, and at the first two meetings of the group phase, they moved to Apeldhorn and then to the semifinal to Lublan.
Nick Kyrgios: severe, but in suspension
The Australian tennis player received a 16-week start order and a fine of $25,000 – in half-year suspension – for the words, gestures and actions during the last ATP tournaments.
The ATP World Tour workers are losing their patience with Kyrgyzstan, but they still give him an opportunity to improve.
A summary of the results of the most undisclosed professional tennisists in recent years appears to be dangerous – 16 weeks of interruption plus a serious dispute, but both of them are suspended for half a year – a period of trial during which the sport will be able to recover.
Nick Kyrgyos is only 24 years old, but he's been working for a long time and has been doing his tennis record – he has had to pay the highest in the history of discipline a single financial penalty for breaking the rules of conduct on and off the court.
Prominent curses, strange gestures, non-portable behaviour, court-martial and visual assaults, two crackdowns during a lost game with Karen Chaczanowe – for all of this after the ATP Masters 1000 series in Cincinnati paid 113 thousand dollars.
In the US Open 2019, he also played not long, but he was able to state publicly that ATP activists were "stupid", which affected the organisation's authorities so much that they carried out a disciplinary investigation against Kyrgyzstan and, after a few weeks, gave the above-mentioned speech about the suspension of the start and the next crime.
However, after hearing the accused and knowing the context of the statement, he was forgiven.
However, it was argued that the investigation showed that Kyrgyos' behaviour over a period of 12 months has in many cases raised serious objections and has been a rather persistent violation of the principle that he has been acting in a Bulgarian manner with respect to tournaments and visas, from which there is a high penalty.
However, ATP has given him five days to file an appeal and has since dismissed the execution, ordering him to comply with the conditions for the next six months: ATP Tour and ATP Challenge Tour Kyrdios can no longer violate the rules of the Code of Conduct of the current professional service providers, in particular, can no longer pass, destroy the rocket, break down with the courts and the public, nor any other way of acting unprovoked and wulgarly.
He also received the recommendation to seek "long support" from mental trainers during the tournaments and to consult with people who are specialized in resolving the problems of athletes who do not have the right attitude.
The first comment (in social media) by Nick Kyrgios was: “Hey, everybody, I can still play.
I just have to control my behavior, that's all."
In practice, the Australian will have at least two-week break, since in Puchare Lavera he had to quit from the nearest beginnings in Beijing (September 30th – October 6th) and Shanghai (6th – 13th October).
At the ATP Kyrgyos station, ATP is taking 27 seats.
In this year he won two tournaments – in Washington and Acapulco, he earned over $1.3 million, so even after his sins he will stay a lot.
GUS: In Poland, life is getting better
From the GUS's report on households' budgets published on Friday, it appears that their material situation has been assessed by up to 44 per cent of them as a good or better.
A year earlier, the percentage had been 37.2 per cent, in 2016 33.5 per cent, and since 2009, when the statistical authorities first examined the subjective assessment of the situation of households, it had never exceeded 30 per cent.
Its material situation was considered to be poor or even worse than its material situation, including 8.1 per cent of households, compared to 11.2 per cent of the previous year and more than 20 per cent in 2009.
The best is the material economy of domestic workers working on their own account.
In this group, 70 per cent of respondents consider it to be good or better.
On the other side, households of pensioners have a rate of only 18 per cent of such responses.
The objective assessment of the material economy situation also has a major impact on the number of children.
The worst thing is for parents to know themselves as a growing generation, of which 32% declare the material situation to be good or better.
Between 55 and 60 per cent of children, this rate is increased by 48.8 per cent, depending on the number of children.
In these statistics, the effect of the 500+ programme is clearly visible.
Before it was launched (in 2016), the most serious material situation was assessed by the single parent and multi-day families (with at least three children).
Improving the subjective assessment of the material situation in Poland is a rapid increase in income, mainly from work.
However, this is not all because the percentage of households that consider their situation to be good increases faster than actual income.
Moreover, there is no clear dependence on the level of income and the assessment of the conditions of the household's material economy on the level of leadership.
The best estimates are made by the inhabitants of the Opolian leadership, where their situation is considered to be 48.9% of the researchers.
There are also Lubuska leaders (47.7 per cent), Słāškian (47.6 per cent), Mazowiki (47.3 per cent) and West-West Sea (47.1 per cent).
At the same time, in Opolski, the regular income (i.e. after payment of taxes and deposits) was 94% of the national average and 98% of the Luxembourg average.
The highest income was based on the inhabitants of Mazowice (120 per cent of the national average) and Dutch (104 per cent).
On the average, in Poland, the regulatory income per person in 2018 was EUR 1693.
In real terms (as adjusted by price change) it increased by 4.3% by 2017.
In the last few years, it's pretty low.
In 2016, income rose by 7% and by 6.3% later this year.
While the increase in income is free, it also limits the increase in expenditure.
These figures were based on the figure of 1187 gross, which means that the actual decrease was 0.7 per cent.
This is the first case since 2013.
In 2017 expenditure per person actually increased by 1.9 per cent and 4.3 per cent in 2016.
Household budget surveys suggest that the household's statistical economy currently accounts for 70.1% of its regular income, while the share increased by 80% in 2014 and increased by 90% by 2006.

U.S.: Three suicides between the airport
Three sailors committed suicide last week on the U.S. George H. W. Bush scene, informing the American war mariner.
In the last two years, five members of this ship have been killed in total.
The previous suicide took place in July of this year and earlier in November 2017.
According to CNN, all three sailors were shot last week.
Each of these events occurred on the ground when USS George H. W. Bush landed on the coast of Virginia.
Since then, participation of third parties has been excluded.
In addition, deaths should not be connected with each other.
"It is necessary for all to take part in the presentation of suggestions and ideas to prevent further suicide.
I would like to stress that there is no stigma or other impact on the search for help," wrote Captain Sean Bailey of the ship.
Non-violent criticism of paper.
John Paul II did nothing
In his conversation with Peter Lekszyki Stefan Niesilovski, John Paul II stressed that in 1981 he was a great authority for opposition.
"In fact, every opinion was accepted."
Later, some of his actions were criticized.
“For me, that John Paul II was unable to reverse the harmful activities of Rydzyk, he is very grateful for his pontification.
After all, this redemptor – the author of the Church and Poland – developed his media in the best possible way for the life of Pope Polaka," he explained.
There was a PO policy: “There were clouds of discontent, the pope said something that had never been accepted by the Rydzyk, but he had power and could simply throw him out of the church or send him to New Caledonia or Fiji to collect money for the poor.
However, John Paul II did not do this, like his followers," Nessilovski explained.
"In addition, this fatal case of pedophile and the activities of the Church, and their lack of it, has resulted.
I got a little out of my mind before, but I wanted to draw his attention to the whole structure of his life.
We know about the scale of pedophile in the Church since relatively recently.
A question arises as to how it is possible that John Paul II, the head of the Church, did not know about these disgusting things," says the newspaper Niesilovski.
In an evaluation of the previous PO policy, the Polish Church is a PiS associate.
“It must be acknowledged that during the Church’s Solidarity, the Church was our most important associate.
All the graces began from the sacred moons, all over the sky.
Now these cross are written, they have become symbols of dictatorship – a sign of the written regime.
I repeat: one of the most unpleasant surprises is that people like Rydzyk are the three Polish churches that John Paul II has done nothing about this and that today the Church is the associate of Pis.
It's a black section of the Polish Church that will come to pay him tribute," Niesilovski convinced.
"I hope that Pope Francis will take over the Jewish, Rydzyk and a few others," he added.
HRUBIEZO: The morning of 590-year-old business
It'll be a lot of concerts and litigation.
The Jubilius Gala will take place at the Hrubieszvsky Cultural House.
First of all, at 10 a.m. in the churches of St.
The official opening will take place at 11.30 p.m. in HDK.
There's a band of songs and dances in the country of Croatia.
Young people from ILO. Stanisława Staszica presents a show at the “Powiet Grubeszowski: From my family – here I live”.
Next, medals will be awarded "Sustained for the Croatian Message".
At 4:00 a.m. the party will be transferred to a local reception where the "Hrubies charity for Angeliki Zinkiewicz" concerts will be held.
They play a team of disco pole – NoLimit, Malibu, Energy Girls and the stars of the Mig night.
There will be litigation, including pears and percentages of the President of the Council of Ministers.
PZPN sleeps for the fences on the stadiums.
Deployed grip
The beginning of Puchar Poland between the Wejherovo and Lechi Gdańsk Gdańsk Griffem on small hair did not end tragically when the Vejher race was fired by the Weyher race of millimetres by the opposing team's banner, Zlatana Alomerovicia.
After this incident, the game was stopped for 20 minutes.
This case was investigated by the PZPN Commission, with the result that Grif was severely punished, excluding it from future fires.
The club will not be able to start in Puchar Polski in the 2020/2021 season.
Additional chips will not be placed in the nearest match at their own stage.
They won't be able to go to the leagues by 31 December either.
The castles at the stadium of Videva Lód were also known as Žláska Wrocław.
However, it was easier here for the PZPN because it had predicted that it could come to similar events and had trained the relevant bodies in this regard.
In addition, services have allowed for the rejection of the shipbuilding sector by race, the burning of rails and the enforcement of the economic sector.
The game was stopped for eight minutes, and the Interpol had to use the water guns.
The PZPN banned Slašk’s single-time stadium ban in the nearest match in Puchara Polski and prohibited the organisation of tickets to the games in this and further PP.
It also included extra-class legal games, but it will take place until 31 December.
Names of foreign cities on road signs also post-police
GDPKIA is planning to change the mark on the entire managed road network by the end of 2020.
GDKIA Streets
The Subcarpath launched the renewal of the Ministry of Infrastructure Regulation, including the registration of foreign cities on road signs and post-police.
For example, "Lwow" appears next to "L'viv".
Our guide will include 94 road signs set at A4 and national roads: DK19, DK94.
As we hear it, it's gonna be easier, easier and easier.
The new guidelines result from the renewal of the Minister of Infrastructure Regulation on specific technical conditions for road signs and signals and road safety equipment.
"We should remember that local names in neighbouring countries are often also Polish.
Thanks to our change, they will soon appear on the roads along our roads.
The introduction of a new sign will start from the subcarpath of the A4 highway," Minister of Infrastructure Andrzej Adamczyk reported.
The amendments will include 94 road signs set at A4 and national roads: DK19, DK94.
Total investment cost?
200 thousand bad.
In the first instance, a new sign will be introduced on A4 road, which is scheduled for 1 November 2019.
How should the realization of the idea look?
It'll be eaten without changing the table, on the basis of the bottle.
They will now be replaced by the names of the new localities written in Polish on existing characters.
Both names will be written in one version – first after Polish and then in the original, in the context.
This will be a great relief for people who do not know the official names of foreign cities in the country in which they are located.

Someone shot the windshields.
In the state of Germany in the Netherlands, residents noticed a lack of problems with crossings.
After rehearsing and visiting the veterinarian, it became evident that someone had developed an animal from the target – in his body was a ventriloquist.
"The information about an early bird has been received from all residents of the Rehabilitation Centre of the Wild Animals in New Soli.
The report showed that the animal had broken ribs.
We made it to the place.
It's been a while since I saw something very wrong with him.
We acted quickly and accurately to avoid hurting him and to treat additional stress.
The lion has been kidnapped and confined to the veterinarian.
After the first photo of the RTG, it was already reported that someone made himself a shooting target with him.
In his body there were cracks," says Marcin Balakasek, president of Malpol’s management company, including the rehabilitation center.
It takes place in the centre
"The wounds have been cleaned, the birds have been given antibiotics, access to water, a safe place in the center where the whole winter is spent.
We're trying to strengthen him.
He's not even able to fly.
The release of it would now be linked to the fact that it would probably not survive the winter," Balakasek adds.
After the lack of rehabilitation, the staff intends to release him to the station in the same state.
The authorities of the Zukowice tribe, after receiving information on the cause of the animal health condition, intend to inform the prosecutor.
It's been in the castle before it happened.
Gowin: "We must encourage Polish, small trade"
"The effective taxation of hypermarkets does not solve the problem of retail trade, it will be necessary to consider whether you have any instruments to encourage Polish trade," said the Deputy Prime Minister, Head of the Jarosław Gowin Agreement on Friday.
Gowin, during his talk at the "Signs of Days" on Radio Unit, said that trade is underway by international networks that offer Polish producers such low-martials that Polish companies can't actually develop.
Given that it was very difficult to fight this problem, the Vice-President recalled that the PIS government was trying to focus on the very beginning of its term of office, but he got "opposite by the EC".
"We have won the justice court, and I hope that if the United Nations wins the closest elections and forms a government, we will return to it," he said.
At the same time, he noted that "the effective taxation of hypermarkets does not solve the problem of Poland and therefore trade".
"It is therefore necessary to consider whether the government has any instruments to encourage Polish trade," Gowin said.
In May the EU's Court found that the European Commission had made a mistake by acknowledging that the Polish tax on retail sales is not allowed by public aid.
The retail tax law provided for the introduction of two rates of trade: 0.8 per cent from income between 17 million and 170 million per month and 1.4 per cent from income over 170 million per month.
The tax should have been valid since September 2016.
In September 2016 the EC initiated a procedure for infringement of Union law by Poland.
Brussels then argued that the construction of the tax could favour less conclusions, which could be recognised as public aid.
She then claimed that Danina was put into force in a way that was incompatible with the law.
It also issued an order to suspend the application of the tax until the end of its analysis by officials in Brussels.
Poland did not agree with this position, but the tax collection was suspended.
The decision of the EU Court of Justice opened the way for the reintroduction of the tax, but it did not end the case.
On 24 July the Commission lodged an appeal in the Court of Justice.
In the fourth quarter of the TEU's Press Service, PAP informed PAP that the case is currently at a written stage where both the European Commission and the Polish Government are presenting their arguments in writing.
At the moment, we do not know whether or not the procedure is open, i.e. listening to the side and any reports.
It takes good time for a couple of months to make a call to report the result.
"This procedure takes four medium years," said the PAP source in the Court of Justice in Luxembourg.
How to get a baby to get baptized?
We consider a few practical solutions
Baptism is a vital step in the life of an unborn child and his parents.
Often it is the first time a child gathers around the family, celebrating its appearance in the world together.
It's no wonder, then, that the freshly secured moms and dad want their rest to look like the best that day.
Before you make a final decision about what to do with your child's machine, however, ask yourself if it's going to be okay.
I can find a lot of machines that do not provide a little comfort.
So, what should we pay attention to?
The child’s age is the primary criterion for choosing the right person to get baptized
A few weeks ago, young ones were baptized, equipped in white sets and put into the same beaks or large air.
Today, children who join the sacrament are often older: monthly, year-old, and even older.
You don't have to think that such a lot of rest is gonna need something else to get baptized.
So if your child on the day of baptism is between 3 and 4 months of age, be sure to stay in the car or at the hands of your parents or Christian parents.
The best way out is to make it comfortable, colorful or complete.
Although this custody element is recognized as a daily store, it is sufficient to look for its excellent options, such as a falbank or crown.
For a boy it's perfect to show points with pressure on the male and the female.
In the case of older children, you can allow yourself to have a bigger fantasy in the bar.
A girl will look like a simple, thin dress.
Many of the girls’ parents with a lack of respect look at the rich, falsified dressers on baptism in addition to their clothes, shoes and shoes.
Unfortunately, a large number of producers use artificial non-explosive materials in which the child is simply uncomfortable.
The search for adequate protection will better look at Asanti for Kids, which offers elegant machines on colorful carpets.
Delicate, dusty skirts, satin clothes, crowns, applications and handy complete will make your daughter look beautiful and feel comfortable.
Ideal roof for a small gentleman: cotton Garniture
More recently, among boys' parents, she was wearing fashions on the garages with a copy of the "adult" model.
Polyester mariners and lingerie, stylists or caskets often caused young elegancers to express their discontent in a loud voice.
Happily today, they have been released by fine, colorful completes.
Just look at the sets available in Asanti for Kids, i.e. soft, wet clothes, and to this flower is made from the front of the sample of the camel.
These machines look very great, and they don't at the same time corrupt the movement of the world of babies.
Christina Paulovic published a rich statement
Christina Paulovic made a rich statement at the end of her term.
The result is that the PIS messenger gathered 110 thousand evil fortunes.
Let's remember that Paulovic told us to leave politics.
At the end of the term, it has an amount of 110 thousand ol.
As a result of a statement made by the messenger, it will receive an monthly amount of 4.7 thousand grams.
The city has a dwelling of 570 thousand evils and something smaller that he hires by collecting 880 evils a month.
It also invests in industrial metals, estimating the investment of 150 000 zl.
Earlier the property statement also published Jarosław Kacinński.
Voting over the suspension at the Conference of the Conservative Party
The British parliamentarians voted against a three-day break in the Gmin elections at the annual programme conference of the Conservative Party, on which the government had been talking.
There were 289 of the apostles, compared with 306.
Izba Gmin usually does not hold meetings during the party meetings so that the delegates do not have to cancel any part of them, nor do they attend Parliament's meetings.
However, the opposition parties felt that Parliament should not interrupt the work during the crucial time that was planned for the last week on 31 October when the Great Britain came out of the European Union.
At the request of the government, 289 letters were filed against 306.
Two opposition parties already after conventions
No agreement may be taken as a political objection to Prime Minister Borisie Johnson for his decision to suspend Parliament for five weeks (the Supreme Court has been recognized by the Supreme Court on the second day of the decision by the Supreme Court of the Law and the State of the Non-Self-Governing Party) and that the Court does not wish to apply for it after the decision of the Court.
After this decision, Izba Gmin resumed the session in the middle of the session, and the most important event of the day was the event of Johnson and the next round of debate.
Johnson fired opposition to blocking Brexit and avoiding pre-term elections.
"It is time to realize Brexit.
It needs to be realized in order to achieve the outcome of the referendum.
Brexit has to hope that we will be able to deal with the citizens' priorities, the health service, the cost of living.
Brexit needs to be realized so we can unite this country," Johnson said.
The Conference of the Conservative Party is scheduled to begin in Manchester next Sunday and to be held on Wednesday 2 October.
The Conferences of the two main opposition groups – the Labour Party and the Liberal Democrats – have already been held.
One of the reasons Johnson gave for this long suspension of Parliament was that it was a party conference.
Media: Andrzej Duda blames Israel for anti-Semitic attacks in Poland
"The President Andrzey Duda believes that anti-Semitic attacks in Poland are a response to the Israeli leadership's anti-political rhetoric," writes the foreign media.
The vice-president of the President has certainly deploreed these contributions.
"It's just not true," he wrote on Twitter by Blažej Spychalski.
The Israeli media, including Haaretz and Jerusalem Post, refer to the Jewish Insider, writes that Andrzej Duda, during a meeting with the representatives of the Jewish diaspora in the RP Consulate in New York, stated that Israel is responsible for recent anti-Semitic attacks in Poland.
The President said that the rise in anti-Semitic attacks in Poland is a response to the Israeli leadership's anti-political rhetoric.
He referred to Israel's Foreign Minister Katz, who stated in prayer that "Police send anti-Semitism with breast milk".
Andrey Duda said he is sorry that Israel has not asked for the misleading statements of its policies.
He also mentioned an act of aggression against Ambassador Polski in Israel by Mark Magierowski.
In May he was attacked by an attacker who called him "Polak, Polak".
“The city is not only incorrect.
It's just not true," he wrote on Twitter.
He stressed that Duda "never said that Israel is responsible for the latest anti-Semitic attacks in Poland".
The Spychalski portal seems to have "invented it."
According to the "JI" speakers at the meeting, there was also a dispute between the Holocaust oval, designated by RP Commander Commander Edward Mosberg and Rabbi Shmuley Boteach.
Mosberg had to agree with President Dudy's words and say that the Jews in Israel are responsible for the growth of anti-Semitism.
According to the source of the Botech portal, he had to stop Mosberg's speech.
Who's Banas, and what's he doing?
The stone holders hired the journalist to discover the damages in Marian Banasia's property statements.
We're going to sum up another case that has been brought to the attention of the governing body.
The "Superviser" TVN reporters revealed that Marian Banas, President of the Supreme Court of Control, has not written in recent years a statement of a 400-metre-a-metre property mine located in the Kraków Podgorz.
More than that, his employer had to run in the aforementioned six-size stone (and then rent rooms per hour).
The building itself has been said since 2016 to ensure the payment of credit.
Bertold Kittel drew attention to the injustice in the Superviser program.
The journalist revealed that from Banasia people had rented a stone with a criminal world to use it as a place of "erotic meetings".
The customers were supposed to be men who used prostitution services.
Banas responded inconsistency and stupidity.
Interestingly, purchased by stone keepers led the journalist to discover failures in Banasian real estate statements.
The stone itself was described in detail, and the income from the rent was to be reduced.
“The property of Mariana Banasia and his wife may be from 6 to 8 million bad.
In sum, couples can praise two houses, three apartments, savings[...]", writes Money.pl.
And as a result of the portal analysis, the very stone of Banasia's value was already about 3 million bad.
The Central Anti-Corruption Bureau is currently conducting control of Mariana Banasia's property statements for the years 2015-2019.
Banas said she would stop her work at NIK until the end of her life. "I'm going to come to you for a free ride," he said.
The position requires clarification.
“We do not hear that the CBA has expanded its investigation or speeded up the study of Marian Banasia's own statements.
That is why we are also forced to address the state authorities and report on the possibility of committing the crime [...]," said PO-KO Mr. Mariusz Witczak.
"If normal Polak had so low an estimate of its properties, he would already have 10 controls, tax purposes and carnage proceedings," he added.
He went high, fell low
Marian Banas is the new president of the Supreme Court of Control.
On 30 August 2019, he was appointed to the 6th term.
Its candidate was notified by Law and Justice and the votes of the politicians of this party.
Banas was previously associated with the NIK in 1992-2005, acting in this institution as co-laborator of Lecha Kacinński.
During the first PIS (2005-2008) Banas served as President of the Customs Service and also Under-Secretary of State in the Ministry of Finance.
Since 2015, he has been serving as Head of the Customs Service again and has been managing the National Customs Administration since 2017.
For three months, Banás served as Minister of Finance under the rule of Mateusz Moravieck.

"Responsibilities": Ignorement of police order will be tarnished
According to the newspaper, the reduction of the order for certain behaviour issued by the police should be a new type of excavation, criminal arrest or restriction of freedom.
These changes are what the police officers want.
The idea came to the Commission's summit on Petitions.
"The case is serious, as more than half a million cases are dealt with in Polish courts every year," we read.
"Reszpospolita" stated that the petition which the Independent Professional Association of the Police wrote to the press on the change of the Code of Appeal had a chance of success.
The applicants shall propose a new amendment to Article 54a of the Notice of Injury Code.
He should say: “He who does not submit to the request or order of a public official issued within the limits and on the basis of the provisions of the law is subject to arrest, criminal or restrictions of freedom”.
"Paragraph 3 of this Regulation refers to the same penalty for those who fail to comply with the orders, impossible or difficult performance of the service," the Journal states.
Sociologist Andrze Kowalski said "Rzečpospolitija" that despite the main transmission of the proposal for a regulation, he is afraid that if it is implemented, it can be used in political demonstrations.
"In situations of free demonstration, it would be useless and instead make the situation easier, rather than shoot it," he adds.
Statistics from the newspaper show that 86 per cent of citizens positively assessed police interventions in 2018 and that each month they take 1.5 million city interventions.
Buras is worried about Europe
I'm going to get Topol writing in blood.
Among his ancestors are editors, translators, writers.
His father, Josef Topol, was one of the most important military plays in Czech, now known as Václav Havlem.
So from the beginning, she raised the talent she's been trying to use.
Eight years later he came back with the "Effective Man".
Both Buras and Sonya are rich, along with two sons who, however, do not make up a typical Czech family.
They're nuclear actors, they're traveling across Europe.
He's a lover of Shakespeare and a thief, she's a single translator who doesn't break up with a bottle of wine.
One of the boys from birth didn't give up his voice, and for the other, he stopped at times when he didn't talk.
But it's not the rich people who are the most important in this story.
Everyone is the only ground to watch the world, where there is no room for artists anymore.
It's a world of crowded provinces, old society, suspicious people and a solution to youth.
"Visual people" places are replaced by absurd theaters.
Narrator is following the grandascal, and the conversation of the rich people is about to start this world.
The scene is a Europe full of concerns about its future, but also persistent questions about the past.
Belgium: Brussels Airlines cancelled 105 flights due to Thomas Cook
Although the British travel office Thomas Cook has fallen, his Belgian branch of Neckermann is working.
But the company has problems.
According to VRT television, Brussels Airlines announced that they were calling 105 flights in October due to problems related to the bankruptcy of Thomas Cook.
Neckermann also released 75 employees.
All exits from the office that have been booked in Belgium will be cancelled, but they will be able to receive money back in time.
The Court also announced the fall of three Belgian subsidiaries: Thomas Cook Belgium, Thomas Cook Retail and Thomas Cook Financial Services.
Currently about 12 thousand Belgians are outside the border on the exits purchased by Thomas Cook.
Another 40 thousand people had to leave the office by the end of the year.
In addition to the fact that the company is currently "in full operational" despite the announcement of a fall by British company to the mother who caused a disturbance between employees and customers.
The Bureau then agreed that the customers who bought their escapes would go on vacation.
Thomas Cook – one of the world’s oldest and one of the largest travel offices – announced a fall on Sunday night.
The direct cause of bankruptcy was a failure on Sunday of discussions with creditors and potential investors.
In addition to the agreed settlement plan of 900 million pounds, the creditors were expected to obtain additional 200 million as a winter insurance when travel offices usually have lower turnover.
However, the company's problems have grown over a few years, with an impact of 1.6 billion pounds.

Görlitz in Germany offers free accommodation for your opinion
Free accommodation in exchange for an opinion – such an extraordinary offer has been prepared for the future German Görlitz.
Action will help to combat the ever-increasing decline in the number of city dwellers.
You see, it's the most outposted on the east side of Germany.
A beautiful pastel age attracts 140 thousand tourists a year.
As The Guardian writes, however, the city is facing major problems.
There are the lowest payments in Görlitz in Germany.
The city also has a permanent killing of the population.
After the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, most of them went west, resulting in 25 percent of the city’s population falling.
In 2013, it had 54 thousand people.
In order to combat the population, officials came up with the idea of starting to offer free monthly accommodation in the city.
As long as 150 proposals have been made.
Two thirds of them were the residents of large cities.
The programme was also of interest to persons from Hungary, the Czech Republic, the United States and the United Kingdom.
"When we applied, we thought the programme should convince people to move to Görlitz," said one of the participants.
"We now feel that it doesn't matter whether we stay here for four weeks or not," he added.
The city has seven thousand free apartments, and unemployment is three times higher than average throughout the country.
While the city authorities hope that some will take place on a permanent basis, the main objective of the programme is to obtain the opinion of the programme participants.
Information collected from news and questionnaires should help to heal smaller German cities.
"We want to find out more about what people need and if they decide to do it – what their motivation was," said Robert Knippschild, responsible for the program.
Other cities have already experimented with ideas for new residents, offering them incentives for accommodation.
First of all was Detroit, which introduced a programme of payment to promising young life and work in the city for a year.
Today such solutions are used in many places, from the Greek island of Antikythera after Candel in Italy or in the U.S. state of Oklahoma.
