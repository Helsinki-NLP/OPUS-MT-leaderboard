The innocence is a good thing.
I don't know Tom.
There's no point in comparing them.

I think that would explain everything.
He's gone for dinner.
Telling and doing isn't the same.
Talk to me.
This is the guy here at Fisher Tomi.
It's been a while.

That's the past.
I'm trying to control myself.
You opened the door.
This suit's nice price.
He's gone abroad.
It's a very old book.
He's always asking for your opinion.
It's round, it's rusty, and it doesn't harmonize with anything, but at least they don't smoke in the dark.
That's a wise choice.
It's not that far away.
There's a lot of schools in this town.
This town has a big TV station.

What are you talking about?
It's a dry stone building.
I found it on the floor.
Tom's waiting.
Look at you.
It's time to get some rest.
He explained the rule to me.
I'm sorry.
This old building doesn't deserve to be painted.
We can't get it anymore.

It's more important to me than to you.
When's the last time you ate the grain?
Tom didn't have much to say.
These are all mine.
He's not here yet.
He turned his pockets off.
The elevator isn't in the building, I barely know what to do about my pain.
That's enough.
I locked the door.
Death is one of two things, or destruction, and the dead is not known; or, as they say to us, a true change of heart from place to place.
Don't blow it.
That was a stupid question.
If you read the book, can you lend me a loan?
If you ended up saying I wasn't angry, I probably wouldn't be so angry.
It's just natural.
What are you doing?
I'll get my passport back to the pancakes.
Tom felt that it would be time to turn the letter to Mari.
At least he doesn't know anything about that animal.

From time to time, he's still calling me.
Something's wrong.
Don't be boring.
Please have a close room with an elevator.
He's probably sleeping.
The wound's broken.
He must be Tom's brother.
It was you, wasn't it?
Can you tell me this man's name?
I'm looking for someone.
I can't see the forest from the tree.
Would you please talk to one more time?
I like green tea.
It was a tragic accident.
I don't think so.
The rich will become more and more rich.
I don't have much time.
I've got to burn it in the box.
Do you think he knows I love him?
I lived in Boston.
When were you there?
They're setting up writing machines.
The Baha's faith is a very expensive religion.
He was born in Alessandro, Italy, on February 18, 1745.
His new son's black.
I'm not a point.
I tried to warn her.
Are they all going to be the same?
I found it!
It's a big, bloody lie.
They've been dealing with this for hours.
She was born to be an editor.
I tried to forget.
We'll pay for the account.
Someone stole my bag.
I saw a very good movie last week.
The sky is a large amount of rain.
Tom is one of the best songs I've ever heard.
We've been learning French for almost three years.
Maria has an approved husband.
Tommy's only in color for a while.
It was wind and the wind began to blow through the road.
I think your job is very good.
There's a problem.
Looks like the day was in a place.
Who thinks that?
You're not gonna stop them with pain.
Tom's getting bored, too.
Tom started taking me there.
Tom got Mary a drink.
The young woman was so beautiful that even the sky wanted to take her.
Because I dropped my bus.
I'm going to stay in my room so I don't hurt anything.
We have to do it now.
Shall I take you home?
Tom's hopeless.
Have you been following a law enforcement?
I'm not the coach.
It's very sweet.
It's too cold to swim.
Collecting my older games.
It was Tomina's time to calm down.
Mary's pregnant.
You're learning Chinese.
It's all about time.
May I?
The flower I saw in the park yesterday was a reflection.
Everything happened on purpose.
I met Tom.
We've got a big day.
We tried to warn them.
I'm proud of Tomira.
Faith is strong.
He's a regular student at the university.
He used it.
He likes to cut off electrical equipment.
You're so uncooling.
He was very tired.
It's a collectioner.
They love my mom.
I don't have time to waste.
Don't forget to write to me.
Everyone worked hard.
Where are you living in Turkey?
The blue is good for you.
Who did you go there with?
The creation of the theater has made it possible for the public to draw close to the rapporteurs and establish contact.
I couldn't move my arms.
I'm sorry, can you help me?
I can understand it.
Can you hold on for a few minutes?
I'm sure he's got five hundred books.
Was the post office here already?
That helps a little.
It was a great day.
When are you getting married?
He's been trying to call Tamás Maria on many occasions.
Let go of the gun!
Mary doctors.
Is this your money?
I didn't get used to this kind of torture.
Now, the kids can't separate the guy from the pain anymore.
It's a concert.
My mom weighed my leg.
It's a pleasure to follow.
Get out!
Did I make a mistake?
It was Tom's suit.
It's just great.
I know.
I appreciate what Tom did to me.
Tommy's glad it's over.
Why are you going up that hill?
He took me to the palace.
There's a woman there who wants to talk to you.
They told him to stand up and he did.
This is the book.
We respect them very much.
How do I get to the airport?
Tom, you're doing anything for money.
You need a good night's rest.
We've got a good day.
You just have to work harder.
That's a good dream.
We need a change.
Learning a language is required for about 10 thousand hours.
It's been two years since she left.
He lost all his money.
It's not hard.
I've been in Tokyo for three years and I've been living here since.
You believe in the man's innocence.
Would you take the villa off?
They warned me not to get out of school more than once.
I've been looking for the key.
Tom saw it.
All clear!
Where did you send him to Boston?
Tom's gone.
The main festival is in its symbol, not in its books.
It's all Tommy's car in this garage.
This is too long!
How much does he give you the gold ring?
The story is written by the winners.
He's a lawyer.
I wish you hadn't looked like you were very fun.
Would you like to have dinner with me?
I would like to write hundreds of words on Tatoeb, but I have a job.
I'll pay later.
Tom's got to get water.
I work every day except Sunday.
Tom's gonna die.
It's not your fault, is it?
My grandpas are starting to become unsatisfied.
You don't have to try.
Tom spent his money in the bank.
Tom was great.
There's always room for improvement.
They hit Tom on the wall.
This should be stopped.
There's alcohol in the university area.
Your name was the third on the list.
I can't do anything about this.
Tommy went to the hospital with a taxi.
It's also true.
Almost completely out of these fields.
I don't know who it is.
The girl was next to me.
He loves you.
You're gay?
My mask's black.
Now I'm hot.
He tried to hide his concerns at the end of the day.
He's back here with some of his friends.
Tom's working on Park Street.
We've been here for a long time.
Can you speak French to your wife?
I was waiting for the answer, but she didn't hear from you.
There's no need for Tom to come if he doesn't want to.
We'll go back there.
It doesn't matter what you say, I'm not gonna pay attention to you.
Take it seriously.
The penguin is also called a table tennis.
It's part of it.
Please leave.
Get your hands off my daughter!
Watch your head.
He doesn't drink coffee.
I'm a little tired.
Forget it.
We're poor, but we're happy.
I respect Tom.
Kint's completely dark.
Did you hear anything about her lately?
We'll wait three hours.
It's probably because Tom was late because he had a business debt on his 19th.
How did Tom answer?
It's a good job.
This is Tom's grandpa farm.
Good night, Mom.
I think I still have time to do it before Tom's here.
I can't imagine getting married.
Everyone says that food is very good in this restaurant.
Do you know exactly what your kids eat?
Looks like it's just yesterday that we went to school together.
Mari loves the kids.
The team's gonna be ready.
Then I wasn't ready for it.
They all said they were sorry about the death.
What was the problem?
I mean, it's your fault.
One more time!
The twins are alive, but the other is dead.
You can send me the file by e-mail.
We need help right here.
Tomorrow's free access.
Tom hid the evidence.
Stay away!
I warned Tom.
The dog was dead.
I've never heard of lying to him.
We didn't know what they were coming up with.
We don't love our neighbors, and they don't love us.
He's the only one who survived.
I'm going to work with the bus.
I think maybe Tom's older than me.
You're done now.
There's a thousand dollars in the bag.
I'll give you a local sensor.
See you at the end of the week.
People can be so unselfish.
It's a discrepancy.
We understand each other.
Tom will help us if he knows.
You should've followed Tom's orders.
My wife and I want to have sex.
Tom hit me out of the mistake.
Count one out of ten.
Someone stole my money.
I mean, what's wrong?
He's bringing clothes from Turkey.
You gonna take this out?
Do you have a fire?
Get me a good book from the library.
Tom's gonna stay.
Are you a nudist?
It hasn't happened like this yet.
Why don't you get a tip?
Who's this bag?
Mari built a house.
I wish I hadn't seen such a boring movie!
I read this story in a book somewhere.
Please write your name.
I'm sorry for the delay.
Tom didn't take my advice.
He's got a lot of history books.
Don't give me anything!
The weighted body movement is affected by bleeding.
It's all right at the office.
Don't you want a little orange?
I want a drink.
He couldn't meet the new circumstances.
That's true love.
They must've been stolen.
We'll be alive as soon as the rain goes on.
Here you go, Tom.
There's no difference in you.
He's drinking too much alcohol.
You can really fix the mistake you've already found in the statement.
Who hit the baby?
The monster is alive, awake and hungry.
The price of the houses went up.
Your friendship is very valuable to me.
He's fighting after school.
I never eat house.
We still need to know the truth.
Mari closed her eyes and started counting the coins.
Tom's drugged Mary.
Do you understand French?
There's no need for science to connect a personal computer to the Internet.
He just took an hour.
I forgot.
Stay with me, Tom.
That's not right.
I think Tom never learned French.
It's great she could've come.
Even Tom wouldn't be stupid enough to ask Mary.
We don't like luck.
What happened last week?
Tom's carrying the weight.
I'm smelling this shit out of me.
I have to do everything.
We appreciate his ability.
Tommy got a gift out of his pocket.
Can you do this to yourself?
Tom said he didn't see anything.
Take in an aspirin.
She's in school.
Do you really try to get involved?
I've been here for you.
Tom will answer all your questions.
You'll need an alibi.
You're out of your mind.
Words give meaning to words. They have personality. They can be funny, rational, dumb, life-sighted, creepy, dirty.
No, it's not.
My book isn't here.
Tom's coming home next week.
Mary told me she enjoyed the concert.
Why are you talking to me all the time?
The day comes out and it's resting.
Tom's on his way.
They eat healthy food.
Tom felt like he was stuck in a trap.
That's what you remember about my old boy.
I've been out for you.
Take one of them.
Get out of here!
Who's that toll?
Who do I have luck with?
Is that mandatory?
Tom didn't seem as busy as he used to.
They're killers.
Tom's very involved.
Who cares?
I can't imagine how I could live without it.
It's my mother tongue.
He's gonna be there in my face.
I think Tom was there already.
Tom is too dependent on Mari.
The boy's got everyone excited with his new partner.
Tom's a very respectable star.
I'm not your father.
The hope is always alive.
My mom likes the focus.
I'm fine.
I've never seen Tom dance.
There's nothing here.
I've never seen Tom before.
The kids are in bed.
I ate too much yesterday.
He's gone.
Tom's sitting still.
It was just fun.
She's no longer dependent on her parents.
Honestly, you're not right.
They're talking about it, and they're talking about it.
Why worry about that?
I ate four last night.
Do you have any money?
These are the things I like.
No one can see.
It's easy to understand why Tom doesn't love Mari.
You're convincing.
He's going to school with a bus?
John's a good friend.
Aren't you coming with me?
I don't hear a word.
The kids are full of energy.
I like coffee better.
I'm still young.
He's a DJ.
Tommy tried to sign up for the night club.
Good night, little lady.
I asked her if she'd go there the other day.
I had to do it alone.
Tom took me to hell.
I made it up yesterday.
The dog is man's best friend.
Tom said that Mari was crazy.
You haven't won yet.
He lived in Tom Boston at the time of his arrest.
I haven't done much lately.
I need more.
It doesn't matter what I do, my parents will never be happy.
Tom arranged an extra big pizza.
The body's dead.
I pressed a bad button.
I know Tom's done.
I think you're worthy.
When he's in trouble, he always turns to his wife for help.
I didn't think Tom was going to Boston.
The freaks don't normally attack the man.
Where's the next one?
The accuracy is important when measured.
I don't understand why it's important.
Can you come to the station?
I really don't know where to start.
I didn't want you to cry.
Everyone's been killed.
Tom is used to how things are going here.
He's dancing.
My phone doesn't work.
Where do you think this happened?
Mari is one of the wildendorphic victors.
I'm studying hard at school.
I'd explain it to you, but your mind would be too big.
I hope Tommy's right.
Tom has a lot of good ideas.
If only I could be different!
Tom gave me my number.
Dan hit the man who tried to steal his car.
Tommy bought Mari some toys.
You admitted your mistakes.
You could've done it by yourself.
The boy's been wrong about the coronation.
They're parts.
I lost my money.
Do you have two windows in your room?
Tom's gonna shoot.
It's our guest.
Please answer.
Tommy won't listen to this.
I remember Tom wearing a brown hat.
We're not friends.
Please close the door.
We didn't have a dog.
It wasn't a very interesting rain.
Tom's finished his work.
How long has he been waiting?
Do you like white chocolate?
The night sky is beautiful and exciting.
I'm not crying.
Tom gave Mari a ride to their wedding anniversary.
On the floor is my grandfather's first-aid equipment used in World War II.
Did Tom ever show you that letter?
They've been dating each other.
What's in your head?
They're both dead.
Everyone's changing.
That's right, honey.
It motivates personal forest.
If he didn't break up, don't fix it.
It's always the same note.
I only have one brother.
Three years ago I met her.
We're fighting a lot.
Explain to me why Tom's not here.
We're not going out to the party.
I hope so.
Tamás has two brothers, one lives in Boston, the other in Chicago.
My grandfather spent hundreds of lives.
I want you, Tom.
The answers are too good.
You have to work very hard.
He hates his Fate.
They built a choice wall on the side of the parking lot to separate the sound from the houses nearby.
I don't have enough money to pay you.
Are they meeting us?
It was pretty weird.
I'll take you to the hotel.
That's good, you'll probably name it.
It's my watch.
I know the rules.
Neither Tom nor Mary waited so long.
It's the black bear.
The kids are innocent.
It was just a dream.
A girl writes.
Tommy closed the secret.
I'll be home in six hours.
It's just faster.
The school accepted three American ceseries.
The milk's in the heater.
I have to go there.
I'm not afraid of you anymore.
What a lovely man!
The police have arranged a warrant for the arrest warrant.
You don't know how much I love you.
I'm in trouble.
They're missing, aren't they?
You choose something.
After the mountains, the ground will rest on the day.
Looks like you want to take that dress.
- There you go, Dad, a hat!
I wish her luck.
Tommy's probably gonna be suspicious.
Tommy's strong enough to remember.
I thought Tommy was still living in Boston.
That's what I need.
Do you like this kangaroo?
Tom ran out of jail on a subway.
I've lost something from you.
I don't want to continue working with this.
Don't be mad at your head.
You're not gonna convince her with these words.
He's not the man who opened the debate.
Tom wanted Mary to love her.
How many machines does he live in Greenland?
I scratched my head.
You have to quit smoking.
They got Tom, they got a stolen car.
Tom's trying to improve.
Mom says it's time money.
I don't know what to do anymore.
There was no visible danger.
I've never met a person I've ever met before.
I wish I could show Tom to you.
How much is the minimum governor in the Czech Republic?
If you speak in such a language to someone you understand, it goes to his head, but if you speak in his language, it goes to his heart.
I don't look like my mom as much as I am.
I don't know who your kid is.
Go to bed!
Let go!
You better move the office.
Whatever you do, I'm not gonna name it.
When did you buy this?
I was disappointed.
You know how to sit down.
Why did you take this bitch?
It's cold at home.
Tomit needs surgery.
Tom got out of France in the past half.
They'll probably be born soon.
Tommy said it was great.
I've got a good reason to be late.
I have to do something.
He gave me a lot of books.
Mary had a simple dinner.
She's in my office soon.
Even the tweets of partial cells look better with 24 point Georgian fonts.
The kid can count on meat.
Everyone had to write a report about what they saw.
We're all making mistakes.
Jesus, are you hungry?
Allergic to any medicine?
He needs it.
There's a great time in Boston today.
Where are the others from our class?
I'm done.
I gave my address to Tominak.
I'm under pressure.
I shouldn't have said anything.
Sometimes we do this again.
Sami took a whore.
The strike lasted three days.
Sounds, plants and animals living in society.
Can I get it?
The import of Tavaly continued to export.
If you're going to Rio, don't forget to invite me in.
I can't fly.
Mom's making a cake now.
Mary looked at me and told me to stay in my arms.
Tom's got a dark pass.
Why do you know so much about Australia?
My boss is a asshole.
I hope he comes tomorrow.
Don't let your cat out.
I think I got the answer.
The roses are opening up in the spring.
Which one's the worst?
Do you want me to smile?
Do you know the name of the leader?
Where's the mistake?
I gave Tom to him what he wanted.
That's all gone.
It was very interesting, wasn't it?
You don't know the rules?
It hurts!
I want to live in Brazil.
Tom's very nice.
Why should I stop this?
A five-star star was the figure the kid drew on the paper.
We argued with him for the house.
Come with me to Boston!
Call me if you can.
It's not my problem.
They were in the mountains under their feet.
I came to Mexico on a beautiful May day.
I'll kill you.
Let's go fight.
That would have been better if it had already been arranged.
I'll be up at seven o'clock in the morning.
What if I don't tell you?
I'm asking you for a house.
I live in Tokyo.
How did you sleep?
I'll eat when I get home.
They're really innocent.
Put it down!
It's gonna be dangerous.
Tom is a fighter, right?
We don't have any more money.
What else could I do?
Everything keeps changing.
Tom's car was last seen in the neighborhood before his ex-wife killed him.
I'm not working tomorrow.
I'm not kidding.
I'm looking for a doctor.
You need to read your bag if you want to be a sick member.
I guess that was the only way to get your job organized.
It's a comfortable situation.
He went up to the enamel.
It was a wonderful night for Tomina.
I've got a lot of friends who talk experientially.
Both girls are very beautiful.
Tommy, you're in a hurry!
He's been late for a long time.
I'm willing to pay anything.
My mom used to get up early.
They offered a prayer to the guests.
Tom always sleeps.
I'm unstoppable.
When was the last time you did this?
Do they want to share?
Further delays are possible.
It's a bad place.
How old was Tom?
That's my Mayo role in a Mayo show in Ryogoku.
Tom was on the phone.
The world has changed a lot in the past three years.
Do you hear me now?
They didn't have anything.
The experience is the name that everyone gives to their regrets.
Tom's focusing on it.
I could've stopped Tom, but I didn't.
That's how I like it better.
Tommy got into a bar.
He made me a confession.
Try it.
Tom's a little late.
Tommy can do this faster for me.
Tom couldn't deny who he was voting for.
It's not easy to solve the problem.
They've been trying to visit the house.
I'm out of my mind.
Tom's father was a bookmaker.
Tom didn't.
What's wrong?
You'll be better.
Tommy's still in trouble with simple mathematical operations.
I don't want you here.
You're too tired.
I needed a level.
I'm not sure I know what it means.
Tommy found a whole bunch of money.
If you offer your life with lemons, make your lemonade.
It's small in her hand.
I'm sorry I doubted you.
Has anyone been hurt?
He's been a long time, but he's finally been able to find it.
Tommy bought a bottle of savanna.
I met Tommy tonight.
She'll be a good wife.
My brother and I will understand each other very well.
I talked to you.
Kim was so cute.
Tom's very handsome.
I don't have a vodka.
Tavaly was born.
The airfield was transferred to Tokyo.
We're ready again.
You want to get my brains up?
Don't be afraid.
Now get up here.
You know that.
On the beach, tourists were threatened.
My mother tongue is the best gift I've ever received from my mother.
Tom gave me a very royal gift.
Do you have a generator?
I was the only one who didn't call me.
What are we doing?
I don't know anyone.
I have my wife and children.
Mari's black eyes.
It's yours.
Take it.
It's not likely anything serious will happen.
Calm down.
Everyone hates Tom.
Tomit seems to be taking a lot of care.
I need to take action in an emergency.
If you eat too much, you'll get worse.
I don't want to see Tom out of my mind.
What's going on?
I don't really need the money.
Tony's got a nice sound.
You didn't do anything wrong, Tommy.
It's too late.
You're a fish.
I thought about it again.
What kind of gymnasium are you going to?
What are you learning?
I'm sorry, but I don't really listen to you.
I'll find her mother-in-law.
He didn't want to be the boss.
Tom and Mary are in the same band.
It's not a woman's job.
He slept on the bus back home.
Do we have to go there?
I think it'd be better if you left now.
You must be Tom's brother.
He's sick.
I just finished the show.
We're very proud of you.
If you had accepted my advice, you wouldn't be sitting in the slamast.
You can leave now.
You know almost everything about me.
When he came home, I was just watching TV.
I know you're reading.
It was three hours ago.
He suggested he don't go.
I got an electric car.
It's very weird.
He gave me some good advice.
My destiny is to get out of the company.
I want you to come to the meeting.
Thank you very much.
How was your flight?
No one understood me.
I'm standing.
Despite his apology, I'm still angry.
Maybe he'll think about it.
Tom asked Mary to take John to the airport.
I forgot to remove the flowers.
She lived in a wooden house in the middle of the forest.
It's not worth making a joke.
What do I say to Tominak?
I can't take this pain anymore.
Amsterdam, the capital of the Netherlands.
Opinions unite or divide people.
This question is easy to answer.
Why is Tom doing that?
This car is bigger than that.
They've been showered in their room.
I'm drinking.
Tom didn't strengthen her, he didn't deny the plates.
I already understood why Tom was upset.
What's the matter?
Where's the judge?
She's got a fever from her throat.
Tom's home is small, very small.
I don't know anything except what you told me.
We have to do something.
It's ready.
He opened a savings account.
We've never lost.
You didn't report a lot of help.
How much is this room's rent?
Tommy took her childhood to the movie.
It's so good to stay home!
Try to imagine your situation.
I forgot my name.
Tom's upset.
This is the situation.
These words will disappear once again.
I'm fine. Thank you.
How old is your daughter?
Very, very different.
How many things did you give me today?
I appreciate your cooperation.
One day we all have to die.
Mary calls her children by herself.
It's not a real word.
It's a big deal.
Why do you always have to fight me?
They lived in Algeria for over a year.
I'm afraid Tommy can't answer.
A ship suddenly emerged from the deck.
There are no rules.
Is there something you're more interested in?
He's got his own value.
If you don't like it, don't eat it.
The two boys laughed at each other.
You still need to learn a lot about how to be nice.
What did you ask?
Without the Day, we couldn't live on Earth.
It happened suddenly.
Everyone knows the law.
I got you red roses.
We walked around the roof.
I want to live in Boston for the rest of my life.
Happiness plays an important role in life.
Tom hasn't seen Mary since they broke up.
He asked for help.
You know I love Tom, right?
It's not always over until we're over it.
Tom wants to do it.
Good morning.
My horse's gone.
I belong with Tom.
Tommy looked at the dog.
I don't understand how to do it.
There's been a breach.
He's going with my sister.
I'm going to buy it every morning.
As a result, it looks bigger.
It's not a secret.
Tom's got a gun.
Tom wanted to see what was going on.
Don't touch me!
Tom's my book.
He's got your cat killed.
I'll pray for Tommy.
It wasn't easy for me.
He was finally quiet.
Be careful, don't drink.
He's got drunk and he's got a big talk.
It's a terrible plan.
How I feel about you.
That's what you need.
There's nothing special about it.
Don't move on my mom's day.
All I have to do is look at the food, and I've got enough.
Who are these guys?
I'm sure she'll be all right with my grandmother.
We got our dad!
I was too serious.
Look what he says.
Let's take a look at the case.
I'd like a Vanilla dress.
It's Tomi's ice cream.
Except for the early days, I'll go to the office with a couple of men.
The dead bodies of Kupaca offered a terrible sight under the sea.
Tom was obviously not satisfied.
The computer for love.
Tom wants Mari to be happy.
They named the boys Janos.
Tommy wanted Mari to answer some questions from her past.
Have you ever been to the funeral?
What do you think you can do?
It was a good party.
He forgot his return.
Don't worry, things are gonna work out.
True friendship is more rare than play.
I know why Tom was killed.
You're probably hungry.
A temporary detoxification can also take place on a pilot's life.
I have to go to my office.
How'd it go?
Let's not go back to the guest.
Do you have love?
I saw your name on the list.
I like to speak Spanish.
You didn't have the right to do this.

He became a director at the age of three.
Who designed these pictures?
These oranges are upset.
I'm making tea on my coffee.
Tommy says he doesn't want to wait for you.
Would you like to visit Chichen Itzá?
My budget is working.
I love music.
I want to do it well.
Tom's doing well at school.
They're our good friends.
Tom didn't know what to answer.
Don't be satisfied with less.
By the way, let's start.
Why are these girls so rude?
I have to get up in the morning.
The mother was very afraid of the baby's birth.
You don't want to think about yourself?
That's all you've got.
It's a big mistake.
Both of us have the same problem.
Tom's always against himself.
Mom!
You really agreed with Tommy.
That's a good idea.
I'm driving to Boston.
If you think about yourself, you know where to find it.
I don't like dogs.
We just ate.
It's urgent.
There's a right in the elevator.
I don't know what's going on.
Do you have a volunteer?
It's not perfect in the woods.
They're watching.
God helps us.
Remember him.
It's really good for you to call.
You'd like to repeat, please, where did you put the key?
I'll get it.
We'll be there.
That's the team leader.
That's what I want.
I need to win Tom.
I don't think they like it.
Tommy was so excited about it.
I'm not going to have to live in a big city.
Tom's got glasses.
Tom's always leaving his boyfriend with a knife.
I can't just walk away.
Looks like you've been thinking about everything.
That day my life changed.
People are part of nature?
You need to be careful.
You know I don't like his toast.
I wish I had a car.
Tommy couldn't help Mari.
Do you know the name of Tommy's family?
I've been trying to scare the alarm.
My wife's family is very rich.
Tell Tomina I'm coming back.
Get out of here!
Someone broke the smell.
Tom, open your pocket!
The boy had a knife in his hand holding his hand from his chest.
I want to go there.
I want to thank you for your great work.
We hope not.
Your French language has improved greatly.
Tom won't believe a word you're telling him.
Tommy got five on the test.
Tommy's word is against Mari's word.
Now I don't have time to talk.
You ever been to Mexico?
They're having coffee at home.
You can't buy respect.
Tom's tired.
Tom's right.
You should never have left early.
This book is used in Spanish.
Health is more important than wealth.
That's what Tom told me.
I'm hungry.
I'm not talking about Tom.
I think it's supposed to be a whole lot of people who study.
What do we do first?
I don't know, I'll call and ask.
Can you suggest another date?
I gave it up too early.
What are you gonna do there?
It's totally normal.
What else?
Let me go first.
Tommy's been away for about three minutes.
All right.
Let's try it.
Tom insisted that he pay for dinner.
Take a cake of bread.
I need a watch.
Samuel's hot.
I like to travel alone.
We don't want that.
My guitar's in the trunk of the car.
We're sitting there.
He dropped the bottle and broke it.
Everyone's surprised.
It's good to see you.
I don't have a computer.
Tom's not complete.
The former tenants have left the place in an irregular state.
Fuck you.
Your idea is completely out of reality.
Some people look at others just because they have less money.
The bosorgian has stopped the poor girl.
Tom didn't show too much interest.
Your work is over.
Now I want to pay.
I'd like to ask you something.
I answered the question.
Maria solved the secret.
Do you have any water?
How can I stop Tom?
Tom's here right now.
I usually eat home with my family.
That shouldn't have been.
We can't prove anything.
You can get in that hole.
Tom was part of it, so Mary drove home with a car.
I don't speak Hungarian.
The party organized by Tom was a great success.
Tom was a cop.
We saw a castle in front of us.
Have you seen Tom when he's watching?
Tommy seemed surprised.
I'm usually going to swim in the river.
Don't even deal with them!
I was sorry to see you in Australia.
They do the same things as I did as children.
That's great!
I'm down from the elevator.
Mary's gone to her final hour.
The report was deliberately prepared, and there was some error of settlement.
Tom's neither rich nor famous.
Everyone's gone.
Tom's on the criminal record.
I'm coming to Boston tomorrow night.
She called me personally.
I have to go.
I'll look after some food.
He can't stop.
I learned so much about Tom.
I need a job right now.
Everyone's still sleeping.
Dogfighting.
Tom decided to go home early.
That was our biggest problem.
You're very nice.
I'm fat too.
I'm so proud of my team.
Sit back!
I don't know where I am.
Tom didn't do anything.
He's very proud of his ability.
You've lived in a distance?
They've all been transferred from the plane.
There's got to be a red toll.
He didn't know what to do with his problem.
I'm lonely now.
My dad's going to work with a cop.
Where's Tommy?
Don't be so sensitive.
I'm running five miles a day.
I never understood Tom.
We had to be there.
Tom made breakfast.
He's the most experienced teacher in the class.
You should've called the cops.
I'll keep it secret.
Tom hasn't even flew off the plane yet.
You gave me your coffee.
I couldn't have done it better myself.
Tom's been a member of this club for three years.
In my career, I'm so small that I can't make it.
Go home now!
I'm not jealous.
You found my cat.
I thought Tom was coming.
Whoever loves flowers can't be a bad person.
Einstein says everything's normal.
The old book was a pity.
They're just grown up.
Around it is as tall as you are.
Tom's honest.
It's important that we help those who are in trouble.
You can't teach your old dog new tricks anymore.
I have to let go of the storm.
I love the language of the school.
I understand what you're thinking.
They've got containments.
Tell him you love him before it's too late.
Would you lend me the book if you were done with it?
That's what I told you.
Catastrophe is causing an accident at work.
What do you think of my idea?
Give me a little time to figure out what's broken.
Tom's not afraid of death.
There's not enough information.
I've got a field at my place.
The bus's gone, too.
There's the biggest one in Turkey.
The radio's broken.
There are no houses on the other side of the road.
Anyway, who's gonna have to wait for the order...
I can't take it off.
Tom looked at his pockets.
The rain has become even more intense.
Tom's doing it with everyone.
Are you coming in?
We'll change this soon.
I don't want to talk about time.
My request was rejected.
We were surprised to hear the news.
Don't underestimate yourself.
I'm Antonio.
I met my friend here.
I've traveled all over Russia.
I like to kiss Tom.
Tommy's my son.
He's a stranger.
You can't tell the truth.
Tomit is also increased by the most critical note.
You don't think it's the truth.
I left without it.
He loves his brother.
Where else should we go?
If you don't like it, you can go.
Tom's gonna pay.
I get it.
Tom just disappeared.
I don't want to meet him.
Serve yourself if you want to eat anything.
Dad's still in bed.
Do you have to work every Sunday?
We've got a good feeling.
We haven't had a problem yet.
How's your hair?
In the room where you're sitting, I was sitting yesterday.
You're not a good student.
I hope Tommy's gonna understand.
Do you believe in ghosts?
I thought I could trust you.
The sound was so loud.
Co-operation is true for the gangs.
The storm swept the whole city in one night.
I'll explain later.
Honestly, I don't care much.
The truth is the best years of life.
Tom's gone?
They called the animal doctor because there were no other doctors in the village.
I know what I want.
Don't let him get hurt!
Trust yourself!
Are you working on the weekend?
How much do you pay?
The aunt took her hand with the final students.
I live in Milan.
Tom can come any time.
I think time will solve this problem.
Why did your pool go together?
I'll stay home and watch TV.
Tom's Christian?
Ask Tama to explain it.
You broke up.
I slept on the open windows because of the heat.
There's still a day left.
He lost his daughter again.
Let's go to the museum.
I want to fight you!
A Nazi killed a Jew.
We don't know exactly.
If you want to get out of here alive, listen to me.
We learned French instead of German.
That's great!
Is that what everyone wants?
You're breaking up with me?
You can't believe a word.
I love Spanish!
I'm going to walk one way to get my head down.
A little work doesn't hurt anybody.
A chain is as strong as its most common eye.
You usually call me.
I'm going to report to work today.
I'm trying to keep you informed.
Tom said Mary was Canadian.
My father traveled to Greece.
That's enough of my barbaric knowledge.
The king destroyed his enemies.
You're talking!
I want Mary to let Tom finish it.
I'm drunk.
We've got a big problem.
You're too busy to drive.
His eyes were cut off from the cry.
You're going there without me.
Tom's gonna eat.
It's not a secret.
I'm sorry about this.
Take it, please.
We'll do it together.
I forgot, could you help me, please?
You saw Tommy smile at Maria.
Seven to reach the eight-hour line.
They considered him a hero because he saved his friend's life.
Your father would be proud of you too.
I'll just ask you a few seconds.
I don't understand why I love Tom so much.
Tomina's vision is alive.
He promised me he'd come to four.
I don't want to lose this game.
I'm changing the education system.
They're there.
Hello!
Tom took a plate of soap.
I don't like to get up.
Tamás thought Maria had material problems.
When I hear the news, I'll be a freeman.
He couldn't resist the temptation.
Why do we deal with what happens after our death?
We need to help each other.
Sometimes my dream will come true.
He's got all the money I've given him.
We were close.
You think I should tell Tom?
What's this for you?
Do you know how to do this?
I'm a doctor.
How old is your dad?
I don't believe it.
Who loves Tom?
Kill Tom!
I think I'm gonna die.
What's up?
Tom's got a carmel in the morning.
We're liars.
You're more accurate than you think.
Did you see my camera?
Tom did a lot of great things.
I was really busy.
It's all right.
Don't be smart anymore.
You're gonna pay for it!
It would be good if we had a collection of the last words of the famous people.
I'm a social worker.
It was amazing to keep it.
I believe your words.
It's different, isn't it?
Tom has as many servants as he needs.
Tom wants to be successful.
Nothing happened.
Were you in the library yesterday?
I like her better.
He wrote ten books, but he didn't tell anyone.
Tom's home with his parents.
I don't really want to eat now.
Tom was satisfied with his success.
They didn't find anyone.
You can do this for yourself.
You don't take much time.
I hate lawyers.
Tom said you hate dancing.
If you have time, why don't you look into his gallery?
At first I was angry, but then I gradually calmed down.
I don't want to buy this kind of couch.
First you have to ask Tom.
Explain to me.
I'm clean with the difficulties.
I'm not sick.
Where are you from, Karen?
He's frozen somewhere in the mountains.
Tom's gone straight.
Tom threw you into his cat's back.
I think something terrible will happen.
Is that it?
Tom's not home.
No one's there.
We were jealous.
Tom threatened Marit.
I didn't realize you weren't speaking French.
There were two dogs.
They're absolutely different from me.
We can't save everyone.
Tom's down.
Where's the river when it's not up there?
This is one of the best places in town.
All I need is to fix it.
Tom's supposed to be dancing.
I left it out of my sight.
He dropped the gas because the water cost the river.
You look so lucky.
Bring him in.
Help Tamás.
I've been looking for a lot of money in my living room.
I'll tell Tom what he should tell Mari.
I haven't eaten yet.
I accept your terms.
I'm a good cook.
It's dangerous!
Can I open my eyes?
The car's blue.
I was sick, I stayed home all day.
He was born in Boston.
Can you wait a minute?
The cops have eight feet.
I'm still a kid.
Tom's looking at women.
That's stupid.
I work as a bus driver.
I think you know him.
That'll be enough.
We didn't have dinner.
I'm done.
I'm going to give the message to Tomina.
Mari was too angry to share her feelings.
Tom should've done a lot better.
What things did they sing?
I'm going home to Boston.
Well, isn't it?
Mr. Harrison's brother-in-law was in a coma and his dad was in the mood for the night.
I don't like learning French today.
Tom's really messy.
Let's go, but I don't.
I was angry that I trusted Tommy.
What kind of beer is it?
That was a secret.
I trust you.
Good to see you.
Japan has diplomatic relations with China.
My parents don't live anymore.
Not all black and white.
You don't have the right to judge these people.
Of course he's out of the way.
Tom and Mary made the same arrangements.
Let's discuss this.
Would you like to buy it with me?
The water's not healthy.
Can you pull up a hand with a towel?
Tom has a brother.
He's here to protect you.
It looked like Tom was very worried.
Tomin's got blood in his pocket.
There's a book on the table.
It's important that we promote our language in every way possible.
When's the next time?
It's because I didn't understand him.
Anytime, you can ask me anything.
I love you.
This isn't your hat, is it?
Tom doesn't have to talk to me if he doesn't want to.
You can go home now.
It's just an empty threat.
There's two old gestations in front of our house.
I'm drunk.
The spiders are stuck in the long, long hair of the bear.
I don't know anyone in the picture.
I hope we don't cause you discomfort.
Let's discuss this later.
You're learning chemistry.
He keeps his word.
I don't count on any special forms of torture.
His old friends turned away from him.
Tom didn't make enough sugar in his coffee.
I'm sure I'm not going through tomorrow's test.
The world's fine.
Today's the new building.
Lora!
I've never seen anything like it in my life.
I'll call Tom right away.
I broke up with my girlfriend.
I hope things will be okay.
Paul's an hour's accuracy.
You replaced the need with Margaret.
It was popular in the nineties.
Everyone did it.
People like gold in the aquarium?
I live in a small house, not too far from here.
Tom risked it.
I'm sorry, can I help you?
The paragraph that the teacher asked Sarah to read was not interesting.
Tommy and Mari are both good teachers.
Tom gave Mari my number.
I live with Rod John.
The elevator is very hot.
There's no money to sell it.
Tom would've gone.
Tell Tom to meet us at the station.
I'll call you back.
I'm glad to see you again.
Tom was a good job.
Everyone has the right to be stupid, some of them get back to their rights.
I just need a little encouragement.
Danny knew Linda was gone.
I'm not the man I've ever been.
I'm not a Catholic.
Let's rest here.
Our money's gone.
I don't want to walk with you.
I don't understand anything.
What's the price for this hat?
I came from Trondheim.
Tom doesn't know.
I need more space.
Tom taught me most of what I know in French.
Can I get you something?
He's keeping his money in the bank.
I don't care if you believe me.
Do you think these are what?
It's hard for everyone to get into it.
There's a solution.
What do you think Tom's looking for?
Well, it's not like that.
This world is ruled by evil forces.
He called him to put his fear down.
I'm on my way.
Can I get a kilo-done tonne?
Don't touch it.
The story was real.
The wound was removed from pain after the emotional effect was over.
That's what I need.
How much money do you have?
Concentrate!
They're not talking at all.
Get off me!
He's always asking for your opinions.
We're gonna use Margarin instead.
I'm very pleased with this invitation.
When they're both doing the same thing, it's not the same anymore.
I'm not the one with Tom's problem.
How much money will Tom get?
Is it true that Tom committed suicide?
Serbia, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, Croatia, Macedonia, Bosnia and Montenegro.
Either you can follow his advice.
My name is Ricardo, and yours?
She's talking in Maria's dream.
I don't think that's ever gonna happen again.
It's yours, Tom!
Give me another beer.
My shoes were stuck in the motorbike.
What's the taste of ice cream?
He speaks French.
I'm dying.
He didn't touch you.
I'll explain it.
Tom went to bed a few years ago.
We're all safe.
I was sure.
Calm down!
There were two bottles of wine left.
Come tomorrow!
Can we try this?
The table's green.
Tom should have won the competition.
I need her to be up-to-date.
I still don't think I can answer it.
I don't want to know.
The fate often gives us what we don't expect.
What's the recipe?
We're competitors.
Give me a pain relief, please.
You're completely wrong.
She was very scared, so she didn't come to school today.
Something's wrong.
They'll discuss it tomorrow.
It's the top of this table.
Open up!
Do you understand English?
It's early to see the date.
Tom took part in a Web site.
Do I feel nervous?
It's hard to steal a towel.
Tom can't ever get out of the room.
Tell me, where's the police?
He was so tired, he slept alone.
I hope I'm starting to learn your beautiful language in the near future.
Tom was so paranoia.
I need numbers.
I'll count to three.
Don't talk.
Tommy didn't even know how to thank France.
Where's the next medicine?
I sang.
Tom and Mari are as different as fire and water.
Tommy's a good provider.
We have less than three hours.
Tom's parents were hippies.
That's a mistake.
This car looks like mine.
How stupid you are!
It may be understandable to you, but not to me.
Don't try to follow me.
No one knows anything.
He's a bus driver.
Not one!
But this isn't the real problem.
What's the title of the book?
Tom loved me.
Are you telling us the truth?
Russia's big.
Who's the woman who's there?
Tom said he was pregnant.
Tom was the most influential man in town.
I can't wait to get married.
Is there cold in Germany?
Leave my camera alone.
He's got to be crazy!
Don't ask me to help you with more.
I'm not coming.
Thank you.
Let's get a head starter.
It's not ice water.
Did you know them personally?
Tom doesn't look too happy, does he?
Please, tell me in a bit more.
She has to keep her eyes open.
Tomina's got a black cat.
Courage is born of heroism, and friendship of faith.
It's been brought up again with the old story.
Tom took Mary a box of socks.
My fate is in your hands.
Let's talk about something else.
The light came out, and we stayed there in the dark.
I'm planning on taking off my room.
The loo stopped, and he wasn't willing to go any further.
He accused them of stealing.
I think you're the only one who needs help.
I decided to join the volunteer firemen.
Tom stopped, but then he fell back.
I love her dance.
I wouldn't leave today.
That woman's pregnant there is her current wife.
I got the letter.
I feel much better today.
That's exactly what you're doing.
You can't do anything wrong by learning a language.
You're kidding me or I'm kicking you out.
Is everything ready?
I gotta go.
I don't know.
There's nothing to justify their existence.
The mathematicians are expensive, they just need to prove what their imagination has created.
I'm working together.
He was afraid of the disorder at best.
No one knows what will happen in the future.
Good morning, honey.
What do you think of modern art?
Not Tom my name.
It's hot today.
He's the hottest boy in our class.
Tom's in the room, isn't he?
Rome didn't build it in one day.
How old were you when you started learning French?
What happened to the money?
We need to protect ourselves from all attempts to lose our freedom.
You've been drinking ten for a week.
What did you do last night?
We're just a bunch of guys!
Tom's fates were not clear.
Do you have my book?
Please think about it.
Tom did what he liked.
I see the light.
I'm just as guilty as anybody else.
You're worse than me.
Don't move me back here.
There's nothing urgent.
Tom's not gonna hurt me.
Green grass.
You can't always win.
It's an ice cream.
I feel like I can't do it.
God be with you!
I'm calling.
It's been ten o'clock tonight.
The road's full of cats.
What do the news say?
You were lucky.
Can I go home?
If the time's up, let's go pee.
I love you, but I'm not in love with you.
- Who's this?
I'm sure I'll win this tennis score.
I went to Boston.
One of us is wrong.
I'm surprised what I've learned.
Your grandson has two sides.
We're boys.
I'll see you tomorrow.
Would you do me an example of this?
I have to give you a message.
He said he doesn't know.
It's worse than we thought.
You know my secrets.
You've lost your tattoos.
I swear they're carrying it.
He told the boys to run.
We have twelve children.
It's my favorite thing to read.
You'll get used to it soon.
I don't know why Tommy went to the hospital.
The prices are down.
I'm not sorry if I have to wait.
We helped each other.
It happened when he was out.
Tom painted the door green.
Just start working.
I'm sure I'll listen.
Tom pulled out Mary's car.
Let's see.
You're the most important thing in my life.
But the proposed changes opposed each other.
I met this tree.
Tom's released.
Can I get the whole name?
Uncle!
I'm gonna talk to him about what he says.
I told you this wouldn't be good.
Tom gave Mary a kiss.
Don't complain, don't explain.
Here's her passport.
I saw one.
What's your profession?
Chief Tom Mary.
Little or no chance of finding real matches.
They left Tom in the womb.
I'm glad I'm late.
Tommy didn't mean one to Mari.
I want to make a smile on your door.
Is that a bear?
I met Tom and Mary.
Is that a faggot?
There's a military base nearby.
You have to do this.
I've got a bad day.
All right, people, let's go!
Tom went on a trip with his friends.
I heard Tommy and Mari were getting married in October.
The white ball is as hard as the red one.
It's got to be here.
Can you get in there with the car?
I don't think this photo is comfortable.
Tommy got water from the tea.
Tom tried to reduce his costs.
Tommy got his dog to sit down.
Don't Tommy ever come back?
I think you know him.
It's not like talking out loud.
It may need Tominak.
For me, he's like a king.
It looks like a son.
I came from Japan.
I saw Dana.
Tom's good for the animals.
I didn't register.
The salt you've put in your pocket, white, not pink.
I always take care of you.
Tom started cleaning.
I'm going to work every day.
You look hot.
We need to stop him now.
Do you really believe in magic?
I don't know exactly where I was born.
I'm afraid of Tommy.
I'm glad we agreed on something.
Then the bear came to the slender, threw down her velvet, and touched her master's bed, which she gave to her. For a moment, the skin was transformed into a baluette from her skull, and the tallicska was transformed into a dome, which had two dancing pairs.
Don't make a mistake.
Don't you understand now?
He's sacrificing his time for books.
He's tall?
I'll wait for Tomira.
I heard you're not going home.
I'm going to kill you for your complaint.
The next day, I was on my way home.
The police found a corpse in an unmanaged car near the park.
I'm sure you can do it.
The sun is in the center of our solar system.
You're done?
He's been working all his life.
We had a ten-mile walk that day.
Tom can't do it to get a babysitter.
Clear!
I dropped my hair yesterday.
You can finally get some sleep.
Cathy stopped the flowering.
The number of traffic accidents is increasing year by year.
Start living.
It's like you don't want this to happen to me.
He's been following the man's murder.
Many will die.
The next case comes to the 2nd floor and continues at 4:35 Shibuya.
You did?
What are they doing there?
Do you want a cup of tea?
Is there any more of this?
I can't find my other box.
Tom's partial.
Apolonians take care of the patient at night.
People don't feel special today if a man grows his hair a long time ago.
A boy was able to get my wallet back when I was in my wheelchair.
Who do you trust?
Here's my e-mail address.
Can you help me get a cab?
Tominak was an alibi.
I know whether he's an enemy or not.
Can I do something for you?
You know the whole city.
Someone hit me.
Mary's not that pretty.
That bookstore was a couple of dozen.
He wanted to go.
Tom's lack of flexibility.
I'm going to Australia next.
You Japanese?
He was a poor musician.
The animals are our friends.
I don't like such surprises.
He was an impeccable man.
It's an opportunity.

Be willing to help.
They're both excavated.
One of us has to do it.
I'd like to kiss you.
Make sure you're not kidding me.
I'm on the line now.
What caused the accident?
It's the queen's wedding.
I don't even remember a good ride.
I'm a fighter.
Let's see what's going on.
I'm Tom and I'm dependent.
Tom wanted to be good.
The best footpins are gay.
Can you explain the difference between black and green tea?
We need guidance.
That's what I've been doing all day.
Those who want to see the dolls must also wear the beads.
I don't want meat.
What's worth more, time or money?
The world's on top of the roof.
Money laundering.
That's not important right now.
Don't get scared.
He stopped the non-lethal injection.
What's the problem?
I need water.
Why did they kill Tom?
It's pretty simple.
Aren't you ready?
When I was ready to call, a letter came from him.
Titek?
Tom is a very close friend of mine.
I don't even like him if he does.
He's always asking for your opinions.
She's our youngest daughter.
Jim loves his girlfriend very much.
I want a lawyer.
They're doing something on their own.
She's actually practicing breastfeeding.
We'll protect you.
I want my barbaric dictionary back, and now.
He's a good boy.
He was hit in a car accident.
What happened to you?
Let's drink another beer.
I came to you today, but you weren't home.
I'll let Tom know.
You're better than me.
You're singing, aren't you?
I'm going home.
He doesn't speak English at all.
You know what's gonna happen?
She thought she took a bike to her son in secret.
I'm sorry I haven't written that long.
I was tired already.
Tom alone has no right to our family.
How far is it?
You're starting to get caught.
Cover up the world.
We have visitors.
Where's your gun?
He wants to know everything about you.
Why do the bears suddenly appear near the herd?
Why are you speaking French?
Before I go home, I'm drinking a couple of drinks.
They live near the gas.
I have two positions.
Tom and Mary were interviewed.
The storm's gone.
I don't understand his way of thinking.
That's why people get so drunk.
Tom used to call Mary's joke.
Drop the gun!
Who's this record?
I wasn't wrong.
You remember me.
I didn't think so.
How many rooms do you have in your house?
I speak Spanish.
Why didn't you call me before you got here?
It was less interesting than I thought.
This bank always has its own interests in mind.
When did you send the Christmas boys down?
Feel at home.
Was Tom busy?
It's got to be either Tom or John.
How'd you get your name?
The head dies while the dolphin is still alive.
How long are the oranges going to be?
Can anyone confirm this?
He doesn't sleep at night because he's trying to save his weak business.
Not a word!
Do you know why God is blue?
I know how to use rehab.
Layla got a text message from Sami.
It's a problem.
The boys will be happy.
I'm not making it for the money.
Tom didn't get one with Mary.
It could be expensive.
I hope so.
I really like the album.
I don't know any of them.
It's locked.
Did you hear about yesterday's fire?
I know what I did.
I think you're already busy and ready to move.
It's hard to believe it's been clear and it's been a long time.
For most people, it's very disturbing if they have to talk before the public.
Get up!
When did you work in Boston?
No one knew who did this.
What are you talking about?
How old are you?
Let's go into the classroom.
Tom's shy.
There are people who can easily be affected.
I don't understand why I shouldn't do that.
It's not a bad idea.
Which way are you going?
Tom's listening.
There's no evidence.
I think you're gonna be fine.
There's no one there.
Our return is coming back to our childhood.
Can I sing?
I'm here to help you.
He came to Tokyo in his early teens.
I don't like the moon.
What's the matter?
The dead man's inexhaustible.
I took my cat to the zoo yesterday.
Tom wanted Mary to help him in the garden.
There's a phone in my room.
You're too busy looking for a treasure.
Everyone's alive.
John started the car.
Please explain.
Who cares for the children?
This is the cold room.
All the students are home.
You know enough.
Don't worry, I can do it.
The business is business.
You should talk to your mom more often.
We're not so stupid.
The kiwi is sizeless, unpretentious.
You can bring water to the moon, but you can't give it to me.
When does the music begin?
He's not gonna take anything into his life.
I'll find your way of thinking.
People believe in God.
Tom and Mary didn't try to name it too loud.
Look what you did to me.
That's the lady's douche.
You're bad.
Tom's the most famous boy in school.
When were you the best?
That's my favorite painting.
You're gonna have to finish it.
I'm in smoke.
Is this going to affect me?
I'm always drinking two cups of coffee in the morning.
I took Tom from his books.
I don't know where Tom's accident is.
This is the last Saturday.
I've been running all this morning.
That was great.
Maybe I'll get up later when I'm really hungry.
Is there anything between you guys?
Don't ask why, just do it.
My dream is to be a teacher.
It's very nice of you.
How many hours did you go to breakfast?
Take this flower off.
There had to be a reason for this.
We're stuck in our gods.
Don't stay long.
Oh, no!
I'd rather go there by bicycle than by bicycle.
Tamás and Maria said they don't like dogs.
Tom made a lot of progress this week.
Are you really sending me a Japanese baby?
I didn't go to Australia with Tommy.
We'll wait.
I didn't mean to tell you that.
Just read a book.
He's too heavy.
As far as I know, he never made such a mistake.
I'll take the car.
We're not living together.
You're sick.
They'd like to.
They won't succeed.
I helped Tom.
There's a table made from a tree.
We're gone.
The cat's adorable.
How's everybody doing?
If it's really so high on your pump, maybe it's time for you to get out.
Can you forgive me?
Who's staying?
I want to learn French for the next time.
I'm awfully innocent of kids.
Tom is 13 years old, but he still believes in Mikulas.
Why don't you sleep yet?
I hope I can see her again.
Tom's got us all fucked up.
He's got a bivalve head and a Russian courage.
It worked well.
There are more houses behind the houses.
The sea was full of rabbits.
The force of gravity has happened in the ocean and filled it.
Please don't leave.
Tom can't stop it.
I had doubts.
Is that dangerous?
Tom's gonna pick up Marit at the airport.
He lives in another state.
I'm working to live, but I'm not living to work.
Stay right there.
He knows everything about breeding.
I gave my dad a piece of candy.
Tommy used to call Marit?
He was self-defensed.
Tom knew everything.
Come with me.
I can't forgive you.
I think you called a bad number.
My monkey ran away from the cage.
The movie's still alive.
Tell me which answer?
The pictures are talking about themselves.
Tommy told them to sit down.
Tom doesn't like boobs.
Write it down as soon as possible.
You're tied up with your shoelace.
Germany is the best language in the world.
Tom should have been a lawyer.
Actually, she's my daughter.
Please fill out this envelope and wait for our notification.
I'll take you to the station.
Don't ask me to help you again.
Where are your kids now?
It's my son's feelings.
I still have a lot of time to have fun.
Tom's talking half.
Tell them everything you know.
Of course!
Is there an elevator here?
Where am I now?
Tom got sick of eating.
Here's the address.
Tommy got a message from Mari.
Mari didn't marry her.
There's one side missing.
Where can I get my copy?
A month ago he went to London.
I don't like your friend.
He's not here today.
He took the farmer's daughter as his wife.
I don't want my kids to smoke.
My car is older than I am.
I missed you, didn't I?
The modern man is no longer happy without a car.
Help's on the way.
He's using this information.
I saw something.
Can I make some suggestions?
Mary was looking for you then.
I found a place to live.
Where's Tom going to prepare pictures?
Bring me some rice.
None of us are afraid.
It's not a whole story.
What are these good for?
Her parents were out of town.
And what can you show me about that?
How long has Tamás been working here?
It's a monster.
He's speaking honestly.
Tom knows much about Mary.
What's the 67th?
They've been kidnapped.
Those girls are very busy.
Are you sure it's okay?
Tom lied to the witness's father.
I'm reading the letter.
We're satisfied.
That it doesn't mean you're smart.
Tom didn't change it.
I tried to sleep.
I'm good at dealing with kids.
She kissed me again.
I think I'm starting to lose my head.
We've got each other.
There's a robbery down there.
Tom knew about the robbery.
I was there with her.
It's all for one second.
The old man hit a car.
I've got to cut my throat.
Caligula was a Roman emperor who heard the name Invititus, which means "gear".
I should never have listened to you.
It's really sad.
We're sick.
They've got their reasons.
This tree was my father's seat in the year when I was born.
Let me rest a little.
I don't know much about dogs.
This lady looks very good.
The tour is my favorite meal.
Look at Tom.
Everyone's got nothing to do with it.
What do you want to do with him?
Tommy deleted his Facebook page.
This fat contains a list of milk, milk, milk and sugar.
I don't like to work; what if we were to go to the movies instead?
You should look at the cake.
It's so beautiful.
I need to change.
It's a pretty popular man in China.
I'm kidding.
Today, we want our children to make their own decisions, but we expect them to fit in with us.
I'm afraid of the bullets.
I always knew this day would come.
I'm glad you liked it.
Mari got caught up in front of you.
Tom went to bed many years ago.
It's half an hour.
It's a red shirt!
It doesn't work.
Are you kidding me?
He hurt her.
Tom was just a moment.
They're drinking too much.
What's your hair look like?
Who founded the Google Translator?
Mary asked Tom what he thought.
That's great.
I doubt you'll remember.
He's gone mad.
They've been married for six months.
Shall I take you somewhere?
Tom's scarf.
Tom's boss.
I killed him in a rage - there was no significant murder before.
We need to count the voting schedules.
I don't like the cold.
Don't worry, it's not the end of the world.
You'll get used to living here in moments.
Tom's a retired cop.
They don't know us.
One liter of milk contains about three grams of white.
Don't forget to write to us.
I underestimated Tom.
I don't know for sure.
Life starts when you're ready to live it.
Tom's working hard to support his family.
I hope my boss will understand the plan.
Can I show you?
All the money was there.
How lovely!
I need to talk to him.
He's dead.
Tom took Mary's name off.
I did it like he didn't understand it.
A good sense of humor helps in difficult situations.
You got it?
I'll see you later.
That'll be interesting.
Are they gone?
I've got a black hair.
Yesterday was a spring, but today's more.
We need to warn Tom.
Sometimes I'll meet you next week.
Stop it.
What operating system are you using?
Did Tom open it for the living room?
The hotel's completely covered.
Did someone fall asleep?
Tom's a good teacher.
All right, Tom!
Paraszt!
Where's your safety?
Maria's own wedding dress.
Tom's a good boss?
He's trying to get his ass kicked.
Can you imagine the retreat of the Bible?
Someone broke my house last week.
How often do you lose things?
Do we have any papers?
I suggest you talk to Mary.
I'll explain later.
Hold always shows the same page to Earth.
Tommy hasn't been out all week.
You should've come here earlier.
His words were exactly those.
He looks young.
Don't be too direct.
The dog's chasing strangers.
It's all right.
He's aware of your risks.
Zukni's gone.
Tom haemophilia.
You never tell me you love me.
Please, there will be a little more careful in the future.
It was Sami's island.
He doesn't have a lot of friends.
You're free here?
Who kissed Tom?
Tom and Mary answered it once.
Have you already taken Petanque?
There's also a designer witch.
I'm not here.
I can't follow your logic.
What do you want to do in the future?
Tom's safe.
We understand the target.
No one was there.
All my questions were answered.
I knew you'd get into trouble.
Tommy's got a guest.
I feel a living pain.
I'm willing to risk it.
How can you say that?
I don't want to sleep.
I don't believe a word from him.
My birthday is November.
Did you guys behave well today?
You're stupid!
I worked hard last month.
Tom slept in two packed chairs.
Here you go. Your beer.
Is that a problem for you?
Why did you take this guy?
Who wrote this?
He's going!
I felt pretty lonely.
I'll go to my friend.
Don't give up on me!
Time's going to be fast enough if you read something.
Tom's thinking fast.
My dream is to be an artist.
I lost my skin.
I like to sleep.
The fruit is in the basket.
I like the secret pizza.
We think our boy's very smart, of course he's not just that we're accepted.
We got it.
Mary said she wasn't Tom's daughter.
Have you eaten in my restaurant where Tom works?
I hope it works.
I came here to bring my dog.
Are you in school teaching French?
You're poor.
Make yourself strong.
I'm so sorry about you, Tom.
She'll be gone right away.
Where were you when I needed your help?
The coffee's ready.
You only love my black hair?
I'm sure I've heard this sound somewhere.
The doctor's taking her to the hospital.
I'll be there in the morning.
I'm not well paid.
Why are you wasting your time?
My family isn't too big.
Please move forward.
There are more cars on the way than yesterday.
I hope they're okay.
Tominas had to know it was coming.
Tommy's a little too heavy.
My sister loves Tomit.
It's too late.
I'll see you tomorrow.
Tom doesn't.
We have to pay the tax.
Tom's been down on the ground.
They don't respond.
Keep doing what you did.
Eat some!
We'll take care of it later.
I'm Israeli.
They got into the woods.
How can you wait in the kitchen for me to pay for that?
Tom asked Mary where John lives.
If it hadn't been on the map, I'd've forgotten.
I think he's coming.
There's a kiss tomorrow.
Are you kidding me?
Can you tell me exactly what you really want?
My wife's gone.
We don't want anything from you.
You know where the problem comes from.
What were you looking at?
I don't think Tom knows where I live.
I'm asking you for three ice cream.
Tom's in his pocket.
I'll wait.
Tom musto.
No one lives in this house.
As far as English is concerned, no one can stop it.
Spongy him!
You're not gonna die.
Did they get Tom out?
My horse is white.
You got it.
We should be comoly.
Is the museum open today?
Tom's not about to stand on the line.
The wifi doesn't work for me.
I'll be late once again.
Do you learn English every day?
Good luck with the competition.
That won't be enough.
Looks like it.
I didn't sleep.
At least Tommy's asking me to love him.
No one sees my ease.
He was born in Mohamed Mekka.
Tom and Maria are on their way.
Look at the words you don't understand.
Who's the smartest man you know?
I want you to be all right tomorrow at this time.
The spring days are over and they're replaced by the spring winter days.
Why me?
I've never thought of this before.
They didn't see anyone.
I'm the boss, aren't I?
My son came to the room.
It doesn't look like Tommy's happy to see us.
Shortly after Tommy died, his wife was repatriated.
Tom's love dog.
I didn't do what I should have done.
Do you have Tom's tattoo?
I'm not sorry to apologize.
Please stay where you are.
I don't travel much.
He stayed in France for a while and then went to Italy.
He's always busy.
There's a certain possibility that my life will be affected.
He loved his job.
Did you find anything?
Stay away from me!
Why didn't Tom get on the bus?
The suit can be extended.
Even ten times a day.
It's very white.
You left last night.
We haven't even had a concert in Boston yet.
Tom probably doesn't know why Mary's not here.
Don't worry.
Good people look good, no matter what they're wearing.
You look like you're all around.
Tom's on the table now.
It's dangerous here.
I can't make this noise.
I'm so glad we met.
Tom doesn't trust anyone.
Tommy's rich, but Mari's not.
We should probably go.
I like coffee.
You know who Tom is?
I'm willing to buy you.
We're understanding.
It'll be a new day tomorrow.
We need a show.
The world's got a problem.
Tom's losing.
They're playing baseball after school.
They're both named.
You've done a perfect job.
He's stuck in the photo.
Tommy wants some books.
There's milk on the day.
What are they gonna do?
Tom led the attack.
Tom never eats eggs at all.
No, it's not my house.
I live in New York.
Our coffee's gone.
Let's fight!
What would you do if your child were like that?
My kids weren't used to lying to me.
I'm not proud of my daughter.
That's never gonna end.
They're both named.
I wish you wouldn't do it now.
I tried to help Tominak.
Your soul is in the dust.
I'm sick and my head hurts, I think I'll get sick.
I'm starting to get in.
Put it down.
He won his love.
He's out of class.
That's where you can give me that piece of shit?
I think Twitter is just a waste of time.
Come on, get it.
Tom asked Mary exactly what I was saying.
Hold no one.
We were born here in this world.
I helped Tominak restore his son-in-law.
I forgot to take flowers to Evan.
We didn't do it for Tommy.
He could've kissed a kisser, but he didn't. He just forgot.
We're not so poor.
He's working for the pay and not because he's enjoying it.
I know who hurt you.
I'm dependent.
It's time for the tree queen to reach the forest.
He's a good friend.
He's been doing some scientific discovery.
On Tom's computer, the secret map contains hundreds of hermelin videos.
Why are you so tired today?
My food's gone.
How many people do you think we call the party?
Tomina doesn't have a lot of books.
I have doubts as to whether it's gonna work.
Let's get out of here!
There's no sport there like me.
I got my phone.
Tom came back to the hotel.
Do you have a TV?
What am I gonna do with Tommy?
I feel better every day.
I feel like I'm crazy.
What do the doctors say?
I forgot my name.
Be nice, help me.
He didn't say anything.
Why are you asking for forgiveness?
Tom thinks he's caught.
Did you know Tom left home?
It's a pleasure to meet you.
We're home today.
I saw Tom dance with another girl.
No one was in the room.
Tom's girlfriend's photo was thrown into the fire.
I'll go and tell everyone.
Step forward!
You're an expert.
This reminds a girl I've ever met.
I was on the list.
Give me my book back!
Although we've all done our best, we know we won't win.
He was close to suicide.
That was my finger.
She didn't say that to my mother.
Tom didn't know his water heater was leaking until he got a big water account.
This will be our secret.
Why are you upset?
I'm sorry, but I didn't fully understand what you were saying.
Last night there was a fire near us.
It's better if we go, Tom.
It's probably a little sleep for everyone.
I'm pretty sure Tom won't stop this.
It's just a matter of time for Tom to get in trouble again.
I dropped it on the plane.
Are you home?
The mountains are taking over the mountain.
That's what I think.
How can I understand you?
It's in the kitchen.
I should've done it with you.
I probably don't want to eat the same again today.
I guess Tamas was right.
Here's my membership card.
I'm the only one who got Tama to help.
Tom's been away.
One of my bikes is defective.
I wasn't used to having lunch with Tamás.
It's over, isn't it?
It's been raining since you loved it.
I'm gonna hold on.
This statement has not yet been translated.
Tom's waiting too long.
It's very light.
Man doesn't come from my monkey, except some.
We're gonna be fine.
Tom wants to learn how to swim.
I've got a hard day today.
Here's your bag!
An intelligent person who discovered something less interesting than sex.
Tom Mokus always has.
He loved both of them, and they loved him both.
I can't stop calling him.
Try someone else.
Remember what you said?
Put your hair down!
He's just drinking hot water.
Personally, I find it more fun to have sex with the usual sex.
That's incredible.
After you waited, he started to get stupid.
I need volunteers.
Tom and I know the truth.
It's a crime.
Tom's gonna fuck up.
Do you have an e-mail address?
You got it, you're not ready.
Tommy knew where Maria got her car.
You should've landed already.
Tom and Mary are not living in the same state.
Look!
Don't keep your scarf in your dad's mouth.
Sometimes I go to the music.
He never lived in Boston.
Don't criticize me.
He was looking for something in the dark.
I'm not gonna shoot Tom.
Tom got off the phone with a meatdove.
I didn't want to tell you that.
I'm not going to Boston.
Tom should've gone home earlier.
The prices are up.
Turn your eyes off.
I didn't buy the car.
How much is the bus ticket going?
You don't do anything!
It's hard to say French?
I see a house.
Just so you know, it's a really bad deal.
It's used to poking around with us.
Did you like the artist?
I've eaten very good food in my stomach.
I slept on the floor before when I saw my grandmother and my grandmother.
We were there.
Tommy left the team after three games.
I'm gitrating.
The kiss that the painter brought to the table was still a win.
If I'm big, I'd like to be a fireman.
It's a very dangerous sport where a small error can lead to serious injury.
It's very important that you wash your hands thoroughly after you cut off your baby's scarf.
It's up to them now.
Take us to town.
He spent three months on the bridge.
Tom's in the closet.
It's just that he started reading the book when someone knocked at the door.
I just started working when the phone broke.
I feel helpless.
Inductive fireplaces use magnets to direct fires and snakes.
Thank you for having me.
They've got everything they need.
He's always on my side.
No one likes a logo.
He's alive.
It's all right, it's over.
The police officers arrested the guard.
I like things like that.
You're ready to go or not.
Why did you become a lawyer?
I've changed.
You shouldn't wait a long time.
Tom seems to enjoy the party.
Why doesn't Tom want to come with us?
What a mess!
What a mess!
Tom put the boxes together by the wall.
It's related that the bear loves the size.
We were young.
Don't worry about getting drunk.
I'll see you soon.
Do you ask them to wait?
I woke up. I was late for school.
Where's the phone book?
I'm fine.
The cats are gonna get them.
He parked his car down on an empty floor.
It's his Christmas gift.
You know what?
It's never too late to learn.
Look at Google Translator.
You're my princess.
What a wonderful place!
We could do something for Tom.
I'll keep this in mind.
It was a big house.
We're happy to accept your offer.
I'm sorry.
It wasn't Tom.
What if we were to go out for dinner tonight?
The dreams have become real.
Don't get used to it.
Tom told me he was home last night.
I didn't tell anyone you were here.
That's very good news.
Does that matter at all?
Majuko designed his own clothes.
That's what's going on in Australia.
The trash is an exciting language.
I wanted to know the truth.
What kind of movies do you want to watch?
Tom's breathing.
Please fix this.
Tom lost his leg as a result of his capitulation.
Can I ask you a question?
Find out what I found.
I'm a sailor.
They've got giant chicks trapped in Florida.
Tom's too young for it, isn't he?
Tommy, can you hear me?
I couldn't get my fingerprints down.
I just don't want to die today.
Tom's ready to come home.
It was like a father to me.
You're gonna hurt her.
Help's on the way.
Do they speak French in Canada?
I wish I could do it.
Keep looking.
I hope you don't mind if I leave early.
Come on, how you are!
I think they're joining us.
You woke up.
I'm looking for my phone.
Frightened.
No one can stop it anymore.
Who did you see?
I'll sleep here.
Tom got Mary out of the house.
Mari was hurt when Tommy bought her some ice cream.
Japan's a group of lakes, lots of hills and almost no forest.
We're usually having a lot of fun.
He put the blue folder on the table.
Two years old, but not as tall as I am.
This meat's so cool.
It took a lot of time for me to write this book.
I like to follow the tradition at night to make a trip by the bridge.
What can we count on?
There's a piece in my print.
The animals are scared of the fire.
It wasn't a week ago.
Don't go to college just because they're waiting for you.
The box's almost empty.
This is gonna happen.
It would have been better if we hadn't done it.
I gave Tom a key to my office.
There's got to be an interpreter.
You understand women's language.
I think Tom's still unemployed.
I'm asking you to pay attention.
I'm ready to help you at any time.
We'll take care of it.
The battery's down.
He found a good meeting for me.
We'll all die sooner or later.
You didn't sleep well last night, did you?
Have you been sick?
Tom's on his way to the station.
He couldn't stop Tommy's family.
We've been trying to warn you.
I found that our wool was very complicated, contrary to the spree, which is very simple.
You'd better take care of it.
Tom loves the kids.
Today's fun.
It's so unscathed.
Tommy touched my hand.
Who brought this?
She's full of her pasta glass.
These bananas don't feel.
Let's get out of here.
But I don't have a bear.
I think you were right.
Where'd they hold the wedding?
I'm swimming in the river.
It wasn't the first time they did this.
The water's cold.
It was a beautiful summer day.
Sometimes I feel stupid.
That's a good place.
Do you have any questions?
It's sabotage.
Smell all night, sweating in the morning.
When do they keep the choices?
Tom's supportive.
Tom's gone in.
I sat in a chair in Bern at the office of freedom when I suddenly thought that if a man was free, he wouldn't feel his own weight.
Speak aloud so everyone can hear you.
A new system is installed on the railway.
We believe in God.
They forgot about you.
Where are we going tonight?
He's dressed in a man's suit.
We should have bought three bottles of wine.
May I borrow it?
I can't find Tim.
Stand straight.
Thania's position is temporary.
I hope so, okay.
That's not interesting.
You've always been like that.
The sun fell down on the horizon and sank down.
Which fear did he win?
Tom's home.
Tom pulled out a piece of meat and put it on his desk.
I'll try it again.
You never know what's going to happen.
If everything goes well, they graduate in 2001 at the university.
The decision was postponed.
It's never happened to me like this.
Danina's got three-hour flight.
He wiped his face off with a zsebkent.
I don't understand what's so boring about this.
I'll catch up with Tom.
Tom left it here.
I was the only one who survived.
He advised her to get rid of the doll, but she didn't listen to him.
Cover him with your clothes!
Tom did the rest.
Are you hungry at all?
My watch is cheaper than yours.
I can't remember how Tommy looked.
Are you crazy or what?
We appreciate your ability.
I feel better.
The director of the new movie is a child's angel.
He's in college.
They give fundamental freedoms to a small security of the Middle East, and none of them deserve it.
She's brave for her creation.
He looked into his face.
Why don't you come with us?
Tom saw someone.
She's a real monster!
I love the game.
You're wrong.
Dani treated me with respect and respect.
But it's not bad for you.
If I were you, I'd ask him.
Do you know this man?
I have to work tonight.
What do you think the TV was watching in this room last night?
Tom wanted to keep you the stolen money.
I had a half-grapefruit in the morning.
I don't think there's a God.
Tom doesn't know who to believe: John or Mary.
Age doesn't mean you don't have to use your imagination anymore.
It was a shock yesterday.
If I had money, I'd travel around the world.
The political situation has changed.
You can go first.
Tom got into the reading and wanted to go play.
I don't know what Tomina's car is.
It's Sunday.
I should've stayed out of it.
Do you have feelings for Tom?
I hate that movie.
It was yesterday.
I'll take my shoes off.
Where did you get your box?
It's just disgusting.
The next city will be left behind.
What are you reading now?
There are scenes and colors that take security guards to keep them away from too much air.
Shall we go to the museum now?
I know you can do this.
He didn't know this about Tom.
These were his last words.
Tom likes to play baseball.
I've become very angry.
I was disappointed for the first time.
I'd better have done it if I had more time.
Why didn't you mention there was a witness?
You can leave when it's time.
Look forward, please.
Get this ass off your ass!
Africa's human wisdom.
I'm glad Tommy's leaving.
Did you talk about this tominak?
Let's keep this between us for a while.
Do you have a volunteer?
Tom's mom's still buying his clothes.
No, no, no, no, no.
I knew Tom knew something.
Tom must have been angry.
It's over for October.
Maybe he's still waiting for her.
Welcome to Boston.
I'm always late.
Tom was sitting at the end of the table.
Tom was nice, but Mary wasn't.
You're more than you think.
I've seen more than Tom knows.
If you don't behave well, Mikulas won't come.
You're too young to buy cigarettes.
It was a mistake to kiss Tom.
Tom seems restless.
This glass is almost larger than you.
Do you accept some advice?
Oh, that's why it's about.
Zagrab Croatia's capital.
That's inevitable.
It's not worth working with this guy.
You two talked to me.
Fuck!
Tom needs to take better care of himself.
Why don't you take off your pants?
What?
Tom says the leaves are too sourced.
I know the secret.
The fire burned the apartment.
Who's gonna do it?
Tom should've done that sooner.
It's staying in a hotel.
I loved that art.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
He told us a story about a boy, Tom Sawyer.
Tom can take it off.
He who doesn't drink in a company is either a thief or a spy.
It's a mess.
This moment should never end.
They were placed on their own on condition yesterday.
- Can I take a look at your face?
Please give her my best wishes.
Tom couldn't open the door.
Tell this to the Hungarian!
Just access to the staff.
Tomina's been able to cross something.
Where do we meet?
There's no right answer.
In the early days, only the children of rich families had their own spirit.
The crystal clear water was very hot.
There's no other interesting thing.
We know an acceptable solution.
The new school was forced to take into account the special needs of young people.
Hold on, please.
Everything that happened between us was a lie?
It's a picture.
It's close enough.
Bring it up!
I'm glad you're here, Tom.
That's what Tommy tells me.
It's Tommy's property, like her boyfriend, but it's a win.
We must be Prudens.
He left without saying.
I never said that!
I don't care.
I'm so old.
I'll be there for the sugar.
I had a little smile.
I found Tom there.
Mr. Jones was late because I had a little sleep in the hour.
Henry wants to see you.
Can you eat?
I've got a meeting today.
We're not leaving.
Tom didn't try to stop the truth.
I was happy last night.
May I ask your name?
It's all a lie.
It's my turn.
I'm sorry, but it was a big deal.
Tom should've listened to Mari.
Tom apologized to Mary for the inconvenience he caused.
I'll apologize later.
I thought he was wearing a new hat.
Hold on, please.
He left without a kiss.
I need to see it.
Don't leave me alone.
It'd be very nice a little coffee.
There's plenty of flowers in the box.
Tom called it too loud.
The answer was simple.
I shouldn't have come this early.
She's always asking for your opinion.
Let's do something else.
The collective responsibility is responsibilitylessness.
They need to learn basics of the churches, so they can teach them.
I know who I live in this house.
Who's going to drive?
I'm done after the chair.
Tom sacrificed the homo on his feet.
I usually talk to Tommy in France.
Where are you going?
It's okay.
Tom trusted his doctors.
They won't get tired of it.
Tom's gonna win the debate.
Can you keep your eyes closed for a minute and a half?
Nakamatsu was so angry at his own stupid question.
You can go, too.
I'm glad Tom was able to change his name.
I know it's weird.
I was sitting on the ground.
It wasn't just me, it was my dog.
Tom's in trouble.
I'm really sorry.
It's a public beach.
Go and get Tom's food.
That's all Tommy's got.
It's very weird.
Are you taking any medicines?
It's a terrible word.
When I give you instructions, start the computer.
Many parents think there's too much power on TV.
I've got my own idea.
Work.
You're like me.
That's so funny.
Can I play in my room?
All gods are possible, but there are only one one.
That's very, very good.
It's not a decision yet.
How much are we gonna do?
Take care of the old man.
The door's not locked.
It's Tony's book.
The bars came in time.
He's been careful.
You know I can do it.
That's not enough.
He looked at his cell phone and noticed that three of you already have two.
Tom was home when it happened.
I'm gonna take a look at it.
I got a nice point.
The scientific reward was decided to offer its financial well-being.
I didn't find out.
His name's Tom, and not John.
I'm not going to school on Sunday.
I'm gonna get some rest next month.
I'm glad I'm not a woman.
This book is amazing.
Do you remember who I am?
Let's all dance!
He's just a man.
Can I help you, sir?
I want to know why women live more than men.
I can't stay in this house.
I'll pay you well.
They're both in the box.
I talked to the doorman about my room's packs.
Is the cook alive or dead?
He could be the man I need.
I hate to say that, but Tom and Mary are right.
My pulse's out of control.
Tom was really sick.
When we got married, my parents gave me this house.
He never loses hope.
My villa fell into the house.
Every morning she tastes herself.
Take off your shoes!
I'd like to say thank you for everything you did.
Tom suggested I don't do it.
I'm not happy at all.
I'm sorry about last night.
It's time for us to say goodbye.
I'm not sure that's a good idea.
It happened to me several times.
The trees are famished.
Tom asked Mary to come in.
It works perfectly with the iPhone.
Maybe it's a trap.
Remember him coming home early.
Tom got up in the morning.
We've only had enough lives for three days and we've got to go and see.
You've got a good memory.
Why are you looking for me?
Ten months after he left, he took it home.
Tom's here too late.
Tom's out.
Your statements are the only ones that should be translated on this website.
What's my price for tomorrow?
I think he's gone.
Let's keep a little low.
It's embarrassing to run, but it's useful.
You'll get to know the heat.
I don't.
They offered it to me.
That's unusual.
In capitalism, there's no need for a man to buy.
He's been surprised by the horror of the wedding.
I don't care what's going to happen.
I don't like to talk about it.
It's too small for you.
Tom gave Mary everything.
Keep trying.
Give me a drink.
Muiriel is 20 years old.
- A drink?
He lifted the ceiling and now it's like a house.
I'll read a letter.
I don't remember asking for your opinion.
I used to sleep on the open doors.
He's got a newspaper.
If you live abroad, you need a car.
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.
I'd like to help him, but I don't know how.
You're crazy.
My patience has reached its limit.
Tommy brought flowers to Mari.
This doesn't happen to me first.
Don't fight!
I can get rid of it.
It can take a long time.
Good morning, Mike.
I'll be here.
I don't know his name.
Which ten favorite movies do you like?
I'd like some things.
He's got his thoughts on paper.
John likes to suck.
It's Valento Maria.
Please fix it.
Where's Mom?
Tommy's never seen Marit like this before.
You're under the roof.
This computer is the most expensive.
I'm armed.
The son of the kidnapper broke his name.
I wish I had learned harder in my early teens.
That's the right price.
I need paper and toll.
I hate to answer.
Tommy's weird.
Why do you want to be jealous?
Don't compare yourself to others.
Your dinner's in the south.
We're classmates.
Are you still here this afternoon?
At least you paid attention to me.
Tom's got short hair.
Do you have a lover?
My son has become a man.
Everyone's at risk.
Did they get caught up in the mall?
The protection program can't be very well calculated.
It's all mine.
Tom was tired.
Can I pay for MasterCard's card?
Who can do this?
Don't be disrespectful.
When you wake up tomorrow morning, you'll find something wonderful.
I don't know when he's coming?
I don't think I'll ever get used to Korean food.
Scientists have identified the entire genetic state of the bone marrow.
I don't know what you heard about it.
He likes the ice cream.
You're careful.
Tom's gonna sit down.
The bars were stopped because of the heavy rains.
Tom went to work and used to get news.
I'm sorry.
Tom's very energyy.
No one's named.
The world is a great place.
Look again.
I don't have any skills.
You treated like a child.
The oil and the water don't melt.
I'll tell you what's going on.
There's a few branches on the ground.
We're still trying to figure out how he got away.
You'd do better if you didn't get too much.
Tommy always keeps his word.
You're going to lose.
Please do everything you think you need.
I'd like to take a girl like that.
They're checking the ground.
Tom's done a good job.
I'm looking forward to it.
Tom always does.
She showed him my picture.
It won't work for me.
Don't open it!
What are you doing tonight?
You got it now.
Bring up the darkness, let it come in a little light.
I'll never love you.
Tom spoke.
He's got a lot of mistakes, but I love him more than I love him.
What's my number?
Tom's probably gonna be happy.
The two green dolls are around.
Did you count on anything like that?
He's been hit.
I should've been there at the meeting.
Too sweet.
We came to the store.
I'm not dead.
You know I'll take care of the test tomorrow.
Let's get to know this guy.
Tom's serious.
I can make it if I'm lucky.
This is communism.
Come on, let's talk about the flowers.
I'm sorry when you heard the story.
Some things are too difficult for me.
Don't wait for tomorrow.
It's hard for everyone to do it for his brother.
He's influential.
Our morning departure depends on the timing.
I'm three.
We don't have any examples of this.
Maybe you're making a mistake.
He's definitely not here.
That's what I've been through.
Let's not talk about it.
I'll stay home tomorrow.
Tom found a wounded man.
What's my home number?
It's a hard part.
Whatever you do, don't tell Tamas.
I'm glad you're here.
Those shoes are too small for you.
He gave the police a personal description of the one he saw.
That's where the bus comes in!
They didn't find DNA as evidence.
Tom's in trouble when he buys it.
Do you know a good doctor?
Don't come in!
You're very round.
Tominak's not the strength of parousal parking.
It's been a while.
He was so hot for dinner!
It's just like you don't know him.
I'm sure you're right.
I need a couple of hours to sleep.
What's wrong with you?
It's so nice to have this wedding.
He'll take care of his baby until his mother's gone.
I came here to talk to Tommy.
Why did you do that?
I usually get coffee at the coffee shop.
He asked for the visa.
Tom's serious.
You're different with Tom.
He likes music very much.
Tom and Marika felt good about themselves.
It's a dictionary.
A real beauty.
Mary, are you okay?
I know what you don't have to worry about.
This place is bad.
I don't believe this anymore.
Time's running out very fast.
Call Tominak!
Another thing to learn and teach a language.
You have to stop drinking.
It was Tom, wasn't it?
Tom's made a fuss.
One hour later, the wound was even higher.
What did he want?
I was on the bus.
I'll do everything except leave.
Don't worry about us.
I need money.
One dog is still alive.
I can stand against everyone, just not the temptation.
Close the door.
I need money.
That's pretty important.
We're stuck.
Tom became a little red.
There's an example here.
Thank you for asking me this question.
The door is open.
I did this for my health.
It's a kitchen.
How do we know the light is faster than the sound?
Tommy brought the letter to the French.
I want to win that game.
He's been there for about five years.
Last 30 years, but he's still lying to his parents.
I've been married for two years.
He was confused about his health problems.
Within a year my son became stronger.
How beautiful!
I think I forgot home.
I promised my parents I wouldn't drink.
Tom said he was gonna hit the Chinese.
We're very similar.
That was Chinese to me.
Oh, my God!
I won a lot in my car sales.
I see you've done this before.
Don't lose your patience.
The solution was there in front of me, I didn't even notice.
One time, one time.
That's very good.
Haven't we met somewhere?
Tom's talking a little French.
Tommy's the best player in our room.
That's really worse.
We can't wait anymore.
Where's Paris?
We appreciate his ability.
Of course, Tom loves his children.
I can't take the stress away.
We can't agree with you on this.
I'm sure she's taking care of Maria now.
Tommy can't handle the bugs anywhere.
Mary's turn was so nice that Tom took it two times.
There's Christian gold too.
I told you Tommy'd like you.
I'll be better every day.
This is dangerous.
If there's too much work, it's bad, but it's too much free.
Tom's gonna stop.
A beautiful paper was pulled out on the roof.
It was really fast.
I assured Tom that I would do it.
Of course I would.
Can I borrow three dollars?
I didn't understand.
It's good to take this substance.
I went to Rome.
Are you coming?
Did Tom grow up in Boston?
See you in the morning!
I feel that this page is a long romantic novelty, which is directed by Tom and Mari.
I have to follow you.
I bought my house for two years.
Take it and put it in the fire.
Come on, get in.
Can I take a nap?
Bad time kept them from winning.
I'll take the house and the vegetables.
Maria and Elke are not brothers.
I love the moon.
You can't vote unless you're not eighteen or older.
Tom's having fun.
I haven't eaten meat in a while.
Did you show me the book?
We urge you to implement this project immediately.
He's a good singer.
Do you know where Toledo is in Spain?
We'll work in Boston next year.
Not mine. These are my keys.
You're my life's great love.
Do you really think I can help you?
What if we get inside?
Do you read the Bible?
He's got a tattoo.
I can assure you, we're not gonna make this mistake again.
It's May's on the fifth birthday.
It's a living animal in you.
A meal shouldn't look like this.
Tommy's collecting the meteors.
Tom ruled the car with his land.
What are you doing?
Can't you do anything to stop it?
Can you stay home at the store?
First of all, don't forget to write to me.
I recognized his face.
Whatever happens, you just smile.
I'm late for the duel.
Why don't I sit down?
She's in school.
Look out here.
He'd get your help.
Wait.
Don't get your word!
They need you.
Tamás closed the door before Maria.
How long do I need this?
The student's lunch is between 11 and 1.
Three months ago they got married.
I picked up your lunch.
How many rats do you have on a cataract?
I think it's very difficult for the patient.
This wine contains water.
Close that door.
I don't wear makeup clothes.
I don't care anymore.
Tom's alive.
Tom went into his bag and pulled out a pack of cards.
I don't have the truth?
Tom and Mari went to a nice restaurant to celebrate their wedding anniversary.
Maybe Tamás's been working for a long time.
Connect the air conditioner.
What's your mother's name?
One day you live another day, you don't have to save a philanthropic.
Is your watch okay?
He died because of his lack of blood.
Tom, where are we?
I can't get down to the roof of the locker.
Oh, thank you.
I like this book at least.
Where are you going now?
She's been badly injured.
Please don't lie to me.
Tommy dances.
Tom can sit here if he wants.
He wasn't so excited at the time.
Do you have enough shoes?
The boxing Olympic boots take a very expensive pocket. Go to the Olympic town, take your jacket to the dress shop, and add an inscription: If you take my pocket, I'll kill. Olympic boots. One hour you go back and see that the pockets are gone, you have only one hole in the place: To get it first. Olympic boots.
Tom's a great dancer.
Get out of here!
The situation has improved.
The water's up to my throat.
It's actually working.
Please change the interface.
Now listen to him!
I should have said I don't feel it.
Why do you want to join the army of Tamás?
You're satisfied with your new car.
The coffee maker's on the ground, with two additions.
I was born on a farm.
I got a car.
No one's gonna die.
Sunday is the last day of the week.
Thank you all for your congratulations.
Just call Tominak.
I'm back early.
I've made Maria a playboy.
Unless you're working.
Tom's not the only one.
Quito was Japan's former capital.
Tommy's very nice to me, but Sam's got a lot more money.
Tom drank too much.
It's already got the party.
Tommy did it like he didn't know anything about it.
No one's out there.
Tom pressed the button and waited.
I don't know why she didn't think about it earlier.
It's a big heat night.
He took on greater responsibility with his new position.
Why are you so cruel?
I wish I could marry my wife.
Put down your address.
Tom's real.
When will this end?
You met my sister, didn't you?
Tom's on his way.
He wants to be great.
Tom was young and influential.
I'm asking you for a martini.
He still loves me, and I think I still love him.
Tamas had a strange dream last night.
I didn't think so.
I fixed the car yesterday.
Take my arm off.
What about me?
My fear was completely baseless.
My country is the whole world.
The grass is a kind of energy.
The worst came in.
The construction started soon.
This city's going to threaten its well-being.
The propaganda is the kind of communication they want to win.
I haven't tried yet.
We'll meet you wherever you want.
Mary is such a lovely girl that everyone loves her.
Has anything changed since?
I've got enough of everything.
The accident caused a hole.
I think Tom was the one who helped Mari.
She's gone.
Your hair's starting to get out.
I win!
The court ruled that the defendant was innocent.
We're not gonna win.
Very smart.
The bright rain didn't come in at all.
I'm in the basement.
Tom's an uninvited guest.
Mary died in the womb.
That's exactly what they want.
It's convincing.
I don't know.
You have to go to a doctor.
I can't wait anymore.
Japan is a coastal country surrounded by sea.
After my first summer training, I felt all the pain I felt as if I were smoking.
It's a long time gone.
Tom, you're synchronous.
It's my skin.
Sit down in the chair.
Who's going to be married?
Who?
I lost my chance.
I'm talking experientially like my mother tongue.
Put them on the table.
Is it true that you like sweet coffee?
I'm sorry!
Just do it.
I improvised.
Help yourself, and God will help you.
Maybe there are other reasons.
Buy cars.
You're good at lying, aren't you?
This surgery isn't fast.
I'm going home now.
I was born on a ship.
The red isn't your color.
They're here on special terms.
I'm not scared.
The language we know is a human invention.
We've got enough capital to build another bridge.
You can go home if you like.
Everyone is equal to God.
They said it was a crime.
I've got two eyes.
Do you have a YouTube account?
Where's the problem?
They can go anywhere they want.
Magdalena, my oldest daughter is like an angel.
I don't think things will change.
Tom will never know what happened.
I love Tomit.
She's staying with you.
I should've done this somewhere else.
Tom's a scientist.
Tom was one of those people who opposed the proposal.
I've got a lot of time.
I don't speak French.
Her parents are older than my parents.
Sami and Layla haven't lived together for six years.
I won the lottery.
What's the name of the horse?
No one hurt her.
Take my car.
You shouldn't take the baby out of the shower.
What a day!
You waited for Tom, didn't you?
Then no one saw her.
Me neither.
There's no better chance.
It's true, isn't it?
How long has your office been open?
I'm no longer as ugly as I was.
I'll call a beer.
We've been through a lot of times in the past year.
He didn't have more than a hundred yen.
Is everybody here?
He'll be back soon.
I'm just kidding.
Your lawyer's outlawed defense against his crime.
If I were you, I'd be right home.
Where did you learn everything?
You can't count on his help.
Are you kidding me?
He wasn't sure if he'd marry him.
I've refreshed my software.
Calm down!
Can I go?
Open door to love.
Did your parents give you anything?

I'm a member of the tennis club.
At least let us talk about it.
That's bad.
Get your hands off me!
We have to be there.
What's the video?
This is my dog.
We hope it works.
Answer me or I've threatened you.
Where did he get it?
Mary is my oldest daughter.
Tom continued his story.
A year is smarter than I am.
I'm sorry I missed you.
I thought Tom'd panic.
I know you're kidding.
Oh, my God, I killed a waiting mother.
Now there's no need for money.
Why is it dangerous?
I'm not hungry.
You were on TV already?
Look at my eyes.
The society is divided.
Knowing foreign languages is useful for everyone.
Tom should have been a sceptic.
Tom immediately noticed that someone had hurt him.
He was afraid of Mary.
It's a great song.
It's ours.
Tom didn't do anything else, he just complained.
I got a picture.
Tom doesn't have any real friends.
He got back to work.
He never existed.
Are you unhappy?
It's never too late to be what you could have been.
Tom asked me to help Mary.
We've had too many meals.
I don't think he's a man.
How many assignments do I make one day?
I think you're wrong.
They're going up to the enamel.
Okay, but what about the money?
Would you like to answer me?
He moved to Paris in 1966.
Why do people paint their hair?
I've heard of an accident.
What do you think he's lying about?
Tommy lived in a dream world, usually as usual, only the body was among us while his soul was completely different.
Tom did what Mary wanted.
Idrekatom?
What color do you like better?
Where is he now?
I really like your website.
The winter comes after the harvest.
I didn't get anything.
You don't even think about it?
Where did I put the locker?
I don't have enough money to travel.
Please make sure my room's safe while I'm awake.
Did you talk to your wife?
Slow down.
I just don't get it done.
You didn't want to show me something?
He started looking for his missing child.
We all know why.
I just don't want you to get hurt.
I learned a lot from their books.
I'm going to share the red.
Why didn't you tell me about it earlier?
The body was lifeless.
Tom told everyone he was dreaming.
It's a kiss.
Tom retired in 2013.
It's okay.
I saw a UFO.
I don't like the kid.
Who are you?
I really like being alone.
It wasn't fate.
It'll be fun when we get home.
I was surprised when I found out Tom was a Frenchman before.
It wouldn't be logical.
We need to redraw the chair.
It doesn't contain the element.
I'm competitive.
He speaks English and German.
It's time for you to move forward with something.
No one ever thought of giving it up before.
That's disgusting.
Tom's taking off his clothes.
What a pain!
How do you want them?
I'm sorry, but I can't agree with you.
I grew up in Boston.
Bacteria are everywhere.
Chris didn't have his car.
Maybe I'll die tomorrow.
I love coming.
I'm sure he'll be rich if he keeps three cars.
Tom's gonna guess.
I only knew his true fate when I met him.
What's the strongest word in the world?
Everyone's still there.
Can you explain what PKO means?
We're not afraid!
How old are you?
The bullet was fired by a superhero's gun and shot a bullet in the cell's locker.
I made an apple.
I'm really sorry I hurt you.
Shall we go?
I'm on it.
We choose colors on the basis of a specific directive.
What did you and Tom eat?
It's a miracle.
This multimillionaire has five homes in four countries.
That's the best.
He's not here right now.
Don't be such a fool!
Let's go home.
I don't want anyone to die.
He said he didn't know anything about it.
Can I go get some milk?
Did they hurt you?
I'll let Tom know.
I should've been a lot more precise.
And how do you know?
I want to see you.
Tom knows.
Is there really close to Sicily Malta?
Tom's too old for me.
It's not a crime to be black.
I grew up, but I'm not afraid of the darkness.
The ice's read.
There was Tamas and Maria.
It's fair if they get the same pay for the same job.
After that, our relationship went through a sudden change.
I spent the night.
Tom says he never liked Chinese cheese.
He's working on a testosterol.
Jim was arrested for doing the test.
What's wrong with your dog?
Tom was home all weekend.
I think I should have helped Tom.
We're not gonna let Tommy do it.
I told him I'd do the best I could.
Looks like I don't need you here.
I'd like to eat something.
Thank you for not saying "I told you."
Everything's back in the normal cycle.
How did you get into such a good mood?
You did it!
I have to leave early.
She hasn't been born.
But they slowly gave it to him.
Never underestimate a woman's feelings.
He's got libasul with his burgunny.
Let's hear a little Mozart.
He got hurt during an intrusion robbery.
Are we all ready?
That's a lot of money.
He likes old things.
Tell me clearly.
I'll get it.
Tom's useless.
I just want to do some exercise.
There's another man in his life.
Do you speak Chinese well?
I'll be there tonight.
When we got back, there were only eight teams left.
What's UFO?
I've lived there for five years.
I gave this to Tom.
You're the only one I need.
Why should this interest us?
Is there any doubt?
It was my favorite sport in high school.
The English are highly respected for their freedom.
He's really good at talking.
I know Tom's happy.
Let's not forget the main purpose of understanding.
Don't take your shirt off!
Canada's first heaven was written in French.
Let the dog out!
I'm usually gonna blow up.
Who's the man?
The robots must be attached to the world.
We need to find his way to stop Tom.
No one's taking me anywhere.
It's written on the table, "the smell of it."
I saw Tama today.
What a unique country!
Your friends are waiting for you.
Of course.
When he came out of the hall, there was only one mess on him.
These images bring up bad memories.
Are you happy?
What the hell's wrong with you guys?
I'll text you later.
In my country, it's hard to learn German.
I knew what it was.
Narance is bigger than mandarin.
Tom took a white box.
Tom wore a black hat.
Come back another time when you want it.
I've had a little sleep.
I'm ready in a few minutes.
Sit where I can see you.
Please explain my strange dreams.
I'll be ready.
I did it without you.
I'm sorry, but I think you're wrong.
I really like city life.
Tom's taking care of his own business.
It's not like looking at others.
It's the same for everyone.
I'm not stupid.
Some people have been making fun of my situation.
You forgot our wedding anniversary.
I wouldn't be lucky, but I wouldn't kill myself.
Adjust the time.
We're looking for oil.
One more time.
Be careful, this could be a trap.
I can't get away with my wife for so long.
There is still no clear definition of what the country is.
Big world.
"What happened?" "The car broke."
Don't spend money you haven't got.
It's a little early for drinking, isn't it?
They're all crying.
How long does the line go?
They've been charged with fraud.
He raised his hand.
It's always name-and-word.
You, me and him there, Joseph, we started a team.
He told me he was coming up soon.
My mom lived with us.
People don't like what they don't understand.
You're a very special man to me.
It's over.
I'm Ricardo.
Where are we going?
The news says he committed suicide.
I'm sorry, or we're done.
Is it possible to buy a personal computer in this business?
Did you eat?
Where's love?
Don't worry, I'll look at you.
There was still a month's hope that maybe everything would work out.
It's amazing that no one voted for the sign.
They've got eggs.
What the hell?
Tom's probably not gonna be here tomorrow.
Tom has to go to school.
My neck hurts a little bit.
I won't let Tom Boston go.
They found the Earth around.
The price is coming to the sea.
No one can stop it.
I know who she is.
I should've known I'd do it.
Tom's gonna be very angry.
Why are you doing this now?
Poppa, do what they tell you.
What a great show!
I can't drive a car.
Tommy wanted everyone to have a good Christmas.
Get down with the corrupt politicians!
Tommy got out of the company in 2013.
Tom and Mary were both at home.
You're afraid of this dog.
I want to get a thousand men.
She sent me a message.
He's scared.
Tom doesn't have much time to get out.
Tom wants to try it.
Tell me where the last night was at the time of the murder.
Finish it as long as you can.
Ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, ten, sixteen, eleven, eleven, eleven, twelve, fourteen, twenty.
We're half an hour after night.
You've got an hour.
I grew up in my fears.
Why did you take this bike?
Stay seated, please.
It's a black hole.
Is there enough money?
Let's start at the end of the week.
The teacher kept him after school.
I like that ring.
Where were you all?
Which sign would you like better?
Tom soon realized that Mary stole all her money.
I'll never do it without your help.
Tom agreed to go to Boston.
He sent you a book.
I've got an old man.
I need to get some rest.
It's a nice smile!
He didn't like golfing with Tom.
It's a small chance you're coming to understand.
They weren't there.
Tom's done well.
I'm tired enough.
I don't remember ever getting rid of my job, even though nothing is going on.
It's time to tell the whole truth.
We compared Tom and Mary's work.
It's a new model.
Except Tom, no one's gone.
I didn't die.
You know who said that?
We're out.
He'd like to see you.
I'm after money laundering.
It was not long before John had an idea of what he was going through.
My heart's sick.
Is everybody okay?
I keep him for my best friend.
Give me one day!
Today's happiness is on my side.
Please tell me your name.
You think Tom did it?
I don't want to go with you.
What's your action?
The base was a lot of noise.
Do you know how to play a game?
I'm trying to get some help.
Can he take us to the British Museum?
It was weird.
That's a really big number.
I want to be rich.
The kids love to laugh at us.
I came to see Tommy.
What are you smiling about?
Tom heard the car's coming back.
You've been there before.
Do you know your family?
Some of them are on the way out.
Tom's done it again, as usual.
Don't they still have hands?
You want me?
We can't wait two weeks.
We'll go see you later.
I called my daughter Nairu and wanted her a long life.
How did you know Tom Boston was going?
Tom never asked why.
Don't talk to him while he's driving.
This is the best time to stay home and not go anywhere.
He's got five pounds.
Tommy tried to stop his family.
I don't think Tommy was able to do all this alone.
I can't stand the weekend.
Tom's been having fun with the kids.
There's a hole in it.
Can I help you?
I don't have much time.
I'm a soldier.
I read it.
He knows Mr. Davidson well.
Tom has a lot of knowledge, but he's a very little friend.
My boss is a rapist.
Let's do it.
I heard Tom was injured.
I'm glad you're back.
Robbie can't fire you.
I don't know anything about France.
They do everything for each other.
More and more are required to use the media's interactive nature.
I know where you live.
Tommy's gone.
My father doesn't drink alcohol.
I must've lost my key on my way.
He's always gone for a lie seven hours ago.
Tom's ready to talk.
We're missing.
Do I love you any more?
They wanted me back.
We'll lose everything.
I don't think they're gonna marry you.
Give me the sugar, please.
What did Tom read?
He hired Maria's camera.
That's exactly what I thought.
I'm drinking tea too.
Tom's got two less games than Marina's.
Drop the gun!
Let's go to the museum.
The air conditioner.
I know you like coffee.
Turn this text down.
I have to let you go.
Tom doesn't eat too often Italian food.
Tom, you've been walking a lot before dinner.
Tommy took Marit's leg off.
I need three minutes to get there.
They hurt me like a kid.
How much are you hungry?
No one lives in this house.
You don't have to get into this area.
Tom should never have returned.
It doesn't have to be arranged.
Yes, the lady is our manager.
I'm not very hungry right now.
That's better.
He missed school because of his illness.
Those roses aren't as beautiful as these.
He decided to drive a red car.
Use your own money.
No one knows their name.
Let's trust him not.
You're drunk.
Who noticed that?
I didn't steal it.
I'm sure Tom's found guilty.
Where are you, Karen?
Are you saying it's my fault?
Tom should've done it right now.
It's just something you're talking about.
His grandfather named him.
It might be a problem.
Who has the key?
I hate when Tom does this.
I'd have started writing a letter when I was home.
Tom was nice.
The same old problem.
Tom was taken into custody.
Tom's honest.
Get out of your ass!
Peter's alive at night.
I'll see them today.
I'm gonna have to get out of here.
I like to use it.
It was enough once.
Good education can't be measured in money.
He's got a guitar, the man sings.
It's so comfortable.
Tom wasn't there last night.
It's been a long time.
Where can I find the information?
We went to the woods.
My dad wouldn't be right.
Being a cop isn't too fun.
If you were looking for my little farm in the world, you wouldn't find it.
Is it time?
I'm going to church every Sunday.
He came up at 8:00 in the morning.
The mask is like a man.
Who taught you how to win?
Tom's got it.
It's Tommy Marin.
I'm asking you not to mention this to anyone.
If you ask me, I'll be happy with you.
Who's this young man?
We needed a compromise.
We've been friends with Sheila for a long time.
It's just between us, it's hard to study.
Shit!
I want you to take me to the store.
He's got a whole piece of cake.
I want a good way.
I heard a gun shot.
I'll have to get used to it.
It's a hot day.
They're coming.
I should never have trusted you.
Saints, we're always going to church.
It's a nice color.
Sit down, Tommy!
Here we go.
That's what a mindless man realizes.
Tom started to rest.
This will change your life.
My eyes are on my hat.
You always give yourself!
I knew you were on your way.
Tom told me he knew where Mari lived.
That doesn't bother me.
The man asked me who I am, but I didn't think I needed to answer him.
The doctor advised him to stop smoking.
Don't yell!
Don't be too family.
Then you'll know that your French language is good when people are no longer rich enough to know how well you know French.
Now that's all I have.
My mom loves music.
He's holding a man's hat on the desk.
I don't understand at the time.
It's close to Christmas.
I know what I'm gonna do now.
"Would you like to work for me, Tony?" asked Mr. Wood.
Europe has never been prepared for Ethiopia, but it is not because of the lack of effort.
I owe you a lunch.
If you could just choose one, what would that be?
Tom's son-in-law was stolen.
Can you explain in a little bit more simple so I can understand?
I'm trying to figure out what happened.
I've got a ring.
He was the last person I ever expected to see during my American detention.
That's what we've been doing.
I feel like it's time to keep going.
That's not a good idea.
They're both in the room.
I'm going to take a shower.
It was a long day.
How much did they pay you to do that?
My mom was sitting in the yard.
Would you like to come with me?
Can I open the doors?
And who are you?
How do you like Japanese weather?
He doesn't know anything about Tom Boston.
I have fond memories of everything we spent together.
What?
What a pain!
It's such a shame.
You're welcome.
It's very exciting.
You've got my lawyer.
I think he picked up some movies.
Tom had to protect his reputation.
He went back to the airport.
What a memory!
He lost his hearing.
I'm leaving tomorrow.
The heart rate often comes as when the wind blows off.
He's got a good sound.
He's the greatest man in the world.
Who called?
Close the door, please.
Well, then let's keep going where we left off.
Where was the mistake?
They're smiling.
I want a robot.
They stole my car.
Those men were fighting.
It's got two books around it.
That's what they're waiting for.
Tom wanted to buy it.
I've got my uncle.
It was months ago.
How many?
Look here.
It's suicide.
He's dead?
What's my room number?
Brazil has more inhabitants than other Portuguese-speaking countries.
Tom wants a thousand beers.
Tom seemed confused.
I should never have let Tom go.
Csalt.
Which is the best solution?
We're supposed to tell you what's going on.
I'm the greatest man on earth!
If you call too much, you're happy if you cry too much, you're sad.
Tommy's a born-in-law.
Did you care about someone?
Always be handy with your dictionary.
Are you coming alone or someone else?
Do I have to go there right away?
You have no idea how much it means to me.
I think we should be patient.
I have billions of dollars.
It took Tom a long time to pick a few shoes.
I'm glad no one's here right now.
I should have helped Tom do that.
Algeria has been very useful in the Chinese import articles.
Doctors have a big problem.
They stayed with me all night in the room.
I've got a lot of rubber.
Tom said Mary's in Boston now.
Everyone hates it.
Make sure I'm wrong.
Oh, my God, with Mari at home?
I brought her to Hercules.
First, he doubted it, but soon he made my advice to you.
He doesn't depend on his parents materially.
Were those people sitting in the back of the car?
Tom doesn't eat red meat.
It's hard to believe.
Mary's late.
That'd be fun.
He walked up to the seabed on the road.
It's not good for us.
This game is made of wood.
Tom should have asked us for help.
One of my dreams was that I was living next to a platoon.
I'll go without you.
Tom did what he was told.
Do you have a little sugar?
Did Tom forget?
I'm dyslexia.
Tom's taking some games for his kids.
His son looks like a monkey.
I was worried you might leave.
Wasn't it enough?
It's not too much to say he's a genius.
The stolen money will never be paid.
We continued negotiations with the company.
Anyway, they're gonna sign the letter.
Hey, my friend, this is the king of shit.
Are you planning on using this again?
I'm worried.
That's where it's going.
We're still the best.
Tom could've handled the problem better.
I'll never forget what you did to me.
She's going to school with her boyfriend.
Tom kept watch on his watch.
I don't like these kind of houses.
Tom's finally here.
When are you leaving home in the morning?
Go home before 6:00.
I want to know myself safely.
Tom was seriously hurt.
Tom was sitting in the chair.
He told me a sad story.
Sit back!
They're afraid of you.
I think it's not funny.
Tom asked Mary if she knew John's address.
It's okay. It's okay.
Most of them say that the best way to learn the language is to learn from the olive tree, which is its mother tongue.
My sister has a dog.
Tom loves the horse.
You found the sword in his head.
That's great.
I know what it's like to be poor.
The company needs two jobs.
It's not just monkeys, man is part of the main race.
There's nothing special about this.
Come here, I want to show you something.
He said thank you for your gifts.
You had your cat.
He smiled and said after a walk, "Now your third wish comes.
That doesn't seem right.
Tommy recently repatriated after his wife died.
In fact, next week will be the university's diplomatic celebration.
We have so little time.
Focus on the present.
I want to get ananas.
Tom's a law-enforcement citizen.
Tom's not buying.
Tom wants an answer.
She came out of the room.
I hate myself.
She loves him.
It was Sunday, not Saturday.
I don't like this song.
It was a crazy week.
We took this to Australia.
I can get out of my lunch list.
It's added that you don't eat honey with your daily routine.
We don't have any future for the religions.
Home or death - for my victory!
I want to know why Tommy didn't come to Mari's party.
How much do you want to be healthier?
He won the money.
Tom and my son.
Tom hasn't won it yet.
You should keep too many codes in your head.
Why is France so hard?
Those are my daughters.
Tom's a super-intelligent mouse.
That's crazy.
Mary Tom's mother?
This political issue has led to a lot of debate.
I just need a leave for this recipe.
Tommy did exactly the same thing as I did.
What a counterfeit.
You're tough, but you're right.
Stay away!
I feel like I'm crazy.
I'm gonna check it out, Tom.
Now you can follow Dad on Twitter.
The white-beam must be heated better.
They've got the truth.
It must have been my love.
He's stuck to his bed.
He knew where she left Maria's car.
Did you get breakfast this morning?
It was just a surgery.
She was very cute and I liked her very much.
Where is it?
If there's only one piece of paper, it's all a problem.
He's on his way to Boston now.

It's the last one.

Dan opened up his claim for all his luck.
There was a debate.
This is about the windshields.
We're lucky.

Unbelievably, you know?
I forgot your phone number.
I've never met a man like you before.
Which one do you think is yours?
They're probably going to drop the game.
Tom broke the door to his finger.
Tom's healed.

It wasn't my time.
Jack's been hiding for the long time, but the little girl's been hit.
My dog did it.
Tom's right.
I take it Tom knows the text.
I'll get out of here.
I was just kidding.
I've added that I'm living alone.
There's a map on the wall.
Whose side are you on?
We're not gonna take it off.
You're not right.
Tom's on his own to keep the stolen money.
Who's asking for a cold?
Is there anyone in here?
He found the water for the source.
Tom had a lot of opportunities.
I'll be happy to help if I can.
You're a lawyer.
He who behaves like a man, doesn't wonder if he's gone.
I'm probably gonna cry.
Memeshhu is a Japanese cheese made of a word.
That's not funny.
Tom broke his focus.
Who was the man waiting outside?
I love romantic queens.
It's technically possible.
It's embarrassing.
Is there a complaint?
Can you give me Tom's address?
I was really surprised that it worked.
Don't take your shirt off!
Maybe I could learn German.
I want to travel.
I'll break the truth.
I don't have a problem with this.
I need to meet Tommy.
This is a protection.
Why does this bother you?
Tom had a severe pain.
I'd like to have some fresh air to eat.
I haven't noticed how important this is to you.
I've never been to Paris.
My paradise is fruitful or green?
One of us is on the street with the hotel.
I'm just so glad I can help with your work.
Why did you park here?
I feel the same way.
But we have three cats.
Tom promised me he'd never come back here again.
Never go anywhere alone.
Who's in service?
Are you doing a dangerous job?
Everyone's upset.
What do I do?
Don't trust Tommy, whatever he says.
Go on, Tom.
Stay here!
There was only one meeting.
Tom's parents just stayed together for the kids' sake.
Can I see you tomorrow?
I'll see my uncle tomorrow.
I was with Tommy last night.
They're gonna get the girls out of the van.
The two men blamed each other for the crime.
This is my life!
I couldn't talk.
It's too late!
Open your book on page 19.
I've never seen her again.
I'll see you this afternoon twice.
He threatened the phone.
Do you really think it's gonna be hard?
I was everywhere.
Three meters long.
I still think it's the best choice.
The mice will keep them safe.
Tom met Merivel last Friday.
Tommy's a Stanovist.
You're not dead.
Shut up!
I want to give you 15 kilos of your size.
What about the world without women?
I'm sure you're hungry.
We need to slow down our steps.
I just don't think I can do it.
Let's do some exercise.
What a beautiful day we have!
It's gonna take ten minutes.
Tom forced him to get married.
You're looking for work.
But I think I live there.
I like winning.
Tom won't do it.
I took a risk.
He's friendly with us.
The cake Tom smoked was nice.
One hour ago I was waiting for you home.
I love this dog.
- Are these your cars?
Pretend it.
Marriage can be wonderful if both parties understand each other in a mutual way.
Tommy doesn't sing well, and neither do I.

Thank you.
We need to prepare for the future.
Mom, can I go wash?
I gave him all my money.
I need it.
Turn your head around.
What kind of food do you don't like?
I'd love to do it again.
I was thinking about Tom.
They were arrested.
I knew Tom wouldn't change.
Please close the door.
The understanding was held yesterday.
He broke up his kitchen floor with a knife.
Tom's been out of jail for a long time.
Now we have a bigger problem.
Let's check it out.

Do you have a brother?
Be nice, answer me.
You're all gonna miss it.
We're eating the cheese brought from Italy in the south today.
You didn't really help me with time and poverty, so I'm very grateful.
Get out of here.

I think we've turned into a bad direction.
I opened it.
I felt totally alone.
Try to imagine the situation.
Why didn't they believe me?
Put your finger on the right side.
Don't judge anybody on the basis of his face.
I was so scared of you.
Tom forgot to take his lunch today.
Why were you angry?
Close the door before you leave.
Never lose hope!
I believe in Bahá.
That's terrible.
Tom should've locked the door.
Tom works at a restaurant at Park Street.
At least you could say "thank you."
Did Tom tell you not to?
I'm not sure in this report.

That's exciting.
I'm glad it works.
It's already in progress.
You can't talk to anyone about this.
There's a little treasure that's as valuable as a smart and helpful friend.

Tom asked me if I'd like a cup of coffee.
Your plan won't work.
You looking for someone?
I'm researching.
That name doesn't mean anything to me.
Tom almost understood what Mari said.
It's a lot to eat.
Look at the words you don't understand.
It's not alive.
Mary's been shot.
It had a lot to do with me.
Be very happy.
There was nothing.
Tom never changes.
Isn't he a drug dealer?
I know what's wrong with you.
He's crazy!
Idiots like yours are getting bad news from school.
You know that?

It was a mistake to do it.

Don't just throw it out because it's right.
He said he just got the guitar.
I helped my mom cook.
Why are you so angry?
The "person" number is "people", not "persons".
Let me get you something to drink.
Sometimes you're upset.
You can try.
I don't need your money.
I'm sorry you got very hurt.
Tom is very good at singing, but he's never singing at the church.

Are you looking for work?
Tommy's the best cop in our class.
I'm hungry.
We don't have a dog.

It's gonna be okay.
My dog attacked Tom.
The Earth is not a perfect cave.

You looking for someone?
That's his eyes.
My sister's standing up.
Oh, my God, I'll be Dad.
I've never seen anything like it before.
Tom wrote a very detailed report.
First I didn't like him.
Tom's gonna let you know.
I'll find out something.
Is there a place to stay?
Maybe there's another way.
It was logical to think.
You're always so kind?
Tom was very disappointed.
Tom started his argument.
Please stop singing.
Tom appreciated Mari's support very much.
Would you like to be a little bit more quiet, sir?
He fell with me.
Can I open the door?
It's fun.
I was in Boston when it happened.
It's not mine.
I don't know much about dogs.
I couldn't get it.
Hey, Tom!
Oh, my God, this is fucking pain!
Where are the best words?
You know who I am.
Your question has nothing to do with the subject.
What can I lose?
Why is Tamás still here?
I gave him a kiss.
I can't say much more.
My heart's young.
Not all the audiences went there yesterday.
I'm glad it was time to meet Tommy.
You got all your guests.
We're going to Boston.
It wouldn't make sense.

Bring the kids home for dinner.
That was impossible.
We could do it today.
I know everything that can only be known about your departures.

I'm sorry if I'm late.
I don't have much time now.
Come back here!
Who the hell was that?
When we were kids, we loved to see the big one because there was always a big box in the kitchen.
I didn't promise you anything.
Love, don't fight.
You don't need to pack.
Please tell Tomina that she called Mari.
I don't know Tom so well yet.
They don't look happy.

Help me!
Tom's back.
We're gonna do our job together.
It's also an alma.
I just realized I was scared of him.
I'm not doing anything like that anymore.
Tom, you're telling me.
Tom's gonna need this, right?
Don't worry!
An important question has been raised, I think we've been through it.
I want to give it to her.
When I woke up, I was sad.
I'll stay for two nights.

I think Tom needs more.
I'd like to live in Boston once.
My dad's home.
You're going to have to get your capacitors.
Can I use your phone?

Look at these pictures.
You should never have doubted me.
Good-bye.
How long has this movie been?
When you're doing something to someone, please don't touch your ear, don't worry about your ass, or don't get into your chest!
Tom needs me.
I'd rather leave.
I have to go to the bathroom.
I'm looking for you.
I've been waiting for the right time.
What's that?
He couldn't keep it easy.
I'll ride it until you're out of your mind.
You have to report something.
How is this supposed to happen?
I'm so tired, I don't like going on a trip right now.
I hate the crowd.
I was alone.
What's my fear?
You shouldn't let Tomina do this.
What's missing?

That's what I like.
Neither of us loves Tomit.
We don't belong here.
Do you have any paramedics?
Tom opened his mind.
He came back yesterday.
Tell Tom he needs to smile.
He asked if I was busy.
I don't want anything from you.
When did you sit down?
I'll do everything I can.
Hurrah, I got it!
Tom's gonna be better next time.
I'm not married.
I feel great today.
What do you find?
He's got nothing nice in his head.
Take a shower.

Take it!
I recently met an old friend of mine.
That's a salesman?
How are the kids?
We started talking.
Let's get up at 4:10.
I don't like this dzsek.
It was Tom's.
Tom stood up with his mother.
Tom got into the room.
Tommy never talks about kids in his blog.
I've been sitting on the bridge.

I'll go.
It was Tommy's cellphones.
I'm sorry about that.
Tommy just told me that.
I'll never answer to e-mails I don't know.
Is there a scientific basis for this?
I'll wait an hour for the bus!
I love reading books.
Tom was in a better mood an hour ago.
He's got a hat on him.
Tom's got all the stuff.
There's nothing missing.
What's family status?
Your lawyer explained the new law to us.
They're a perfect family.
You've been warned countless times and more times than you've accepted.
They're not gonna be happy about this.
I can't imagine without you.
Here in Tatoebán, let's record Tom's life in a detailed detail from the wise man.
That's really great!
Love conquers hate.
I waited longer.
My fear is gone.
We're looking for a place.

Take it easy.
What happened next?
Tom's dead.
You can't order me.

I've been studying it for two hours every day.
I'm just trying to hurry.
What did I say?
It's all wrong for him.
When do we meet?
The shower's ready.
The air seemed a little cold.
Did they hear that?
I'd like to help him, but I don't know how.
Tom's still in his office, right?
He's only ten years old.
Have you met God yet?
You gotta be crazy about this.

They have to come.
How do you stay up?
I can't make it like a hole; I'm a bear!
I'm sorry, I must have called a bad number.
I gave Tomina another chance.
I need to find Tom.
Why do you want to buy him?
I like to talk to Tom.
Tom doesn't want to wait.
I don't think he's coming.
It's special.
I arranged it.
The article was published in French.
I don't feel good right now.
I'd like to move to another room.

I'm tired.
This dog is mine.

Can you drive this bitch?
Do you have any room?
It's all my book.
I don't want you to stop singing.
Take it!
I'm looking for something to read on the board.

Tom once ate food and got food in an empty restaurant, so now it's really about where he's going.
I used to cry early.
Let's start being careful.
They're still my age.
As soon as he saw it, he disappeared.
I can't lie.
Why don't you make a try with him?
Tom's out there.
I've got to get to this place.
You're traveling a lot?
There's someone out there.
How do you say to France that I love you?
What does this have to do with my future?
You're Japanese?
I wore my best clothes.
Can you put all your clothes in your bag?

It's me again, Tom.
You're the reason I'm here today.
They didn't find anything.
Give me your weapons.
I want to live in Tampa.
What are you gonna do with the rain?
Tom loves it.
Statistics show that our quality of life is high.
I'm sweet.
The hope is gone.
Tom may not know the danger.
I was a son of a bitch.
You're very good today.
I'd be much more productive if I didn't waste my time online.
Women are people too.
You're imaginational.
Did you smoke?
Get out of here!
Are there landscapes in Germany?
I hope you'll help me.
There's no escape route.
Get on the bus!
I don't feel angry.
Don't hate what you don't understand.
It was great tonight.
It's gone. It's gone.
What I'm gonna say now, you won't like it.
This book is smaller.
I opened the car and I pulled it out.
Tom Marit left home alone.
You can go now.
Tom encouraged Mary to stop smoking.
We're all talking in French.
I'm just trying to read my eyes.
Be serious.
Good morning, dreamy.
In fact, gorillas have the same feelings as humans.
I need to go to the news store to get a newspaper.
Which direction does he take?
Tom hit his opponent.
Stay with us for a few days.
I know what the next question will be.
I plan on going there.
Justson thinks you're gonna have to smile.
I didn't doubt that.
How did you get there?
It's too small for me.
That took courage.
Did Tommy come?
- Would you like some more coffee?
Tommy's still playing.
It's the same time as me.
When did you meet Tom?
They're on the sun.
Tommy never knew that.
It's an old joke.
It wouldn't be brave, it would be stupid.
I just learned a new word.
Why doesn't Tom want to go to Boston?
Please, give me the gun.
We don't have more time.
Our grandfather's sick.
Do you want to replace what you're doing?
I'm going home to four.
Tommy got another dog.
I think you know our friend's name.
The dancer angrily broke his contract.
Dan transferred to a new police unit.
Tom's got his shirt.
Go work!
I'll do it.
I found this letter in the books.
When I'm interested in my opinion, I'll ask you.
In 1683, the Turks were excommunicated again by Bécset.
The air went off when I got home.
The story was boring.
You weren't used to talking a lot.
Fuck you!
I don't have to be scared.
Please give me my passport.
I got what I wanted.
It was very cold.
Put them in the boys.
It's a difficult mathematical problem.
I hope they're gone.
Are you crazy?
Why didn't you dance with him?
Things have turned out to be horrible.
Tom's parents got him on the phone.
We're going to Boston tomorrow.

I don't want to.
Environmental disaster.

I don't speak French like Tom.
He pulled a picture out of the book.
He was almost old enough.
I lost my thumb.
I just want Tom to pay attention.
Did you make it?
You have to choose between honor and death.
I think you're scared.
Tom never told the authorities that.
Will you give me your car?
There's one or two more things you need to put in your skin.
I'll see you soon.
Tom didn't need that anymore.
Will you eat tomorrow?
This guy's five hundred bucks.
Tom's a truck driver.
It's getting cold in the morning.
This coffee is delicious.
I'm in a special mood today.
Tom's fate was obvious.
Are you leaving the car now?
You got Tom's name?
If you knew, you would have told me, right?
It was a Christmas night.
I'm my own boss.
His speech upsets me.
That's Tom's decision.
Tom's always smiling.
There's an apple on the table.
I'm Ellene to go there alone.
The cats don't want to be water.
She's going to school with her boyfriend.
