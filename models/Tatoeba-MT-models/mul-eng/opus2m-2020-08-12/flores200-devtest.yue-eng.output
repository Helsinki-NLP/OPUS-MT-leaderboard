The original groups have not changed completely, and they still need adaptability as in the past.
In time, these new groups began to adapt to new environments, and their differences with other groups began to grow.
Finally, over the past millennium, even over a million years, these two groups will look very different and cannot be described as the same species.

In tree gardens, long species of animals (compared to humans) are difficult to extract from available plant resources.
Moreover, failure can lead to serious consequences: poor development, malnutrition, and even death.
The most readily available plant resources are protein extracted from plants of the genus or plant species, but if these plants do not agree, it is difficult for us to eliminate them.
On the contrary, animal food (petroleum, protein and eggs) is not easily disposed of, providing more than a large amount of protein for all necessary oxygen.
After all of this, our ancestors are not surprised by the similar methods used by black grapes in today's orchard, "the protein problem," which is not surprising.
