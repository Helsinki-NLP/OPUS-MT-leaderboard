Bosnia and Herzegovina protesting Croatia's plans on the stockpiling of mining waste
In the fifth century, hundreds of people gathered in northern and western Bosnia in a protest against the plans of neighbouring Croatia concerning the composition of parts of waste from one nuclear region near the border with Bosnia and the main river known as natural beauty.
The protesters in the Bosnian city of Novi Grad asked Croatia to launch plans to build waste warehouses in former military barracks in the town of Tragovska Gora and declared war on the project.
The facility would contain waste from the nuclear power plant.
Bosnia and Herzegovina, which holds banners with the words "Healthy Future" and "Stop – (The) It needs us," said that the composition of the waste of mining can threaten the Union's rivers and the lives of about 250 000 inhabitants.
We have to say NO,
He said to the tribe Miroslav Drjaca, the burmist of the tribe of Novi Grad.
We must fight to protect our way of life and our Union.
Located in Slovenia, the power plant Krško built in the 1980s is also located in Croatia.
Representatives of both countries will meet next week to discuss the issue of additional waste stocks.
Croatian public television HRT stated on Friday that Croatia has not yet decided whether to build its own waste stock or to pay for the storage of parts of waste in a new facility built by Slovenia.
Croatia's Minister for Environment and Energy Tomislav Coric told journalists that Croatia also has a problem with institutional waste from schools, hospitals and prisons and hopes to find a complete solution.
In Bosnia, activists, officials and residents from each side of the country of the ethnic division were forced by Croatia to find another location in the nearby country.
"Why does Croatia throughout its territory claim that this is the best place in Bosnia?" Drjac asked.
We can't let them down!

US Congress agreed to sell Poland 32 F-35 flights
The United States Congress of 15 days after approval by the State Department of Possible Procurement by Poland by 32 thinkers F-35 did not object to this transaction, which means that the last conditions were met before the start of the purchase negotiations.
The Congress's decision, although not surprising, is of great political importance.
"After the approval of the sale by the State Department, and now by Congress, I see no significant obstacles," said John V. Venable, senior policy adviser to the Washington Defence Force Conservative thought of the Heritage Foundation.
The expert explained that, on the basis of the 1976 Law on the Control of the Export of Arms, the Federal Government represented by the Department of State must notify Congress of any planned arms sale within 15 days of the signing of the contract, if the value of such a transaction, in the case of arms sales to NATO Member State, exceeds $50 million.
The value of the proposed transaction is estimated at $6.5 billion by Poland for 32 F-35 thinkers. This amount includes technical and logistical assistance costs, auxiliary equipment and pilot training.
The main supplier of F-35 aircraft – if this transaction is finally finalised – will be the US Army Consortium Lockheed Martin and its subcontractor is the manufacturer of engines for the F-35A Group of Pratt and Whitney thinkers.
Proposals for the purchase of American thinkers of the fifth generation F-35 on behalf of the Polish government were submitted by the Minister of Defence Mariusz Blaštak in May.
Poland's offer was discussed in June of this year at the meeting of President Andrzey Dudy with President Donald Trump in the White House.
On the implementation of this agreement, if finalised, the representatives of the Pentagon will feel under the Foreign Military Sales Programme (FMS).
Under the FMS Poland programme, there was already an anti-bacterial system Patriot.
The price of one F-35 thinker at the time of the submission by Poland of the purchase offer – without equipment and technical assistance – was about $89.2 million.
As U.S. military experts who wanted to maintain anonymity informed PAP, the price given in the previous negotiations was "the maximum price, much higher than the price to be negotiated".
"The prices are very low, currently the price of one F-35 is less than $80 million, much less than the cost of Eurofighter, which does not have the keys that F-35 has," Venable pointed out.
The PAP spokesmen expressed the hope that the final negotiations on the purchase by Poland of American warplanes would still end this year.
Any part of the Polish subcontractors in this transaction – i.e. offset – will be discussed directly with US thinkers producers F-35.
What is the role of the Münchhausena team, which is referred to in the series “Payton Hobarta Elections” on Netflix platform?
Caregivers and parents with the above concern believe that their healthy child is sick.
The "Payton Hobarta choices" series is currently available on the Netflix platform.
He tells the story of Payton Hobart, who wants to be president of the United States of America, but first must be the head of the scientific self-government in his high school.
In the series of Ryan Murphy, American Horror Story and Glee, we see Gwyneth Paltrow, Ben Platta and Lucy Boynton.
Not revealing too much details for those who have not yet had the opportunity to see the series, it is the theme of the Münchhausena team – mental illness in caregivers who act as if the health of the person involved was affected by physical or mental illness.
There are various types of this infection, such as the Münchhausen group, which is dependent on the occurrence of the disease.
Münchhausena's replacement team is a simulation that the person remaining under our care has a certain duration.
It is also called a mental and caused disease, and it is treated as violence against the child.
It's rare that it usually includes a parent who is suffering from symptoms or causes symptoms, so it looks like his child is sick.
What are the side effects of the Münchhausena team?
The symptoms of this disease may vary, but NHS takes into account the following exemplary behaviour:
To convince medical personnel that a child who looks healthy, however, feels bad.
Illustrating or inventing symptoms.
Disordering the results for the child to be considered sick, e.g. administration of glucose to the breast test to make it look like the child has diabetes.
The development of symptoms of disease such as medications and other substances in children.
How often does the Münchhausena team take place?
It is difficult to estimate how often this disorder occurs because many cases of disease are not reported.
A 2000 study shows that 89 cases of this disorder have been reported for over two years.
What should be done if there are suspicions that a child may be in danger?
Contact the local department of special services or call the NSPCC Children's Protection Information, choosing number 0808 800 5000.

He claimed that the children were studying the Qur'an and nothing else.

Boris Johnson addressed to the police authority in relation to a close relationship with businesswoman Jennifer Arcuri
The independent IOPC police procedure authority examined the possibility of entering into a preliminary investigation into whether while making a public office as mayor of London, it was allowed to commit criminal offences.
The Council of the Great London (GLA) announced that its supervisory inspector had registered the "procedure" of the Prime Minister in connection with the charges of preferential treatment of Arcuri to be brought to light by their close knowledge.
‘The matter relating to the proceedings’ may be referred to when information on the possibility of committing a crime is provided’ – he said.
It doesn't mean it's somehow proven.
IOPC will now consider whether it is necessary to examine this matter.
The issue was addressed to IOPC, which is responsible for complaints against members of the police services in England and Wallia.
She was transferred to this police control body because Johnson was then responsible for the position of the Commissioner of Police and the Commissioner of Criminal Affairs.
Johnson objected that because of his close relationship with Arcuri, he had any irregularities.
He said earlier that he applied to the London City Council's order and gave details on his relationship with Arcuri, but he insisted that the Council "depends on the wrong problem".
As a result of the “The Sunday Times” report, Arcuri, an American who moved to London seven years ago, received 126,000 pounds of budget money, as well as authorized access to three foreign trade missions, on which he was then the mayor of Johnson.
As a result of this investigation, the government frozen a grant of 100,000 pounds to Arcuri at Hacker House.
The Board is waiting for difficult questions on the verification procedure before the grant is granted.
The Minister for Finance Matt Warman said in Izbey Gmin that his department's employees "constantly maintained due diligence" and that the company has a British phone number.
However, according to the number of connections, they were transferred to the office in California, where they currently live at 34-year-old Arcuri.
The close relationship of the Prime Minister with the businessman "was for the police officer".
The decision of the GLA to appoint the prime minister to the independent IOPC Police Office was met with an objection at 10 Downing Street.
According to the source of the above-mentioned line, the representative of the government is “a politically motivated act”, and his term – before the Conservative Party’s Conference – is “politically clear”.
"The supervisory inspector did not provide any evidence confirming arguments, and the Prime Minister did not have the opportunity to give him an answer before the publication of the press communication by Friday evening," said the source.
Neither citizens nor the media can be drawn into such a clear political constitution.
Today the newspaper The Standard said that a close relationship between Johnson and a businessman from California, who was helping the London Tourism and Promotion Agency, was for the "secret police" workers.
The employees of the London & Partners Agency (L&P) mentioned above that Arcuri received seats during the foreign trade outlets of Johnson as mayor, despite the fact that her company was then not considered to be "dependable".
Third accused of drug offences related to the death of Mac Miller
LOS ANGELES (AP) – As a result of the sudden death of rapper Mac Miller as a result of drug overdose, a third man was arrested and charged with drug crimes.
According to judicial documents, Stephen Walter is suspected of selling contaminated oxycodone pills infected with fentanyl, which Miller had in his possession prior to his death in September of the year as a result of the accidental overdose of cocaine, alcohol and fentanyl, i.e. a strong opioid responsible for “epidemia”, which has confirmed several thousand human beings in the United States.
Walter complains about the delivery of the chicken that another man, Cameron Pettit, sold to Miller.
The court documents published on Tuesday reveal that Petit received drugs from Walter throughout her life.
Ryan Reavis, who was arrested earlier this week in Lake Havasu City in Arizona, is suspected of playing Walter's role as a curator, who delivered Petitto's pills.
None of the men mentioned were directly charged with causing Miller's death, nor did any of them present a line of defense in their case.
Walter, who was released under the 2005 drug release conditions, was arrested and was also sentenced to five months' imprisonment for his release.
The complainants in charge of the case, which was first brought to the fourth quarter of the website dedicated to TMZ Celebrates, are expected to arrest Walter while waiting for the trial, claiming that there is a serious risk of the fugitive in question.
The reply to the message left by the automatic secretary of his lawyer was not received immediately.
Petitto was brought before the federal court on 4 September and his defense rejected the comment.
The words of Miller's novel creations are a sincere talk about his depression and drug use, which led him to win fans from among the largest hip-hop stars.
From Pittsburgh Miller, who was actually named Malcolm James Myers McCormick, for two years remained in contact with singer Arian Grande, who ended earlier in 2018.
After his death in the Instagram portal, she published an exciting movie with Miller and the “Think U Next” that she remembers with love.
Miller is one of the music that has died in recent years with opioid abuse.
Matthew Roberts, the guitarist of Group 3 Doors Down, also died as a result of overdose in 2016, and the presence of fentanyl and hydrocodon was confirmed in his body.
This article changed: The correct spelling of Walter's name is "Stephen", not "Steven".
9-year-old Nigerian makes more than 30 games on mobile devices
9-year-old creates a game of fun buried using free application for Skatch 2.
Scratch 2 allows users to create games, animations and stories in online or offline mode.
Since then Basil has generated more than 30 games on mobile devices.
In today's game, there's a non-topic negativity that works according to the program.
The player gets a point every time he grabs a non-territory that comes out of the envelope.
I learned to create a game on a fast course.
"I'll make them now when I get up," said Basil CNN.
In March, Dad wrote it on a five-day fast course for children between 5 and 15 years of age.
The course organized by Codefest International was aimed at providing children such as Basil, access to new technologies such as robotics and virtual reality.
The boy's father, Basil Okpara senior, says Basil played a lot on mobile devices.
“When he was 4 years old, I bought him a tablet because he always picked up his phone and played on it.
He played a lot at Candy Crush and Temple Run," said the father of CNN.
But Basil's interest in creating the game grew when he was 7 years old and got a beer to devote all the time to the game.
"One day he played on the tablet, as usual, and was so excited that I was upset," said his father.
I mean, I said, "You're still playing, can't you think of creating your own games so they can play no other game?"
By saying those words, I was upset and I didn't think I'd take them seriously," he added.
Since then Basil has shown an active interest in the science of creating his own games, encouraging his parents to buy a laptop and record it for a course that he knew the basis for creating the game.
Basil, who wants to be a scientist in the future, gives his game a title based on their content.
One of his games, “Mosquito mass”, is available in Google play store.
Africa has the largest population of young people in the world and, like Basil, this population includes leadership in the development of continents.
Two Nigerian 12-year-olds have recently been celebrated to use codes to create jobs that divide their work at home.
In May, Acrobot from the middle school of women in Ghana won the Robofest 2019 competition to program robots to stop the cracks.
And thanks to the growing investment of giants in technology such as Google and Microsoft, in Africa, Basil and its counterparts are on a good path to the career of the codification star.
Former President of the Republican Party in North Carolina admitted to a lie on corruption
Of the five judicial documents, it appears that they were the Presidents of the Republical Party in North Carolina that he accused federal agents of investigating the corruption of the main political donor.
According to Robin Hayes, he's going to be guilty in the future.
The document containing the actual basis drawn up under the defence agreement and signed by the lawyer Hayes shows that Hayes knew that he had made a false statement to FBI agents investigating corruption in 2018.
The defence agreement was maintained, and on the basis of the facts, it did not result in the approval of Hayes' claims.
He was initially accused of fraud, corruption and false statements.
The prosecutors accused the former Hayes of participating in the plan of the insurance company's management of the campaign to the main country of the insurance market regulator in place of special treatment.
Director Greg Lindberg and his two colleagues were charged with trying to persuade the State Security Commissioner Mike Causey.
Lindberg is the founder of an insurance and investment firm, one of the main state political donors who has been transferring over $5 million since 2016 to national and federal candidates and committees.
He supported mainly the objectives and policies of the Republican Party, but also transmitted documents to the Democrats.
His lawyer did not respond to a fifth e-mail message asking for a comment.
Defender Hayesa Kearns Davis did not respond to a fifth email message asking for a comment.
Of the five court documents, Hayes reported that he lied to FBI agents in August 2018 when he said he didn't talk to Causey about employees of the State Department of Insurance.
According to the document containing the actual basis of Hayes, he actually talked to the insurance Commissioner about Lindberg's request for a change in the staff employed by the market regulator.
The complainants claim that Hayes also helped Lindberg to organize a meeting with Causey and that he talked about the kidnapper directly with the regulator.
According to the Court of Justice, Lindberg requested special treatment of its insurance activities and planned to transfer $2 million to the Causeya re campaign in 2020.
The complainant also found that the complaint included the request for a change in the department officer who controlled Lindberg's company.
As a Republican Causey, he reported a significant attempt to corrupt federal agents and helped them collect evidence on this matter.
He wasn't set up for any charges.
According to the Order of Indictation, Lindberg ordered Hayes to transfer $250,000 to the Causeya campaign during the talks in which Lindberg and Causey were also present.
During the interview, Hayes initially protested, saying that the transfer of such money would draw attention to it, but as a result of the complaint, he finally took a stand.
"As long as you want everyone to do it, we will do it," said Hayes.
"All right, I'll take care of it."
The Federal Prosecutor's Office did not respond to the e-mail request for further information on the agreement.

Facebook with a lack of self-sensitivity of users is hidden on the sample number of kisses
In the first time in the world, an experiment aimed at improving user self-esteem, some of the people who use Facebook recently do not see the number of loved ones, reactions and video shows.
Loves will be hidden and visible only for the author of the post, and this change will be introduced in Australia following a similar test carried out on Instagram in July.
A new version of Facebook will also be launched in Australia on Friday.
Mia Garlick, director of Facebook's privacy in Australia, said that the change is the result of a self-sustainment study and the opinions of mental health specialists indicating that the number of kisses can be compared to others.
"Reviews from many groups of victims of torture and mental health organisations were really positive," Garlick said.
The elimination of this calculator makes people group on the quality of their interactions and on the quality of their content, not on the number of kisses or reactions.
It is expected that sharing with others via the platform will be more pleasant and will not be considered as a realisation – she said.
Garlick has ensured that companies supporting Facebook activities will continue to receive the same indicators and observations as they have had access to.
She said it was too early to be able to determine whether the test would be extended to other countries, such as Instagram, when the test covered Australia, Canada, Brazil, New Zealand, Japan, Italy and Ireland.
As with Instagram, which belongs to Facebook, there is no indication when the experiment is completed and whether the change will be made on a permanent basis.
"The previous comments of users on the new principles in Instagram were positive, but at this stage we are still learning and listening to opinions," she said.
Speaking about the place of the world experiment, Garlick said that Australia has a very active, technically protected Facebook and Instagram users.
We believe that it is an extraordinary country that will provide us with balanced opinions on whether or not the new experience is valuable for those who benefit from our services.
Frequent: Workers want compensation for orphans
In the absence of comments by the Kürka Kürka on the call for workers to this metropolis, Mr Wacław Depo, on the transfer of financial compensation for the service of the waste economy in the spring season.
The city's asking for one bad thing from the police.
On Friday, he spoke about the event at a press conference with the participation of the leader of Wiosny Robert Biedronia, who was organized on the leading side of the Light Mountain of the Most Holy Maryi Panny, the mayor of the city council and candidate to Seym Lukasz Kot.
As he reported that the day before, local SLD councils had announced an appeal to the bishop of Wacław Depo to transfer one gold city from every frequent pilgrimage – to support the work of local, municipal services, etc.
We accepted an appeal to the Archbishop of Depo to help the city, help us get rid of the guards, check the city for the hostages.
"We ask you to forward to the budget of the symbolic city of gold from each pillar.
As a result, the city will be able to provide them with better living conditions in the Commons", the city's Vice-President said.
The petitioner's comment was made by Mr. Mariusz Bakalarz, who initially prepared a number of answers, but then asked – as he pointed out – to the Dec. Depo – to replace it with information on its content: “We will not deal with the matter until the official position of the City Council has been obtained.”
According to the project on the site of the Common Magistrate for the Depo Abpa, "the delivery of financial compensation for the Common City for the use of the municipal waste management system during the spring season".
"In view of the increasing number of arrivals in the Common Customs Tariff and therefore increasing the costs of the services of the Community-based system for the management of municipal waste during the spring season, given the views of the city between its inhabitants and its inhabitants, its inhabitants and its inhabitants, its passengers and its pets, we would like to propose participation in the costs of services in the Community, our small village, and the rural area," the appeal cries out.
"In order to maintain the purity of the track track tracks which are moved simultaneously with the small infrastructure, i.e. the external boxes on waste, we present a proposal for a symbolic participation in the municipal waste management system in the amount 1 evil from the pipeline," it was written.
"In addition to participation in the annual costs that the city will cover from its own resources, with regard to the purity and aesthetics of the urban area, and also with a view to stressing that such cooperation will benefit all parties, we declare that 20% of these amounts will be intended to improve tourism infrastructure, e.g. by increasing the number of general public toilets available."
They noted that, in addition to the financial issues, their proposal resulted from a number of comments by the residents on the status of road cleanliness that were transferred by the pilgrims.
"In view of the concern about the purity of our city and the possible positive effects of cooperation, the City Council calls on the Archbishop of Commons of the Wacław Depo on the transfer of financial compensation for the Common City for the use of the municipal waste management system during the spring season," repeated the appeal.
According to information from the Press Office of the Clear Mountain, 834 000 persons participated throughout the year in 200 general-pollean pilgrimages to this shrine.
About 124 thousand believers arrived in 255 caves of sand.
More than 8,8 000 people have come to the Commons in wheelchairs (133 groups), and 440 persons (16 groups) in refugee beds.
Less than 20 people were reached to the sanctuary of the horse, and more than 170 Pilgrims of the two groups were on wheels.
The "Effects" TVP mentioned the Confedera at the survey's description
According to a poll conducted by Pollster, in the elections to Seym PiS, 45% would get votes, KO 26%, Lewica 14%, PSL 7%, and the Confederation 5%.
It was even written on the “Super Express” portal for which the survey was conducted.
In the main issue of "Informance", describing the same survey, only four first parties submitted the results, with a complete closure of the Confederation.
Chief Edita Lewandoska clearly stressed that only four committees had crossed the electoral threshold and would have entered the Seym.
The TVP also showed the share of summary mandates without taking into account the votes delivered to the Confederation.
It'd give Pis to the government on its own.
Krzysztof Bosak, in his comment on the whole situation, spoke of "a public compromise on honesty towards society".
‘They started with the haze of ‘the moral revolution’’, he recalled and claimed that this was a sign of weakness.
Robert Winnicki wrote on Twitter that “TVP performances” in further actions against the Confederations are against Urban and Michnik.
He also drew attention to the lack of right-wing journalists.
“But let us also look at those who allow silence.
These "rights", "independent", "incorrigible".
In a few years they have become the most primitive version of everything they've fought for last night," he added.

Brother sentenced to life penalty for the murder of honorary social media star Kwandeel Baloch
Qandeel Baloch, who became a star by means of a photo published in social services, was released in July 2016.
The Pakistani social media star Qandeel Baloch was convicted of her murder on Friday and sentenced to life imprisonment for the most famous “dignity killing” in this patriarchal country.
Baloch, who gained fame by publishing ridiculous selfies – sinful according to Western standards, but in a strong mystical Pakistan was considered a provocation – was defeated in July 2016.
Her brother Muhammad Waseema was arrested.
A few days later, he said during a press conference that there was no sumptuous charges for his actions and said that he “of course” had murdered his sister and that her conduct was “unacceptable”.
His lawyer, Sardar Mehmood, told AFP that the court in the western city of Multan recognized his client as guilty and sentenced him to life in a long term.
“Inshallah (if God permits), will be destroyed by the court of the higher court” he said.
Previously, Baloch's mother, Anwar May, announced to the AFP that she had hoped her son would be destroyed.
“He is innocent.
It was my daughter, and it was my son," she said.
Baloch's murder has taken place on the streets of the world's information services and has called for action against the epidemic of honour killings, in which victims - mostly women - are killed for breach of patriarchal social principles.
Women were shot, shot, shot or beaten for such experiences as choosing their own husband or, as in the case of Baloch, for bringing their family to “dangerous” by displaying their own sexuality.
Murders are usually committed by close blood.
According to the Pakistani law, Qisas (blood money) and Dayat (Odwet) can ask for the nearest victims of forgiveness.
Three months after Baloch's murder, Parliament adopted a new legislation imposing a life sentence for the murder of honour.
However, whether the murder will be considered an honorary crime remains in court, which means that the killers can theoretically resort to other reasons and be judged.
In the case of Baloch, her parents at first insisted that their son should not be treated kindly in any way.
However, they are upset that they may also lose him, have changed their mind, and show that they want to stop him.
The international harassment caused by the murder has forced the State of Pakistan to take an unprecedented step and to declare itself a failure together with its parents, requiring the same move to the future.
One of the most famous Baloch performances is to offer a strip before the Pakistani cricket team and set up a pure-brown dress in Valentine's Day.
It was criticised and threatened, but many people, including young people, viewed it as a disturbing restriction in a country where the invitation to become a model for Kim Kardashian could be considered a ridiculous and political movement to strengthen the position of women.
The “honorous” killings are among the tribal social standards that still prevail in South Asia, and in particular the standards of female behaviour, although men can also be victims.

Anarchia gives the number of people living in northern and western Nigeria to 40,000: UNHCR
On Friday, the UN organization stated that the growing violence has caused the number of people living in northern and western Nigeria to double over the last four months.
The UN Refugee Agency has stated that concerns have created "a new exceptional humanitarian situation", which requires an inter-agency effort to gather by the end of the year of new measures of $35.5 million.
Babar Baloch, UN High Commissioner for Refugees, said that the Islamic group Boko Haram, which has been leading up north of the country for decades, is not responsible for the last attack.
The increase in violence in the Nigerian states of Sokoto, Zamfara and Katsina has been observed over the last 10 months is rather the result of activities organised by armed groups.
"It's a frightening image of anarchy and uncertainty," he said to a journalist on Friday.
He reported on frequent reports of rapes, tortures, rapes, murders and sexual assaults by attackers who also destroy homes and stolen profits.
Military and police have been sent to combat gangs of criminals in the region.
However, the military is withdrawn from the fight against Boko Haram and the eviction of the Islamic state in West Africa, which has resigned from its long-standing group in 2016.
"Employers don't come with the names of the groups," he said.
That's what's going on with the back of the story.
In most countries, refugees move to neighboring Niger.
In his statement to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees said that it is expected that more people will enter Niger in the coming months, along with the worsening security situation, particularly in the state of Sokoto.
New date of the report of the male accused of killing women and 2 children
A new date of the report was planned for a man accused of killing the residents of Iowa and her two children from Guatemala.
The Act of the Regional Court in the province of Poland states that 31-year-old Marvin Escobar-Orellan is charged with three murders of the first degree, as stated by the authorities, with a false name originally given by the police: Marvin Escquivel-Lopez.
He didn't confess.
It appears that the police killed 29-year-old Flores-Rodriguez, her 11-year-old daughter and her 5-year-old son on 16 July at their home in Des Moines.
The Court of Justice has concluded that the new date of the proceedings, i.e. 27 January, will allow the representatives of both sides more time to prepare.
U.S. Immigration and Customs officials say Escobar-Orellan lives in the United States illegally and has been deported twice before the shooting.
In 2010, he was sentenced to illegal entry into the United States.
“The Sun”: Boris Johnson in view of the rebellion of the Office to reduce requests for Brexit and to reach a compromise agreement with Brussels
Within just three weeks of the final EU leaders' honour among the most important people in the country in the prime minister's environment, there is a growing concern that he does not have enough time to make important decisions.
Boris Johnson is at risk of a rebellion by the Office wishing to reduce requests for Brexit and reach a compromise agreement with the EU.
In the negotiations, there was an impasse on a new customs system which should be replaced by a backstop mechanism for Ireland, as Brussels identified other provisions offered by Johnson as "incompetence".
The Ministers of the Crown expect the EU's decision-makers, which is the intention of Chief of German Angela Merkel, to offer you the most critical leadership to compromise as a three-year time limit for the implementation of the backstop mechanism.
The Sun spoke with three different branch ministers, all of whom are preparing to meet with the prime minister after the annual Tours conference next week in Manchester.
They will be asked by the Prime Minister to reject the "aggressive" strategy developed by his close adviser Dominika Cummingsa on attempts to use bluff towards the EU and threaten to leave the Union without agreement and then accept its offer made at the last moment by the Union.
One of the officers of the Office identified the controversial verdict of the Supreme Court on Tuesday on the termination of Parliament's suspension as "an alert" and added: "The only way we can leave the European Union on 31 October is to do so on the basis of a contract.
We're never going to make arthmetics in the Gmin Ezbey that works for our disadvantage.
The Premier must now go ahead and accept what he is able to get.
Aggressiveness doesn't pay: it's obvious that Cummings' plan burned on her.
We can't fight so many fronts.
The second office minister committed himself to hand over to Johnson to try to reverse the agreement of former Prime Minister Theresy May if he doesn't say anything else.
The minister said: "If I have to, I'll tell the Prime Minister to introduce again the agreement proposed by Theresa May in the Gmin House."
There are a number of opportunities for her to vote, and it's all very much up to the end of this matter.
If we're forced to prolong the term, it's the end of Boris Johnson and the end of us all.
John Major told Boris Johnson he wasn't serious about the negotiations.
In the summer talk, the prime minister of the Toris said: “The Prime Minister tells us that he wants an agreement with the European Union.
But we can't see him sitting in Brussels and working on it.
Instead, it's going through the streets of Scotland, checking the eggs in Valia and fighting with its citizens on the main streets of the city – everything in the world as if the election campaign had been going on for good."
The current prime minister's attorney admitted yesterday that the contract was still delayed and added: "No one should have any reason: to make a deal very long."
However, the complainant also said that the law of Benna, which introduces a three-month deferral of Brexit, in the absence of an agreement, "actively weakens our negotiating position" in Brussels.
He said: "There is no doubt that this law is difficult for us to negotiate, but despite its prime minister and its colleagues, it continues to make progress through hard work."
Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay is returning to Brussels today, where he will have more discussions with Michel Barnier on the EU's side.
They will discuss the book on how the area is functioning throughout Ireland for food and food.

Perfectly imperfect
The customer was supposed to be successful.
However, he managed to avoid it.
Suczka was transferred from Romania to Great Britain by Beacon Animal Rescue Centre.
The dog picture was published on Facebook.
Kate Comfort has been in love with the animal since the first visit.
"At first, I had trouble convincing my husband to adopt, because we already had three dogs," she said.
The woman decided she'd take care of the cat until someone doesn't take it.
But no one's reported yet.
“The fact that no one wanted her made me want to take her more and more.
She was sensitive and needed love," Kate said.
Finally, the marriage decided to adopt Bonnie.
"Our Bonnie is perfectly imperfect.
We love her the way she is, and if anyone doesn't like how she looks, that's his problem, not us," said the woman.
Bonnie, in time, became a star of social media.
Instagram, it has over 14,000 Internet sites.
Lorraine Kelly: I've been told I'll never do a career on television with a voice accent
According to Lorraine Kelly, TV executives said that because of the attention from Glasgow, "he'll never make careers" as a president.
Recalling her 35-year-old career in the television industry, Kelly, in 59, admitted that before her first performance on the screen she felt “very nervous”.
"I was just 25 years old and I was very upset," she said.
When I was working in BBC Scotland as a research and research specialist, the chief of directors said I would never make success on television with my headmaster from Glasgow.
I went to London to meet the entire TV team and watch the program show before I took up my duties at the Glasgow office.
I'll never forget the story of the Bette Davis star by Anne Diamond and Mike Morris that morning.
I didn't believe I was in the same room with the living legend.
I knew I wanted to stay here.
Before Kelly became a shocking TV correspondent in 1984, she started her career as a local reporter in East Kibride in Scotland.
Then she started running such programs as "GMTV", "ITV Breakfast" and "Daybreak" to start with her morning program "Lorraine", which was named after her.
The 35th anniversary of her career is devoted to a special program that will remind her of her best moments and experiences.
The President said that the secretary of her long course in television is "passion and enthusiasm" and "interest", adding: "It needs to be hard to work.
To be honest and truthful.
Prepare for programmes and be both interested and interested.
When she recalls the media reports that devastated her emotions, Kelly appears to have been "very hard" for her to communicate with the castle in Dunblane.
I had no idea that many families of murdered or wounded children were watching our Dunblane live program the day after the terrible murder of sixteen children and their teachers.
One of the mothers, Pam Ross, whose 5-year-old daughter Joanna was murdered, asked me for a private meeting, during which we talked to her at home for many hours.
The whole meeting took place after the silence, and Pam Ross and I will be friends from the moment Johnny's funeral I took part.
She added that "very difficult" was the experience of Kate and Gerry McCannami shortly after their daughter Madeleine disappeared in 2007 and that "it really impressed their strength and enthusiasm".
They have to deal with the pain because they don't know what happened to their beloved daughter and also have the worst comments on Internet trolls.
I'm with them with all my heart.
The program for the 35th anniversary of Lorraine Kelly's work on television starts at 8:30 a.m. on Monday, 30 September at ITV.
Zimbabwe: Chiweng was under arrest
The senior state official said that Vice-President Constantine Chiweng refused to take the office of President Robert Mugabe at the turning point because he was afraid of arrests in order to confirm the military's takeover in November 2017.
Last week, "The Zimbabwe Independent", Mugabe offered the Vice-President of China a presidency during his talks with the military in the context of the return.
However, a higher level of government officials announced in the social media that Chiweng did not reject the offer because he had reviewed Mugabe's plan to use it to prove to the world leaders and to the African Union (AU) that he had actually lost during his return.
In a tweet on the Twitter portal, which confirmed that 37-year-old Zimbabwe Governors wanted to transfer the authority of Vice-President Chiwende, not President Emmerson Mmangawie, Jamanda 2, to which the state officials confirmed that he was a senior state official in the Office of the President and the Council of Ministers, it was said that intensive negotiations were under way at the time.
The government officials said Mugabe contacted Chiweng via one of his agents when he realized that the government was holding him off.
Media among the military authorities and the dead former president had, in the opinion of a higher ranks of state officials, three phases.
The official said that he was the chairman of President George Charamba, a former head of the Central Organization for the Development of Aaron Nheper and a spiritual bishop representing the Roman Catholic Bishop Fidelis Mukonori.
The head of the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe, Gideon Gono, was another element since Mugabe sent him with a single mission to deliver the offer to the president of Chiwendze, who was chief of the Zimbabwe Defence Force (SOZ).
A person who was considered more than alive as an icon of Africa after his death tried to obtain from the U.S. military intervention by forceing other African leaders to intervene.
The President's offer to the former Chief Defence Force (SSO) in Chiwende was not made out of the election.
"It was desperate to save a situation that was dangerously timed by removing part of the family of the deceased," wrote the official (Jamunda).
But there was also some political temptation to help the dead wish to reverse the situation completely non-democratic.
It is enough to remind itself that the witnesses have shown that they have failed and are not violating the constitutional order, which would be the cause of their conflict with the UA's position on conversion.
The dead (Mugaba) hoped that at the time the SSO (Chiwenga) would be able to make a full contribution, strongly interrupting the claims of leaders that they did not violate the constitutional order.
The hope for the dead (Mugab) was that the UA, which, on the other hand, continued to be highly focused on the whole situation and how to fit it into its theoretical taxonomy of conversions, would have no choice at all but to describe it as a return, so that the call for military intervention would be credible.
That's the spirit and that's what made this offer.
The officials claimed that Mugabe performed this movement when he felt that the defence forces were no longer ready to protect him.
They said Mugabe was forced to sign a ban list after warning the governor that he was risking a link in Kaddafie's style.
The military commanders told him they wouldn't return guns against the citizens if they moved to his Blue Roof residence.
And at the same time, Mugabe had two wishes to save his family and prove that the army had taken power," the officer added.
The former SSO and the leaders read the Foundations correctly.
The messenger (Gono) who delivered this desperate message was given to understand – through a powerful metaphor – that the sum of the vemakakupa-makakupas (we belong to the Kumflasz sect, i.e. the army), we are not politicians or we are not competing with each other at political level, said a higher level of government officials.
The authorities tell the state that the military has informed military leaders in the region of the attacks in Zimbabwe that they are not going to fight Mugabe but to talk to the surrounding "criminals".
Mugabe has tried to use the same strategy to re-emerge Manangawa from a short stay in the Republic of South Africa so that they can talk about recovery and success.
In addition to negotiating with the army, Mugabe also sought assistance in the region.
The residents of the Republic of South Africa, which is a key element of the process – not only because of its economic and regional strength but also because of the fact that former President Jacob Zuma was President Sadc – refused to intervene, but clearly indicated that if the army comes to Mugabe's home as often as it feared in the background, the armies of the Republic of South Africa will suddenly appear in Harare.
"This didn't work because Putin and African leaders didn't choose this path," said the Independent, a certain informant.
China needs strong leadership or "distributive" as the policy document states
China needs strong, unanimized leadership of the Communist Party, since the country, on the other hand, is “disappearable” – the government has established a document on the policy issued on Friday in the preceding 70th anniversary of the establishment of the People's Republic.
The Chinese government's press office told the White Paper that the country's success since the occupation of the Communists 70 years ago has led to the party's leadership.
China is a major area, has complex national conditions, but it is rare to see administrative difficulties here.
The document recalls that without the unified and strong leadership of China, it will move towards the sides of the divide and the collapse that will be disastrous for the world.
The Chinese authorities have long been using the policy of hard hand as in the case of the translation of pro-democracy protests in Beijing in 1989, which is why it is necessary to maintain the stability of the country.
President Xi Jinping's strong hand, which will take place on Tuesday at the end of the second year of the world economy's size, has been further strengthened by the government of the party since the end of 2012 and has applied sanctions to those who can question power.
Xi also oversees the military modernisation programme that has emerged from the balance of the region.
The document states that China is not trying to export its development model or wants to import any foreign models into the room only, not to "hegemonia".
The Chinese don't have the genes of subjugation or domination over the world.
In the days of modern China, great hardships have taken place, and wars and troubles have been deeply affected by the effects of suffering; China never imposes other sufferings that it has experienced.
China is dealing with this anniversary at some time for a country that is accustomed to a hot war with the United States and is facing challenges due to the release of the economy, as well as anti-governmental protests under China Hong Kong.
The document says that China will never "pretend" its most important interests, nor will it allow anything to undermine their sovereignty.
With regard to the country's trade dispute with Washington, the document states that "the danger of trade wars and further increase in customs duties will not lead to problems".
China has experienced an economy with a full industrial system, a complete chain of industries, a broad market place and a strong economic development temperature.
The document added that "the trade war will never weaken it".
China is certain that they are able to cope with difficulties, change the crisis into new opportunities and open up a new world.
It was also added that the United States should look at China's development rationally, since China does not intend to question the position of the United States, nor does it want to replace the United States.
The United States can't control China, and it's even less likely that they will stop China's development.
Limitation and weakening of other countries and the transfer of national border agreements will not guarantee the United States of America's strong position.
World Jack Palikiwicza: Dubai, real faces
The Dubai Empress is still looking for its own identity, divided between the Cuban tradition, religious radicalism of Islam and extreme progress.
This branding new trends of world tourism leader inspires imagination and desires, facilitating the transparency of affordable snobs hotels and attracting the well-being of investors and traders as a tax environment.
The Internet pages are enthusiasts of this city of March, which is an exciting luxury temple and a heavy concentration of the twenty-first century architecture.
They grew up on the rich in the cave of emigration became Eden for those who love the rest, the five-star hotels, the beautiful weather, and the basic hundreds of meters above the ground.
Many are attracted by the universal appeal here, the appreciation of creative hyperactivism and the hysterical path of avaquarity.
This is the city whose motto says everything: “Shut up, strangle and watch.”
And that's almost every step.
But there are also those who can look at Dubai critically, calling it a city without a character.
According to British writer Lawrence Osborne, "the full strength and resistance of the metropolis has brought about the size of the fine grotesque".
It was transformed into a future costume, completely dominated by the Guinness Book of Records, an informal constitution.
Because everything here must be bigger and cheaper than anywhere else in the world.
There is, however, a lack of something that may be somewhat transparent in old Europe, but important for the quality of life.
In Wrocław, Berlin or Madrid, everyone feels like home.
And in Dubai, I don't think so.
Fleeing from the world of heaven, I wiped out his golden mask, revealing the other faces of an artificial paradise.
A face that doesn't speak aloud and doesn't write.
I show the Asian flag contrasting with the basal conditions of the God-given ethnic box of Dubains, the unwritten Beduins.
I am in a place of extreme poverty, such as the gett on the edge of the city, where the Asian workers' army is living under harsh conditions.
This is exactly what they built during a generation of generations under the wretched conditions of the desert of Manhattan.
They came here with good jobs and a chance to make a good life for their families, and they became a nightmare.
This tourist will never see it because it could blow it up in the air created by the years of Mit Dubai.
The frequent criticism of international society makes the issue of labour becoming very difficult for the emera.
Mel C from the Spice Girls team ordered in her home a discussion of diets after her needs with nutrition disorders
Melanie Chisholm from the Spice Girls team admitted that there is a ban on the use of diet in her home after she herself struggled with eating disorders, eating only fruit and vegetables.
Sport Spice has not been able to “obsessively trained” over the years because of the pressure associated with being a celebrity member of the pop group worldwide, which later led to depression and malnutrition.
He now reveals that her experiences affect how she raised her daughter Scarlett, so he also “does not allow her to talk about diets at home”.
"Scarlet is 10 years old now and I'm starting to realize that he's more aware of his appearance," Mel said.
"I believe that one of the benefits of eating disorders is that I am very aware of the way I speak to her.
The use of positive language has now become my habit.
In a report to the Women's Health Mel magazine, which was celebrated in the 1990s as a member of the Spice Girls team, she said that in times before the social media were created, comments on her subject were complex.
"I began to look at myself in an inappropriate way by turning away from certain groups of food products, practicing more and more obsessively, until I began to feel sick," she says.
"I was sick and it probably lasted a few years."
A picture that's all over the world.
Poland's girl and American documentaryist gave the world a witness to war cruelty.
Legendary picture of Julien Bryana can be seen at the World War II Museum in Gdańsk
"Listen to my story.
I'm talking about a fortified city of Warsaw.
I can and must speak on behalf of the Polish people about what happened here.
America has to work, it has to help!" began its radio show documentaryist, photographer, Julien Bryan.
In a tragic, September day in 1939 he was in the capital of Poland, where he saw the drama of the bombed city and its inhabitants.
His relationship turned out to be a broad drive to the West.
The President of Warsaw, Stefan Starzzynski, first helped him, he wanted a car, but then he asked him to leave immediately for his own safety.
Brian wrote a letter to the family in the U.S., put it in the embassy's safe and... he stayed.
For the next four weeks, he tried to be everywhere where he was going.
400 planes and artillery almost non-stop attacked the city.
Bryan has lived on pictures of death, suffering, the struggle to survive in the city halls.
Even before the capitalisation, he and his embassies had produced negative ocean effects.
He didn't stop talking about Hitler's crimes.
He appealed to the world: "What met Warsaw, the Paris meeting, London, and even New York."
His stirring records were seen by President Eleanor Roosevelt.
Soon the United States began to prepare for war.
"Dad showed the truth and thus fought against the German propaganda.
They were making films glorifying their race.
They said they didn't attack women and children, and people believed them," says Sam Bryan, son of Julien.
Debates of the European Parliament and of the Council
In front of the jury, the case of violence against the university team at Delaware, which is considered to be a number of sexual assaults.
On Friday after 10 days of submission and hearing of arguments by members of the jury, they joined in the resolution of 23-year-old Clay Conawaya.
A woman who was 21 years old said Conaway raped her when she went to her house in June 2018.
The event took place three weeks after the closing of this two-year-old knowledge on Bumble's page and sent a woman through a man's photo on which he presented himself.
A woman is one of the six who accuse Conawaya of sexual assaults in the years 2013-2018.
According to the prosecutor, the attack on which the woman had expressed her consent was violent, which she had met with.
The defenders are referring to the opposite relations between women and women in the memory and claim that the woman is probably grieving that she has reached an intimate relationship.
Gold on two wheels: Polish wheel for millions of gold
Covered with gold biker worth millions of gold you could see on the jubilee, 10th edition on the International Bike-EXPO Wheels.
It's an extraordinary 3D printing vehicle.
His designer, 30-year-old Adam Zdanowicz, just got his bike Oscar at the Las Vegas World Railway Exhibition.
The daily example has made a fur on the markets. - The wheel is covered with a gold nose chrome, under which is the highest silver sample.
It's a non-smooth dress made by my colleague from Zor.
"It's a chair, they're pedaled, it's a driver, it might be normal for him to drive.
It can develop at 50 kilometers an hour.
It's an electric bike," says his designer.
“Rover Karoseria was printed on 3D printer.
It's the six creative kind of faith.
I came up with the idea of this model by going on my first bike home a few years ago.
I drew it on the map and hid it deep into the ceiling.
Uncle was waiting for five years to come.
Sam's biker's been up for three years," adds Adam Zdanowic.
“It was very difficult to hide all the elements under the corridor.
There are batteries, guidelines, elements that make up the structure.
It's hidden under a basket placed in 11 elements on a steel frame.
There's also a motor hidden there.
The driver of this bike set up a week before my trip to the United States to the World Railway Station.
I couldn't finally decide what kind of leader this is going to be.
She's in the transport.

Film material shows strong pollution of popular tourist places
The Sydney Stock Exchange is surrounded by an opera building, the Circular Quay Port, the Luna Park entertainment park and of course the famous Harbour Bridge offers its important contribution to the amount of $21,9 billion annually offered by tourists visiting Sydney.
However, under the bridge the seeds of truth are hidden.
The known Sydney catch is one of the most affected waterways in the country, which affects the annual level of pollution of about 15 Olympic basses.
These frightening statistics make one of our biggest tourist attractions at the same time one of our worst waters.
According to the new film material entitled “Sydney Bay – Up and Down” water in the most popular city of Australia is full of wastes, plastic bags and bottles, lost boots and parts of clothing, and even dead animals, and all this is due to flooding along the river walls.
However, most of the composition of our oxygen channels is plastic.
"I'd call it a paradox," said Dr. Katherine Dafforn, director of the Sydney Harbour Research Program, published on September 27th, and the publication of this film is in the course of World Tourism Day.
This aquene looks beautiful, but it's one of the most modified and damaged ports of the river along our coast.
The CSIRO Agency estimates that every hour about 1560 kg of plastic is transported to our waterways, and most of it is affected by the capture through the noise channel.
"After such severe setbacks... it looks pretty tragic," said Dr. Dafforn.
Two thirds of the pollution comes from rainwater.
However, as in the case of the high water problem with Sydney Bay, 70% of the plastic transported to the bottom of the sea is significantly more important.
“I believe that unless time is running out of water, you cannot really know what is in the deep there,” said Richard Nicholls, owner of the Dive Centre Manly, pointing out that he and his team are pulling out of the water alone about 500 kg plastic a year.
I think if more people knew (that's under water), they'd just be scared.
It's exciting... over half of what we've found on the day is plastic nets.
The remaining 50% are things that are at least done by artificial creation.
When you look at the floor, it looks beautiful, and people can't believe that all this plastic and the rest of the trash are coming out under the surface.
Jeremy Brown, co-founder and director of Ocean Protection, said there are ways in which people — both local and tourists — could help reduce the amount of plastic and the rest of our waterways.
"This has to start with the source," he said.
We need to reduce the amount used by our plastics, better conduct material recovery and have greater awareness of what we're going through in the streets that end up dealing with the oceans.
If we destroy the ocean, it's waiting for us to starve, because 50% of what we breathe comes from the ocean.
It extracts 30% carbon dioxide and our food source.
However, we can fix this flood and bring it back to the old world, which is very simple.
If we kill our oceans, we kill ourselves.
The film material financed by the TOMRA recycling company in its broader efforts to educate Australians in the area of environmental protection and reducing the negative impact of alcohol users who are often trafficked into the environment is in the course of a study on the relevance of artificial and mental health, which has been published this month.
A new survey of 546 children aged 12 to 18 years showed that 82% of respondents felt uncomfortable with waste from artificial products and 25% of adults due to problems with waste from single plastic packs.
The study found that wastes from artificial objects were also a fourth and a fourth concern for parents, and 93% of 551 surveyed parents said that their growing concern was related to the number of plastic wastes from oceans.
Many people who participated in the study said that they wanted to do something about waste from artificial objects, but they just don't know how to make significant changes that led to environmental change.

Google's making a chromium in Poland.
BP PKO partner
Operator Chmuri National, PKO BP and PFR, has concluded a strategic partnership with Google.
Cooperation should help the Polish company to implement and use the potential of digital chemistry technology.
Google Cloud Platform products will be included in the offer of National Chmuri operator, and Google will open in Warsaw so-called Google Cloud region – the hub of technical infrastructure and software dedicated to customers from Poland and the region of Central and Eastern Europe.
The Google Cloud region will be the first global, public computing firm in Central Europe.
The cryptification of Polish companies was one of the key foundations that were based on the project to create the National Court, initiated and developed by the PKO Bank of Poland and the Polish Development Fund, the participants of this company.
The partnership of Chmuri National and Google is another important step along the way that we referred to an imperfect year ago by announcing the call of Operator Chmuri National.
The objective remains unchanged – the diversification of the Polish economy and the dynnamization of its growth.
"The Polish companies are now receiving additional tools designed to implement it.
By using them, they increase their chances of making progress to the world's league, which is up to us all.
The fact that Google is joining them today will greatly strengthen our joint project," says Zbigniew Jajajeło, president of the PKO Bank of Poland.
The Polish Development Fund points out that it is interested in investment projects that support the development of modern industries and businesses.
"Investment in the National Chmura operator is ideally part of the PFR strategy as an important element of country digitalisation.
It will provide modern and affordable solutions based on chromium architecture.
"I am convinced that this cooperation will also have a positive impact on the development of the Polish IT market and will attract the best specialists," says PFR President Paul Borys.
Google Cloud offers advanced technologies, products and analytical tools based on leading technical infrastructure, which provides a great deal of computing and data storage services.
Customers in Poland in the service portfolio find all the key products Google Cloud Platform such as Computer Engine, App Engine, Google Kubernetes Engine, Cloud Bigtable, Cloud Spanner or BigQuery.
Enabling Google Cloud services to offer Chmuri National will allow Polish entrepreneurs to use exactly the same advanced technologies that they use their global competition.
However, we will remain in the Polish jurisdiction and under the control of local regulators," said Michał Potoczek, President of the State Operator Chmuri.
It adds that the company will be ready for megatrends, such as the Internet of Things (IoT), which repeatedly increases the demand for the computational power needed to process solid data collections.
VI Generalpolska Parad of Seniors
On Sunday, 24 August 2019, at Rondde de Gaulle in Warsaw, the VI Parada of the Seniors “Do Wonderful” and the Picnic of the Generations, held by the Foundation of Beginnings, began.
As the Wisniewski Industry of the Foundation stated: “The Council is an event on a global scale.
It has already passed six times through the centre of Warsaw to determine how large and diverse society is becoming elders.
By means of Paradise, we have opposed harmful stereotypes of older people and we call for inter-ethnic solidarity."
The parade was carried out by a special five-year-old car serving as a musical stage, on which the Warsaw DJ Wik has traditionally appeared.
The participants in the joyous choir, during the second known Warsaw and world battles, passed by the Allies of Jerusalem, Ul. Kracza to the Place of the Uprising of Warsaw, Ul. Mazowieck to the Place of J. Piłssudski and Ul. Królevska and Krakow at the campus of the University of Warsaw.
In the course of the march, which involved several times thousands of seniors representing 300 senior organisations from all over Poland, the colour delegations welcomed were classes of numerous groups along the route of the march, the wharfs and tourists.
From the Legion, two organized groups were involved in the company's blue and blue shirts.
The first to represent the Third World University and the Senior+ Club and the second to be named SAGA, the Senior Active Group of Animaters.
In the field of the campus, university organizers have prepared, inter alia, gastronomic and numerical losses of institutions and companies offering services and products to improve their daily life and functioning.
There were medical, cosmetic, culinary, recreation, sports and fashions.
For example, for example, the Stylish Seniors' Voice by Professor Hanny Piekarski and projector Agnieszki Wywal, guidance and information on current trends in the 60+ mode could be obtained.
Stoisko also offered a scholarship to the art of motion after stage and the invitation to take pictures.
It was a show of old-style fashions.
At the table of the General Voice of Seniors was the latest edition of the letter and material on the campaign “Stop handling – Do Not Buy Presentations!”.
The next hundreds offered cosmetics, motions, plastics and artistic.
A few studies could be conducted and consulted with health and nutrition specialists.
Discussion panels were also organised with participation in: Heleny Norowicz, Beaty Tadli, Marioli Bojarskij-Fernc, Thomas Jacykova or Robert Janowski.
The picnic didn't include vocal and musical attractions.
The legend of the Polish song – Krzysztof Krawczyk appeared on the street, and at night there was an inter-cooling dance that was conducted by DJ Wika.
The tasmans may provide an indication of the treatment of cancer
Tasmanians may have a key to cancer treatment – researchers have discovered that it can revolutionize treatment for patients.
Medical researchers have discovered how to mask some of the new cells
Researchers have found that the same process depends on the demons of Tasmanian and human beings.
There is hope that this will lead to new methods of treating oncological patients.
What do the two Tasmans and the people have?
Newborn cells that may become invisible.
Researchers, including Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre in Melbourne, have made a transient discovery that may help to revolutionize the treatment of some of the new drugs if they do not respond to immunotherapy.
It may also contain the key to the treatment of fatal tumors in the face that threaten the future of a dangerous Tasmanian devil.
The study has established how to mask some of the new cells both in humans and in bags, using a white group called the PRC2, which excludes the marker that would otherwise signal the anti-repudiation system to attack the new one.
This may pose the greatest challenge in treating lung cancer, neuroblastoma and type of skin cancer called cancer from Merk's cell.
"The great importance of this project is that in patients with occasionally developing resistance to immunological therapy, we can be able to reverse this process," said AAP researcher Mark Dawson from Peter Mac.
Existing therapy can be directed at re-injecting markers called MHC, which allows the immunological system to identify the newly formed cells.
"Maybe it has far-reaching implications for people with lung transplants," said Professor Dawson.
“This is one of the most common diseases on earth.
And maybe we'll be able to treat her a lot better.
Researchers also hope that the discovery will ever be used to treat the faces of the Tasmanian devil, where newborn cells in a similar way avoid detection.
"It is unusual that the same process is exactly the same (in the case of innovations in humans and in the demons of Tasmanian people),” said Professor Dawson.
“How difficult this time it was to treat the demons of the Tasmans.
But if medicines that work in humans can also be used in tasman demons, there is a possibility that it will help control disease."
Scientists believe that the universe really is a very large planet
Scientists are amazed by the discovery of a 30-year-old solar system of light from Earth, which reflects our current understanding of the processes of the creation of the planet, since in this arrangement a large planet similar to Jovis is orbiting around a small star called a red male.
Artistic illustration of the planet of the gas type GJ 3512b orbiting around the star of the central red ball, published on 26 September 2019.
In general, stars are much larger than even the largest planets orbiting around them.
However, as scientists have pointed out in the fourth quarter, in this case the stars and the planets differ little in size.
The size of the star called GJ 3512 is about 12% of the size of the Sun, but the mass of the planet that surrounds it is at least half the mass of the Jovisza, or the largest planet of our solar system.
"Yes, it's an absolute surprise," said Astrophysicist Juan Carlos Morales from the Catholic Space Research Institute at the Spanish Space Research Institute, which became a series of research published in the journal Science.
The discovery is surprising because the theoretical models of the creation of solar systems suggest that stars with a lower mass of rules become parent stars for less planets like Earth or less Neptunes.
"In this case, we have discovered a planet of a gas type like an olive tree that is orbiting around a very small star," added Morales.
The planet that resembles Jovisz consists mainly of gas, discovered using telescopes at Calar Alto Observatory in Spain.
She surrounds her star after a very elliptical orbit, and full rotation takes 204 days.
Red balls are small and have relatively low surface temperature.
The GJ 3512 star is not only significantly smaller than the Sun, but to a certain extent it has a relatively larger size than the planet, since it is only about 35% higher than Jovis.
They emit less energy, so they are closer than the sun, and their surface temperature is lower and is approximately 3800 (degrees) in Kelvin (6180 degrees Fahrrenheita / 3527 degrees Celsius).
"That's why they have red color," said Morales.
"There are evidence of the existence of a second planet that is currently orbiting around this star, while a third planet could be removed from a star system in the past, which could interpret an elliptical orbit of a planet similar to Jowisz," said Morales.
The planets are made up of the same interstellar disk of gas and dust that forms a star around which planets orbit.
According to the leading model of the creation of a planet called the model of action, the original object is made up of particles in the disk and the force of gravity of the planet in the early stages of development allows for the formation of atmosphere from surrounding gas.
This non-competitive system may explain a competitive model called a gravitational instability model.
"In this case, the protoplanetary disk around the young star may be something more massive than we expect and may be cold," said Morales.
This leads to a deterioration of the disk's stability and can therefore occur in some harsher areas.
These masses can grow until the time of the fall and the creation of the planet.
Delicate staff accused of co-administration of a professional dip containing methamphetamine
The office of Szeryfa in the town of Marion held Cassandra Medinë-Hernardez, 38 years old, for the administration of a professional dip containing methamphetamine.
On Thursday from Albania, 38-year-old Cassandra Ani Medina-Hernardez was charged with the supply of methamphetamine and the use of this substance controlled by another person – both crimes are crimes of the second degree.
The complaint was filed on the basis of an event from 9 September in the food store of Thiftway in Jefferson.
In a statement made by OregonLive.com portal under an oath pointing to the likelihood of wine on 27-year-old co-workers suspected of being replaced by Marion's county sheriff that during his lunch break, she saw Medina-Hernerandez make a fake dip that she then used.
On the basis of the statement, it is reported that the victim of a crime that according to what she reported subsequently never received methamphetamines said that “she thought one of her bones had tasted strangely, but it did not arouse any suspicions. ”
When she got back to work, she felt that she had a scarf and that she couldn't stand on her feet.
According to the Albany Democrat-Herald newspaper, she managed to go to a local hospital where it was found that a fascal dip could contain methamphetamine.
On the basis of reports from The Smoking Gun, a police officer on the Thriftway network said that Medina-Hernardez "Telled her to add drugs to her food", while another admitted that she was suspected of sending her message, claiming that methamphetamine had been hit by an accident.
The OregonLive site informs about the recording from the delicates monitoring, which is said to show how returned to the Medina-Hernerandez camera pulls something out of the biostonosa, becomes a microphaly and falls down.
Then it's easy to get out of the nose, get to the table and put on a fashionable dip in a small paper way.
According to the police, the thing she pulled out of the boustonosa was probably also on the taller.
The Oregon newspaper Statesman-Journal reports that the sheriff's employees say there is no doubt now that the customer will be given any food.
Medina-Hernardez is in prison in the state of Marion – a fine of $520,000.
According to The Smoking Gun, her extensive police card indicates that she was already sentenced to assault, robbery, theft of identity, delivery of methamphetamine, theft, possession of methamphetamine and possession of unauthorized weapons.
Johnson's giving you the secret in a combination of the rejection.
The visit of Boris Johnson to the United Nations General Assembly was interrupted by the historic decision of the Supreme Court.
However, his vengeful appearance at the Gmin Selection did not betray any shame or loss of summation.
To explain the meaning of this return, in the eyes of the Cyclone Tony Connelly, editor of the European RTE section in Brussels and London correspondent Sean Wheelan in Westminster.

Marian Banas.
What's KAS doing about Chief NIK?
The acquisition of real estate at a lower market price is a contradiction that is evident in the case of the President of the Supreme Court of Control of Mariana Banasia.
We asked what the treasure is doing in this regard in the Kraków Customs Administration Committee and the Ministry of Finance.
Bertold Kittel, in his report to the "Supervisor" TVN, expressed doubts about the statements of the President of the Supreme Court of Control of Mariana Banasia.
A few months of research is the Central Anti-Corruption Bureau.
Control should be completed in the second half of October, after parliamentary elections.
As a result of the announcement, Banas had to rent a stone of 400 square metres and two smaller apartments.
In sum, he received 65.7 thousand gold a year.
The report "Superviser" revealed that a hotel was located on the stone rented by him for hours.
The head of the NIK later translated into state television, so he took only over 5,000 gold a month after renting property.
"The House of Elections," calling on the experts from the assessment of real estate, she appreciated that it should be 15 thousand gold per month on the same stone.
"The amount was lower for a simple reason: I concluded a preliminary contract and just because the buyer had to buy this stone, I agreed on a lower rate that the remaining liabilities would be calculated on the sale of the stone," Banas concluded.
However, doubts arose as to whether such action would constitute a violation of the law.
Konrad Zawada, head of the Office of the Treasure Administration in Krakow, informed TVN24 that "the Ministry of Finance is taking direct action on this matter".
"All such questions are addressed to the Minister of Finance," he added.
He explained that in such cases "acts shall be carried out by the National Customs Administration".
Director of the Ministry of Finance Paul Jurek admitted that the National Customs Administration itself monitors a number of matters that may raise any objections.
"The National Customs Administration is acting in such a way that it has its own information as well as in a certain sense based on those information which are publicly available.
On this basis, it shall decide whether or not a specific case is to be conducted or not," explained the MF.
"The fact that it is binding on all of us in the entire treasure secret financial resource is therefore that we will never be able to speak in individual matters of a taxable person, a specific person or a company," he stressed, asking about Mariana Banasia.
Finance Minister Jerzy Kwicinski stressed that "the customs authorities do not communicate to the public information of this type of information".
"Of course, the whole charging device is very similar in many cases throughout the country," he said.
Secrets of the Royal Family: revealed to visitors often flying by the Royal Air Force
Under the service obligations of the royal family during their lifetime, they must make themselves available in hundreds of travel worldwide.
This usually facilitates a royal plane – a private machine that carries the royal family around the world on important events and events.
It's no surprise that owning a plane is related to privileges.
Members of the royal family do not have to stand in long distances to get rid of, they do not have their luggage limits, and they may also, as it turns out, invite any guests – including those who are really unaccompanied.
According to a recent prime minister on Channel 5 of the documentary film, not only the king and the book of Philip are often traveling on royal planes.
During the program entitled "King's Flights Secrets" the king's pilot announced that, along with the royal family, the flight was often conducted by interested guests.
Bob Shields said: "Sometimes, along with our very important royal guests, very important royal dogs could fly."
It is not surprising that the queen could earn her loved ones on her journeys, since she is known for her deep attachment to the dogs of the bear race.
Since the earliest years of King Elżbieta has been a lover of these four creative creatures, it has been heard that since the crowning period, he has been the owner of more than 30 crowns.
It is said that in 2007, she had five disciplines: Monty, Emma, Linneta, Willowa and Holly.
It included five Spanish cockers: Bisto, Oxo, Flash, Spick and Spain, as well as the four dogs that will be a cross-country skirmish: Cider, Barry Vulcan and Candy.
The king's aircraft must have had full hands.
A staff member of the royal dog house was seen and asked to meet their needs before they were caught by the plane – says Shields.
I'm glad to say it never happened to any incident.
The programme also revealed a shocking number of baggage that the king will take on board during his journey in carrying out his duties.
The film Narrator said: "In 1953 the king took 12 tons of luggage on his journey of 70,000 kilometers."
To be able to draw it better, it's less the same as two huge salts.
However, the king is not the only person with a weakness in fashion.
Similarly, priest Cambridge also has his own pictures of the transport of her wardrobe – it is said that each of her dressers has a personal seat.
The new law comes into force.
Victims of accidents receive pensions
On Friday, a regulation shall enter into force which shall ensure that in the event of serious injury, further rent payments are paid – shall be notified by the Financial Officer.
It shall apply from 9 July 2019 on specific rights of persons injured in the event of a loss of the security amount established on the basis of the provisions applicable before 1 January 2006.
It concerns persons who were injured before 1 January 2006.
At the same time, they were obliged to make a decision less than the current guarantee amount, so in some cases the policyholders have already cancelled the interest payments.
"I am pleased with this regulation because our institution has been working for many years to create a mechanism that will allow for the serious damage caused in cases of financial support from the communication OC or the farmer's OC, despite the loss of the guarantee amount," says Alexander Daszewski, the legal adviser to the Financial Auditors' office.
According to the Financial Officer, this was necessary because these are often very tragic situations with regard to people in very bad health who cannot work because of the accident and at the same time bear significant costs of accidental rehabilitation treatment.
Some of these no longer received equivalent rates and increased needs due to the need for further treatment or rehabilitation due to the so-called OC policies.
It was part of a threat in the next few years.
By 1 January 2006, the insurance liability was significantly lower than the present.
This is why the problem of exhaustion of the guarantee amount in the previous years was most often affecting people who suffered injury in the 1990s.
However, the guarantee amounts were very low and economic conditions resulted in a significant increase in prices.
"We have also noted that this problem has also affected a number of young people who have suffered injury during a period of EUR 350 000 per case.
It is currently EUR 5.21 million on an event, regardless of the number of injured.
So this is a huge difference in relation to the previous periods, so the problem required legislative intervention," recalled Alexander Daszewski.
In view of the fact that the amount of the guarantee that has been raised for some time, the legislator has agreed that the upper limit of the liability of the Guarantee Fund will be the guarantee amount in force at the time of the granting of the interest rate increase fund.
This Regulation shall apply where the insurance undertaking is not obliged to pay interest on the basis of a judgment setting the amount of the guarantee other than those laid down in the OC insurance agreement.
This shall take place in the event of an increase in the amount of guarantee on a court-martial basis under Article 3571 of the Civil Code which allows for the modification of the existing bond relationship.
“In recent days we have sent letters to people who have previously returned to us with an intervention request.
We are informing them of new opportunities and of course we are ensuring that further support is given in the event of any problems," says Alexander Daszewski.

Brenda Barattini sentenced to death for a boy's penis
The case concerns events of November 2017.
As Buenos Aires Times says, then Brenda Barattini found out that her boyfriend showed her a friend of the sexes who stood in their bedroom.
The 28-year-old, who is an architect, explained before the court that a partner in this way ruined her life and treated her with nothing "throfium" that could be praised in front of friends.
"He has disturbed my privacy, my life and career.
He destroyed everything," she argued.
The residents of Cordoby decided on their own to measure justice.
She invited her 42-year-old Sergio F. to her bed and told him she was preparing a special surprise.
With the help of an axamitous tape, her eyes were lit up by the seductor and her penicillator.
"I felt like I was supposed to die.
I didn't see anything.
I was trying to get up, pulled down, and pulled off the cell phone to get ready," he admitted.
"I wanted to go out, but she began to admire me.
She grabbed me by my hair and hair, didn't let me go," he added.
Although Barattini explained that her boyfriend hurt her by revealing sex, she did not try to escape responsibility.
"Please measure justice," she said in the direction of the vows.
Finally, she was convicted of attempted murder and sentenced to 13 years in prison.
A congressman in Alabama, Jack Edwards died at 91 years of age.
On Friday, a congressman from the state of Alabama died outside the Republican party, Jack Edwards, who served for 10 years and belonged to the first group of Republicans of the so-called Deep South.
The family speaker said Edwards died in his home in Fairhope after fighting with the newtrepreneur.
Edwards was first elected to the United States Congress in 1965 as one of the first Republicans from Alabama in the Southern Hemisphere, thanks to the party's obtaining permits here.
At Congress, he served ten terms.
According to a family statement in response to a recent question about what the world would like to leave to its lawyers and lawyers, Edwards replied that he would like to return home.
"I hope that my lawyers and my lawyers will grow up in a country where there is a common debate and efforts to solve the country's problems of return," Edwards said in a family statement.
State Governor of Alabama Kay Ivey said Edwards served his position and country with the highest standards of honesty.
She added that in part of her flight to the capital of Alabama, they'll be released into half of the mass.
"He was a real government official and was the best man for Alabama.
Our state has lost one of the most important policies," Ivey said in a statement.
Michelle Obama called Meghan Markle "inspiration" on Instagram
Michelle Obama expressed a high recognition for Meghan Markle on Instagram on Thursday, calling the book Sussex "a powerful leader who transcends the schemes and makes our world a better place".
The priest and the book Harry, who is currently on his ten-day royal journey to South Africa with their son Archipelago Harrison Mountbutten-Windsor, participated in a meeting with the youth at the beginning of this week, during which they met with the leaders of the Obama Foundation.
"I would like to thank my friend, Her Royal Place, Pope Sussex @susexroyal, "a three-year-old leader who is breaking the schematics and making our world better," wrote the first lady in her enthusiastic position.
"Is it meeting with the leaders of the Obama Foundation @Obama Foundation or helping girls around the world gain access to the education they deserve, is an inspiration for many people," Obama added, adding a picture of the funny Meghan with the founding leaders.
Meghan conducted an interview with Obama for the British Vogue, a guest edited by former actor of the "Suits" series.
In the real conversation, the first lady was talking about motherhood and how she changed it.
"Be a mother means bringing to the mystery of the art of vacation," said Obama in his report.
“Maternalism has taught me that most of my time my task is to give children space so that they can know the world and become those who want to be.
Not who I want to be or who I wanted to be at their age, but who are in deep heart.
Both of them, who knew from experience what it was like to be at the shrine, shared with the priest’s board during a talk with the Good Housekeeping magazine.
“The pressure you feel – driven by yourself and by others – may at times make you feel” she said.
"So my advice is to relax and not rush into anything.
During the first few months of my life in the White House, I spent most of my time caring for my daughters, making sure that they got good advice at school and developed new skills before I dedicated myself to more ambitious work.
I think it's necessary, too.
Hotel Trumpa maintains a permit to sell alcohol despite complaints about the owner's ability
WASHINGTON (AP) – The Committee on Control of Alcohol Drinks in Washington has submitted a proposal to check whether the local Trump International Hotel should lose the right to sell alcohol because of the owner's training.
The Agency has ruled in the middle that there are three pastors, two Emigrated Judges and two Rabbis on the ground is unreasonable because most of them do not live in the district or have no property in it.
“The Washington Post” says that the reasons for your return to the hotel for the sale of alcohol are the second reason you have to call on the seller in the distribution of the provision that the applicant for the sale of alcohol must prove to be “good training”.
In the preliminary complaint filed last year, President Donald Trump was found to be in violation of the law, and charges of assault and repeated cases of fraud have been filed.
The complaint was dismissed because the permit was granted before it was lodged.
As a result of the second complaint, the extension of the authorisation was extended.
“The Sun”: The joint report recognises the scandal of police services in Cleveland for the worst in Britain
The inspectors considered the SCCOMROMITALS to be the worst police in Great Britain.
In the interim report, the police work in Cleveland was assessed as inappropriate in all areas.
Phil Gormley of the Chief Police Inspector of Her Royalty says that there has been a "significant deterioration" of standards in police services in Cleveland.
New appeals were made to resolve police services, with five commanders working for six years.
According to the police report, efforts were made to prevent crime, arrest of suspects and protect the weakest.
Phil Gormley of Her Royal Place Police Chief Inspector said: "There has been a significant deterioration of standards since our last inspection."
In January, Commander Mike Veale gave up on a minor year in the form of an investigation into the ' serious', although unknown, charges for his action.
Commander Adrian Roberts was arrested after being arrested under the suspicion of growing suspicions.
Last year, Inspector Simon Hurwood stood before the Commission for the Exploration of the Training of Employees for Sexual Activities.
He left the service.
The mayor of Tees Valley Ben Houchen, from the Torist side, said: “This is an official confirmation that these services are compromised.
It's time for him to interview the Department of Home Office."
Police commander Richard Lewis said: "After improvement, I will take full responsibility for the conduct of police forces by change."
We've got a look at the skate park!
Are young people finally waiting?
The older residents are interrupting the young passenger rides on mules and dolls, along the road complaining that there is no suitable place for them in Olava.
For years, young people have been reminded of the place to drive on wheels, dolls, mules, bikes.
The subject is still going back to our bones.
We've been paying attention to this problem for 10 years.
Last time there was a voice about the lack of a ski park.
That's why we're going back to that and ask in the office what's next?
We remember that a few days ago, a woman who was passing by a young man ran into the center.
"I write on behalf of the residents of the block at Piłsudski, for example, in order to take an interest in the situation of the youth," writes Małgorzat.
"The residents of the block called the City Guard many times in vain.
On the basis of these daily situations, I send a photo."
We asked others about what they thought about it.
Most of them claim that young people simply don't have a place to drive in town and that for years they've been desperately looking for places for themselves.
Under the post on Facebook there was a lot of commentaries.
We've already written in July that there's a chance that the ski park will be built on the  publicly owned city.
The mayor informed me that the city had come to finance the building of a ski park.
"The project consulted with the young man along with the permits is ready.
On 28 March, a proposal was made to the Ministry of Sport and Tourism to fund the work of the “Building Skatepark in Ålava” under the Sport Polska programme, which we were told in the office.
Total project value: 798 306.00 zl.
Amount of funding requested: 263 440.00 ol.
Now we've asked again what stage it is.
"We do not yet have any information on the issue of what is presented to the Ministry of Sport and Tourism on the request for funding," said Elżbieta Bednarczyk, director of the European Um Olaw Foundation.
"The information received from ministerial staff shows that the final selection of all tasks under the Sport Programme of Poland should take place in October".
We've also asked for a visualization of the Oval Skatepark.
We present her below.
The youth informed the editorial that on Saturday (September 28th) signatures will be received on the petition concerning the building of the Skatepark in Ålava.
"The rebellious youth saw the last post on Facebook and decided to organize the collection," writes Mikolaj.
The signatures of the petition will be collected from 12 noon around the Lidl market.
Puchar Polski 2019/20: release 1/16 final.
We know each other, hit last year.
It was one of the most difficult civilizations in the extra-class.
The greatest legend has been the Memorial of the 1996/1997 season.
On June 18, 1997, Legia took an old stadium at the Lázienkov shipyard in a superior train.
Both teams shared the point.
The economy had to win, and Vidzewow gave the second of Poland's mystery series.
Until 87 minutes Legia drove 2:0, but in five minutes it reached the ground – Vidzew shot three holes and enjoyed the title.
The ice club with years of runaway has dropped more and more dramatically until he's stopped counting in the fight on the mystery and fell from the highest level of gambling.
The last two groups met at this level in the 2013/2014 season.
The legend – on the way to the title – brought two victories – 5:1 to itself and 1:0 to the exit.
Return to Elity
Now the ships are fighting for their return to national elite.
These plans were delayed for at least a year, since in previous games one of the favorites was unable to advance on extraclasses.

Nancy Pelosi: William Barr "surrendered" and the investigation under the impeachment must be addressed to his own tower
We'll never know where we're going.
Now I think we are going to take part in trying to hide facts trying to hide facts, and the investigation in this case can be successful," said Pelosi in a report for CNN on the Chapter.
"They do the work they started, keeping the facts and time necessary to find them," she added.
The protocol issued this week by the White House shows that Trump asked the President of Ukraine, Woładmyr Zełenski, to conduct an investigation on former Vice-President Joe Biden, a 2020 candidate and his son.
The Group also asked Greens to cooperate with Barr and his own personal lawyer, Rudy Giulian, as outlined in the Protocol.
The trumpet stopped him from doing anything wrong.
On Thursday, the CNN concluded that national security lawyers from the Department of Justice had notified a complaint by a complainant concerning the procedure of the trumpet with part of Ukraine more than one week before the formal notification.
Following a complaint by intelligence Community officials, the Department of Justice stated that the telephone interview had not provided a criminal investigation into the financing of the campaign.
Asked whether Barr should admit, Pelos said that on Friday, the Intelligence Committee decided who to call on the witness.
She added, however, that she thought that Barr "was rebellious."
It's been such a long time.
"In addition (Barra) will change in all of this," Pelosi added, referring to the change of the trumpet of his Attorney General during a lycic conversation with the leader of Ukraine.
It's interesting that he made decisions on how to deal with the complaint.
Pelosi announced that "very scared" about the signalist informants that Trump attacked on Thursday as spies, suggesting that in the past they had been treated with spies.
I believe that the President's words are beyond responsibility, that is dangerous.
Our signallers play an important role in discovering – the sending of distortions in our government," Pelosi said, adding "The President's words on people who can provide information are seriously concerned about honesty in management".
In the second half of Pelosi, a historic step has been taken to announce a formal investigation into the enforcement of an act contrary to the law based on the evidence of an attempt to impose pressure on a leader of the State in order to obtain political benefits.
The telephone speech was included in a fourth complaint published by the signalist, in which he claimed that Trump had challenged his authority to "send Ukraine into interference" during the upcoming 2020 elections.
The signalist also stated that the White House lawyers had instructed officials to delete the record of communication from the computer system in which they were kept at the needs of the Council of Ministers and to place it in a system designed for particular sensitive information.

Possible ban on driving too fast for Crystal Palace Christiana Bentke Club attacker
The star Premier League Christian Bentke, which has been caught twice over the speed limit for the last two months, is a dangerous ban on driving.
The 28-year-old Crystal Palace was on board by Bentley's car at 80 miles per hour on the A3 road to Richmond on the south-west of London on January 20.
Then, in March of Putney's photo fairs in south-western London, Belgium recorded eating speed 89 miles per hour, which is twice the limit of 40 miles per hour.
Bentke from Kingston Hill from Surrey doesn't have to be in the room this morning at Lavender Hill.
He admitted to two appeals at the beginning of July under the simplified procedure on which the crimes were further condemned at a sitting held by a judge.

Ghana: Kofi Manu worried about the structure of the Audit Commission
Kofi Manu, the football manager and the representative of the Second Hasakas Club, expressed doubts as to the composition of the Audit Commission for the needs of the upcoming elections to the National Federation of Firearms in Ghana (GFA).
He challenged the involvement of Commission President Frank Davis, adding that he was not satisfied with his participation.
In the GNA Sport Manu report, he expressed doubts whether the President of the Commission would be honest because the outcome of the verification process was in his interest.
The Audit Commission should be composed of non-neutral persons who do not show any contacts with any of the members and who previously did not show interest.
For example, Davisa employed NC as a lawyer who wrote to Osei Kwaku Palmer about 10 per cent payment.
He's also a well-known skirmisher of the Olympic Games.
For these two reasons he should not be allowed to take a position in the Audit Commission because he is interested in this," he said.
He explained to me that if Fred Pappoe, Director of the Olympic Games, is present before the Commission, there will be a conflict of interests on the part of the President in view of his association with the club, suggesting at the same time that if he is represented by the Palmer Commission, he will be the subject of advance and site visits.
According to the expectations of the members of the Commission, they had to start their work from yesterday, after having been sworn at the GFA Secretariat in Akre on Tuesday, 19 September and ending on 4 October.
The President of the Commission is Frank Davies and its members are Mr. Marian Barnor and Mr. Emmanuel Darkwah.
The other members include Reginald Larryea, Director of Marketing and Business and Richard Akpokavie, Sport Administrator and Lawyer.

Cornel Moraviacki went to the hospital, and doctors determine his condition as severe.
The senior Marshal's family told "SE", that policy is quiet and full of knowledge.
It's not the only disease that Cornel Moraviacke copes with.
He also has heart problems, and because of the chemotherapy he goes through, he also has nerves.

Israel: There is no agreement on the governance of unity
The two main parts of Israel, the Association of the Heavens and the Whites and the Likuds, continued in the fifth negotiations on the appointment of the Government of Unity.
The meeting, which took place after the Presidential Mission of the Government of Benjamin Netanyahu, did not produce results.
The talks discussed the possibility of rotational leadership of both parties in the government and the rest of Netanyah in the position of prime minister, but there was no close-up of views, as the Israeli newspaper Haarec writes.
The talks will be resumed Sunday.
The Central Alliance of Heaven-Whites announced in the communication that he was presenting preliminary reports.
Likud's legal charge is that he "has taken care of his positions", hoping that his leader and current prime minister, Netanyahu, would remain in the government's interests, and in the office's composition – which was previously part of his ultra-orthodox policy.
"From the very beginning it was announced that the sky-Bali would not comply with these conditions," the voices published by them were published.
Unfortunately, acting solely in the interest of Netanyahu, he wants to "bring Israel into the second round of elections".
The Head of the Blue and White Benny Gantz rejects the support of the government that would lead Netanyahu while he is being accused of participating in three corruption cases on the basis of which the prosecutor could formally accuse him of being appointed in the middle of the meeting.
"Likud and Sky-Bali received on 17 September a sufficient majority of the elections that would allow them to join the common governments as natural allies, but this will force them to negotiate which none of them would want," says the EFE Agency.
President Reuwen Rivlin tried to bring their positions closer in the last days and proposed a call for a "rotational government", suggesting that the Prime Minister temporarily suspended his duties, which would allow Gantz to take this position if the charges against Netanyahu were maintained and formalized.
There's no need for Israeli analysts who think things got stuck in jail.
However, half of the Israelis, as a result of a poll published in public television on Friday, want to block the political situation in the country by calling the government of unity under the rotational leadership of Netanyah and Gantz.
This solution is estimated to be 50.6 per cent of Israelis, and 32.1 per cent of respondents object to such a solution.
The survey shows a deep part of the Israeli society – on the question of who should be the first to be in office offices, 41.8% of respondents are told about Netanyahu and 40% about Gantz.
In another survey published by the "Israel Hajom" newspaper, the percentage of government leavers grew to 63 per cent, and 60% were against the new elections that would be third in this year.
In the previous parliamentary elections on 17 September, he won the Gantz Sojuz, winning 33 positions in 120 local Knesset, Likud Netanjahu won 32 positions.
Netanyahu with its traditional and potential allies can count on support for 55 jobs while Gantz – 54.
None of the pages have collected 61 mandates necessary to obtain a majority.
Tipuric calls for a final fight with the Australians
Justin Tipuric says that "it's time to check out", when Wallia is in the form of a final match with Australia in the world's Puchar, which can create their forest in the tournament.
The victory of Walli over the "kangarm" would set this team on a position of favour to the winning Group D and guarantee its participation in a likely final meeting with France or Argentina.
However, if Australia defeats Wally once again 14 times during the last 15 meetings, Tipuric and his team will be sent to the beginning with England in an eight-year term.
"Let's make the matter clear, both teams want to try to get through this and find themselves in the hands of a group," said the Valian War of Tipuric.
In the past, there were some difficult results, but last summer it was nice to win with them (Australia).
I think they're going to be impatiently trying to get us this victory, and we're gonna have to take it back.
Before we got here, you knew it'd be a big old man.
And now we're here, and it's really time to check.
Valia won only one victory over Australia, New Zealand or RPA in the history of the world’s Puchar – and it took place 32 years ago in a third place when they finished "cangues".
And their overall record under the lead coach Warren Gatland shows only seven victories in 41 attempts to make three teams weigh more than half the weight of the South.
Valia has been a member of the Australian team for the past few years, and Tipuric has been preparing to be among the few escaped from this 9-6 race that run out of Tokyo on Sunday.
Tipuric, who was asked if the team had experienced mental blockade before this victory, added: “It’s hard to say.
These games are so similar that maybe... people expect a certain mental blockade to occur, I don't know.
At the end of the last game, we probably left about 15 points on the forest, so the final result seems to be much less than it was actually.
If Wallia is traumatized, while the battle of Tipurica with a beloved Australian duo from the third line of Michael Hooper and David Pocock during detention and release will be of major importance.
Tipuric has played 67 representations and met both professionals on several previous occasions, so he knows exactly what he's waiting for.
"These are careers playing at the seventh world class," he said.
When playing against the world class of third-line fraud, we always know it's gonna be a hard game to play.
These two are always with the best professionals in the world.
You know what kind of mess you can expect.
Pocock is one of the best players in the world playing defensively, and Michael is more attacking the seventh and probably feeling better, because he's always in the right place at the right time.
It's better to play against the best professionals in the world and set up challenges than to measure with a third line of lead that's not so good.
It's worth playing against the best and struggling with these two, I'm sure you should be in an honorable form.
I wouldn't say it's almost over Sunday, but it's an important game for us in the world.
Impet's setting up an important element of it.
When we build up our strength and keep exerting ourselves, we will fly as fast as we can and be hard to conquer.

"Waffen-SS" Jochen Boehler, Robert Gerwarth, Jacek Mlínarczyk
They were supposed to be an elite organization called "the Lord's Lands".
They accepted in their ranks those they raised.
Can crime be linked more powerful than national identity?
In your hands, we give you no further book on the subject of war or military.
We are offering a deep international study on non-German participation in Waffen-SS.
Historians from different countries in Europe are analysing the structures and motivations of volunteers, remembering their activities and looking at the recruitment processes at the various stages of the war.
Did the dunes differ from the French?
Where did he get the Ukrainian enthusiasm?
Why did you fail to create a division made up of the Poles themselves?
How does the official historical narrative of cooperation in certain European countries look today?
What happened to the volunteers after the war ended?
Among other things, the book "Waffen-SS" answers these questions on the basis of solid research material.
We have worked to present a more subtle and more balanced, closer picture of collaboration in Europe during the second world war, also trying to cross the methodological boundaries of history and a given period of action by presenting the reports of the research authority from different countries. (...) As far as the main victims of this war - forced workers, Jews, Jews, political opponents of Nazi Germany, the Slovak population - are sometimes represented in comparison and/or overnational perceptions, the majority of these people are mainly from a national perspective (how much they do).
‘Total panic’ when the White House struggles to find arguments about impeachment
The White House officials are ashamed to think about how to open up on Thursday the new embezzlement policy, and one of the speakers in the situation describes the “total panic” feeling felt last week due to the lack of a new reality response plan.
It seems to require "an anxiety, uncertainty and fear" – one of the people associated with the White House describes the situation in the Western Hemisphere in this way – that informant charges may seriously harm the President and those around him.
The person said, "There's no more sure there's nothing in there."
The White House officials were still uncertain how to proceed, not only because there is no clear plan of action in this situation, but also because the allegations are so serious that the standard methods of effective prevention of disputes used by the President in the past may not work. "This does not seem to change as well as a further cycle of information".
Another person who knew the course of the discussion described the atmosphere in the White House as a “school state” which accompanied the growing uncertainty that, along with the ongoing investigation into the impeachment, it is likely that the president will respond in a irresponsible way and become “hard to drink”.
This is shared by another speaker who claims that the people in the presidential district expect him to experience a more "fashioned" behaviour, and the pressure on him is certainly beginning to increase with each day of the investigation on the impeachment.
This raises concerns that the Trump can present increasingly unpredictable behaviour and in an unexpected way blow up – this is in the context of the year of elections, both from the point of view of the Presidency and the elections.
In view of the greatest threat to the Presidency, Trump has launched an attack on the defence, re-examined the strategy he considered effective during the investigation by Robert Muellera on Russia.
He tried to relocate his own request to the Ukrainian President for assistance in investigating his political rivals in order to turn his attention and focus on the actions of the Democrats and the candidate of the Democrats of Joe Biden and to entrust the informant as a leading party initiatives.
But while many people in the White House were involved in fighting after Mueller's investigation, something changed – consultants and consultants said.
The President, whose mark is the force, the international press conference has shown itself to be a dead end – said one of the persons affected by the situation.
While Trump was excited about the question of Russian investigation, it seemed that he did not want to answer the questions about Ukraine – they said.
Some of the presidents believe that it is possible to avoid damage, and some of them maintain that the informant did not know from the first hand about the controversial telephone conversation between President Trump and Ukrainian President Voladymzyr Zełenski – which they consider to be his credibility.
And as often as the president is the object of an attack, the fact is that he is alive raised by his main supporters in his defense.
But one of the Republican strategies related to the White House shows that the results of the presidential support polls are relatively high, and impeachment will not influence much on finding new sympathies.
"There is no position in the need to focus on the President's commitment for the next four months," in particular if it makes it difficult for its legislative programme to be put into effect and it prevails in the new cycle of news headlines.
Another speaker said that those who maintained that the impeachment would help the President did not finally understand how his reaction would be unpredictable.
The poor officials of the White House sought help from the consultants, completing an impeachment response team.
According to the person I know about the plans, given that these efforts are at an early stage, there is no clear indication whether any action in the way of the centre of evidence will be taken and what form it can take.
This person has stated that it is believed that a coordinated legal and communication strategy with a determined leader is required to carry out an attack on PR in response to the publication of a useful signalist report and with a view to halting the spread of democratic actions concerning the impact of the disclosure of this report.
The speaker noted that the lack of a long-term strategic vision was clearly visible when the Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Charity Steve Mnuchin indicated that they did not intend to disclose the notes describing the discussion with the Ukrainian President, and 48 hours later it could have been felt that there was no way out and that the document should be published.
It is expected that the press will now be greater than during the follow-up of Robert Mueller, who has been extremely silent and spoke only for the average charge. One person who can be involved in preparing a response to the impeachment is Corey Lewandowski, a man from the stupid work of the trumpet and was the head of the election – the person involved in the case.
However, Lewandoski said in a conversation with NBC News that it is not a true suggestion that he will be directing this action.
"For the last five years, I have done everything I can to support the President and his programme – he said – but I have not participated in any talks with the President or his team on membership of the team in order to reject a false talk about the impeachment."
Private attorney Donald Trump of Mueller's investigation, Jay Sekulow, is also involved in the investigation.
"We are responding to matters as appropriate" – He replied to the centuries when he was asked by NBC News for a comment.
At present the White House feels a lack of a lawyer experienced in the field of impeachment, after Emmet Floyd, who worked at Clinton's impeachment and advised the White House at the end of Mueller's investigation, went away, and the current consultant, Pat Cipolone, has no such experience.
The White House strategy speaker stated that the general officials did not intend to hire people or create a centre of evidence at any time, but admitted that there was a need for coordinated, joint response and political action.
Excursion Explorer of the Seas line Royal Caribbean went through the repair for 89 million pounds
The explorer of the Seas, who belongs to the Royal Caribbean International family, will travel this year, presenting a completely new look.
After a renewal of $110 million (89 million), the ship is encouraged by a wide selection of culinary accessories from around the world and a rich offer of entertainment for the entire family.
This year, the Explorer stops at the most Spanish ports in Italy and Greece, allowing passengers to feel the taste of Mediterranean Europe.
When the case on land is over, the ship's foundation promises unforgettable effects on the sea.
In response to each satisfactory offer, the Explorer, after refurbishment of $110 million, or about 89 million, moved into a passenger ship providing perfect entertainment for the entire family.
The impressive technology means that passengers can surf on a platform using advanced surfing simulators or watch a favorite family film using the weather clocks in a full-time cinema.
However, the most revolutionary attraction is the addition of virtual balconies that enable internal cabin passengers to look at the ocean without the need for exit.
Water lovers are attracted to a new building with a base connecting the Caribbean curator style with the water park’s roots.
The pool features beach hammocks and ideal beds to relax in the sun, and two modernized dailys are within the hands of people who are exposed to powerful effects on the floor.
An attractive tour for passengers every year imposes the number of activities available to guests during their journey to destinations.
Created with the idea of small Adventure Ocean for children, it is a chance for younger members of the family to enjoy beautiful memories, and the only place for young people to spend free time is a super game and a music area prepared with a view to people over 12 years of age.
If this is not enough, the entire family may, in "Studio B" on the ship, aim at the laser tag with the effect of lighting in the dark, which can also be used as a swimming pool on the bed.
During the trip to the Mediterranean, guests will also have the opportunity to get to know exotic tastes from around the world, hanging on the floor of the restaurant located on the floor.
A modern Asian kitchen is offered on board at the Izim restaurant, and in the freshen Giovanni's Italian Kitchen is served with a dishes inspired by a modern view of traditional Italian cuisine.
The other food items on the table include the American restaurant offering Chops Grille, the Latin Boleros bar, the Schooner Bar and the Johnny Rockets bar.
Reys, with the option of a seven- or nine-day route, will leave Rome in May 2020.
As a second European ship belonging to the Royal Caribbean line, it will join the Allure of the Seas, which has recently passed an incredible repair.
After a 58-day metamorphosis Allure, a total of $165 million, a travel operator offered guests who had previously made a reservation, an amount of $300 for delivery on board the ship.
The travel operator said: "Explorer of the Seas is a fourth vessel of the Voyager class, which will undergo transformation in the modernization of the Royal Amplified fleet."
The programme, which requires investment of more than $1 billion, including 10 ships and for four years, improves every aspect of customer satisfaction and introduces a wide range of possibilities: from non-renewable attractions and gastronomics to nightlife.
Devin Nunes accuses Democrats that they want "the pictures of our troops"
Congressman Devin Nunes from the state of California is obviously unable to reveal the truth about President Donald Trump's investigation.
In his fourth defense, the President accused the Democrats of wanting to get a good picture of the President.
Now, the high-level Republicans sitting on the Commission's report on the Election of Representatives have put the above call in the course of a preliminary hearing on the impact of the complainant's complaint, as if the Trump had returned to Ukraine to assist in the initiation of an investigation against the Democratic candidate for President Joe Biden and his son.
The congressman called the Ukrainian scandal "grotessy presentation" of the left and their "medial ass" before he said that the Democrats wanted to see pictures of the president in the Neglisa.
"Democrats in this commission were negotiating with people who thought they were Ukrainians to get some pictures of the trumpet," Nunes said.
"People can ask themselves honestly why Democrats are so determined to put the president in charge when they have their chance in a year.
When Nunes ended up making excuses, the political reporter of HuffPost, Jennifer Bendery, decided to check if the Democrats were really trying to... find out.
By this time, he only responded by the representative of Connecticut, Jim Himes, although we suspect that his answer is the truth, confirming the idea of many of his colleagues and colleagues.
Portal Mediaite.com suspects that Nunesa’s comments on the behaviour have referred to “some more interesting and unconfirmed information”, which are likely to appear in the controversial acts of Steele,
It is celebrated by former British spy Christopher Steele's collection of charges against Trump, pointing to the likelihood of a tasma that last night shows him the viewing power of prostitution in the hotel room in Moscow.
Potential studies on biofuels can help reduce emissions
While electrical cars and Semi Tesli have dominated information services in recent years, one issue seems to be to force renewable energy – airplanes.
However, Professor Alberta of the University has developed a technology that will allow renewable biofuels to be used as air fuel.
Dr. David Bressler is a professor at Albert University at the Department of Agriculture, Life and Environment who started working on this project in 2003.
Its laboratory produces carbon dioxide derived from fats such as fats from restaurants, fats from animal origin and vegetable oil.
Unlike ethanol and other biofuels, this technology can benefit from low-quality oil, which is estimated at 85% lower carbon emissions than in the case of oil fuels and also use waste from other industries.
This technology has the task of imitating current hydrocarbons in oil fuels.
"What our technology did in the first generation – said Bressler – is [in total creation] hydrocarbons that are identical particles like diesel fuel."
While opening up this new possibility of using biofuels, previously developed biofuel products were prone to destabilization at lower temperatures, which was a serious threat to high-speed aeroplanes.
"The problem with the fuel air is a bit wrong," Bressler said.
It's really less valuable than diesel, but it has higher requirements.
The Bressler Laboratory is currently looking at two options for the production of biofuels.
The first option is a small risk approach which requires additional treatment of hydrocarbons and addition of water.
The second option is to continue work on partly developed chemical properties that will ensure fuel stability, even at low temperatures.
"We can experiment with chemical properties in our reactor to try to change them a little bit," Bressler said, commenting on another option.
This option is more risky.
An open company created by the University of Alberty, Forge Hydrocarbons, works for the marketing of the product as air lines as well as Canadian and American armies increase investments in the new option.
"They are able to imagine the times when the situation can be reversed and the carbon tax charged on them," he said.
Instead, they want an alternative that will set up an emergency plan.
Forge is currently running a pilot plant near the Edmonton Waste Management Centre and has recently received $4 million from Lockheed Martin for investment in support of $25 million of the production plant building that will be located in Sombra, Ontario.
It is expected that the plant will produce about 19 million litres of biofuels annually.
Bressler also notes that the proposed carbon reduction is about 85 per cent, but issues such as transport and fuel production stop further carbon reduction.
“As a technology specialist – Bressler said –
I have the task of developing options that enable me to make informed decisions and many choices."
OPINION: Further fraud on grandson
Eight thousand evils and 750 euros lost the residents of the place, thinking it was helping their uncle who caused the accident.
The police reported the incident on Thursday, the son of a fraud agent.
"The woman was called in the middle of a man who looked after her grandson.
He said he was causing an accident and needed money.
It's different in jail.
In order to help the grandson, the senior handed over 8,000 ills and 750 euros to a false police officer who came to her home," said Dr. Dorota Krukovska-Bubilo from the police station.
The police are looking for judges and then call for caution:
‘Every phone with a request for financial assistance shall be verified.
Do not act under emotional and rapid influence.
Remember, cops don't ask for money and they don't take money.
If we get a phone with a request for financial support that raises our suspicion, we need to respond immediately and notify the police by calling the alarm number 112.
We also call younger members of the family.
Let's talk to our seniors about threats, let's know how they're acting.
Please be careful and do not trust those who call and ask for a loan."
Prime Minister Boris Johnson warns that if Britain's brexit is rejected, they threaten to threaten the land of Los Angeles, and he himself calls for peace.
One of the chief bureau ministers said last night that the country was threatened by "violent social prejudice" if the first result was questioned by the outcome of the second referendum.
The British Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from his immediate vicinity warned that the country was threatened by social unrest on the scale of "gold trucks" protests in France due to social inequalities and migration in Los Angeles in 1992.
Johnson called for "relief of tools" during the tumultuous debate on the language of politics, but stressed that it would not stop using the word "submission".
Despite his address on the peace of the office ministry, The Times said: "In this country there has never been such protests as the "Gilets Junes" demonstrations or the "Golden Camels" in Los Angeles in 1992.
People think it's impossible just because they didn't happen before.
Now they have an example – gillets young – they use encrypted phones that can coordinate pickets, and in order to get people to protest, there are several undesirable populist leaders.
The residents of Los Angeles were excommunicated after the menacing of four white police officers who killed blacksmith Rodney King in 1992.
This year the anti-government demonstrators in France carrying yellow red red camels – gilet young – have been free for more than six weeks and are on the streets of Paris.
The Minister referred to Johnson's warning in the Gmin Election and said that if Great Britain fails to get out of the EU, "the disastrous loss of confidence in our political system will occur."
"If we organise a referendum with 30 million people and 66% of them will be opposed to the rest of Great Britain in the European Union, ten million people will be unhappy," said the Minister.
Even if it ignores 99% of them, we'll have 100,000 upset people who'll write to their jobs and who won't give up.
Many don't need to see tens of thousands on the street soon.
One of the main branch ministers added that the country's "violent social tension" threat should be questioned by the results of the first referendum.
Johnson called for the organisation of the general elections in which the voter should discuss the Brexit Lotus.
According to the report, the Prime Minister is at risk of a rebellion in the office wishing to reduce requests for Brexit and achieving a compromise agreement with the EU.
The capitals, the Czubs and the Crosnys were introduced to Krakow.
For us Talk'N"Roll
More than 300 participants were heard on Thursday (September 26th) 11 inspiring lectures by representatives including Simon Holovnia, Christina Czubovna or Ireneusz Krosny.
That's all under the Talk'N'Roll conference, which took place in Kraków the fifth time.
Talk'N'roll 2019
Enlargement of horizons, discussion on values values and joint discussions that can become an incentive for further development.
These objectives were set by the organizers of the Talk'N'Roll conference, inviting 11 exceptional delegates, representing very diverse industries and areas of interest, among other people known from the media - Simon Hollownija, Christian Czubovna and Ireneus Kross.
The theme of this year's edition Talk'N'Roll was "Crafting the Future, NEW" and right around creating the future, guests invited to attend the conference.
The first session was opened by the director of Sabre Polska, Sebastian Drzewicki, who spoke about how the brand that is building around him might have an impact on our future.
Richard Lucas went out on stage to change public awareness of the phenomenon of rejection, claiming that it should be accepted if the future is to be created, from Chris Badura's wheel, he took the issue of empathy in a flashy technological development.
Paula Mascarenhas (VP Sabre) has shared observations and techniques that can help manage careers and increase overall satisfactory by finding an appropriate balance between professional and private life.
The second part of the conference opened a multi-stakeholder discussion with Christine Czubov, who told others about how the lecturer’s career in Poland had changed from her perspective on space for years.
One of the most popular voices in the country acknowledged that today, thanks to development technology, everyone can find this profession difficult.
It does not, however, consider that in recent years people have been completely replaced by technology.
Also after her, Peter Nabelec took a life-threatening problem during information, emotional or electoral burden, sharing the publicity of the price indicators, how to deal with it, and Lucas Lötocha said in his presentation what the next industrial revolution, known as "Industry 4.0", could lead to.
By playing lessons, by playing games
The conference organizers were also impressed by the artistic impact, calling for an illusionist scene, Daniel Onedinak.
The third part of the conference opened by the Ireneusz Krosny, who first played a pantonium audience, and then, for example, by his own career, told us how to maintain a proper balance between the career on stage and private life.
The participants were also impressed by Simon Holovnia’s presentation, stressing the full role of time in our lives.
The publisher noted that even two minutes can change the situation diametrically and must be ready to use this time.
In addition, Holovnia shared her thoughts about the realities surrounding us, including the angels who could raise smiles on the faces of the vision.
Then Adrian Tvoruszka appeared on the scene, who reviewed history and the objectives of several innovation models and brought them to what way they are currently being used.
At the end of Marcin Sloviak, for example, Rubik's bones, said about how to solve problems.
Each of the 11 presidents has certainly introduced something new to observe the reality of all those who have the opportunity to look at the performances, and the lively reactions and numerous questions to the guests are evidence of a great commitment from the public.
The organizers provided a transmission for all persons who could not personally participate in the event, and recordings from the lectures are available on the website.
I'm right instead of right-wing governments.
"In spite of the lack of enough votes to change the Constitution, the majority of the rulers have introduced a number of changes in the State system, creating threats to the protection of the rule of law and the principles of the three-part authority," wrote in the fourth report of the Helsinki Foundation for Human Rights.
The report "The Court of Justice instead of the Government of Law" documents inter alia changes in the degree of justice and in the area of fundamental rights and freedoms.
The Helsinki Foundation for Human Rights (HFPC) published in the fourth report entitled "The Courts of Law instead of Governments.
Threats to the protection of human rights in Poland in 2015-2019."
The Foundation estimates that in 2015-2019 the largest human rights regress was noted in Poland after 1989.
"In spite of the lack of sufficient number of votes to change the Constitution, the majority have introduced a number of changes in the State system, creating threats to the protection of the rule of law and the principles of the three-part authority.
By adapting the right to political objectives, governments have been replaced by the right to rule," writes HFPC experts.
What about HFPC?
The report document changes in the functioning of justice, independent institutions (such as public media or civil law prosecutor) and in the area of protection of fundamental rights and freedoms (including freedom of assembly, women's rights, LGBT people's rights and the right to a fair process).
The report also summarizes the three-year dispute between the Polish authorities and the European Union.
"For the last four years, we have observed the use of the right to exercise the particular interests of parties in the last four years.
It was a long-standing crisis of rule of law and also a weakening of the entire human rights system in Poland," stressed counsel Marcin Volny, one of the authors of the report.
Protection of Human Rights
As indicated in the report, the last four years are “the period of systemic change both within the State” and “the protection of human rights”.
Over the past four years, Sejm has adopted more than 20 key legal acts from the point of view of the protection of human rights.
"The changes were often taken in a rapid pace, without social consultation and despite the preservation of the legal environment, the Ombudsman for Civil Law or international organisations," the co-author of the report said lawyer Malgorzat Szulek.
According to the report, the main trends observed over the past four years have been: "the weakening of independent institutions (including courts and prosecutors), the non-compliance with the consequences of the international institutions and recommendations and the weakening of the protection of human rights".
National authorities have not responded
In particular, the Helsinki Foundation for Human Rights has considered "these situations in which the authorities have not responded or have simply learned about cases of aggression".
The experts of the Foundation noted that some changes were introduced into the atmosphere of attacks on individual institutions or professional groups or groups affected by discrimination.
The Foundation points out that the result of State activity in the area of limitation of the rule of law is the ongoing dispute between the Polish authorities with the European Union and a number of recommendations by international law entities.
"The lack of implementation of these recommendations not only weakens Poland's position as a leader of democratic change in the Middle East European region but also undermines the responsibility of the Polish State for violating the law of the European Union or the European Convention on Human Rights," we read in the report.
Brother of the Pakistani Social Media Star for Honorary Murder
Women's rights experts say that the investigation of justice is often difficult because of prolonged proceedings, the release of suspect killers from prison and public opinion awareness-raising.
"Three is so long that people forget," says Farzan Bari, the defender of women's rights and founder of Pakistan's first gender study department at the university, and adds that even a wide-ranging case of Baloch's murder has been resolved for more than three years.
Although data are difficult to determine according to the Working Group on Women's Rights, in 2018 the Pakistani Commission on Human Rights found that at least 300 cases of so-called honor killings were reported.
Many activists claim that the actual number is significantly higher, and a network promoting awareness of the crimes of honour reasons estimates that in Pakistan about one fifth of the 5000 crimes committed each year are committed worldwide.
Polish overseas record records
However, transfers to the country are small because many immigrants are outside Poland on a permanent basis – the fifth edition of "Rzeczpospolita".
The latest Euro-Tax report shows that Poland's average labour in other European countries was more than 8.6 000 bad in 2018, which means that nearly a thousand gold, or nearly 12%, have grown.
The Euro-Tax "is of the opinion that the total income of Polish migrant workers in the Union reached a record value of 154.5 billion evil in 2018, one seventh more than a year earlier," we read.
Paul Kaczmarczyk, Director of the Centre for Research on Migration at the University of Warsaw, says that Poland is increasingly consulting itself in the international labour market, where they use various options available.
"The number of specialists and professionals who are constantly moving from country to country, like international corporations' workers," says the newspaper.
Some Euro-Tax customers work in both countries, such as Britain and Germany.
"This is the highest in the IMF in 2018 because of the 11% increase in total labour of Polish immigrants (up to 27 billion dollars).
However, the greatest number of Polish prisoners on the island – almost 35 billion evils," we continue to read.
The President of the Euro-Taxu believes that despite improving working conditions on the Polish market, the number of migrant workers does not decrease.
I continue to pay taxes to the West and the North of Europe (in Norway's eyes) this is often a chance for multiple jobs higher than in Poland.
“And even at the minimum rates in the country concerned, such as in Germany, EUR 9,5-11,7 per hour,” the newspaper reports.
The "School" says that the Polish are not only in terms of higher employment, but also because they have settled abroad.
Many Poles leave their way across the border, which is also seen after small monetary transfers to the country.
These mid-years were less than a year old.
As economist Tadeusz Christiane recalls, along with an extension of the period of stay beyond the borders of a small group of people who send money to the country and reduce their height.
"Emigrants are moving towards each other," we read in the fifth "Rzeczpospolitaj".
Long-term monsoons are causing causes and chaos in many regions of India
The monsoon season in India has been nearly a month, and the unexploded floods cause death as a result of flooding of buildings and many floors.
In northern India monsun is usually due early in September, but the average rainfall this month exceeded the standard by 37%.
According to experts from the Indian Meteorological Department, if this situation continues for the next few days, this will be the last of a decade's monsoon.
In many areas of the country, floods are still unexploited – in recent times the city of Pune’s environmental and quarterly flood has resulted in the death of several people and the destruction of buildings.
There's been a house collapse, people got stuck through the streets on their knees, which usually has a place only during the monsoon apogeum.
Great floods also occurred in such cities as Calcutta, Lucknow and Haydarabad.
The effects of long-term rains in the northern state of Uttarakhand caused many homes to be destroyed.
Monsun also started late.
There was a shortage of water in many areas, so farmers were preparing for a possible harvest.
Too long lasting monsoon is not nice seen by farmers.
That amount of rain isn't something normal about this time of year.
"With it my crops – and now I have a cappuccino, fascose, grass and tomatoes – are burning," says Prakash Mehra, a farmer from a small economy in Bhimtal, Uttarakhand state.
For consumers, the impact of the late and late monsoon also means a rise in the price of cereals, i.e. the unremarkable ingredient of Indian foods.
Cebula, which was usually required to pay 20 rubies (0.23 pounds of British pounds), currently costs 80 rubies (about 1 pound of British pounds) per kilogram in cities such as Delhi and Bombay.
They are also threatened with festivals and holidays.
The next big festival is on October 8th of the Day of the Dassar, during which Hindus raise huge beads such as the comic, representing Ravana, to become a fight-whispers and a smile from the era of "Ramayan".
The burning Ravany symbolizes the triumph of good over evil.
However, given that similar Ravany is made out of paper, if the monsoon continues to last, it's going to be Ravena's last laugh.

Doodle celebrates 21 birthdays of Google
It would be hard to imagine today the world without Google.
In the search engine we're looking for answers to all the questions we're asking.
What are we looking for in Google?
"What is it?" "Where?", "How?" and "Where?" is one of the favorite categories sought by Poles.
From the giant data, it turns out that last year we wanted to ask, "Where's the burza?", "How to make swords?" and "How many fingers have horses?", "How to get rid of the bear of the fruit?", "How to eat?".
Today, the searcher is dealing with the twenty-first generation today.
Her users – and in Poland up to 96% of people benefit from "Google's uncle" – welcome Google Doodle today.
This time he's not animated.
Google remembers its births, showing a computer station with monitor, mouse and keyboard, and in the right, below the clock a digital date was printed – as in the 1990s.
Catalogue of information
The search engine was established for a specific purpose – it had to catalogue all possible information and make it available via the Internet.
Her name is a word game.
It comes from the mathematical term googol indicating the number of 10 to the annual power.
The name was also to reflect the company's intention to index as the largest number of sites from the world's Internet resources.
Google researchers were founded by Sergey Brina and Larry Page in 1996 under their research project at Stanford University.
It was based on a mathematical analysis of the dependence between the parties which worked better than the usual method of segregating results based on the frequency of this phrase.
At the start of the searcher, the searcher named BlackRub, referring to the English word blacklink, which means the number of pages linked to the result.
Page and Brin founded a company operating under Google Inc. 7 September 1998, and shortly later they launched the website google.com.
What's up, Google?
In December 1998, the “PC Magazine” published information on the very high incidence of Google’s search results.
Then the company's history seems to look as small as its grandmother - a blushing development with each month, further markets, and the increase in company value.
Already in June 2000, Google’s URL address index has more than a billion positions, making Page and Brina’s work the name of the world’s largest Internet search engine.
Currently a company founded by Page and Brina is one of the leading players on the IT market.
So is there any further field of development?
"Google's mission is an organization of global information resources to be universally available and useful, although we have made huge progress in this field, it is still a long way ahead of us to achieve this goal," Piotr Zalewski from Google Polska said in his talk with "Newsweek".
Frequent contact with pesticides may increase the risk of heart disease and brain damage
The new study suggests that work with a high level of plant protection measures may be at high risk of heart failure in later years.
That is what happened in the case of a group of Americans from Japan in Hawaii, which has been studied for over 30 years.
Researchers found that compared with men who did not work with plant protection measures, those who had the most contact with them were 45% more affected by heart disease or stroke.
“The study highlights the need for the use of personal protective equipment during contact with pesticides at work and the importance of evidence in medical documentation of contact with such measures at work, as well as the control of standard factors that increase the risk of heart disease,” said Dr. Beatriz Rodriguez, co-author.
She's a professor of Geratric Medicine at the University of Hawaii in Manoa.
The results are based on data from more than 6,000 men on Oahu Island who participated in the Cardiological Kuakini Honolulu programme.
As scientists have pointed out, the results of studies may not apply to women and other populations, as it was only for men of Japanese origin.
Pesticides have a long period of fishing time, so their effects on health can tell you about themselves many years after contact with these substances.
In this case, the most visible results were observed for 10 years after contact with plant protection substances.
Rodriguez’s oral communication said: “After 34 years of observation, men have shown that the relationship between the infection with pesticides and heart disease has been no longer significant. ”
It was so likely that more important factors related to ageing were involved, which masked possible causes-effectal relationships between contact with pesticides and disease progression in later years of life.
Researchers have not discovered a significant relationship between exposure to small to moderate amounts of plant protection measures and increased risk of heart disease or stroke.
Telephony Zełenski-Turp: Your Three Big Dolls
Washington's policy has been weeks since the launch of an impeachment procedure against US President Donald Trump
It's a political scandal for political debates in the Greens situation that I would like to avoid.
But what do we really know about the Zełenski-Turp affair and will it have far-reaching effects for the first of them?
At the beginning of the telephone interview, the Trump told Greenski that the United States is doing more for Ukraine than the European countries.
Despite the fact that the White House notes are not complete, they describe in detail the attack by the cancellan of the German Angel Merkel because the German leaders and other leaders of European countries are engaged in negotiations instead of presenting concrete proposals.
The controversy stirred the response of Greenskin, who announced that he agreed with Trump, not 100%, but 1000%.
Zelenski added that both French President Macron and Merkel are trying not enough to help Ukraine.
This exchange of views led to the decision that policies, in particular those of the Ukrainian opposition, decided to vote by means of social services.
Pedro Poroszenko, former President of Ukraine, said on Twitter that EU support "was unprecedented".
In other tweets, Porosenko said he was grateful for the EU's "Russian aggression" support which included sanctions and financial aid.
Others expressed their concern, including Ukrainian policy Victoria Voysitska declared: "How can we talk to Germany and France now?"
Then Trump mentioned military aid and asked Zełenski to investigate not one but two: the first about Joe Bidena’s son – Hunter – and the second about breaking down on the DNA server, suggesting that Ukraine was involved in a hacker attack on the e-mail of Democrats during the 2016 elections.
It is not known whether it describes European relations, or whether it makes rediscovered relations with the French and German leaders.
I don't want to talk bad about anyone...
We thank all those who help us," he said after publishing a record of the telephone conversation in Greenskin in New York during the United Nations General Assembly.
Zelenski has to meet with the leaders of Russia, Germany and France in a nearby "Nordic Square" that will take place in October.
Leaders have been legally removed
The court has cleansed the Visniewsky Jerzez of his acts committed by him.
After six years, Jerzy Wisniewski was finally cleaned out of the scars.
The District Court in the Industry has cleared the former Chief of the Defence Inspector for the Quality of Trade of Agricultural and Consumer Products in Russia, with a view to exceeding the powers.
The Lubelles' prosecutor accused him of betraying the former Marshal's lead during the control period in the food-producing oil plant.
It has recently come into force on this legal issue.
The appeal was heard on 12 September.
"The Court has maintained the appellant's case," confirmed Judge Malügorzat Reiser, Judge of the District Court of Industry.
It relates to the judgment of 14 February issued by the Regional Court of Industry.
Jerzy Wisniewski thus commented on Facebook: “It has been six years since I was introduced by the Appeals Prosecutor in Lublin for a serious violation of the law in a telephone conversation with Marszalki, the Subkarpacky Commander on 30 April 2012.
The court ruled unanimously that I was innocent and did not break the law in force.
I was convinced that my phone conversation with Marszalk was in line with the applicable law.
The version of the media published in 2013 by the Court of Appeal in Lublin was true and caused irreparable damage both to the food producer and to the loss of the views of my staff in my employees, between workers and local society.
The Court's action against me contained a number of errors, incorrect facts, inadequate legal basis definitions, not confirmed in reality.
With the help of CBA in Russia everything was done to remove me from public and professional life.
I was immediately released from work and released from financial resources.
I've been staying with my wife for a long time."
Let's remember.
Jerzy Wisniewski served as the lead quality inspector for agricultural and food articles in 2009-2013.
He was dismissed from his position after the prosecutor in Lublin submitted his charges in 2013.
It appears that he was in a telephone conversation to betray the former Marshal Commander (Mirosław Karapyta was sentenced to 4 years of deprivation of liberty) for a period of control in a food oil plant belonging to the wife of the former subcarpack.
This warning – as the prosecutors from Lublina said – should have led to the fact that the owner of the company knew about control and corrected the labels on oil that were incomplete.
Jerzy Wisniewski heard accusations of abuse of power, which threatened him to lose his freedom for three years.
"I feel that this case has finally reached its end and the court has confirmed my innocence.
From the beginning I was convinced that I did nothing wrong, which is now the final confirmation is a legal reason why I am cut off from my sentences," comments Jerzy Wisniewski.
The White House tried to hide the conversation record with Greenskin
In a report made available on Thursday, the signalist wrote that President Donald Trump, speaking to President Voladymzymzyr Zelenski of Ukraine, had been engaged in the United States elections, and the White House was trying to hide the record of this conversation.
Presidents of Ukraine and the United States
In an anonymous report dated 12 August, which is probably a report worker, he wrote: “I was informed by many members of the U.S. government that the president used his role to organize the country's elections in 2020.”
‘Turp used part of the conversation (with Zelenski) to carry out its own interests.
And exactly – he tried to pressure the Ukrainian leader to take steps that would help the President in the re-election in 2020, a report quoted by The Hill.
The Ukrainian leader "has been given an understanding" that his contacts with Trump are dependent on whether he will "show willingness to take the game" in matters about which President Rudy Giuliani was more precisely informed.
The author admits that he was not a witness to the conversation but stressed that he was informed in detail about its contents by “a number of White House officials who had direct information on this matter” and their relations were covered.
"In the days following this conversation I learned from many U.S. officials that the high-ranking representatives of the White House have intervened to "crowd" all the archival records on this conversation, and in particular the text that has been prepared as usual in the crisis room of the White House," we read.
"The High Level of the White House officials told me that White House's lawmakers "have 'caused them" to delete an electronic record from an information system in which such records are kept.
The record has been transferred to a separate electronic system, which is usually used to store and manipulate information in particular," the author of the report wrote.
"In my assessment, these steps testify to the fact that the White House officials were aware of the importance of what happened during the conversation," the signalist assessed.
As the AP agency comments, this document will ensure that the President's investment procedure is expeditious and will also contain valuable information on witnesses who can confirm this relationship.
The Green White House conversation record was made available in the middle, but not on the basis of an electronic record, but on the basis of the relationship between the people who were witnesses to it.
The content of the report, in its revised version, was disclosed on the day following the report of the Committee of Representatives.
Also, on Thursday, the Director of the U.S. Report, Joseph Maguire, acknowledged before the Committee of the Report of the Representatives and made explanations on how he dealt with the report by the staff member.
Maguire said that the signalist made the right choice and acted as he ordered the law.
He also stressed that his view of the conversation with Montenegro was that it was an event “without precedent”.
The Democrats in the Commission asked Magguire why he blocked access to the Congress's signalist report; he replied that he did not have the right to disclose its content, which is a confidential nature guaranteeing a temporary executive authority.
The part of Magire's hearing by the Commission was behind closed doors.
On Tuesday, the presidential election of the representatives of Nancy Pelosi informed that due to the suspicion that the President had issued a pressure on the Ukrainian authorities to harm his potential rival in the next presidential elections, the election of the representatives of the original investigation which might lead to the trumpet.
The day later, she assessed that the report of the Greens Forum confirmed that the President of the United States had violated the rules on elections and security.
Election law in the United States prohibits the use of state aid.
However, the Justice Resort assessed that the president had not violated the right to vote. In the fourth quarter of the White House, Stephen Grisham said that there was nothing wrong with the speech, and the report "there is nothing more than a third-hand relationship and a combination of dirty consequences".
"The White House will continue to criticise this media hysteria and false narrative promoted by the mainstream media," she added.
Ghana receives two ICAO awards
Ghana received two prizes during its 40th anniversary of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) in Montreal, Canada.
The security award has been granted in support of the recognition that Ghana has obtained the highest number of air safety oversight points in Africa, i.e. 89.89 per cent of the Implementing Interim Time (EI).
It came to an end when ICAO completed its ICVM control on 3 April 2019 in accordance with the UN Aviation Agency’s General Audit Programme.
The protection award was evidenced by the high country's commitment to the implementation of ICAO standards and protocols for protection at airports and in the airspace of Ghany.
The award programme was developed to support ICAO initiative called No. Country Left Behind.
In addition, 16 other safety and safety certificates and 17 safety certificates were granted to ICAO Member States that have improved their safety and safety standards.
During the award for Ghany, he was currently Minister of Aviation Joseph Kofi Adda, Director General of Ghany Civil Aviation Office, Simon Allotey, Ambassador Ghany in Canada, Nii Ayikoi Otoo and Director of Ghana Airport Company Limited, Yaw Kwakwa.
The President of the International Civil Aviation Organization, Olumiyawa Benard Aliu, stressed in his speech the need to maintain safety in the airspace of the Member States.
He stated that "it is important that we constantly remind ourselves that even in the time of innovation the safety of aviation protection and sustainable development must remain our key priorities".
Mr Adda, on his side, noted that the prizes were a huge achievement for the efforts of the State, since they are complementary to the hard work and sustainability of the industry.
He added that the aviation industry has a huge potential for developing the country's economy, saying "latitude has the potential to change our lives.
These are socio-economic benefits, but all results from the security and protection that we have been able to achieve."

Trump appoints Peter Gaynor as head of FEMA: White House
Peter Gaynor, who serves as Director of the Federal Crisis Management Agency (FEMA), laughs when he attends the session of the Senate Sub-Commission on National Security on the proposal for the FEMA budget for the financial year 2020 at the Capital Summit in Washington, U.S.A., on 3 April 2019.
WASZYNGTON (Reuters) – The White House announced that US President Donald Trump appointed Peter Gaynor as head of the Federal Crisis Management Agency (FEMA) on Thursday.
Gaynor, the Deputy Administrator of FEMA, is the head of the Agency, who oversees the government's response to disasters such as hurricanes or forest fires.
The Agency has been acting without an administrator approved by the US Senate since March when it released this position by Brock Long.
Long rejected the fact that the U.S. National Security Department of the United States, to which FEMA is subject, claimed that Long had misused governmental vehicles for transport between Washington and his home in North Carolina.
Another candidate for this position, Jeffrey Byyard, was dismissed earlier this month when the exact examination of his past revealed the suspicion that he had participated in the fight in the bar.
The appointment of Gaynor was expected to take this position.
To confirm his appointment to this role, the majority of the Senate will be required.
The White House announced that before Gaynor became the FEMA administrator in 2018, he worked in crisis management in Rhode Island and served in the seabed.
Henrik Ingebrigtsen, a Norwegian fugitive, discusses the amputation of his finger
The 28-year-old racer specializes in the distance of 1500 metres, gaining the gold medal of Europe's Masters in 2012 (Helsinki), in 2014 (Zurich) and in 2016 (Amsterdam).
It is also a European majority at 5000 metres from 2018 (Berlin).
He explained that this is not a new delay and that one operation has already passed since the games in 2016, but the pain has returned and there has been a lot of violence in the current season.
Pain causes me to take a step that, in turn, changes my body system, causes other non-natural burdens, and I start to feel pain in other places, for example in the liver.
That's why I couldn't prepare enough for the world's mysteries, and since two weeks of pain it's so strong that I've had trouble putting up wheels – said the runner on the NRK TV channel.
The father and trainer Gjert Ingebrigtsen acknowledged that after long discussions with his son, the only solution to not finish his career and participate in the future Olympic Games in Tokyo will be amputation.
It looks like it's the only one, although the drastic solution and the decision has already come to an end.
"If part of the body is sick, it must be removed, and Henrik in sum does not need this finger so much and in this case it should be forgotten about the cosmetic aspect," he explained.
Police close illegal e-paper factory with marijuana in San Gabriel – CBS Los Angeles
EL MONTE (CBSLA) – On Thursday the police closed an illegal e-paper factory with marijuana in San Gabriel Valley.
At the office building at the 9600 Telstar Avenue, around 16:37 was built, while the police were looking for illegal e-papers for sale containing marijuana and where there was a large layer containing butane haze oil – concentration of Indian coins.
According to Lieutenant Christopher Cano of the El Monte police officers, they also found devices that were used to supplement their pollutant contributions.
"This process is very dangerous," says Cano.
Cano, who once worked in drugs, says that the distillation of oil used in vamping products is a potentially easy process.
"The usual electrostatic demand from our weapons can cause these fires to burn down, not only because of fire but also because of concentration, even explosions," he says.
“If we have lots of waves and similar waves in the room, after one explosion another occurs, resulting not only in fire but also in explosions that could remove the entire complex from the surface.
The Bureau was invited to special tasks to deal with illegal and potentially dangerous substances.
The value of confiscated products and equipment is currently unknown.
The detectives say they got an anonymous notice that allowed them to get an order for search, thus detecting illegal activity.
Followers continue to try to obtain information about who is behind this illegal business.
According to them, the person responsible put an interest in this place because the office was empty.
The permanent and official investigation would like to ensure that illegal products did not occur on the street, taking into account recent articles on the damaging effects of vaccination.
"People really don't know what products they buy," says Cano.
‘They may be mixed with other harmful chemicals.
This can be a threat to our society and children, so we always keep them in front of the pursuit of this kind of thing.

One banknote will cost 80 gold.
All the currencies and banknotes issued by the NCB, including those from the special series, are legal means of payment in Poland.
Their nominal value, however, is much higher than that which can be achieved on the collection market.
The new owner bought it for 500 thousand dollars, or more than two million gold, for his parents and set up a building in Queenstown in Maryland.
The house was moved to a special platform at Easton port where it was loaded onto a boat.
That's where he crossed the river 50 miles.

The exhibition of the lost Elzbiety I dress in the Hampton Court Palace
The recharged silver cloth made of the most famous single chamber was artificially decorated with hafts representing plant, animal and motley.
For Eleri Lynn, the curator of the Historic Royal Palaces Foundation, this meant only one thing.
The fabric of a 100-year-old wall of a small village church that looked like could have been only lost part of Elsebeth I's garden.
Three years after Lynn was caught up in the case of an exhibition on the altar in Bacton in Herefordshire, the lost Elzbiety dress has to be met in the next month at the Hampton Court Palace, near the same rooms where the Queen of Tudorov was able to wear it more than 450 years ago.
The importance of this discovery is that from the entire collection of royal garments, only one element of the XVI permanent garment has survived.
Although there is no need for Elżbieta to wear this dress, three years of research enabled experts to believe that she had to be part of the royal guard.
‘Srebrokers’, of course, was legally reserved only for the most important members of the royal court, and the virtuososor quality of refined plants and flowers, later enriched on eating, dogs, motillas, fish and insects, indicates that the crop was among the most significant of the people.
The suit, when it was finished, could cost the equivalent of Tudor's possession.
“The more, at the age of 90, or at the end of Elzbiet’s reign, she felt the threat of other women at the door and would not tolerate rivals carrying such manufactured fabrics,” says Lynn.
“As a very important statement, I asked many people from the environment to come and dress.
It really impressed me that seeing the dress also attracted her and she was practically convinced that we had an element of royal custody before us.
A long, renewed life of dress, excited to serve as an altar fabric in the dark St. Faith Church in Bacton, is not as surprised as it might seem.
Bacton is the person from which Blanche Parry came, the closest lady of the court, who served the king for the rest of her life and with whom the tent was built in local legends.
Although the dress was born after her death in 1590, experts believe that Elzbieta had to give her family Parry or parafies to Blanche before her death in 1603.
Over a thousand hours of conservatory work, four of which have been led to the longest handcuff with the help of specially colored vestibules and thin surgical needles, an ultrasound event on the exhibition next to the exhibition at the Hatfield House portrait “Rainbow Portrait”, one of Elzbiet’s most recent pictures taken in a similar dress.
"When you work with the historical fabric, you start to really respect the art of people who have done it," says Libby Thompson, the main conservative work that most of them have done for this purpose in the Hampton Court palace – the only place that is large enough to accommodate some of the priceless palaces.
“Looking forward and backward, I began to feel a great deal of appreciation for those who did it.
I've never worked on something so elite.
The "The Lost Dress of Elizabeth" exhibition will begin on 12 October in the Hampton Court Hall
Fitch Agency confirmed rating Poland with a stable outlook
The Fitch agency confirmed the long-term rating of Poland in the currency at the level of A- – given in the communication.
The rating perspective remained stable.
"The Fitch Agency points to strong macroeconomic and well-versified economies supported by a reasonable economic policy and a strong banking sector," we read in the Ministry of Finance communication.
As added, Fitch pointed out that Poland was in the beginning of a cyclical cycle, and in the years 2019-2021 the real growth rate of the Gross National Product in Poland was 4.1 per cent, 3.3 per cent and 2.9 per cent respectively.
The Agency estimates that the deficit of the government and self-government sector to GDP in the years 2020-2021 will remain below the limit of 3 per cent, 2.3 per cent and 1.9 per cent respectively.
"The government and self-government debt index for GDP in 2019 will be 50.5 per cent by the agency and will be lower in the coming years (average 48.3 per cent in the period 2020-2021)", we read.
Rating Polski
A series of reviews of the Polish rating will end on 11 October S&P and Moody's.
Rating Poland in the evaluation of Fitch agency remains the same as published at the end of March 2019.
At the same time, the agency confirmed Poland's rating at A-level with a stable outlook.
Among the three largest rating agencies, Poland’s highest rating of Moody’s credit rating – at A2 level.
Rating Polish according to Fitch and S&P is "A-", one level below Moody's.
The prospects for all evaluations are stable.
What's the rating?
The rating agencies are established to assist investors in assessing the risk of their investment activities.
Ratings are granted by companies, banks and countries.
In the case of the latter, each assessment shall be subject to economic attractiveness.
Rating is nothing but a credit rating.
On the basis of it, decisions are made about who and how much money to borrow.
Sometimes such information also suggests that those who are best not to make any credit at all are at risk that money cannot be recovered.
The lower rating is linked to the higher risk.
From the higher risk, it's a high percentage of credit.
Each assessment must be reasoned and explained.
Ratings can be manipulated, but agencies are at risk of losing their reputation.
More than 90% of the world market for rating services are currently controlled by three agencies: Standard & Poor's, Fitch and Moody's.
Each of them applies its own system of assessment.
"Fiveth of the Confederation": After the first 1000 plus
"Fiveth of the Confederation", i.e. the main principles of the electoral programme, presented applications to the Seym in Kosovo on Friday, 40 applications for a mandate from the KW Confederation of Freedom and Indebt.
The head of the Kossaliń letter to Seym Krzysztof Chmielewski introduced the title "Fiveths of the Confederation".
"After the first programme 1000 plus for Poland, after the second quick and fair courts, after the third cultural and educational bonus, after the fourth national security, it is a healthy life after the fifth," said Chmielevski.
He noted that "Police must finally start to work well," so the Confederation wants income tax relief and, as Chmielevski said, "the problem with free tax will grow".
"We must easily choose where they want to save their money for retirement, i.e. zero PIT and a voluntary ZUS for all," said the leader of the list on the basis of the "1000 plus programme for Poland".
Instead, Alexandra Zadencka, starting from the second place on the list, referring to the program title "healthy life", said that "food is increasingly higher" and to change it, "support Polish farmers, Polish agriculture" should work towards free GMOs.
As she said, the Confederation is also told that it will stop "stigmating the bones".
Zadencka declared the support of the Confederation for "the development of the building of a natural resource.
She also said on behalf of her group for "good-willing vaccines".
"It cannot be a breach of the right to a known agreement," she added.
Further applicants to the Seima from the Kossalan district stressed that the Confederation is "to conduct a thorough judicial reform", which should include a review of the case by the judge "day after day".
They were also told that the world subsidy would go to schools without the intervention of the authorities, or, according to them, without additional costs related to the maintenance of officials.
The confederation is also a "strong Polish army, based on the Polish industry and Polish soldiers".
The candidates to Seym stressed the need for an increase in the number of troops.
They say it's also easier to access weapons.
In economic matters, the need for 'solid access to energy' was stressed.
"We can gasify a candle, we have a lot of geothermal energy layers, we also need to consider going back to the idea of a nuclear power," Piotr Karpinski said fifth on the list.
The head of the Mexican cartel stands for one third of the drugs in the United States
Chicago – just after the sun set in West Side in Chicago CBS News related the morning drug situation.
Brian McKnight from the DEA Office of Drug Fighter in full light showed what's going on.
In Chicago last year nearly 800 people died of drug overdose.
McKnight said "probably 90%" of drugs in Chicago comes from Mexico.
DEA focuses on the Mexican drug lord Nemesio Cervantesie, known simply as El Mencho.
"This is the most important priority for DEA and directly for the federal executive bodies in the United States," said Matthew Donahue, head DEA agent in Mexico.
The reward for El Mencho is $10 million.
He helped to discover dozens of patients placed in El Mencho's drug labs.
The El Mencho Cartel Jalisco Nueva Generation, or CJNG, is responsible for at least one third of the drugs that hit the United States on both land and sea routes.
According to the Department of Justice, the cartel has manufactured “tonnes” of cocaine, methamphetamine and heroin contaminated with fentanyl.
El Mencho's head is waiting for a prize of $10 million.
As an Iranian, he lived in California about 30 years ago, where he was arrested for drug-related assaults and finally deported to Mexico.
That's where he created a brutal cartel.
It owns a large amount of weapons, RPG, 50 calibre guns.
It's basically owned by its own SWAT team," Donahue added.
El Mencho is free to protect his empire by using such measures as the explosion of a Mexican army helicopter, killing six people or taking part in a public campaign this year.
In recent years, cartel brutality has led to thousands of murders.
According to the statistics of the Mexican government, about 94 murders occur every day.
Mexican drugs in Chicago are so toxic that they cannot be treated without protective equipment.
In the cocaine pack laboratory, the mark of the seller is marked.
For more than one third of them, they lead to the El Mencho cartel.
"That's what he's responsible for sending a terrorist who kills innocent women and children," Donahue said.
So when a child dies, Donahue believes there is a “dear chance” that drugs come from El Mencho.
Over 67,000 Americans died last year from overdose.
France: 27-year-old President of France and his wife
The 27-year-old man tried to Santaise Emmanuel Macrona and the first lady – says the French prosecutor.
The accused shall ensure that it has documents that compromise the presidential couple.
He asked the Head of State for 300 000 euros in cash.
A man who was born in Azerbaijan and who wanted to work in France said he had received "buff" documents from the persons employed in the House of Elizai.
During the hearing, he explained that these documents not only compromise the presidential couple, but that their disclosure could pose a serious threat to the security of Macron and the first lady of France.
Instead of returning, he asked 300 thousand euros – he wanted to get a residence in Paris as well.
He contacted one of Brigitte Macron's daughters from the previous marriage.
According to the prosecutor, he refused to submit the documents he had mentioned to the police.
He said he'd send them through the media – but we don't know if these documents really exist.
They weren't found during the audition in this 27-year-old apartment.
The man was given psychiatric studies, but the doctors did not find any serious disturbances in him.

Run, jump and fight - Sport
On Saturday, the first Stomil will take Podbeskide and will want to win.
Stomil's bullets from three wheels are unharmed.
At this time, the favorite Piotar Zawtzkowski received seven points because they won with Stalt Mielec and Chojniczánka Chojnice, and in the last game, there was a stand-alone remist in Suwałka.
Now the Olstinian team will take Podbeskide on Saturday 18th, which is changed as one of the favorites for the promotion of Extraclass.
The closest railways to Stomilla take the fourth place in the table and have a lead point over the Olstyn team.
At the end of this season, the Subbeskide played six times and won two victories, remissions and victories by Natomiast Stomil is very good at his project – at the stadium at Al. Piłsudski 69a, the Piotra Zawtzkovsky team won three times and once won.
A total of 17 points were collected together in ten rows and are in the table drawers, although after two rounds at the start of the game, there was nothing to do with this.
"Every change takes time to be results," explains Piotr Skiba.
"Well, at the end of something happened to us, we believed in ourselves, and we can work under normal conditions.
We're just stuck to the game in the ball.
They're clean heads, it's a good atmosphere and everyone knows what to do because we have a strong degree of training."
On the second day, Stomilu’s pills were removed from Puchar Polski Move Chorzow, but they needed corrections and a series of criminal routes.
In the south of Poland, Piotr Skiba, Grzegorz Lech and Janusz Bucholc did not leave because the trainer Zvadzkowski gave these key advocates rest before the Saturday meeting with Podbeskid.
On the contrary, in Croatia he played back after the conquest of Jacob Mosakowski, who finally shot his long - awaited flag.
“It’s always nice to get naked, and I’ve still met at such a time that this allows us to continue to play in poker (Moscow’s 3:3 in the 119th minute – red.).
My father often corrected me and laughed that I couldn't get arms, and I always told him that I'd shoot him at such a time as he wouldn't expect."
Now Moscow is counting back on its basic composition, more so that because of the gold cards it can't play Ołeh Tarasenko.
"After this I work hard on training so I can play in the first composition," Moscow says.
“In Croatia I did everything I could to present myself as best.
However, whether I'm playing or sitting on a reserve locker, I'm still going to support the team.
Because the most important thing is the team and three points in the game with Podbeskid.
We are sure to be faced with a difficult meeting in which victory will have to be avoided, spared and fought."
In the middle of the Oustian defence, Rafał Remisz can still play, which has recently also been attacked, so whether it will occur, we will learn only on Saturday, more than the traditional Czar trainer is trying to keep himself in the dark.
A man raped and murdered a sister
“You will never see the light of the day.
You'll never breathe fresh air again," said Judge Kevin K. Allen, returning to Alex Whipple.
"What you've done was so embarrassing and boring that you have to spend the rest of your life in prison," he added.
Five-year-old Lizzie disappeared in May.
Her search lasted five days until Whipple indicated where to hide the body.
"How could someone do this to his own sister?" asked Dejay Smith, the girl's uncle.
"You are the worst person humanity has to offer," said Alex Whipple.
"I would give everything to meet her again," said the mother of the murdered girl.
“Our life will never be the same anymore,” added a depressed woman.
As Fox News reports, 22-year-old Whipple didn't show any emotion during the interview.
Last month he admitted he broke up, abused sex and murdered a girl.
The husband's lawyer said his client was raised in a "incompatibility family".
He was supposed to be upset as a child.
He also added that Whipple is aware that he has done terrible things and is ready to bear the penalty.
A man was sentenced to life without the opportunity to apply for a permit.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced that he would send nearly $100 million of additional funds to dry-affected societies.
The programme providing money for farmers affected by drought will be expanded and the allocation criteria for the economy will be simplified.
The aid package includes almost $34 million in support for dry society initiatives, which enables qualified economic aid to receive up to $3,000 in emergency cases.
Each of the 13 local self-government areas under the Social Assistance Programme will receive up to $1 million for infrastructure and aid in consultation with the impact of fraud.
The new support package is an addendum to more than 7 billion dollars for government funds in the fight against drought.

In the Name of Love China's Mystery Busters
documentary film: In China the number of divorces has increased twice over the last decade.
The cause of this condition was generally a third person.
More and more men are maintaining extramarital relations, which has led to the development of a particular industry in this country – a professional group of lovers who are committed to the survival of married couples.
Let's move on, Ma-te-usz!
Test of the Prime Minister's invitation to the Słóškýs Piekars
A personal test was carried out before the election meeting with Prime Minister Mateus Morawwick in the Słóws.
"The honourable Member, the more, the more we do not welcome Mr. Prime Minister here.
Let's start by saying, "Ma-te-usz!", he strongly urged the driver.
Unfortunately, the efforts of enthusiastic control did not produce the expected result.
The campaign is underway.
Politicians are going throughout the country, convincing themselves of voters.
The intensive campaign is also conducted by Prime Minister Mateusz Morawwicki, who is the leader of the PIS list as a frequent guest in this region.
Each meeting is well planned, including the appropriate repair.
It was the same, and most of all it was supposed to be in the Slags.
Notice – a special guest should be especially welcome.
Before meeting the prime minister, the current manager decided to conduct a general test.
Nothing out there was trying to encourage the crowd to scan the name of the head of government.
"This will not be a welcome to me, only for Mr. Matheuss Moravia!
And the more voice, the more noise of my ass!" he encouraged the disenchanted.
Unfortunately, the crowd did not fully resist the hot lead and was reluctant to respond to "Ma-te-usz", but the recording of an enthusiastic control of the network makes noise.
Ronald Lee Haskell: A man sentenced to the murder of his ex-wife in Texas
Ronald Lee Haskell, 39, was sentenced to the 2014 murder of Stephen and Katie Stay and four of their five children in Spring, Texas.
The authorities appear to have entered the Stay's house on 9 July 2014, asking for the location of his wife, Melanie Haskell, who was in separation.
She wasn't there, but she was her sister, Katie Stay and her family.
Stephen Stay, 39, Katie Stay, 33, two boys 13 and 4 years old, and two girls 9 and 7 died when Haskell opened fire, according to the Harris Bureau of Sheriff.
He survived only one family member, 15-year-old Cassidy Stay.
The authorities said it was a serious wound, but it managed to heal her completely.
On Thursday, members of the jury rejected Ronald Lee Haskell's defence on the ground of illiteracy.
The vows will be reconvened on Monday to issue a verdict.
Quantitative Internet ever closer to reality – ScienceDaily
The results of U.S. Army research are moving online quotas for steps closer.
Such an Internet could provide military security, detection and accuracy of time-consuming practices that are not available in a traditional way to create a network.
The Centre for the Explanation of Military Information Processing of the U.S. Military Research Laboratory for the Development of the Possibilities of the U.S. Army Department looked at researchers from the University of Insbruck, who were able to achieve a record transfer of the state between material and light – 50 kilometres from the use of light cables.
A surprise is a correlation that can arise between quantities such as cubes.
When two cubes are filled and one of them is measured, it will have an impact on the size of the other, even if the other cube is physically removed.
"These [50 kilometers] are two sets of sizes more than ever possible and it is an effective distance to start the building of the inter-mediate quota networks," said Dr. Ben Lanyon, an experimental physics from the University of Innsbruck and the main researcher in a project that was published in the journal Nature, section of Quantum Information.
Intermediate quota networks would be made up of remote network bonds of physical cubes that are connected to each other despite much physical distance.
Researchers have found that this extension of state is necessary for the creation of a quota internet.
"This demonstration is a number of steps forward towards achieving a wide-ranging state," said Dr. Sara Gamble, co-organized by a military programme supporting this research.
The quality of the state completed at the end of the second light is also so high that it can meet some of the most difficult applications of the quota network.
The research team launched an experiment from the atom of the wet wet in the ion.
With the help of laser sensors, they entered the ion state, while encouraging him to print the photo in which the quantification information was recorded.
As a result, the quantification of atoms and particles of light were filled.
The challenge is to send a photo with a light cable.
"The photo produced by ion waffne has a length of 854 nanometers and is rapidly absorbed by light," said Lanaon.
That is why his team initially sent a lot of light through a non-linear crystal with a powerful laser change.
The length of the photo falls has been converted to the optimal value from the point of view of the transmission to the great distance – the current standard telecommunications length is 1550 nanometers.
Then the researchers sent this photo over a 50-kilometre light cable.
Their measurements show that the atoms and particles of light were still filled even after the transfer of the length of the gap and the passage of that distance.
"The choice of weapons means that this results in a direct way for the creation of a complete network of nuclear threats at large physical distances, as the weapon can be compatible with the high quality of the "fire".
The army is very interested in the large-scale steel networks built on the use of precise positioning, accurate navigation and time synchronization," said Dr. Fredrik Fatemi, a military researcher who also co-organizes the programme.
