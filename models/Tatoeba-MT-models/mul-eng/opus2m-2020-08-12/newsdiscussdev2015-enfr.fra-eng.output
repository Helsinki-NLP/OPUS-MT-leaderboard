It makes me feel like I'm a typical rugby club.
In an English university, maybe...
Nothing to see with the rugby clubs I knew in NZ.
But it doesn't justify anything, does it?
Of course not, but the premise that says it's current in the rugby is of the big...
Of course, the prayers of Muslims are not interrupted and the human nose is not broken during drinking games (end, unless it is part of the game), but we are actually crying in black for some dehydrated evenings.
I've never played a drinking game based on the Nazi theme.
Yeeha and Ride the Bus are enough.
I left a similar comment on the previous article because the language and feeling expressed in the first year's students' prospects seemed quite typical to me.
That said, this new information does not leave any doubt in my eyes that they go much further than the mesaginous pleasurees and balgaes under the alcohol company that we often associate with university rugby teams.
The incident with Muslim students shows particularly well that they were trying to cause the maximum.
You probably don't know anything about the rugby clubs.
But why should we let your injuries and stereotypes prevent the facts?
I imagine that the rugby LSE team is popular with former students of these schools for which the rugby competition is a tradition.
In other words, old private boys.
There are very different environments from those that play in rugby in NZ, very different attitudes.
So are the "misgginal pleasures" acceptable?
I've never seen racist behavior in my university, but the race through the campus, the flight, the destruction of goods and the mission were all part of the game.
Absolutely not.
I'm sorry I didn't specify it in my last comment.
You can see it another way: tell yourself that your own body itself is part of this ancient water.
I'm going to win.
antistral also this interstellar cloud (or, not traditional:)
@lux You haven't read the article well: a small half of your pasti water has more than 4.6 billion years...
Yes, well we can at the same time consider that the fleet of pastis has on average slightly more than 2.3 billion years, which is no longer so bad as this.
A sacred foot of nests to the catastrophic and hottest of all dust that predicts the end of the oceans and water resources, while this water always exists.
One irrefutable evidence that the heating stopped 20 years ago (see Serge Ferry's outstanding works funded by Total and Areva).
@manon tooo: What is evidence that the heating has stopped?
I can't see the connection.
I think Manon Troppo's comment is ironic.
You, and for the second degree and irony, what do you have as a signal?
So you don't understand much about environmental problems.
It is not a question of the "catastrophists" as you say to worry about the destruction of the oceans but rather the reduction of human water reserves (you know the soft water that represents less than 1% of total water reserves on our planet).
And then more generally, this is not the most dangerous climate recovery for our species, but especially the reduction of low or non-renewable resources (gas, oil, rare metals) that sustain our life patterns more and more gourmant.
As for the study that you read and that you make the general effort to quote the source, there is no doubt about the truth of the conclusion.
With regard to the water problems, I assure you that the French are far from being related to xD. Then you have to stop considering ecology as an unfavourable dogma, the ozone layer is being quietly referred to (estimated to 100% for 2050 at the current rate).
Yes, the ecology, the religious dogmatistic and unreasonable environment, not thanks.
"Then you have to stop considering ecology as a doctrine without fail, the roof of the ozone layer is being quietly referred to" Yes, it is not like it was a spontaneous movement that would come from nothing.
@martin: I just want to specify that climate warming is a need because if we emit too much CO2 our land will look like Venus.
A lock which, by action of oxygen, will capture the heat without releasing it and which will accelerate the closure process exponentially in a vicissive circle.
Has anyone seen direct actions so far?
Or the least sign indicating that 10,000 good men would have come into the field to plant trees and do what a green army is bent on doing, what could that be?
I'm not sure!
In the small Abbott brain, it may be that sending RAAF to the Middle East is its version of a direct action.
We're moving forward to retreats, it's certain.
When are they gonna get rid of this idiot in the village?
The latest findings suggest that 16% of CO2 would be consumed more than any climate model allowed to give priority to replanting.
It is not logical, since CO2 is the food of plants that is the most abundant in nature, and it is necessary to preserve the flora throughout the world.
It would be said that this scientific fact has never been spread.
Have you seen the army see any part of it?
You don't do anything, you want a government.
CO2 levels increase from 280 ppm to 400 ppm and the rate is high, your argument about plant nutrition is just a failure distraction.
And before you start your wine against the Dooms wall, the most abundant fat is not CO2 but nitrogen and pain.
The most abundant of biologically generated materials may be carbon, but this does not mean that it is the most abundant fat, so Silverhead's argument is falsified and worthy of being ridiculous.
Direct Action is a step since it can't happen again.
LandCare's budget has been severely reduced and this money is now spent by the Red Army.
The problem is that instead of investing money where it was the most beneficial, it is now investing where it will receive the most publicity to re-establish liberals to marginal voters.
Your contribution, on the other hand, deserves the price of ignorance, brave champion.
SilverHead, when there is too much CO2 in the air, plants produce less photosynthesis and contain less nutrients.
This means that animals and humans need to eat them in a much larger amount in order to benefit from their nutritional benefits.
The fact that this member is a puerile is evidence.
To date, he has not presented a certificate of academic rigidity which prevents him from withdrawing from the rules of XVIIe.
For this reason, to punish him and not Tévenoud, it is incomprehensible not to harm the world, even though the AN regulation is not a tax treaty.
That this lady in charge of all things is not to her honor, it looks especially like history.
If Mitterrand had put all those who had declared Mitran...
I remember that during the debate on the femaleization of names, "Academie" was frustrated: "Let's say to Mrs. Squeaux's guardian or guardian" (post that had never been occupied so far by a woman).
For magic!
"The Political Air " . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The sandbank, the back of the Republic filled, the marigot of the opulents, the chart of illusions, etc. ...
But the air is supposed to be gladiators, people who take real risks, good grass, bad grass.
Qd the Phallocrate Empire sits on the label and Parliamentary rule by confusing the + elemental civility under the false paraplete of good ways, the punishment applies to it "the quality" for its party's conscience and its amusement of political air.
The conduct of this Member is neither normal nor worthy of his position.
He's a provocation to talk about him.
Until now he has been unknown, he can now be proud to be known as any cancer of a primary class.
The two-year high school and we see that the MPs are sensitive to the pocha...
The UMP will have to focus on solving its internal problems and stop causing chaos and scandals.
The Academy has two, especially when we tell him what she doesn't say.
This member is acting as a college in full-time youth crisis, which is causing provocation and which partners, in delegation, are going to see the Chief to cancel the colloquial hours.
and on the basis of a text they have not even read!
Women don't even represent 15 per cent of UMP members' signatures.
Mr Judge, I call on two expert witnesses that a few thousand years of separation.
That's why I like spending time with animals.
The joy they feel when they play is so obvious and attractive.
Dogs, dolphins, otters, horses, they're all stupid things for the simple pleasure they're looking for.
On the contrary, it would seem like we liked the majority of our 80s to work, move and store.
This strange phase has reached us - we are able to multiply by two of our lifetimes, but we spend most of it in the nest.
How did we get there?
Thanks to the illusion that it's anthropomorphism.
The game is a meta-communication.
Try again.
It's always an illusion.
Moreover, the "communication" necessarily involves a shared symbol system.
A difficult concept for you, maybe?
I imagine the concept of inter-species communication is not compatible with your beliefs.
That's true.
I can see when a dog wants to play and I can communicate with the dog I would like to play – basic body language.
After that, there is a variant indicating whether the game will be a race, an object to go looking for, etc.
This is not difficult and there is no anthropomorphism – although I agree with the idea that there are many concerns about animals that are being "play" while they are simply communicating.
Maybe the game isn't just "useful" (it may be, or not), it's just something that exists.
For example, David Graeber is of the opinion that "there is a principle of game based on any physical reality".
"If he had learned at school that a woman is not an object, he might not have been raped" Maybe, the hope of living...
Thank you for the hope of giving you the opportunity to live, to be healthy and to be able to answer an article today when you had to drink the information without being able to respond to it at least 15 years ago.
In general I am not against ideas, and I would even tend to be quite enthusiastic about those who appear to be early.
But when we see what many have kept up with their education at school, especially among the most likely public access to violence against women, my enthusiasm is not at least the beginning of an accommodation.
"the most likely public to commit aggression against women" We would like to know a little more.
Or rather, no, it's good, we understand.
And yes, reality doesn't always feel the rose, even though it doesn't necessarily fit your thinking schemes.
It is true that Neilly's cute youth and other beautiful neighborhoods don't listen much in class.
She prefers to play on her iPhone6.
Evry's dynasted youth too!
If the reactions were no longer responding, Twitter would no longer propose to follow Le Pen and Sarko in the first choice.
I didn't learn anything about it at school and I never raped anyone (and that's not my intention).
Do I have to like chances?
Unless I had parents to teach me some values....
The family micro-society is learning social life.
How to start reading life when we can't read?
And are young socialists going to dance schools to teach gender equality?
It would be more effective than making moralising mounts on Twitter, but it would have to come out of beautiful neighborhoods...
Enlarge this campaign.
They are nothing everywhere but to give moral lessons, it remains the best.
It's all photogenic, but I want to see the bread in a cup.
There's a balsam there about using his bread.
This week's article won't work.
It's not time to make jokes about bread, my boy!
A little sensitivity!
You have played a double word game with the word "fun" to refer to a great-grandmother.
60 books for that?
It wouldn't even fill the stomach of a 90-year-old in a retirement home.
How is it that the more we pay, the less there is in the asset?
Because the quality of experience is not necessarily measured by weight or number of calories, nor by the quality of a film or piece is determined by its length.
Yes, I agree with you.
But why should good food be served in portions that would not even satisfy a minor?
It doesn't make any sense, and it's just a deliberate policy to make you buy more money.
Of course it must not be.
The Sportsman at Seasalter is a very good restaurant where the portions and prices are both reasonably high.
You pay more because you're still hungry after several mini dishes.
The more you pay, the more you have the chance to receive a child's share of art in your pocket.
At least they've tried to put up with it.
So when I want to go to a restaurant in York City, you tell me I should go to a restaurant in London...
Maybe you should try one of the many other (excellent) restaurants in York before you decide that London is the only place on Earth where you can enjoy good dishes?
Is the Manif for all only a Catholic and Muslim movement?
Yes, that's right: a kind of homophobic collection.
But it's not just there.
There are also atheists and humanists who do not want modern child manufacturing systems.
A child must not be raised in a battery plant or manufactured by a technology device.
Battery relief?
You got it.
And if you challenge any technical intervention in the "production", you need to claim the prohibition of PMA for heterosexual couples, this would be worth the consistency.
I am also surprised that the statement "for all" did not yet have this logical claim to its catalytic attraction.
it is true that this is not the only cathos that manifest itself: other religions also, Jews, Muslims, Protestants.
It is equally useful to remember that these different churches have TOUJOURS been opposed to all developments in society: in 1865 (and I meet G.
Kauffmann) a widow, Mr. Dupanloup was violently involved in the will of the gvt to allow girls to school in the name of just "the family's defense".
We're always in the same scheme.
And, more recently, the same currents have rushed to the collapse of civilization and to the destruction of the family when school became mixed.
This is the credit we can give to the positions of these people.
I don't need to be a catho to avoid the marketing of babies and babies...
All of this is in the right line of the decline in Western civilization, more and more challenged by others!
For me, freedom ends with one another: yes to the recognition of homosexual couples who have both the right to love each other and the right to love each other.
But don't worry about letting the child be a furniture object.
And this is also valid for heteros looking for GPA.
I just don't come to love this guy, or to recognize his results.
If he had better control of the balloon and knew how to avoid falling moments of stupidity, he could have been a more popular player.
In addition, I am sure that any other attacker, besides Heskey, who plays so many games for England, will accumulate a considerable number of goals.
Imagine what Peter Crouch's goals would have been if more than 42 selections had been given to him in the national team...
I cannot disagree, at least not categorically:) Because this article speaks of the objectives it has marked, I am not going to talk about other things it brings, especially to ManUtd (where RvP, Mata, Kagawa does not bring or does nothing), but perhaps this would be another reason for which he has received much more often than we say, Peter Crouch.
Botham77 hoddle1 07 October 2014 12h48 Recommendation 119 It's about how to criticise Rooney at this point so we can forgive you for doing so too.
It is good to note that since he signed with Manchester City in August 2011, Aguiro has scored 56 goals and has taken 23 decisive steps in 93 matches.
At the same time, Wayne Rooney marked 59 goals and made 32 decisive steps in 96 matches.
So many people will have to find another excuse to take it to our Wazza because its states on the ground are excellent.
In addition, "Wazza" is a good reason for reticulating it.
I have to ask myself if you really look at the foot or if you think that Peter Crouch A) would deserve as many choices as Rooney and B) would have so many goals if there were so many choices.
I really don't understand where criticism of Rooney's abilities comes from as a football player.
The most difficult thing is to be selected regularly in his country team for 13 years, and to continue...
Do you seriously compare the quality of the footballer (even not attacking) Wayne Rooney to those of Peter Crouch?
You're doing this without bluffing?
There really are people in full mass.
Please note also for your government that Rooney has not always been the front-end engine for England during his career as an English team.
Instead, he played the first removed, the role of Beardsley/Sheringham.
He played behind players such as Michael Owen, Mr. Crouch, mentioned above, Germain Defoe, and more recently Daniel Sturridge.
You wrote this over and over again.
In a country where the arms port is tolerated and in a state where 71% of the people have a weapon, I find it totally schizophrene and paradoxal as a way of proceeding.
And of course those in this school are not just agreeing with the U.S. arms port authorisation!
the use of the skull is always suicidal.
Stop the cannery: the girl is 5 years old.
How many games do they play with the fact that they're old guns at our house?
Is that actually the killers in power for so much?
Although the arms port is in the American constitution and it has a strong impact on the culture of the country, I do not think that the Russian mines are significantly different from ours.
A bit of good sense and reason kept svp.
It's a disarmament procedure!
Make sure you're sure!
The information on this difference is insufficient to assess whether this little girl really has, or does not have any premises to the taste of morbidity.
Can we be from the principle that a serial killer can't have a weird behavior at the age of 5 anymore?
If people need a psycho surveillance, it's more mabouls in this school than students!
Let the parents take their lunch from there: she's in danger!
I totally agree.
Those who manage this school are clearly ill.
Your reaction is the most relevant.
Alabama is not the most representative state of the United States, but it is part of it.
What an incomprehensible country!
How about young people?
These bloody blue bastards that men wear have nothing to do with a businessman!
What was Alan Sugar or Richard Branson doing at the beginning of their career?
In their first photos, Lord Sugar wore a long leather coat and Sir Richard Branson wore a wheeled bullet.
I can't comment too much because I've never seen this before, but it all seems like it's hurt and without a soul.
I don't have the impression that's what he meant.
Contrary, maybe?
But what's that got to do with the depressive air?
You've made me move.
I'd have thought that a major knowledge of English would be an asset to business.
I wonder what Mr. Bjayou is doing these days.
Maybe by saying "ostracisser", he meant "aliener".
That would be logical.
No, I thought that's what he could have meant, but it doesn't always make sense.
At the same time, if all candidates were dressed like Carmen Miranda and Sugar wore a gray suit, we could see that their intention was to distract him.
But here, no.
It should be said that this has been corrected – weird. Maybe the whole sentence has been invented!
It's not weird.
Haha, who knows what he could say?
Of course nothing, but someone really wanted to quote something...
Thus, the word used in the article was well "obstructing", which meant nothing at all.
The unemployment rate in the United States is still low, about 6%.
I've never seen it since 2001.
The prices of essence are low in all states.
The US economy, along with Obama, is constantly strengthening.
Who says better?
You have a very short look...
Does their economy become "sustainable"?
In order to live there at this time, I would say that the United States is nearing the explosion as inequality gets worse.
The political system is literally capable of financing electoral campaigns.
The racial tensions, police violence, mass imprisonment have a broader scope than we can imagine in Europe but Americans keep an incredible optimism in the future of their countries and their countries!
How long?
This is the main issue.
A few days ago the English financial environment said France was lost.
Now it's America that's at the top of her wheel.
Fortunately, there will always be the UK to save the world.
Another of these articles simply forgets the essential.
The level of consumption of the US economy is no longer sustainable...
These and billboards would not be able to change for a long time...
On the basis of the strengthening of earth's resources and growing needs of the rest of the planet.
And the weakest and the poor, a very large majority of citizens, will "drive" or instead die.
I can't tell Farrage.
Will the Labour finally understand that its cynic and deliberate policy of importing co-sponsors from another country makes it even more of a support to him?
I probably don't think so.
Multiculturalism and diversity must continue to advance at any price.
LOL It was to please our American masters and their ongoing cold war with Russia.
The work's shameful performance, Ed Milliband is in the mood, it plays 617 votes.
About Clacton 11% for the Work – shocking, really shocking.
The whole world is more or less aware that the massive immigration policy of the Blair government was designed "to strengthen the rule of law in diversity"
The Labour wins the partial election, the Tories lose the partial election in sure position against ukip = Crisis Work Have you talked about your fight against reality with a therapist?
I imagine it is the same Multiculturalism that brings this manoeuvre back, the pendulum has spread very far since the end of the war, and I think it will now spread in the other sense.
Have you talked about your fight against reality with a therapist?
Lol - sure headquarters of the Work, a difference of 617 votes.
It's depressive Jack, you know, I know, anyone who doesn't know.
Of course, the Tories have seen much worse, but for the Work it is a victory at Pyrrhus.
Search for the word "victoire" in any context, and you will see that when it is used in an argumentative way against the word "failure", it gets the fight!
I agree, Jack, it's a winner, but she's a major.
The work should have won at least a few thousand votes.
If they record a performance like that in a safe seat, can you honestly imagine them winning the majority?
Personally, I'm not as insignificant as the Dems Libs won in 2015.
Of course you don't understand how our parliamentary democracy works, do you?
Yes, I know the ices of Canada, Greenland and the north of Russia.
On the contrary, I wonder if the alliance between Venus and Mars should not be considered as well?
In general, the Earth needs to be seen as more “patheless ” or as inferior than we can imagine.
Is that right?
A few little perplexities.
Wylie, on the other hand, tells us about "a simple mechanism: with the disappearing of the ice on the ground surface, the pressure on the handle slows down, which would give/give us a) a cut in magma production b) while facilitating its access to the surface??
In any case, either the "flight cut" or the facilitating of access to the surface (more or less) located.
It's difficult to distinguish the cause of the effect and inverse As for climate warming, I think it's wise to focus rather on its effects on our environment, which is already quite complex.
Very friendly, patricedud, does this Volcanism have any effect on our environment?
Does it have any effect on our climate warming, future or past?
Isn't Prudence not to warm up anymore?
When complexity cannot be resolved by simplification, we will apply this simplicity and observe it.
Yeah, but also, when it's nighttime, we'll see less.
Today, the end of the last gladiator period was also accompanied by a stronger sysmic activity, particularly in the "active" mountain chain on the very frozen continents of Canada, Scandinavia).
CB Cordialment
It is too often ignored that the earth’s crust floats over the magma and that the only crossing of the moon is to mount or descend from some 30 to 60 cm, in contrast, following its passage to the Zenith, as it does for the waters of the oceans.
What makes the glazing of the tectonic plates, as well as the marbles, is more or less easier by this moving box, more than the polar shells are aligned by the source of the ice, thus leading to a change in the earth's balance to the equator, as the volume of the earth remains constant.
I am amazed by this "human", saying the Supreme of Nature and its self-proclaimed commander, to be reticulated by his stupid act on the environment that created him and which made him so separate that it became harmful, and to himself and to this environment.
And all of this to remain the ultimate commander of this nature who goes beyond it in the organization of its own viscerals, by an invention that consists of finding all the means to dominate its neighbor, the other, in terms of cooperation, money.
The earth’s crust does not depend on the magma, but on the earth’s magnetic field, which is made up of solid rock.
I personally find it impossible to look at it.
Pretentious and proud.
That reminds me of Ascent of Man de Bronowski.
The next part is alive.
Beautiful Wild1 History
This reminds me of a totally wonderful series of 2002 which was called "Ape-man".
One of the best documentary series I've ever seen.
Surprisingly, almost no one remembers them now.
The damage you've never been beyond the first impression.
Your loss...
"The ice creams, our distant ancestors" You should look at this passage again.
Or read about evolution.
Super program thank you Brian
I'm almost sure that the "Human History" documentary has already been completed several times, they're still going to Ethiopia (of course)
Oh there I don't support this guy, Brian's "air miles" Cox, who's going up to Ethiopia to pretend to be looking at a brain in a mouth.
And his narrative...
It must be hard for you, forced to look at Coxy.
There may be a group of support for you, that's what I said.
I agree, everything is presented in such a way that I can understand.
I loved the program, beautifully filmed.
Marcel Gauchet is a Marxist bust?
Indeed, it is the individualist identity that exists today.
It therefore needs to be itself, in itself, therefore not in conformity.
True, but Descartes is also present at the time of the development of individualism, and his intellectual inquiry expresses this statement.
But at that time these are just the premises that appear, today individualism forms society as a whole, educated or not, cultivated or not, rich or poor...
We're good in the individualism of mass!!
Without making an indistinct approach, there is no connection with the Cartesian approach to examining what we are supposed to believe, what we believe ourselves.
More than rebellion, the doubt is fictitious.
Making Foucault a revolutionary is an absurdity.
Many xxx-liberals refer to them and claim them.
His work on psychiatry has produced a counter - reform!
In the face of the problem at the level of its paranoid numeral, it blocked any progress and any reflection on the reality of the follicle.
And brought with it the most repressive and reactive vision that underpins: beheaviorism.
Gauchet has absolutely reason for this and to be anti-conformist, that is to fight against this discovery.
Marcel Gauchet is accused of being a defender of the order.
Excellent idea!
You're beautiful and rebellious. Ask some of them...
Blacks and rebels, to others.
Beautiful and robotic, they include the most followers of those who see rebellion in their vision.
Thank you in any case for his controversial polymymes to be thrown into the fires of the modern Marcel Gauchet, this patient and persistent humanist, and his pedagogically enlightened.
David Cameron supports the rise of the tax threshold on inheritance
How many other budget cuts will be needed to pay the social benefits of this rich person?
Dave the robot will well increase its net value once it is no longer in power.
Business councils, allocations, consultation fees, a series of best-sellings written by a blackman on "serious policy" – it will cost £100 once it has passed the left arm.
Of course, he doesn't want to impose on the inheritance.
Wouldn't that be the same lie as the last election?
And the richest are those who will certainly pay very little tax on inheritance due to super-paid accounts and tax evasion programmes.
This has all the signs of an Emperor deduce where inheritance kills innovation.
He'll be 100 £ once he's left.
Anything.
He'll probably promise to increase the threshold to $1 million, which is well below what you say is worth.
What was your position when the Labour doubled the threshold to 650,000 for couples?
Do you also think Brown thought only of his own heirs, or are you just a brainless tribalist?
We haven't chosen it the last time, we've had a coalition in place.
You could not allow him to accuse you of lying unless you actually chose him.
Like the rest of us, "David" won't die "normally".
Climate change and extinction will soon end, he and others of his destiny.
His “richness ” will be as worthless as that of others and will not save him or his children.
A non-compulsory income is a social benefit, especially in a country where government debt exceeds £1 billion.
We must all be imposed to pay the essential services and repay the debt.
I agree with you, Exdionys.
I do not say that the teaching of discipline is useless, of course, but I just say it is insufficient to compensate for some natural "inadequacies".
Little rational statement for the professor of math that she was!
Like what...
A better recruitment and training of teachers is a qualitative approach.
However, the French political class does not know any more than quantitative approaches.
There are 2 possible answers, the 1st would be to select teachers according to their ability to transmit knowledge => reforming recruitment methods.
From +, she hates children because she doesn't understand them.
Not understanding them, she doesn't know how to act or react to work well => It's reduced to establish a challenge relationship that causes everyone to suffer from loss => there should be 1 training to teach skills.
A metier who learns, of course.
But pedagogy is first of all an art, natural provision and a profession before being a technique.
Working on and with human beings is not making car parts.
The pedagogy does not even work when we are professor of math!
"Education sciences" cannot compensate for a lack of natural skills.
What is lacking at present, just as it is a true vocation in bcp of those who embrace the profession
If there are gifts, pedagogy (I prefer discipline education) allows those who are less inclined to make mistakes.
There are ways to address a more effective issue.
The real unknown today are the students who tell us 1/3: learning doesn't mean anything I already know what I think.
A Slate article describes quite well the cachotic situation of this return.
Let's review the old Schools Normal Schools of Institutors..
It ends at 3 p.m. this week, but it starts at midnight.
If this happens, it's all right to use her time.
Oh, I didn't know that, thank you.
I don't deserve it!
It's been years since it started tonight.
We have this call called iplayer and which allows us to listen to emissions to the request when we want it!
The Internet is rather incredible, isn't it?
I don't have iPlayer on my phone and with a maximum download speed of 4 MB at my home, I can't really listen to radio broadcasts no more.
I have a type usb adapter in two of my SKY box which is connected to the Internet but listening to the radio on my TV has very complicated air.
Yeah, I think I've been wrong in the hours, I've got to hear Richard Lester for about 3 hours.
Although it's men's day on Radio 2, they could at least put a woman in her lunch hour when one of them is on vacation or sick, at least that would make people happy.
They should start by getting rid of Jeremy Vine.
Its emissions are from any sensory debate, and it would be better on a chain like LBC.
The lack of DJ women on a daily basis, where none of the regular sponsors, Chris Evans' morning at Simon May's show at night on his return to work, is not a woman
It's five emissions.
So which (of these five) is most likely to be modified.
Shennan knows it very well, but don't say anything - for the moment.
Steve Wright is the most semi-detailed of these times.
Jeremy Vine may have been sent to the offices as a real journalist, but breakfast keeps the whole glass air from a Daily Mail radio.
I imagine it's quiet, waiting for the current team to take it or it's turning around.
I was born in Soissons in 1950!
Too late?
It's normal for these people to vote for the UN.
For 40 years we have the same two parties that change power and give the country's keys to the other in less good condition than they have taken.
The campaigns are very poor, much more poor than the bathing pools with more isolation.
It takes miles to find a cinema, a bar, a gymnasium, a theater.
But since they don't burn cars, they don't attack, they don't move, they don't care about political men...
But don't talk about a department where you haven't lived.
Yes,Doclocal, these are men, sociology is good to think about them.
They have the rate of absenteism and early alcoholism very high as well...
The UN advocates human beings, inculcation and ignorance so much that it still has an enormous potential for growth, it really needs to be bad for it not to do better...
Today, the UN is particularly promoting poverty, the fear of the day, the fear of the other and the sense of having no perspective.
But you're right!
What a terrible humanity.
Fortunately there's a bunch of people like you, intelligent, cultivated and educated to save honor.
They've been looking for him.
Take the voters for c...
Here's what's going on.
Who's "they"?
"forgotten" in fact there is less than a resource =>low of supplies.
Here's the comment I left on Twitter (@priya963) Listen you can't just "add and mix", women must be integrated into the development process.
What I want to say here is that in many developing countries, existing standards are referred to in question, such as childcare and socio-producing roles.
This allows women to recognize that they can work in the economic sphere and it's super - it's necessary.
But this is not possible without recognizing the fact that women will then have a double flow, i.e. they will be expected to get back to work while continuing to play their role as socio-producer.
I'm not convinced of my sister.
The economy and benefits do not recognize the roles of sex.
Money is talking, and if a sex isn't at the height, next time!
The benefits are from the life you eat.
What are you doing, what is the advantage and what are you offering?
The benefits are derived from the heroism and education of children.
If it was a crime, the companies would listen.
Employees will never be employed by women aged 20 to 45.
Well said to my sister.
It is very problematic that no one is talking about unremunerated social work in this article.
In some countries, the value of unremunerated social work (with most women) should be more than 50 per cent of GDP.
Unremunerated social work does not receive enough support and is undervalued (without talking about the fact that men do not have enough), but it enables us to operate our societies and preserve our work.
The unremunerated social work is also an important reason why many women are unable to find a real "economic emancipation" outside the home...
Thank you for all your comments - to come back on the Mskayadee point, how can we take into account the responsibilities assumed by women disproportionately when gender integration projects are carried out?
A very practical article.
I'm sure he'll help a lot of people who need to "carve a house".
The tiger is not Russian but Western propaganda.
The Chinese are only responsible for the current situation and would be better able to sit at the negotiating table.
The right-of-self-determination tiger and Russian soldiers are just in exercise near the border, long-term exercises before the current situation.
In addition to the tiger there is no anti-Muslim in his possession.
Let go of the Tigris!
You made my day!
Oh yeah, you do.
He just came to me with the same kind of idea.
Here's a premise that's all you've found to arm some separatists in order to join China.
If Siberia's tiger is in China, China is in Siberia.
It's just time to fix this anomaly.
Why does an article on a tiger, a magnificent girl and in real danger of extinction finally turn into an article headed against Putin?
What's he doing inside?
So this is not a paper on Siberia's tiger, but a paper on the follow-up of a Potine operation.
When we expose ourselves to the media, we also expose ourselves to the irony of criticism.
The cycle of permanent victimization of Soviet-Poutinian sympathians.
Hollande had also taken the powder with his camera without calling it into the French anti-computer.
Our teacher Alain Bougrain-Duburg is a loyal protector of the Great Russia personally and physically involved in the re-introduction of this tiger.
In any case, the tiger's got it all, he's laughing...
What's going down in Holland is one thing.
At first glance, this seemed to be an awfully congenital idea.
On the basis of the article, however, it should be said that it is both a response to a real problem - dental grants of emergency - and effective.
So it's hard to find something to do.
And if only 53% of this sample had brushed your teeth before and 73% after, it's a little empty to complain about patriotism.
After all, there's no need to brush your teeth!
In fact, the complaints seem to be related to the fact that they are aimed at the lodgers and that this confirms a negative stereotype.
But if that's true, then it's not a fair criticism.
Belinda Smith, of the Canterbury Regional Health Committee, said that the Department was concerned about the number of emergency dental subsidies offered by the Department of Labour and Income from the Department of Social Development to young homeless adults.
On a media level, there would be better ways to implement it, I imagine.
But he thought reasonably well.
There is an inconsistencies in brushing your teeth.
If you brush them after having a bottle of wine, it can damage the enemael layer.
If your toothbrush is old and rigid, it can pick up the gene and cause inflammation.
And I remember an issue on the Guinese book of records where someone had tried to brush his teeth for the longest time and the Guinese judges at the time had strongly advised him to do so because of the bad effects of a frequent and prolonged toothbrushing.
" Firstly " is very dramatic.
It has to be an experimental design.
The simple fact that this study will be conducted voluntarily will have changed the habits of participants who knew that toothbrushing would be studied.
This is why most behavior studies include tricks such as double-blind, witness groups, etc.
There is no way to reject these results on the programme itself.
Assuming these texts are sent to each young person who sees social benefits, there are two things that differ from the test: (1) These are not volunteers, and 2) they do not return information about the times when they break or do not brush their teeth (lightly wrong results in air by people who deliver their results according to perceived expectations).
Are there consequences at the epigenetic level?
Studies (Pr. Lyonnet) showed that the maternal environment (including uterus) could have effects on genetic heritage, not on genetics, but on the expression of genes, and that these inherited treatments could be transmitted to the next generation.
Does the uterine flu affect this phenomenon?
Nausea itself looks like some sort of flu.
There are likely consequences, but as long as we don't want to have a perfect clone of ourselves, is there a problem first?
I think it's going beyond the limit of reason.
The desire for motherhood and parenthood must not keep going ever further, without asking the question of ethics, risk taking, for mother and for her baby.
The doctor is not all powerful, it is not unlimited and yes it is unfortunate and painful to accept that all women will not have the child, or children they wish to have.
It's nothing, absolutely nothing, to see with the train.
But let people, women, others, have their bodies, their notion of love that can go up to risk taking and manage your little witnesses to you alone, all alone in your little pants to you all alone.
from their "trust" this magical bag so they have this wonderful moment of pregnancy.
Why would I keep him tightly in my safe case if he can still give me love?
The current narrow conditions make PR FRYDMAN cautious about its communication, but if "we" agreed to reflect, "on" would admit that this is only the bag and not the genetic material involved.
Let's put it as an anti-argument : cf here these reactions all males curiously....
Marjane, no organ gift has anything to do with it.
I've been a plasma donor for years, it's not completely anadine.
I was enrolled as a spinal cord donor (I have never been selected because the selection is very hard and this is understood both for the recipient and for the donor), it is a real operation.
Now as a man, I wouldn't be allowed to judge in any way or in any other way or take part in this gift, but I'd listen to women talking.
@Margane: Indeed, it has nothing to do with anodin, and it strengthens the act of love that it involves.
Giving a queen to a member of her family who needs it has nothing to do with it, and that's what happens!
Please don't mix Messi v Ronaldo.
It's low.
I agree, we don't need this.
Especially since there's no really competition...
Ronaldo is the best athlete.
Messi is the best footballer.
The Sports has become a Yoyo club.
They're too good for the Second but they don't have the League's standard.
Rivaldo was not part of the winning team.
Thank you for correcting me.
But Rivaldo played well for the Deportivo before going to Barcelona.
Ronaldo who continues to do his best to beat all the memories of Real Madrid's goals this season so that he can then return to Old Trafford this summer with a quiet conscience...
I don't think so.
I think Ronaldo will finish his career in Santiago Bernebeu.
I think you want to talk about the state of the international oil investment company?
I'd look at it on a fucking connection so I can't tell you much if it's not that Valencia has been well defended and without counting on possession, they deserve to win.
I was afraid the ground environment wouldn't go too fast but they played well.
Parejo's game in general is getting better.
A low-priced criminality affair but saved to a fair title by Diego.
A hot weather mestalla and this has not to be dramatic for Atletico's bus to be bombed.
It's interesting.
A complete article, signed by young researcher Amandine Marshall, “On the origins of mummification, ” well illustrated, appeared in the magazine Archeology 524 of September.
It is good to have arguments to confirm and date what becomes intuition.
Not surprisingly, before we're complicated, we've made it simple.
All science progresses by small steps.
And was "the body" of the woman who was thus preserved?
Passionate!
Good morning and thank you for your tickets.
He seemed to have read to me some time ago that a black child mummie had been discovered in the current Libya and that this discovery had opened up new horizons, including geographic and temporal (I think I remember that the mummie was 1,000 years ago to the first African mummies known).
Do you have any information on this?
Thank you for your progress.
She's playing some reading.
These may not be pollutions of modern times.
Didn't the desert at the time extend beyond now?
Why don't you imagine plants like the cannabis pushing where there's only sand now?
We knew the song.
And it's enough for a European scientist to say it, even without any evidence, that it is a scientific truth: the Egyptians and therefore Africans have never invented anything from them yesterday and today.
But the song does not tell us who are the inventors of African inventions in Africa.
If this is not and always "from his unknown predecessors".
You should read the article.
Here is an article written by neoliberal cracks in the free market that preachs against people's mobility and property mobility.
I think there are other people affected by Ebola and on whom the Spanish Government is thinking, so as not to give up bad image and protect tourism.
Today, I would like to believe that tourism is the last of their concerns.
But they may remain silent to avoid general panic.
I would like to believe the same about tourism, but governments in particular (i.e. those in Spain and the United Kingdom) tend to protect the interests of businesses rather than those of people.
Stop, do not hesitate to call your local MP and complain about a lack of transparency.
Although I think that the government here is just a bunch of connards, good-to-nothing and corrupts, like Madrid is not a very tourist place, I doubt that this is their greatest concern.
What are you waiting for?"
(with all due respect and compassion for the nurse and her colleagues), since tourism is one of the only things that enables millions of people in this country to keep their heads out of the water, I would say that it is important.
If they were to return the missionaries absolutely, I don't see why they couldn't send them to an air force base and take care of them there in a field hospital, instead of in the capital, for example.
Rajoy had the task of decommissioning the Spanish health service, privatizing nationalized hospitals in particular in Madrid, which is the basis of his power, until the courts intervene.
It's nothing but a public relations lawyer like Cameron, and like Cameron, I think he's mad at the next elections.
To be fair to Cameron (I know it's not easy here) he's socially far from his right and would find his place in the religious spheres of right in America.
He now has to sing the hospital halls he had just left to try to achieve his goal of protecting Spanish tourism.
I am sorry, but you cannot really compare the Tories or any other European party right to Spanish law.
These are separate cases, believe me.
The Spanish Government is thinking about almost everything it has to do with it.
It's not like someone could accuse you of spreading infamous rumors.
So you have tangible evidence to support this idea?
This section of the Guardian is called Comments are free.
Thank you, Mr. Supiot.
Without putting work at the centre of production and economy with its rights and guarantees, we will not leave.
Excellent article but especially fascinating reactions on the forum.
Many of TPE patterns - SMEs seem to read The World to take time to condemn Mr.
Let's look at the anti-intellectualism of the environment.
A law teacher at the French College seems unable to know the labour market unless it is a Nobel Prize for Economy and proposes to liberalise it completely
It was so much better before, it was true when Dr. Villermé noticed the work of children aged 8 and 10 per day, when the Canuts were taking care of a signed collective convention.
Oh, good old time...
Your reaction is equally fascinating by your knowledge of the TPE pattern metie!
His master is not to know the right in all his ways, but to manage and produce.
Four handwritten amounts registered on my youth payroll, more than 100 information today!
Here, for example, we could say much more, which illustrates the constant flow of constraints, which are imposed without any consequences, and which would affect the small business.
Your paper would have been very useful if you had written it as an expert and not as a customer of Sorbon.
In order to break the back of the archipelago argument of the French Labour Code in relation to the helvete, a serious university would be placed in the Swiss texts and would have compared the number of official texts, then that of comments (the absence of these last comments may mean that Swiss laws are more understandable than we are).
By comments in a Code, whether it's work or not, it's about justice, including...
And yes, in France, there is still a judge who is responsible for applying the laws when a employee is licensed, for example....
Who's this complicated?
Do you find that the rules of law (laws, jurisdiction, conventions, contracts) are about labour and trade barriers?
What's he doing?
How hard is that?
Pullmann "The art has been practically immunized against the criticism of Mrs.
Is this guy still in the mood?
There is certainly a time when new revolutionary absurdities are making criticisms...
For each article on Ai Weiwei I recently read, you are part of the first three comments that complain about its popularity.
Go ahead!
Let's see, the choice is not missing in the art world.
If China can produce new artists who are not the spokesmen of the Communist Party, the world will be interested.
Yes, GhenisCan is probably a troll of the Chinese government.
I think China has produced a lot of good contemporary artists.
Those who are the spokesmen of the Communist government are not appreciated in the West, and those who are not the speakers are not as well connected as Ai Weiwei.
For those of you who think Ai Weiwei's art is a kind of fraud, that's what you're laughing at.
Thanks for that, you're here to ruin my little breakfast.
I'm sorry, but it was worth any price to expose it (without making a bad word game).
It's the guy who excavates the old irreplaceable ceramics and calls it art, right?
There's art, and then there's vandalism trying to attract attention.
The real artists make the difference.
A beautiful artist.
His father is also a good poet.
His father was a very famous poet in China.

KARSENTY DEMISSION This gentleman is unwilling to carry out an electoral mandate for the extremists of any board (including Zionists) must be removed
Philippe Karsenty and his ridiculous theories of the conspiracy, which were worth a number of judicial convictions, are both embarrassing in Israel and in the capital of Neuily.
It's neither one nor the other.
Philippe Karsenty is fighting against the truth alone, marginally.
HOW TO RESPONSIBLE
What's Newilly's Marie doing against Philip Karsenty, who has hired a journalist and his family, and who's calling publicly to attack this citizen?
Crime Apology?
I can't find Neuilly on my card?
Is it a new administration that holds these new privileges???
This type needs care, as well as Ulcan Chelli, they both do in the theory of the antijuf/anti-Israeli compact and whose sources are perfectly identical to those of their most angry tractors.
As many people believe in any political decision to see the hand of the "sixists" (the term of which is meant to disappear, because of its abuse), these two, as the LDJ or CRIF, believe in any criticism, even banal, an object antisemitism "that is not without remembering the most dark hours of our history because it is still the heart of my good lady we believe would have returned to Russia in the 19th century!"
Noting that Karsenty's incredibly stupid theories on Charles Enderlin's report are even more stupid than those on September 11.
And God knows that the theories of the conspiracy on September 11 are of a very broken spirit.
And this type has political responsibilities, it's extremely worrying.
To clarify my analogy with the theory of the September 11th summit, we speak of cognitive dissonance on how to deal with the issue.
Totally blinded by a totally colorful truth, having spent too much time, spent too much money to steal it, it is unacceptable to accept this theory to detach it (as in the case of extreme religions).
If there is a logical and inexhaustible advance, the end justifies all means, even the lie, which is a combination but does not seem to disturb the mission.
You advise to pay attention and not put the whole world in the same box, but that's what you do for September 11.
There is still a lot of questions without answers for this event, and Bush/Cheney/Saudiens/consorts do not seem to be forced to answer.
There are indeed very colorful theories, but the official theory is also, at least on a few points.
Oh, nothing's funny now...
Health NGOs and public health portals find that the results of the study are widely in favour of their awareness-raising efforts.
And, of course, they will need more subsidies to follow!!
Although smoking was socially accepted 50 years ago and is now recognized for what it is true, alcohol will also know its time of judgment where the real damage it causes in our society will be exposed.
More than waiting for everybody to attack me now...
Well, it's easy to enjoy saying tricks such as "excessive consumption of alcohol is rising", but what demands (a little) more effort is to give real facts.
I'm sorry if you think it's an attack - you're gonna drink a glass and you're gonna stop?
It's better to risk it than to put my mental health at risk by avoiding me.
The Government ends its pleasure when it costs him money.
Here are other alarming advice based on unreliable statistics.
Two average grapes per day is at least a low level of alcohol consumption, and the first quote seems to indicate that it increases the risk of many cancers, but the second implies that it is a higher or less safe amount.
Perhaps the Cancer Council and the National Health and Medical Research Council should come together (about one or two wines, but not more than three) and give us a number on which they agree - whether it is justified or not.
Now, we're going to pay them back, like the smokers!
They're already doing it - soon this will be the grass!
My father didn't drink and didn't smoke, and cancer took him to 64 years.
So I'm going to continue drinking my two red bottles on Fridays and Saturday evenings (and the other night when my wife isn't there).
Why is it that the Cancer Council encourages children to go to places where alcohol is served? It is an old age that the Cancer Council has deliberately ignored.
What's not connected to a risk of cancer today??
Requiries don't touch cancer - they eat anything but they're not good company.
Requins can attract cancer - skin cancer.
Charlie Whiting's incompetence has been a recurring subject for many years.
Refuse to run when we can run and run together.
Complete agreement.
Whiting is Bernie's blessing.
Two of them destroyed F1 under security.
We hope he gets better than Schumi or less Wendlinger in 1994.
Absolutely agree with you, but note on point number 1: this is not F1, but the circuit authorities who refused to move forward so as not to steal TV broadcasts.
Everything exactly, +1
I just want a quick and quick recovery in Jules Bianchi!
Brazil, 2003 Europe 2007, the incidents that failed to take place between landfills and f1 were free of charge warnings.
We knew it would happen one day, and Jacques Laffite said it for years.
How the organization of the race and the FIA could afford these manoeuvres without going out for safety?
I can only accept the risks of the metior or failure to succeed when it has not been prevented from predictable.
But that accident was it.
It must also be said that there was a yellow flag, which not only means "a ban on crossing the area" but is intended to signal a danger first.
It's not embarrassing, it's happy for the family that should be in front of the television.
Even under the yellow flag, the pilots will just lift their feet.
Under changing conditions, the steering wheel can be much more tighter and the pilot, believing to arrive with enough margin, can even be "reduceed" at a normal pace.
But it's because we're out there, as long as we haven't seen the pictures, we're not gonna be able to deliver a notice.
I don't see what that changes.
Are there any injuries?
According to the CBC, no injury was reported.
The CBC showed the information this morning before this happens, which makes me wonder what caused the delay.
It's hard to believe there's still bubbles where we have to keep watch 24 hours.
I don't think there are people injured because Canada is almost empty.
There may be animals injured such as ears, working rats, etc.
I hope it's irony.
Some parts of Vancouver have the strongest population density in North America and Toronto's agglomeration has at least six million inhabitants.
In the Saskatchewan campaign, trains don't go as far as enchanting and these types of trains often cross popular urban areas.
Nearly every Canadian city is crossed by a rail line, and trains are very, very often in one day.
In addition, as roads often follow water courses in areas where there are lakes, rivers or oceans, they also pass in densely populated areas, as people always want to stay close to water.
Also, the whole railway traffic goes through the center of a city because there was a central element of the original construction of the railway lines here.
You may have tried to be a role model, but there is a huge potential for road accidents in Canada.
Mansbridge made a report on last night, really shocking.
You've obviously not read the article about the demolition and explosion of a train in a town in Quebec that killed 47 people?
In fact, you're right in part.
The city of Vancouver was a port city just before the railway.
This said that when railway roads were built, they passed through the center of the established communities because it was the most direct and central road.
Perhaps Canada's National Railways Society employees should attend the next Calgary Conference on Dangerous Products in Canada on 2 and 3 December 2014.
NC employees are long trained to carry dangerous products.
This article, like many comments, focuses on the primary religious issue: a religion is a revealed truth and for its believers it could not exist with other facts.
The problem is all there and the executions of theologians only strengthen this fact, but what good talk about the sex of angels?
"God has said it's good - it's bad" > It's not compatible with democracy, it's called dictatorship (variant: theocracy).
A statement by a leader (Muslim but Not Important): "But without religion, how do you want to keep the people?"
In other words, obey the healer priest Rabbi Imam and pray for your prayers, it will be better!
Reported below, (Nowak): pb was settled in 1905 after 40 years of fighting against cures.
Then His Appendix Newilesque touch you.
Yes, that's what Voltaire and others thought, where Robesierre somehow tried to establish a cult of the Supreme Star.
But our oligarchia also has its cults: the strong euro ( rather at present) or the free market ( probably supported by the State when it needs to float ) , etc .
Great ideas derived from religious origins.
Yes, but especially where there was no distinction between religious and Protestant.
Where the rationale emerges, the religious is on the way back and expresses itself in the schisma.
Religion was born as an ideological support of the State, and the gods served ambitions even if they also brought forms of controversy.
The theology between loyalty in the form of revelation and adaptation to weather did not know the question.
Fantasy is often described as a bad interpretation of "sacred texts".
This is not opposed to the examination of these texts which are simply explicit appeals to the hatred of the author.
Rather, these are the moderate religions (and fortunately they are the most numerous) who "read the texts badly" and feel that they are only what comes from humanity and common values throughout humanity, atheists and various believers.
For me, fanaticism is the beast and evil application of passage of sacred texts from their context.
Thus, some verses of the Koran calling for the killing of "mecreants", "infidels", "hypocrites", "Jewish" or "Christians" are incomprehensible and therefore unacceptable if not read some verses above or below that these executions are justified only in cases where Muslims are attacked, killed and in a state of legitimate defence.
on Yves Petit: "As regards "foulard", this is a religious requirement that makes almost unanimity among "salants" today.
There are idiots everywhere.
The only positive point to draw from this is that this has led to a general condemnation.
Especially in Australia.
Aren't you guilty of the same damage as that shown in the clip?
Néandertalans' flag supraised and hypersexualized.
They've gotten enough of humanity!
What they have freely brought us together with our neighbors, For life, Summer Bay, Paul Hogan, Crocodile Dundee, Junior Einstein, Angry Anderson - Suddenly, Mental as Anything - Live It Up, Danni Minogue, Razorback, Baz Lurman, Nicole Kidman, Russell Crowe, Bee Gees, Shane Warne, Yahoo Serious, Ian Thorpe, Kylie Minogue, Men at Work, Hugh Jackman, the Devil of Tasmania and this satanic Skippy!
An insult to our intelligence, that's what he gave us!
If you tear your eyes off the TV for a while, you will see that Australia has a rich cultural heritage, starting with paintings in caves and on stone made by its indigenous peoples and still a source of inspiration for modern artists today.
And then there's Sydney Opera and a national opera company that produced such great singers as Joan Sutherland and Nellie Melba.
The Australian film produced films such as The Story of the Kelly Gang, Mad Max and Gallipoli.
The outstanding Australians include Errol Flynn, Nicole Kidman, Hugh Jackman, Heath Ledger, Geoffrey Rush and Kate Blanchett.
The only thing that offends your intelligence is you and your ignorance.
Russell Crowe is Dutch, and the Bee Gees were English.
Your intelligence really needs to be insulted!
Let me have another opinion.
Sox doesn't need any help in this section.
How have I managed to make it a "little white"!
Another one of George Lazenby's.
I love you!!
But are you Marie Jego?
The largest foreign journalist based in Moscow.
The most brilliant.
Its articles are missing.
She understands whether she has Poutine and those who support her.
Go see Leviathan in the movie instead, you'll understand a lot!!
Nice try Savantcosi!
But you may not know yet that Kastals is only a small Moscow telegraphist who has only been doing this for his days.
We leave him for a month and when we return he's going to owe the same salads.
The total number of 331 deaths since the ceasefire has been civilians of the Donbass victims of military bombings, due to uncontrollable elements according to Kiev.
The presentation of the hypocritically proposed responsibilities in the article does not mean that the separatists are clearly identified in the Otanesian World line, which does not hesitate to reverse facts and responsibilities in order to maintain the felicity of the pro-European neonates facing Russians with courage
@SavantCosinus: switch browser.
I really open this page on firefox and mac.
If I understand your story about the criminals are the Ukrainians and the Russian Stalinists you wouldn't be a little communist by hazard
Extract from the (very long) document you read about MH17: "This ticket is absolutely not intended to say that pro-Donetsk resistors are innocent".
The Ministry of Defence of the Russian Federation said that Ukraine was responsible.
From the propaganda?
At Alexandre Kastals: Where do you keep these details about the macabre account?
Of the Ukrainian army (she loses soldiers almost every day, she says)?
Uncontrolled elements (possible to say anything)?
ALLEEEEEEZ LA ROMANIA!
Alleeeeeeweeweeweewein Hungary!
And I say it as a Romanian citizen.
From Transylvania, with a Hungarian woman of origin, on the contrary.
I can't support the Piturca team, they don't represent me.
Piturca is a member of the local authorities who has not stopped denouncing the Romanian football until the pathetic level he has now reached.
They formed a network that produced the "Cooperativa" which decided before the start of the season which team would win the championship, which teams would be in Europe, which would be relegated, and which would whiten the money into its interest, mainly by selling players who were well-appropriated.
Gica Popescu, the former captain of Barcelona, had dealt with the above-mentioned agents, and tried to avoid paying taxes (about a million euros), then paid them, but apparently he was advised by his lawyers, refused to admit his mistakes to the court (which would have been worth a fine without fine), and was therefore taken 3 and a half years in prison.
The trial was also worth prison for Becali's brothers, four club owners, Steaua manager Mihai Stoica, and Popescu, for offences related to football.
George Becali also cleanses him of a punishment for trying to suck (and then disseminating the facts) a team to beat us (CFR Cluj) in the final match of the championship, to win the title and win the league's jackpot.
The team he tried to do was our neighbors from Cluj, University.
We won 1-0 at their stage, a result that allowed us to be the first champions of Cluj, while they were relegated.
I'm always dreaming this time.
The demolition of this corruption attempt involved, among other things, Piturca, who signed as a witness a false document suggesting that the money that the police had confiscated in Cluj was related to land sales.
So this uneducated, uneducated buddy, idiot, traitor and liar don't represent me, and I'll never do it.
The Hungarians are just a bunch of nationalists today.
You might think that after the last time they broke down the stairs and store wines, and where they burned racist banners in their streets, they couldn't have tickets this time, but not.
I thought Neil Lennon was about to take the reins back to Al-Ittikhad.
Wherever it ends, it'll be a disappointment, after Stockport County rejected it.
Super article.
If it were Sarkozy who had done it, we'd have heard the left scream like a big disease.
But like the Dutch gentleman, friends of trade unions and small people, we hear a little protest, but all low
That is why economic environments sometimes prefer that a party claiming to be left is placed in power.
These are the bankers who have financed Obama's victory, and they have not been due to their investment!
"the absurd idea that most job applicants are not looking for work" LOL (no comment)
Should the employment policy generalize the control of farmers in early 2015?
I hope that in the crowd, the fiscal pool will also generalize the absolute control of the so-called gurus commonly called plutocrates, bankers, kleptocrats, tax evavades, thieves bosses, and other malandrins.
Do you know how to make a phrase without the words of bankers or plutocrats?
You're very proud of your jargon every time
That's true when we're in class: we're dealing with the population of white and toothless people.
In each new period of unemployment, these are dozens and dozens of candidates I address to employers who are most often not even on a reception charge, were automated.
It is also the total absence of follow-up or support from Poland Employment.
In conclusion, I would add that the "socialist" pattern of this government appears to me as an insult to the memory of Jaures or Mendés France.
Do we have an article here from the dressed canard?
We learn that a fraud can last several months without news from its agency, but that it must continue to look for jobs by its own means.
It is learned that controls have enabled people who for more than half of them no longer touched unemployment.
So we ask ourselves how we can control people we've never seen before.
We are asked what punishment is a radiation for someone who has not access to the employment services or unemployment allowances.
And if we can admit that this reform will allow for more radiation, we ask ourselves what it will help recruiters.
"It is learned that a farmer can stay several months without news from his agency, but that he must continue looking for jobs by his own means" Indeed, it is shameful.
Why should these countries be in the EU while the authorities are clearly unable to defend Europe's equal ideals?
Isn't it like the Spanish or Italian authorities had done a great deal about racism in the foot no more?
Should we throw them out of the EU?
The EU was of economic origin only and should remain.
The aim is not to be a "police of thought".
The EU is a peaceful project.
It doesn't make any sense about an economic plan.
That is probably why Britain will soon leave the EU: it is Europe's most unfair society.
What equality??
Eastern European teams are constantly being hit by corrupt mafia architects who are the EAFRD.
The best solution would be that all East left this lucrative organization and created the scene.
At least we'll look at the end of the football.
This cross-sectional anti-racism is just a screen to cover injustice and corruption!
No, that's not true.
The currency and trade, instead.
The European ideas of equality ?
What, then, is it wrong for Europe to allow the United Kingdom to enter?
Uefa should have appealed to them for having enjoyed the comedy of Blair and his men.
This has been happening all over the world for a few years, and I don't exaggerate.
Two or three days ago from the Guardian:
Would he expect to see little symmetrical phrases back, just history of keeping the polymics?
Whatever it is, it is a fact that every small event towards peace, there has been, there will be and there will be people working to throw oil into the fire.
The decoding would be to say that the Western States are against a "Palestinian State", that they are pro-Israeli and that this alone explains that these States have never done anything against the Israeli State.
The decoding would mean that in order to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian issue, it would have to act against the Israeli-Identified State under the occupation of a colonizing oppressors.
In 1945, rather than creating a Jewish state in Palestine to destroy an Arab population that was nothing in Shoah, it was more reasonable to see the Bavarian of its German residents (which they were capable of Shoah) replace them by surviving Jews.
If it had been fair, the Germans had nothing to complain about and Europe would have kept millions of educated, entrepreneurial and dynamic residents.
Mr., take the example of the colonization of Western Sahara...
If Morocco is the colonialist, it's evidence!
But as for Israel, it is also necessary to question the History, its allies and its support for the intervention of the truth.
Colonialism, whatever it is, has never been altruistic, we agree.
So stop your pirates to support Israel as a colonizer.
The Gaule has been colonized by the Romans but at present there is no discrimination between the descendants of the Romans, Gaulais or others.
In Palestine, there is discrimination based on origin.
In addition, the State of Israel is defined as that of a "Jewish people" whose non-Jewish people will not be part of it.
The Israeli State discriminates against non-Jewish people, from which they are happy.
Conclusion: To resolve the conflict, it must end with the Zionism that opposes Jews and non-Jewish.
In Maghreb, some people have even been baptized in the name of their first status by this lifesaving civilization!
Two realities that must stop ignoring.
Primo, the Zionist European project (colonising itself to Palestine) involved the deposition of the Palestinians, which was therefore an interethnically anti-Palestinian project, so the solution needed to break with Zionism.
Second, Zionism is a political ideology.
Uruguay has been missing since the beginning.
Their final outcome will provide them with what will kill their teeth.
He should start his rehabilitation by small mouth.
I hope he didn't lose the appetite of the game.
We were so tolerant of subtleties, including racial injuries and physically hard toys in the football, but Suarez was punished too long.
I'd like to see him come back to England, no matter what the Purists say.
Yes, I hate all these molarizers.
The football is a contact sport where the tiles exist and, therefore, the players will get hurt.
The fact that his teeth are turned into the body of an opponent to have the advantage certainly has no place in the game.
A rugbyman has been suspended for 80 matches to make a similar gesture.
It's now the third time Suarez does this.
If you kill someone at work.
What would be the consequences for you?
I knew someone was going to kill you.
If you're dyslexic, I'm sorry.
I'm slightly dyslexic.
I'm sorry about this mess with two balls.
I guess he was hot to come back to play with his teeth.
All these words on Suarez are losing their dying.
I failed to kill the hamlet.
An essential condition for a good school course is respect for students from their teachers and school institutions.
This works if parents inculcat this respect to their children.
Parents will convey this respect more easily if they also feel respected by their children's professions and school.
In the good institutions of those who make progress in their students, parents are considered partners, not like emms.
Who can believe that it is the professor who should do all the work (teaching, educating, learning respect, limits, living together short) It is for parents to do at least 50% of the ceiling.
But it's no doubt easier to take it to school.
Taking care of parents is not operational.
No one really cared about them.
The action will be limited from then on.
On the other hand, the school institution could have a lot of things.
Operational solutions live there.
It would be necessary for actors (professes, hierarchy and ministry) to play their role and do not remain in touch.
We can dissipate a team that is struggling to reboot it, not families.
Don't talk about teaching.
It is true that communication courses allow for change.
It's like training teachers, but we forget the first role of school.
Transfer knowledge.
And if it requires parents there, it is the school that ensures the instruction of their children.
What is the Minister who will put in place what was called the Public Education.
Next article: little information, partial and structured reflections.
Do you really expect an intelligent comment from this beautiful East whale?
It's a beautiful, it's clear, but I think it's rather Willoughby, and so on the North Coast...
Sloppy Joe doesn't understand the numbers.
He refuses to accept the facts.
Not surprisingly, we have a budgetary emergency.
Let him fall and the economy will wake up right away.
Hunters Hill, a fact.
true care
That's it.
A little Aloysius.
His electorate is the head of Sydney North.
Indeed a beauty from the North Coast!!!
Well, if British BBC viewers wanted to compare the non-conservative governments of our two countries, they would obviously have concluded that they were both led by the Monster Raving Tory Wang-Bangers.
It's going on for a grinche of our day.
Yes, but his good leader leaves him on his hunger regularly.
Instead, you would also be proud if you woke up one morning and realized that you would never have the role of Prime Minister and that all these legitimate and unlawful benefits in life would never remain outside your scope.
Pauve Joe.
It's really pathetic.
He tried half of it to present a budget and then he left.
At least he doesn't threaten to hurt anyone.
Brittany Ferries needs a new ship.
She will be able to command it, without gas turbines - in a distant country and to claim State aid.
And as she can do lobbying, don't be afraid of the result.
And so bad for employment in France that it has nothing to do with it, it is always ready to break when its body has losses on markets, outside, including...
it's just because their lobbying didn't work until the command was cancelled.
If the company had obtained the time or arrangement for marpol, there is no doubt that the project would have been completed.
Then, to know if it's okay or not and how BF will comply with the law despite everything, it would be nice that "the world" hangs over!
The company Brittany Ferries is detained by the legumier bretons.
Those who burn tax and drought centres.
They want state aid.
That they didn't look like it to me at least normal.
And even as an army ship under the French metropolitan flag is 30% more expensive than any other civilized flag, it is normal to wait for a break from the State.
Or we are condemned to tolerate British monopolies on the market.
It's the choice.
An eternal French problem that considers its maritime faces as tourist destinations, not as areas of activity, where there are sometimes people different from the average Paris.
This difference is paid every day, no investment, no short wish.
One of the reasons why Britain has to find its sovereignty.
That's it and then they're gonna create the Breton Pavilion with equipment exclusively made of pure-bred concrete.
With this, they're sure they're going to make the costs down significantly...
That's right.
Unfortunately, this is what we are waiting for from the BBC now.
They have always hated everything about the future, so it is not surprising that they have chosen to go beyond the foothill of Hackett, which has always been closer to the Genesis spirit of the 1970s than those of the other members of the group.
Hackett was for Genesis what Malcolm Young was for AC/DC.
If you don't understand how important it was for the sound, you don't really understand their music.
To tell the truth, they hardly mention Gabriel’s sole work no more.
I do not think that the BBC can be accused of "hate everything about the prog," as they have been distributing an hour and a half documentary on one of the largest prog groups that ever existed.
I haven't seen the documentary yet, but it's a film about the Genesis group, not about the solo projects of its members.
As for Hackett's solo career, which would be "near closer to the Genesis spirit of the 1970s", I do not agree.
Hackett no longer has the right to take the road, play a Genesis song bag on which he has several degrees of participation and pretend to have a relationship with Genesis that David Gilmour has no right to collect half-final demos and call it a Pink Floyd album.
Oh, wait...
I think Steve Hackett's asking for nothing more than a fair representation, but he didn't.
A curious feeling, the first solo album of Bank, is absolutely great, and in fact in the spirit of Genesis of the 70s.
They've gone beyond Hackett's solo career because we're honest, she's scared.
Yes, this is one of the best prog groups, but would the documentary have been made if they had not been successful in the '80s' trade?
I have not always seen the BBC broadcast a long documentary about groups such as King Crimson and Gentle Giant that have an interesting story but lack the popular attraction that Genesis has.
Good notes.
I would say when even though the BBC has "always" hated the fact that it was ADORAIL the progressive music in time.
A person with a personal interest calls "prejudice" : of course.
A little more interview with Jonathan King on the DVD version?
It's a really great chance.
If the death penalty is an attempt to redouble a terrible act by another horrible act (including sometimes against innocents), then it is an exciting success.
There will always be a difference of size between a convicted criminal and those who kill him.
The criminal has committed his actions since his misinformed understanding of society and its rules.
Those who kill it from vision and reflection make it the fairest and wisest of a society.
I mean, they have no excuse.
They're indefinable.
Yes, we understood your point of view, the first time already.
That's exactly where the difference lies, Mr LeClos.
There must be a very different spirit from the common spirit of mortals in order to enjoy violence.
That's what the criminal has been doing since his wrong understanding of things.
But it is also what causes pain, hatred, victory among the victims of the innocent victim: a false understanding that will never prevail against those who wisely decide the death of others since their health and just reason for their pedestal.
However, in order to try to balance the analysis, we could still say that the death sentence has often been subjected to wild violence, which he has been able to do against people who are deeply loved, who have made it free of charge.
The neighbors of these unfortunate victims will perhaps see their pain lessened by the disappearance of the one who was the storm, sometimes the torturer, of being loved and keeping their nights.
We don't hate their relief.
Thank you Emilio for this thought I find very fair.
A strong and exciting article.
As far as Marc Asnin is concerned, he proves great intelligence.
The one in the heart.
That's certainly what I've read more just for a long time.
However, we would believe to read stories from another time, old things, that the barrier of the past would excuse, and then there are the dates that call, 2009, 2011, 2012...
I really don't think Philip Roth is so great.
The same for the other two "American Excellent Romanceers" mentioned here.
Roth, Pinchon and De Lillo are all over.
I thought you stopped white, man.
What's that smell?
Roth is great, better than De Lillo or Pinchon.
And Roth is inextricably better than this doomed Bellow, who received his prize.
Perhaps Nobel’s judges of this year decided that if we had to have an American laureate, we could still have a [reader] racist.
Munro's very good, too.
They all produce "geneine novels" as if it were a literary kind.
His homonymous Joseph against...
What have you got?
How many books of DeLillo are the anti-DeLillos there?
I've never finished Underworld, but a few years later I started reading his other books.
Do you have The Body Artist?
The news like "Human moments in World War III"?
White Noise?
The first lighter novels, softer, smaller, and their dialogues are also super.
I don't know if I'm gonna finish a day Underworld.
I just know that if I meet someone who claims to live in the same world as me and have enough books from DeLillo to reject his writer's talent, I can only fear that his favorite novelist is Tony Parsons.
Why would he have a conflict??
It's of simple interest.
It was a sense of humor, "the law," not a request for definition.
Between the text and the spirit, it seems so obvious here that the lady has acted in the SON's sole interest, and absolutely not in the institution she represented, that we are asked what the term "conflict" is going to do there.
For her, there was no conflict.
I hope she'll take very nice!
Yes, State services are very practical: either they prevent a dynamic entrepreneur from creating the value, or they have not prevented it from being dangerous.
After we understand that the French wages are not dynamic and are only seeking peace.
The watery areas that become constructive from day to day when a major construction program will be launched are classic, and only on a low-cost basis.
Look at the raindrops near the rivers.
We were told that "from our day there are no more floods due to regulation barriers".
Now it is necessary to increase the retention lakes up and across the fingertips.
But this will be due to state services, of course...
The benefit on the ground, on the whole of the promotion?
By land.
So 6 million euros.
Is it clearer, there, interest?
Get out the calculator and you'll dream of the life you could have in place Mrs. Babin, 1st Deputy UMP of La Faute sur Mer and former president of the Urbanism Commission, who gives permission to build!
The two mothers of the Triomphant Sarkozysm are old-fashioned and real estate.
I'm left and not all sympathizing with Sarko, but svp, not of low political or low cuts all at once, we're not there in a big fight.
I wonder if the figures involved in these recent fossilized incidents were also involved.
U.S. Flicks are hardened criminals.
The U.S. is a fucking hole.
So what the hell are you looking at?
The U.S. isn't a fucking trick.
Yes, U.S. flicks are forced by what they have done every day.
Of course none of them ever does anything but the flickers "come after them because they are racist".
That's a good excuse.
Racism is endemic to the U.S., it's unfortunate that there's an incident like that to force people to see the problem closer.
Your generalization reveals a deep ignorance of the US...
You're ignoring him here.
The good flicks must condemn corrupt racist flicks.
VENDEZ-LES!
Do the calculation.
This kind of open racism isn't here.
Is this the first time you're in a conversation?
This is not a conversation, you accuse someone of being ignorant while it is clearly you who do not care about anything - many sources (US sources) have noted the permanent problem of racism in the United States (this is not an arbitrary speculative speculation).
It is very likely that you underestimate the extent of the problem and do not appreciate the extent of the tension on this subject at this time.
As a result, the gap between public service and private security for power and privileges, which has never been very robust, becomes even more significant.
Wall Street finances the NYPD in various ways, where treatment is conducted by Occupy there.
What surprises me is the birth of some and I'm shocked by the false birth of VA and others.
And where do you think research journalists find their information?
On the Internet?
They will question the responsible, speak to them, raise confidence.
That Lomme next to Elisée has nothing really surprising.
Then, what counts is recovery, verification, analysis.
And that's where we understand that the sarcoids are worried about doing it.
@Munstead, our current president has chosen a wave of anti-sarkozysism based on all-room-mounted business (a non-place and no condemnation) that seems to have been concocted by judges(2 referred to in correctional), two Dutch fellow journalists.
If this conspiracy that is revealed between justice, politics, executive and the press that is not supposed to be an organ of power doesn't shock you, it's just your parting spirit blinds you!
RV with Holland...
And of course all this is only coincidence and not teleguided!!!! ...
If you think Sarkozy's only support is engineered!
From the extract I've read, the VA article makes it just scratching the trigger.
I even had such a big one.
For the rest, the world's complaint has little chance to make it because journalists are not "astronomy" to the secret of sources, is it not?
There seems to be no difference between VA and power while there seems to be a difference between power and the world's journalists for an operation against an opponent.
I must not be the only one to wait for an explanation from the World about the background and its dangerous relationships.
We are well in front of a state scandal that in any other democracy would cause the fall of the government involved.
From where this editorial on the lips, which has long said about the complexity with the current government.
It's not a matter of left or right, it's more serious.
I'd have thought the island would be fine with the smoked Hareng!
It's just for numbers and to reduce wages and create housing problems, I'm sure if I was an immigrant of the second generation whose life was pleasant because my parents had come here I'd have doubts about immigration, but that's no reason to oppose controls.
One of the most sensitive people in a BBC broadcast on immigration was a second generation Sikh who said that it was easy with the number of people who had entered and the changes they had made with them, she was associated with a Muslim man who was not of any co-operative, even refusing to give jokes simply because of the religion of the lady, and she refused to go into her place of worship even though she said that she was not obliged to pray.

As we all know, if we let it go, the United Kingdom will continue to go to the right - whoever imposes limits and answers that must be admired even if he is a Pub director:) That's so much better for you!
More to the right?
Where do you live?
If this country was more left, it would be Communist.
What do you think the New Labour has done, especially on the left?
The release of a country, the NHS this NHS is repeated, the massive immigration of immigrants (according to their own terms for the well-being of the right-wing nose), the culture of social benefits, the age of the right-of-occupancy, the political right-wing killing freedom of expression.
I understand that the Labour is a left-wing and non-communist centre, I have said this to be a joke, which I mean is that they have socially manipulated a very high percentage of the population to make them independent of the State.
It's typical of the left, if you want my advice.
Hide your prepared arguments as much as you want, but what I have asked you is specific examples of left-wing policy, or a left-wing program defended by the New Labour government.
Can you do that?
With all my respect, that's not what you asked Daniel Johnson to do what he thinks the New Labour was particularly right.
He gave you his advice, and then you refused to accept it and changed what you asked for.
Yes - it's more Tim Bell's territory.
So Martin Sorrell, the most powerful publisher in the United Kingdom, shares the situation of his parents with those of economic migrants who now come to Britain?
What an insult to their memory!
He had absolutely reason to do so.
France to the French!
He fought in 40 45 to fall into another dictatorship, that of the money.
We're going to make great savings by turning these technocrats...
I think we should renegotiate the treaties.
Or, renegotiations and if the word "democracy" still makes sense in Europe, shouldn't it?
Unfortunately, the Commission is not concerned about the delay in tax competition between countries for companies.
This must be a negligible amount.
"Europe is not the solution, it's the problem...
The EU has only one objective: to make the rail transport sector completely marketable.
In the end, this means that whole breads in the French territory will no longer be served by the railway.
The departure already suffered by many territories will only strengthen itself.
All the sacrifices, including the advancement of a country, in the name of the liberal doxa, did not seem to me to be a good idea.
The EU is a real problem that will have to be treated well one day.
Not at all.
Europe is the first institution to have both the will and the means to clarify the SNCF's accounts.
The French state has been decommissioned for a long time.
The regions have the impression to pay for nothing, but they do not have the means to force the ncf to comply with its commitments.
But using public money without waste is essential in our days when public resources are under pressure.
And the enormous needs.
I don't see very well what the TER competition could be!
Is there another problem with alcohol?
If that's the case, shouldn't he be the chief of praise?
It seems to me that you have not really managed to distinguish the problems that existed during marriage and that you are, of course, still coming to an end of pain and anger now more than five years have passed.
Of course, having an ex-alcoholic living so close to you and having what seems to be a daily impact on your life is exciting and very difficult.
That said, I would feel like starting the separation process between your life and the complications you have inherited.
I'd say that's what they do, but it's hostile to me.
Since you all live if you are close to each other and the complications seem likely to persist while new ones are on the surface, have you thought of a "plan" of "flight" so that you can cut between your life and your future?
Financial problems have a bad effect, but with a compatible estate credit company, a good lawyer and a little pressure from the court, they can be resolved.

Why don't you go to a family advisory group to say things openly and to provide support to help her get back to work and pay her food pension.
I think that's the key.
Your life is done much more than the time you spent with your ex.
Very good advice.
My advice, ask the children what they want to do, even if this involves meeting the new woman.
Tell them you'll support their choice whatever it is.
Warn them that he will not strictly keep his promises about contact and ask them to reflect on how this would make them feel and how they would manage the disappointment if they did not have their appointments.
Try to keep them in touch with their father.
If they see that you do so for their good, despite your own feelings about the way he treated you, they will respect you.
They will never stop loving you, and if you do all you can to facilitate a continuous parent/child relationship, they will know who will be grateful when they are older.
I think children end up understanding who's wrong if we let them see things for themselves.
You're close to Godwin point for a little while.
It is true that in 30 to 40 years of civilisation will have disappeared, the short-term economic interests are too powerful, that is the power of land against iron power.

This is not the climateceptics that produce C02.
It's all those who heat themselves, those who use the climate, those who take the plane or the car, those who live in housing that is well built, those who buy industrial products that they have to produce and transport.
These are not climate-optics that have shown against ecotax, but drivers.
No policy is climate-sensitive and Arnold S consumes much more than I do.
But no one says that climateceptics emit more than CO2 than others.
Environmental defenders are also moving for conferences.
It is that individual actions, even if they count, will not be enough.
Political actions (other sources of energy, reducing dependence on car, etc.) are also needed.
And politicians act in part according to their electoral sensitivity.

The United Kingdom depends on immigration to pay for all our retirements, to care for our old age, to see their health bases, to bury 30,000 people who die each year from hypothermia or hunger (forget your lain and bonnet, which allows you to warm up, to extend the heat and to eat this sandwich to breakfast).

This is how public money is spent to allow a poor minority of individuals to spend a good time in space making glippets and run around playing clowns in front of television cameras.
The reality television has therefore not invented anything and the authorities certainly expect a baby to be designed there to blow up the world and recover the media coverage to Western kingdoms that are used to the mothers of the tablets.
Maybe they're going back to the ground to find out we're out here!
Unlike what you think, we don't send men or women into space to make gloves or clowns, but to work.
And these work is very useful to mankind in general.
And that, in all areas.
Many things that improve our daily life are derived from space research.
Well, it's money spent usefully.
You can quote one thing that improves our daily life and derives from space research.

After the infamous minority of individuals who go into space, there are several tens of thousands of others who work as far as possible.
You know, people who boast, including more and more private companies, in particular to drive the cargo to the station.
If you're going to buy a plastic gun...
But what about those who don't want to buy a plastic gun now but who have the potential to buy it in the future?
This may be the most dangerous of all.
Not because the plastic sword was a decoration in a private residence.
A plastic gun in a bank is used to try to mislead people to make them think it's a real gun used to commit a crime.
The plastic arrows may be kitsch decorations, but nothing else.
A very dishonest article, would it have hurt the author/editor rather than put a picture of "the sword" in question instead of a general picture of "the sword in plastic"?
Or even being curious enough to ask what the inscription (if any) that appeared above?
Mousvais typical report, we point to the fact that "this is only a plastic sword" and not the inspiring Jihadi text that is written above.
The sword, a Zulfiqar or Dhu al-Fiqar, is one of the major symbols of the Shiite Islam.
The Dirani family, on the other hand, is a Shiite Muslim born in Afghanistan, the terrorist groups that seek to destroy the governments in Syria and Iraq are almost exclusively Sunni Muslims.
If only people would stop regulating the fact that plastic caps are harmless.
In their hands they can be mortal.
Even the small envelopes that are given in the fast remnants can feed the flesh.
Thank you very much for this information, so if it is a common decorative object, it justifies the ridiculousness given by the author.
It is not wrong to try to make it a "ha, ha, a plastic sword", the facts you have mentioned actually support its argument.
I saw at the time these decorative objects in Muslim houses, or painted on walls, never had the threat air, just another version of a "cross".
Jesus, you're right.
And that makes all her sense now...
I saw this guy who had the air from the Middle East to the Kebab Stop and who was distributing plastic bags to anyone else all night!
I love the conclusion.
All the wonderful news, often technologically, gives many people the idea that it is a right and a need to benefit from it, but they have an immediate and worse cost, a fixed cost (subscription, electricity consumption) that is available in the budgets.
And the inability to take advantage of new technologies to generate frustration.
For example, call on the Energy Pact Solidarity, which allows you to isolate the furniture of a house for 1€ symbolic when it is used by a modest household (work costs are borne by actual energy suppliers!).
Simply effective but rare even if more than 3,000 houses have been isolated this year!
Interesting this PSE.
But I never heard of it.
Who can call it and how does it work?
for information 60 million consumers, water-economy shower testing and predicts the installation of water-consumer material on robots and WC.

This is not a crisis of demand, it is a crisis of the system that is no longer going to produce enough surplus (that it would then be redistributiond in the form of real-time income increase) so that these surpluses will bear the rise in the expenditure you are classified in the "compulsory expenditure" category.
In other words, energy precarcity is "just" the reverse of the medal of the fact that the economy is no longer able to grow as fast as it would like.
Note that the classic theory of the economy is completely unable to answer such a question, because for it there is no internal limit to economic growth, and there is no element that can make the pace of economic growth difficult, more strongly after a decade.
From its very definition (in physics), energy is what allows for any physical transformation.
Because producing, basically, is transforming, energy is this way to achieve the least economic production (good or service).
And the more we want to produce, the more energy we need.
This means that any pressure on energy gain (unappropriately called "production" of energy), even in the form of an increase in its price, to the rise in production (not only to improve energy efficiency, but to improve energy efficiency requires still heavy investments, which are not profitable if energy is not expensive).
Briefly, there is a very strong link between energy precarcity and the fact that it comes, or not, to create the "production" of energy not expensive.
And the very official data published by the International Energy Agency, for example, show that the situation will only be worse in the years and decades to come (the AIA, in these recent reports, clearly indicates that the production of conventional oil was achieved in 2008 and that oil was not consumed.
But oil is the most universal form of energy, because of its very strong energy density, its ease of transport and handling and storage, its variety of possible uses, etc.)
Three points, I work well whatever it is.
It was a good performance in Germany, and nothing worked out, so it's the same thing.
Take this to France!
You're not the 18th.
Are you a Guardian webmaster?
As noted earlier: It is good to win.
It's good to win.
In fact, it's a good job for the boys.
Although many English people like to dance with Ecossans when they just lose, there is nothing to say, they bring some color to the tournaments when they arrive to qualify, at least until they get rid of them in the first round.
It is even more rigid if we play against them;)
England is starting to bother me.
Because, now that the "dear Shige Generation" is gone, they may have a decent team with all these young people.
Ferdinand, D.
Batty, Joe Cole and David Seamen back in the XIs, why change a team that gets?
The only English footballer who, in my humble opinion, has really been "of international class", is David Beckham, a bit affected, perhaps, but I think if he hit a patent on his shoulders like me, he'd completely exaggerate me.
People forget about its athletic constitution, or about its athletic constitution in sports, Wayne Rooney... ?
I've never had any trouble with the Ecossais.
I tend to be surprised at seeing their hot colors with nostalgia at the end of the night...
The only English footballer who, in my humble opinion, was really "of international class," is David Beckham.
Yes, people often seem to forget that he was, at his best, a very good player.
It is true that Juppe would have been wrong to ask for 100000 euros for a South Korea conference.
And not about what he'd get if he asked them...
You mean people come here to fix a good time?
For the rest, I would be surprised to learn that B Debre, for example, lives only on his MPs' wages...
I am particularly concerned about what he can tell in his conferences.
How to reduce its deficit?
How to get back to full-time?
I would say that no serious conference on scientific discipline, whatever its scientific level, even if he is entitled to a Nobel Prize, will not consider asking for the minimum amount.
Conferences with content are most of the free or almost time.
And I can assure you that these young people are really working and that the results presented in their conferences – free – are real.
At the time of the constraints on the research budget, the implementation of these two figures is constructive.
The researchers' conferences are even paid by the labo!!!!
It's to say...
It's all clear to me.
They're looking at the sun.
So N Sarkozy is a representative of UMP ethics
I have the impression that we're accusing him of making money?
I'm far from being one of his fans, but we're accusing him of having bad (or fraudulently) handling his OK campaign.
But making conferences seems to me to be a legitimate activity.
To add to Nina's comment, let us recall that its movements are being carried out by the contributors.
Rule No.1 of epidemiology: isolation.
All American and British flights to or from Africa should have been suspended weeks ago.
Human lives are more important than political right.
It is present in Spain, GB, Texas and other potential places.
What degree of infection of the population is that politicians will resolve to make the right decision?
So if I want to leave Africa to the United Kingdom, I take the plane for Spain and then take a plane from Spain to the United Kingdom.
If Ebola is operating in West Africa, I see it very well prohibiting all flights and ships in the direction of the United Kingdom.
We should always have sent goods like that...
What harm the panic of the international media on Ebola is no longer used to talk about less spectacular but more deadly health crises affecting the people of West Africa.
We're all threatened.
In every corner of the world, men and women. It's such a sad newspaper article, a big title so low.
I could read each paragraph and replace the word Men in other contexts (also relevant): Women are the first donors of care - read - Men travel from one community to another, etc.
Such smarter comments could have been made on ways, reasons and places where we can all better understand and interpret cultural and sociological approaches and gender differences that could help combat Ebola in West Africa.
Come on, let's think and write, we don't like making noise.
There's a time for everything.
If you are not able to offer a good analysis and an intelligent opinion, maybe you should just think before writing?
Although I put the female genital mutation on the same level as the decapitation - a form of terrorism as barbarous as it is, its survival rate makes it only a different form of torture - says that its temporary suspension is a "place of hope" beyond understanding.
In fact, I see that the contributor is Sierra Leone, which can give a certain degree of "validity" to its opinion, but in this case, of course, this does not give a better perspective than that of an average activist in the street.
And I believed that the Guardian was in the process of "increasing" as a global resource for journalism - moving forward in the 21st century, laying down its fundamental requirements.
Who, in the editorial team, makes this look like it?
For a territorial election or other money doesn't matter.
I read without delay that the territorial public function increases its effectiveness, and I have never seen an article giving them the word or trying to explain why.
That would be legitimate, actually.
There will certainly be lies and truths to separate us from the good seed of the ibrary.
The Court of Auditors spends a lot of money reporting on the economic dividends.
It's true that they've never had anything to do with the people of the Cambon street.
TTCs are not in deficits, they have funding needs that can only concern and only their investments.
He has the power to use too many concepts of the press as the World makes the game of all the obscenities.
Debt is beneficial because it finances investment, collective property
Unfortunately, the financial debt is mainly of operating costs...
And as the surplus of staff (for example, to make good rounds-points) generates an increasing and uncompressable burden (compulsory burden up to their deaths, as work on life + retirement), these communities are increasing in investment.
It is therefore necessary to delete the staff member's status prior to the reduction of supplies.
And take responsibility for the majors financially.
It is interesting that the intercoms would have to be accompanied by a reduction in Community efficiency and that the reverse is being done, as evidenced by the fact that it is not effective without the removal of others.
How do you want to manage large areas such as the TGV and the car?
The time of the horse where these territories were created is a revolution, perhaps it would be time to react.
They wouldn't prefer to stay in prison, worse English, in the administrative toilet!
In fact, it is not too hard to explain the situation of blockade in which the state of the Weme has led with its providential men.
That really started with Petain.
Then he went on to turn to the series "at the top of his breath" which came to him very strongly.
Why are they not going to live in a 250 million-dollar apartment in Monaco above a movie to leave all this suffering behind them?
Europe is also built on a cemetery, which will be a long and difficult process.
When will these people learn to take care of themselves?
Do not even try the answers of the kind "is the fault of the whites".
"response" does not "response"
I really hope it's from sarcasme.
It was in my previous post, where it wasn't obvious enough.
That's what happens when we step aside to be the first.
Whether it's sarcism or not, there's an argument to go through.
We now agree on the fact that modern Homo sapiens evolved in North-East Africa some 200 thousand years ago, and during a particularly cold period about 150 thousand years ago they were able to travel to the North to the Middle East, and the rest (or at least eight thousand last years) was part of the story.
The current Defence Minister had declared a few months ago that no military hospital would stop.
So he's lying.
It was undoubtedly the only government that seemed to have the road.
Now we know we can't trust him anymore.
Disappointment!
in 2017:Transformation in a comfortable special hotel with expensive cards for future Republic pensions?
Moving from the stage dedicated to Bercy?
Very good decision: Val-de-Grace was a symbol of the past, a medicine for nantis and their families, the "Grand V" care of a 3-speed medicine.
We'll save money, and the soldiers will take care of the flu of the little one...
Do you know that 70% of patients are civilians, from all directions?
The London Wasps?
I'm sorry about their fans who are based in Wycombe/London.
How about London Irish and London Welsh?
They left the "London" last season.
It's just "Wasps" now.
A franchise from any other name...
At least they're going to Los Angeles, right?
It turns out a football team uses the field of a rugby club instead of the reverse.
In addition, travel abroad for Tigers and Saints will be much easier.
No, it doesn't change anything.
In Stockport County, we had the disadvantage of being bought by the Sharks Sale, and we ended up renting our own stadium with them once we found our independence.
I'd say the same thing.
The way they insisted on training in the field, although they had access to other locations, did not benefit us.
I like to support Coventry City.
The good news won't stop.
There is always the possibility of a Converry United now.
It must be frustrating for a team that has no bad support and who has been on top for more than 30 years, to see its stage restored by a gang of rugby.
I am aware of the recent problems of the CCFC, but this must be a good guide.
For my part, I'm not the club's cornerby, and to be honest I don't know anyone who's doing it apart from some Wasps at work.
Are they and a few thousand other people in the South East sure to follow them away or should they now support another team?
Fine article pro-domo and good publicity.
But who cares?
Why, then, are not all computer systems based on these concepts ?????
+ Because there's a huge mass of programs (cobal, Java), + Because not all systems don't need them, + Because there's no magic bagut ++....
And because for most computer systems, bugs do not really matter, which is the first on the segment.
The work of G.

But they sell us.
Real-time information has become a key sector in many areas, and few are aware of the intimate details of these processes.
It's been 15 years since I didn't go to an Olive Garden.
The quality-price report has fallen.
I'm sorry for those who lose their job but it's better to close the box.
I would recommend a simpler menu with choices whose popularity is known.
Reduce costs and prices.
There's already too much salt in our diet.
Don't ask Olive Garden not to put yourself in the future.
It should be said that they reason with Faisons more profits, and not Faisons of the healthier places and the best quality price report.
They're taking us for kids.
Oh yeah, be careful that people don't have too much trouble.
And then we make our soup by somebody else, it's better when it's industrial.
Make sure there's a lot of salt inside it, it replaces the real ingredients.
We should also add some sodium glutate.
The amount of salt you must add to the water of pasta is negligible, but this greatly benefits the taste of the finished product.
This is not only the taste of the salt, it also affects the way the feet feed.
The finished product is so much better.
Without it, there's no food.
Each should try alternatives to the business kitchen.
Do there are family restaurants and they offer affordable dishes?
What is happening in the United States is very sad.
An accident at work that turned bad.
A young contractor, trained as a thief, followed his father's career in prison to kill.
A man has completely disappeared and violently interrupted this birth call.
To be sentenced to 10 years in prison seems to be the minimum.
Where are we going?
All right!
That Humour!
The desire for redemption is obvious and difficult and embarrassing at the same time...
In fact, the desire for divorce is hard to excuse.
That's what makes me have a certain sympathy for a 15-year-old dog.
During the trial, the father of the game complained never to see his son again but without asking for forgiveness for the kind of guy he killed himself.
Who's really the victim in this story?
What do you come to mix!!?
The father of the game was convicted for what he did.
With regard to the connery of lost bullets, the accused and the guilty were well aware that the bullets were dangerous.
The gang didn't do anything to the accused!
Let him therefore pay for the crime he is responsible for!
Ten years, it's a little bit of my opinion.
To have the intelligence to shoot this young man to make the noise?
Actually, it's the noise!
If the occasion is present, take vacations in the Mosule Valley and sleep in the B&B of one of the small victors.
This makes me do it twice, wine, landscape and food are excellent.
In addition, if you're there during one of the many wine festivals held in each community, it's even better.
I'm sorry, Moselle Valley, I fell too fast.
It's good to see that German wine is recognized.
Rather, it is important that German winemakers traditionally use only one variety of rice, which means that they must really stick hard to preserve a certain quality.
Of course, some young generations have experiences with different roots, such as France, Italy, etc.
There is only the region of the Moselle which should be recommended - France, the Rhine (Pfalz), Baden deserves to be visited.
A French region of interest is Alsace, which is like a blend between Germany and France.
Wines are German style (or maybe it's the reverse, short).
The Germans prefer beer.
Traditionally, they drink wine after meals.
Knowing the popularity of dry whites during the meal, they now offer them a lot, and with a much higher content of alcohol than their 9 degrees preferred.
But their traditional wines placed in the bottle are so complex, sweet is extremely balanced.
Try Schloss Vollrad's spatose with a terminator host next time you go to the rest.
Search Hallgarten online to have a good selection.
I used them when I had my restaurant.
The World Atlas of Wine by Hugh Johnston is a good guide, beautifully illustrated.
I understand very well that there will be new readers of the Guardian who discover the wine, but this is a summary of each article on German wine since the night of time.
From time to time, there is an article on German wines that are coming, the new seeds of Baden that are now going to accompany the dishes, the reds that are extremely powerful, but above all, it's not these Liebfraumilch that people were drinking when they were young (Hey, I don't really think it's always true or evangelical, except if I address myself over 40 years - which, as I say, will have seen all of this).
Closer the Val de Graçae would be a huge mistake and an illustration of the sad state in which the administration of France is.
A crime against Louis XIV and an epine in the foot of my grandmother-in-law and my grandmother-in-law who studied there.
In democracy, public health management should be subject to the vote in the House of Representatives: these cabinets of departments held by barbicettes, and these decisions taken by close friends have become intolerable.
Superblying reason.
It should be done as in the Green Sun: euthanasia at 70 years of age.
In addition, we could sell the meat that will feed our poor (sic) active ones because they can no longer go to the market.
In fact, find a job for our customers, a real job, and you won't have any problems!
For the elderly, the time has come to pay a little more because national solidarity is no longer able to provide...
The assets, by way of disappearance, cannot have this demographic transition alone...
So of the hierarchy, of course, but to think otherwise than a hospital model of 30 glorious.
Now, the maximum growth of 1.5% (which has been the case for 30 years) for the next 50 years will force us to reconsider all the model defined after the war!
Val de Grace is the symbol of medical excellence in France: a certain harshness and discipline that was more known in the public hospital.
If this symbol falls we're really fucked up.
First we're fucked because the rest of the hospitals aren't high.
The scandal is that the presidents and other elites tend to care for themselves more than the public hospital.
The solution is more in the increase in the offer of public service in other hospitals than in keeping a medicine at two paces.
Val is a French medical excellence pool, and of course a symbol.
The farm would be a mistake, a further sign of the path towards the mediaty of France.
Without talking about military status, which must be preserved absolutely.
"The hospitalization day price", a hospital management unit, is decided by the department with local supervision of the Regional Hospital Agencys.
The abuse of our nation continues.
Finally, I mean, of course, the baby is only one of these economic refugees, who came to Australia to have a better job than the one he had with him.
In almost every country in the world, a child born in this country of two non-citizen parents is almost always non-citizen.
Australia is going further than most of the countries with children born from Australian citizens.
However, it is Australia that is criticised because it does not respond to some very high standards, with obvious difficult consequences.
Why?
It seems to me to take two measures.
Send Abbott to the Middle East, Pakistan, Sri Lanka to end all the persecutions and ill-treatment and war that make people of their countries flee and force them to seek help in Australia.
If he doesn't want people to come by boat, then he has to solve the problem that generates this traffic.
I have nothing to complain about in Sri Lanka today.
The civil war lasted for 26 years, and tens of thousands of people died on both sides.
That's what happens during civil wars.
However, the war ended six years ago and the country returned to normal.
It's all going to make sense now, nomad.
It's strange that British Prime Minister David Cameron didn't believe in this little superhero when he was in Sri Lanka with Mr. Abbott...
Cameron denounced war crimes and ill-treatment that were still taking place.
Several European countries have since suspended the deportations of the Tamils with links to the LTTE, thinking that they would be at risk of torture on their way back.
UNHCR revised its asylum applications assessment guidelines in December 2012, and recommended that persons with links with LTTE be considered at risk of returning.
The year [2013] saw a number of attacks by Buddhist groups against Hindus and Muslims.
Elections for three provincial councils were held in September.
Take it easy, boys!
Mr. Novak, you've gone to the coco with so much time.
In fact, this guy couldn't even get a chance to make it.
He didn't have a health insurance in the State?
So I wouldn't have been given any treatment.
I would like to know who is going to pay for the medical expenses during his stay in the hospital.
The city of Dallas perhaps, unless some lab pay for the pollase of the body?
In the US, the rule is cash first, help comes later.
Especially in Texas
Ah ah!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
There was only a short time ago, we were told that the Ebola kills so fast that a large-scale epidemic was impossible (there is all scientific literature on the subject, with models and everything).
Then we were told that the risk of infection of the collected persons was zero.
The more we're assured, the more I'm afraid.
You have to read about newspapers to believe that a risk may go away.
It's weak to see three weak but nothing.
Finally, it is a scientific reality, more a virus is rapidly mortal (generally) less likely to repent because the death of the host means its own death.
The combination of 2 (high transmission and rapid death) sometimes comes from the flu called Spanish.
Apres c is the general 40th century to save mankind. ..
There is nothing objectionable to pre-meditatives of certain well-being and virtues, but to the destruction of thousands of other African diseases that were not known to the metire, to the beard, or to the vertus?
This, of course, highlights the action of NGOs and encourages them to help them, but repeated announcements are a terrible participation.
Freedom of expression, so much loved by conservationists.
The suspension was to keep doctors under control.
I ask how many doctors have voted for Newman and Abbott, brothers of arms against freedom of expression and the right to the private life of Australians.
I hope they never imagined that their five conservatives would have deprived them of their rights to freedom of expression.
I wonder how many doctors voted for Newman and Abbott,
I guess there's someone who won't do it next time.
Yes, that is exactly what we need right now, less health professionals available during a potential health crisis.
A hot turn for when the problem becomes really out of control.
There are no more doctors working in the regions around Australia like this.
Tony Abbott's refusal to take part in the "war" against Ebola illustrates his philosophy regarding medical challenges.
Joe Hockey's plan for a new Medical Research Market Fund, which should reach $20 billion by 2020, would probably be just a black emergency case for the budget.
Using the noble medical research perspective, it will collect $20 billion and, at a later date, transfer these funds as a general income.
I hope that Australian voters will see this great Russian for what it is.
Tony Abbott is much smarter than we don't want to believe him.
He explained that the sale of Medibank Private is compensated by the Term Markets Fund for medical research.
However, it is a loss for the sick, a loss for the elderly and a loss for the poor people who have returned.
It may be very smart, but it's not fair.
Finally, the "false ringer" and his Telstra Market Fund were excellent guardians.
If that's not fair, then let's show Abbott who's smart.
Send him in hell to the next election.
The most terrible thing for Nadine is even the "old personality" you know....
I've also noticed it, quite corrosive as notice.
If only he could have prevented her from holding a bug on her constantly..
The worst destination for a career policy: not to be recognised in the street.
Welcome She has not been recognized in her city of Toul as being sufficiently high to manage it.
What a good "provincial" sense of good!
We live a time of hate, Mrs. Morano.
I'm sure I'm against the port of Burqa, but that's not the question.
What this anecdotes tells is sarcosism in the pure state: a minority of mediocres with a rank of ministers, confusion between the government function and the execution function (if it could, Sarkozy would come with his tofa on each side of the road to show that he is well-guarded by public order), the magnitude and discretion of their maximum degree.
I propose that the right be granted to Morano, Sarkozy and all these "old personalities" who have become lost in carrying out a fire weapon and a sign, which would thus have failed to perform their self-proclaimed role as judges.
But who's Nadine Romano?
This is indeed the main teaching of the matter: even the police have turned the Sarkozy page, perhaps not even regretting it.
He really needs to stop before he gets mad for it.
I want this agent who would ignore Nadine Morano's existence, if only I could do the same...
like Bob, for the cup
I don't agree, thanks to her we're well adjusted...!
Nadine, if she didn't exist, he'd have to invent it!
It's easy, however, it looks like Christine Boutin with a blonde purple.
What a blow, N.
Morano clearly did in the misprincipal, in the contempt of the police officer she faced, and who would undoubtedly have had to multiply the curves and the "Yes, ma'am, of course Madame, all of a sudden, tell me Madame in which direction I must run to catch myself without waiting for this wild woman."
"In one case, the Australian Super Hornets left an air attack on a target of Isis when the risk of killing civilians became too important..."
The Americans aren't bad about it, but I think even though Isis is going to pass them or have already done it in Iraq, at least one of the bodies here is not doing it.
As for the civilian deaths at the industrial level, nothing matches the Western war machine.
I do not agree that the sanctions imposed by the United Nations (including non-West) between the two wars of Iraq would have cost millions of Iraqis, especially children, older persons and vulnerable adults.
Most of the anti-war protesters I knew preferred sanctions against the "war machine".
Are you also the kind of guy who prefers sanctions to order and men on the ground?
Very good note - the United Nations has been acting incredibly hard and unconsiderable in recent years.
Sanctions are generally ineffective and are not able to touch the elite - no doubt one reason why they have the occasional approval of the Security Council itself.
You may remember that the insurgents have not lost time to mark their main enemy when they saw him in the recent war in Iraq.
It was the attack on the United Nations Mission in QG that they were five days older than in Baghdad in 2003.
They hit this place with force and two times and I imagine with satisfaction and cold blood.
As brutal and hard as this bombing was, I was surprised by the shock of people to know that a United Nations mission had been targeted like this.
Well, note, I've actually forgotten this.
Therefore, add one half million people to the total number of deaths of Western nations (at least with recent problems in Ukraine, economic activity was directed directly at those who were intent to harm them).
This does not help your argument but to exaggerate the widely untrustworthy statistics.
The same vaguely reliable figures for deaths related to sanctions are those of children under 5 years of age and are even very suspicious because Saddam Hussain refused to allow inspectors to see the facts.
Of course, it was in his interest to exaggerate the negative effects of sanctions.
The most reliable estimate is that the number of additional deaths for this age group is between 200,000 and 400,000, but no one really knows.
As for additional deaths in other age groups, estimates are no better than assumptions.
Since the number of pre-mortem deaths in at least five years was about 10 times higher than in the United Kingdom, for example, it is possible that the number of post-mortem deaths is widely shared with this age group.
Of course he needs to be afraid of it, but also the gift of gambling in general.
It must be stopped as if people were pure spirits, that love was all that children needed, and that they could be treated with strangers that neither parent nor child could ever know, without any consequences for them.
One of our fundamental myths is Oedipe, 60% of the French are genetically derived.
It's an essential and disgusting thing to know its origins.
Instead of making it as if it were obvious and using fantastic arguments, we should explain what serious problems may arise for a child who is adopted or designed with a gift of gamma.
If you learn that your parents who raised you didn't provide the games you're out of, you could give it back to me because they wouldn't have committed any crime.
The latest developments in PMA (e.g. virus seizures) are at least as discussable as a reasonably framed GPA.
The real question seems to me to be: the frustration of the desire of children is justified by these acrobats and this has nothing to do with marriage for all.
Very just as a point.
Of course, GPA should be scared, which is what this stupid question is.
Of course, it's sad that we can't have children when we want them.
It's a problem I've met with my husband.
However, it is less serious than being born very disabled or becoming sick, contracting a serious disease, losing all its children in an accident, etc.
Of all the concerns of life this is not the most serious.
It's a frustration among many others.
That doesn't stop you from living.
And we can always take care of other children!
In a society that no longer supports any form of frustration, where the child becomes well-consumed, GPA is unacceptable to me.
The desire for a child is not a trap where another can be used according to his good will.
The stereotyping requires reflection and acceptance.
