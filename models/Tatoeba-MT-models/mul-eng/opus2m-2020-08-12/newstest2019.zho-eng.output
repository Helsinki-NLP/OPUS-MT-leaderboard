According to British media, U.S. Navy Deputy Minister for War, William Morlan, would say that even when the US Navy is revitalising its forces to respond to increasingly worrying Russians on both sides of the Atlantic, the United States will continue to expand its area – the fifth floor extending its scope to include the Indian-Asian-Pacific region – as the focus of the Navy.
According to the British "Principal Protection Week" website, on 24 September, the United States placed central Russia as a strategic competitor in the new defence strategy that was published in the first year.
Following that, the US Navy resumed its second round in order to directly oppose Russian activities.
It was reported that these movements raised some doubts and concerns among allies and analysts, who were concerned that the U.S. Navy might be away from marking the "Asian again" strategy of the Government of Obama.
But Morland would say that the United States Navy remains the focus of the West Pacific.
At a round table on 24 January 2018 organized by the National Asian Research Agency in Washington, U.S.A., he said: " There has been no significant change for us. "
Moran says: " The focus is still more balanced, moving more attention or whatever you want to describe it. "
But he admits that the United States is close to Europe.
He said: " We will continue to be concerned about the growth of the West Sea and balance what we can do. "
Although he noted that the overall policy on Russia was within the scope of the mandate of the Minister of Defence of the United States, he warned: " Russians may face the challenges of population and economics, but history proves that if we have a conflict with them, they will be very strong. "
Moran would say that, as part of the United States action against Russia, China and other competitors in the East, the United States Navy is actively deploying troops as a " new combat model " , which will help to prevent the attackers from deploying United States combatants or other assets at any given time and place.
He said: "Our Navy and the Marine Army support it -- a concept of unpredictable warfare, not once again appearing in the same place, almost as we did -- is our practice. "
It was reported that this new approach was the first attempt by the Hari Durumen Navy team, whose early deployment included visits to the work of ports and patrolling areas that were normally adopted.
Moran said that the U.S. Navy was currently working to ensure that allies knew that these troops would remain in traditional regional patrols and that they would also address logistical and family communications issues for new deployment procedures.
In this event, the Australian Royal Navy Commander, Michael Nunu, will also make a statement that the Australian Army can work together with U.S. Navy combat groups.
He said that the situation would continue as Australia's Royal Navy plans to repurchasing 9 ships equipped with "Cuss" as a protection against the war system.
On 5 October, many airlines moved or recovered fuel additional charges.
Yesterday, OCCA declared that since 5 October 2018, domestic aviation fuel would be additional 800 km (containing) for each of the passengers on the following routes and more than 800 km for each passenger.
As of 5 October 2018, OCCA announced that it would receive additional charges for domestic aviation fuel from 10 dollars/up to 20 kg/s and more than 800 km/s from 10 dollars/up to 30 dollars/s per passenger from 10 to 30 km/s per passenger from 10 km/s from 5 October 2018.
Children, the military police remain $10/person; children continue to be exempt.
According to the operator concerned, the air carrier has indicated in the notice that the receipt of fuel supplements is not sufficient for the date of the initial vote and that fuel supplements are not reimbursed when the customer is replaced.
This means that domestic airfarers who voted before 5 October shall not be charged additional fuel in accordance with new standards if they want to change to 5 October (containing).
Since 5 June 2018, several airlines, such as OCCA, have recovered additional domestic fuel for three years and have been eligible for 10 dollars/persons.
This time, the Okay Air Force had announced an additional fuel flow rate for the first time, as a journalist, and had not yet been informed of any further adjustments in the domestic air.
It was also understood that Hong Kong Civil Aviation Service provided that air carriers could decide whether to collect additional fuel from them in November.
It was announced earlier on 27 September that additional fuel would be recovered on 2 November.
The Thai National Aviation Web site shows that all Thai-Thai-Taigon aircraft issued or reissued on or after 2 November would include additional fuel charges for long-term flights to Hong Kong and South-South Pacific regions, North America, Europe, the Middle East and India, Africa's aviation, and the additional fuel requirements for 652 dollars and the short-way range of 146 dollars.

In May 2016, in Tokyo, Japan, a man went to the Red Cross Society headquarters.
The Red Cross said that the U.S. coal sector was high under trade shock flags and that it had suspended its financial transactions in agriculture.
A number of heavy equipment manufacturers in Japan have been warned about the impact of the Central American trade motifs, such as the publication of the latest performance by telecommunications companies, and are now included in the series.
The United States and China have been threatened by the United States and the United States of America's President Tranquo, who, if unable to resolve the dispute, has to expand the scope of the taxation to a total of $50 billion in Chinese exports of US goods.
Isuyoshi Hachimura, financial director of Isuyoshi, said that the future trade dispute could have a greater impact on China ' s economy.
The Ivorian trader and the Thai Abbey Group have invested $1 billion in 2015 and has access to 20 per cent of its units.
Hachimura stated that the Ivorian business held a loss of $143.3 billion ($13 billion) for this part of the unit, as it believed that the price of the Central Trust Unit would not be reimbursed in the near future.
Ivorian business maintains a profit forecast for the financial year ended 31 March 2019 at around 5 billion days.
In July China added 25 per cent of import duties to the United States of America to counter the initiative in the Moors trade.
"Our livestock business has been attacked by the American trade molluscs," said the Ministry of Red Cross.
He said that he had stopped his own financial transactions since September.

On 5 November, the new Internet electronics consolidated reports that the US mid-term vote has been taken into account.
On 4 November, President Tranup and the Democratic Party voted against their core voters.
Both parties pointed out that the voter voting rate would be key to the left-hand choice.
It was reported that, at 48 hours before the vote of the people of the United States, Tranun was widely attended by candidates from the community party, and former President Obama arrived in Indiana, where he was invited to the election by the Federal Assembly of Democrats (Joe Donnelly) to the polling station and finally appealed to the public before the election.
On 4 November, Tranun went to Mége, Georgia, as the candidate for the President of the Party, Brian Kemp, who said: " You have to go to the polling station on Tuesday, you have to vote. "
"It's impossible for this election to be more clear. "
The political enthusiasm of the voters has increased to a high level, and some states have voted too often.
The President of the United States of America has been elected during the first period, and the seats of the national parliamentarians of his political party have often been reduced.
According to the New People's Movement published in Washington Posts and the U.S. Press Network (ABC News) 4, while the elections of the Federal Assembly of Democrats are still preferable, the common party can benefit from economic assessments and strict concerns about border security at the Tranou border.

According to analysts at the FuveThirtyExight.com website, the potential for the public councils is 85 per cent high.
The National Political Coalition was held in the Near Plenary, a seminar on key ideas on strengthening and improving people's political cooperation.
The National Political Association held a seminar on the importance of strengthening and improving the political cooperation of peoples at the General Assembly in Beijing from 29 to 30 May.

In order to take this important idea seriously, to take into account its importance, its richness and spiritual nature, and to make real progress in learning to do what is really right, to learn the concepts, to improve the quality of the work of armed promoters of politics, and to effectively carry out new missions of the new generation of peoples' political associations.
On 29-30 September, the National Political Association held a seminar on key ideas on strengthening and improving public political collaboration in Beijing.
He noted that since the 18th anniversary of the party's recent General Assembly, he had presented a series of new ideas on strengthening and improving public political cooperation, the first of which was a major channel of socialist consultation and a special consultative body, an important component of the national governance system, a special system with China's system, the first of which highlighted the characteristics and advantages of the new political party system, emphasised the correct handling of the relationship of the people's democracy, and emphasized that it was a good deal of compromise, and that the public's case was the logical link between the "government of China" and the political system of China, and that the development of the people's political cohesion system was the most recent result of the party ' s political consensus.
He stressed that political associations at all levels, in terms of theoretical learning, were a tool for further research into weaknesses and weaknesses in the work of political collaboration, and called for a break-up of efforts to strengthen and improve.
In order to fully strengthen the construction of the political partners ' parties, it is essential to ensure that central decision-making processes are deployed without compromising compliance with the political partners ' work.
In order to strengthen the political orientation of thought, to improve the system, procedures and mechanisms for the implementation of the political orientation of the word ' s capital and synergy ' , to implement the political orientation in all aspects and processes of the performance process.

On 5 November, the People ' s Network of Beijing (the Royal Bank) began to focus more and more on patent development and related protection work, deepening the potential value of patents and becoming the dominant authority of the market.
Similarly, a number of technological enterprises have experienced minor violations in terms of patent technology authorizations, such as patent technology use.
By the end of 2017, the defence from the province of Pratio, where three persons were charged with patent violations, will be executed by the "APP Developer's Small Sciences Limited Company (hereinafter referred to as the Small Sciences"), the operator's "Technology Limited" (hereinafter referred to as the "Technology"), the company's "Technology Limited (hereinafter referred to as the "Technology"), and the limited Internet Information Service of the Whole Pacific (hereinafter referred to as the East Pacific) against the Court of Public Information Rights.
Three prosecutors requested court order, and three accused immediately ceased manufacturing, selling, selling and using the expertise of the accused.
On 30 October 2018, the Chinese court document ' s network of judges published " defences, attacks by small and medium-sized companies such as Beijing's small-scale technology firm " , revealing some of the cases involving the APP accused of patent violations.
The third complainant considers that the "car service system based on the move-out terminal and the " patented patent owner and inventor" method, while the "extraordinary" operation of "APP" aircraft, as a whole, is a response to the technical programme for the protection of patents in the case, constitutes a violation of the patent.
However, during the Court ' s decision, the small-scale scientific expertise was of the opinion that the Pacific Ocean was not an adequate accused, which provided free download of the APP ' s case on the web only and did not implement the case ' s expert approach without direct or indirect violations and should not be included in the case.
Secondly, the case is not in the East in violation of the law.
In accordance with the rule of law, the violation of the jurisdiction of the court should be carried out in the place of full implementation of the technique of the case and therefore requested the transfer of the case to the local court of the accused, namely the Beijing Court of intellectual property.
The Court of Informed Rights of the United States considers that the accused has provided APP products for alleged rape on its network platform and that the accused is not inappropriate in the Pacific of the accused.
The accused is also located in the city of the state of the province, within the jurisdictional area of the Court of intellectual property of the state.
The defendant claimed that the case had been transferred to the Beijing Court of intellectual property, on the basis of insufficient grounds, rejected the objections made by the small-scale technical firm of the accused against the jurisdiction of the case and taken into account the costs incurred in the cases of jurisdiction.
Other proceedings in the present case have not yet been published, and the press will also pay close attention to the follow-up to the case of patent violations.
Visiting Chief Executive Officer of the Australian Federal Science and Industrial Research Organization: outstanding results of scientific cooperation in Australia
" China ' s scientific technology has developed rapidly over the past few decades, and both Australia ' s countries have joined in the field of science and are able to achieve the desired results. "
The Australian Federal Science and Industrial Research Organization, the Chief Executive Officer of the Australian Federation of Science and Industry Studies, Lari Mašel, in Beijing before receiving a new social journalist's visit, said that cooperation from climate change to "day" project, with cooperation in the field of science and technology in Australia, was an excellent tool.
As the largest national scientific research institution in the Australian Federation, CSIRO has gained many innovative research results for world-wide purposes in the areas of ocean, energy, bio, materials and space.
CSIRO has maintained close cooperation with science institutions such as the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
"This is a long-term friendship, which includes the tradition of trust and long-term cooperation with partners."
In May this year, China ' s 500-metre-point satellite radio remote — " China ' s Day Eye " — was installed at the first 19-block L-point receiver on the international front.
This is the most advanced 19-block source receiver on the international scene, developed jointly by middle Australian scientists.
Marshall stated that the successful development of the receivers was based on the CSIRO ' s multi-year technical accumulation and that, following the launch of the FAST cycle, it would increase 5 to 6 times, while further scientific observation objectives would be developed.
"This is a force that CSIRO contributed to FAST."
In addition to the above-mentioned cooperation, CSIRO has close cooperation with the Chinese Institute for Science and Technology in the area of the construction of a four-mile range of satellites and the development of new fuel technologies, which can reduce emissions.
" Previous scientific research is often a matter of over a hundred years, and there is a need for more scientific research efforts to solve the problem that lies ahead. "
In his view, two Australian countries were complementary in the field of scientific development, while both faced a number of challenges in development.
For example, extreme weather on a global scale has led to droughts and floods that have led to food shortages, and food shortages have seriously affected human development.
At the same time, the problems of population explosions, ageing and chronic illness are also a serious challenge.
" Cooperation between the two countries in Australia in recent years is mainly focused on solving these problems. "
He explained that CSIRO and the International South-South Pacific Research Centre for Ocean Science and Technology, which was built together with the National Institute for Ocean Science and Technology, focused on monitoring the phenomenon of El Niño and Larna, studying the relationship between the two and extreme weather and establishing emergency warning facilities; CSIRO could also alleviate food shortages caused by extreme weather.
" In the current environment, technology innovation is difficult to complete on its own and requires very high costs and many problems to be addressed, so cooperation is particularly important today. "
Marshall stated that cooperation would be more closely possible to achieve fragmented progress, which would also mean strengthening cooperation between the two sides of Australia within the "one-way" framework.
" Strengthening bilateral cooperation is primarily scientific cooperation for us. "
For example, in the case of Mahalalel, CSIRO has recently developed a gold mining law that is not used for pesticides, which is very serious because of traditional mining gold mining legislation against the environment, and many countries hope to find a gold mining method for environmental pollution.
"We are willing to introduce this technology into China, which is one of the results we have participated in in 'one way' cooperation. "

The Korean Foreign Minister Liquor stated to the United Nations that the continued implementation of the sanctions would not be possible for Korea to abandon nuclear weapons on its own in such a case.
At the United Nations General Assembly, Lilongwe stated that last year Korea had adopted " very friendly practices " , including the cessation of missiles and nuclear tests, the elimination of nuclear testing sites and its commitment to the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"But we didn't see any corresponding response from the United States," he said.
" If we don't trust the United States, our national security will not be trusted, and in this case we will not be able to give up arms once and for all. "
Although Lilongwe was the time to repeat its complaint against the United States of America against "the phase" of nuclearization, his words were significant because it was not as in the past as in Korea and completely refused to nuclearize.
Lilongwe referred to the joint statement of 12 June Kinsain and Tranpus, which was at the time when Kinsain agreed to work towards nuclearization on the Korean peninsula, and Tranupi promised to protect the security of Korea.
Korea has been seeking to officially end the Korean War of 1950-53, but the United States has stated that it must first abandon nuclear weapons.
The United States also refuses to relax its demands for international sanctions against Korea.
"The United States ' continued to ' nuclearization ' , and increased sanctions to achieve its objective in a high-pressure manner, even refusing to declare 'the end of the war ' , " Lilongwe stated.
"The idea that sanctions can cause us to complain is that we don't know what our people are dreaming about.
But the problem is that such persistent sanctions are deepening our mistrust. "
Lilongwe did not mention the second financial plan mentioned earlier this week in the United Nations by the President of the United States.
On the contrary, he stressed that China and the President of Korea had met three times in the past five months and said: " If the other party that went to nuclear is Korea rather than Korea, nuclearization would not be so persistent. "
China declared that since 1 November 2018 it has reduced import duties for 1585 tax purposes.
Since this year, China has taken the initiative to reduce import duties.
This year, on 1 May, total import duties will be adjusted to zero for all conventional anticancer medicinal products and biodegradable biodegradable medicinal products, including anticancer medicinal products.
At the same time, the production of anticancer drugs has been significantly reduced and the import value of taxable income increases.
On 1 July, a reduction in the duty rate for 218 vehicles and spare parts.
After tax reductions, the Chinese vehicle-wide rate has been lower than the average level of developing countries and is in actual conformity with the Chinese car industry.
This reduction will promote industrial structural adjustment and resource optimisation, speed up excellence and help improve the quality of products and services, and is expected to contribute to a certain degree to vehicle price adjustment and make consumers more effective.
Consumer tax fell on 1 July for 1449 tax purposes.
Day-to-day consumption taxes are related to the need for a comfortable life for people.
This tax reduction is not only large and strong but also 56 per cent on average.
Day-to-day consumption taxes directly benefit consumers and promote competitiveness in the domestic industry.
On 1 November, taxes will be imposed on mechanical electrical equipment for 1585 tax purposes, industrial goods such as spare parts and raw materials.
Appropriate reductions in import tariffs for domestically-industrial goods can attract more external resources, contribute to increasing effective domestic supply, contribute to industrial growth while helping businesses to adjust resources globally, reduce production costs, and reduce pressures on the domestic environment.
The Office of the Committee on Taxation of the State Office of China introduced a description of the managers of the previous four independent tax reductions and the third phase of the extension of the negotiations under the information technology agreement on 1 July this year will result in a reduction of China ' s overall rate of duty by 9.8% to 7.5 per cent last year.
The post-adjusted overall level of tariffs is slightly higher than the EU, which is lower than most developing countries, at the medium-lowest level, and is fundamentally aligned with the status and development phase of developing countries in China.
The Heads indicated that the overall level of duty as an important indicator of openness in the area of trade in goods in China should be adapted to the economic development phase in China and reflect contemporary characteristics.
China ' s global trade in goods has already had a more open economic base, but there is still a gap between the quality and benefits of trade development and the developed economies and should therefore be adequately reduced in the overall level of tariffs.
Customs are a common means of protection, and tariff levels should be adapted to industrial competitiveness, encouraging good competition and excessive protection against industrial development and improving quality.
Tax rates are adjusted to take into account production needs and consumption needs.
Focusing on reducing domestic demand and contributing to the increase in commodity tax rates in industrial transformation, efforts to increase the import of special preferential products that are more focused on the population ' s needs, to increase the growing awareness of businesses and the public and to meet the increasing needs of industrial structures and consumer structures.
The reduction of tax forces should take into account the acceptable capacity of financial income and industrial development.
In specific options for reducing taxable goods and reducing tax levels, better coordination of two domestic markets is required, on both sides of the journey, to produce and consume two relationships and to maintain a positive development trend in China ' s economic stability.
The Heads stressed that this year was the 40th anniversary of reform, and China's initiative to reduce the overall level of import tariffs was an important initiative undertaken in response to China ' s own high-quality development needs, facilitating the integrated use of two resources outside the international country to promote the quality of the domestic supply system and meeting the needs of the population ' s consumption levels.
This action and initiative indicated that China would firmly support economic globalization and maintain the principle of free trade and the central multilateral trading system of WTO, continue to build on development motivation from the openness of the world and make China's development more beneficial to the world.
Serbia announced its entry into the highest level of equipment. The President of Séo will discuss the situation in Kosovo tomorrow.
The South-West Association appealed to the Office of the President of Serbia ' s Office that, in view of the way the Kosovo Special Forces occupied the Gaza Strip in northern Kosovo under the control of Belgrade, it was directed by the Serbian President ' s army to enter the country ' s armed forces into the highest military situation.
On 29 September, the Minister of Defence of Serbia said that the Serbian army had entered the full-time equipment situation.
He stressed that Serbia would continue to monitor the current situation in Kosovo as long as the orders issued by the U.S. Army remained valid.
According to the Russian Federation report, on 29 September, Vuchić indicated that he had been informed of the current situation with other European parties, such as the United States, and would go to Moscow on 2 October to meet with the Russian President Putin and seek support on the issue of Kosovo.
When asked whether Serbia needed military support from Russia like Syria, Vuchić replied with a negative response: " I do not want a major military conflict on our territory. "
VUC also indicated that the military would enter into a comprehensive armed situation only to create a threat to prevent conflict, but it was also a clear warning: no violence would ever be tolerated in Kosovo.
As a result of the military's improvement of the equipment situation, two major initiatives in Kosovo are related.
According to Serbia ' s side, the Albanians have recently been under massive arrest for generations of Serbs living in the region of the northern region of Kosovo, and these Serbs who have been arrested have not been subject to any law.
It is surprising that since 26 March this year, Al-Qaida has been arrested and arrested by the Kosovo Army, the head of the Kosovo and Metohija Office of the Government of Serbia, has continued to improve the situation in the region and has been subjected to unhindered arrest and expulsion from Serbs.
In addition, more than 100 armed police and attackers from the Ministry of the Interior of the Republic of Kosovo, which had previously been declared on their own day, occupied a position near the Gaza Strip, entering the ecological and sports centres near the northern edge of the Kosovo region, and blocked all roads near them, which were controlled by Serbia.
Vuchić noted that this military risk action in Kosovo was carried out under the auspices of the Western States and that the operations of the Kosovo army had not previously notified Serbia of violations of Chapter IX of the Brussels Agreement and of military technical agreements between United Nations Council resolution 1244 and Seko.
Vuchić has spoken to the Secretary-General of the North York, St. George Beg, to criticize the false statements by Western countries on the issue of Kosovo.
The root cause of the conflict is the fact that hundreds of years of history between the two tribes of Seaa in the Kosovo region.
With regard to Kosovo ' s inheritance, Serbs and Arabs have different words.
Serbia saw Kosovo as a national refuge and cultural haven, as Serbia had established its most powerful country here in the 12th century, but the Arab had only entered a large number after the invasion of the Ottoman state and the defeat of the army.
The Arab also maintained that the original tribe of Ilyrians who lived in Kosovo from 4 to 5 centuries ago were the ancestors of the Arabs, and thus Kosovo had been the territory of the Arabs since then.
The topical political division has led to ethnic and religious and cultural conflicts and has led to strong opposition to Serbs and Arabs in the Kosovo region.
In 1912 the Kosovo Arabs first declared their independence from Albania.
After the first world war, a large number of Arab people living in the Balkans moved to Turkey, with Serbs growing considerably higher and Serbs appear to be “only taking their own land” and being considered by the Arab to be the "Asserbiaism", and both ethnic sensitization.
Kosovo became the " Firearms " of the Balkans.
In 1999, the armed conflict between the Albanian separatists of the Kosovo Liberation Army and the Serbian army and the police led to the bombing of the NATO army against the South Union comprising Serbia and Montenegro and the outbreak of the Kosovo war.
On 17 February 2008, Kosovo unilaterally declared independence from Serbia.
Although Serbia will then communicate information on normalization of relations with Kosovo and sign a global and legally binding agreement, it is not possible to sign a multilateral agreement with the benefit of the historical nation and the geopolitical dividend.
However, a month ago, Vuchić first made it clear that he had advocated the separation of Serbs and Arabs in Kosovo and that he had reopened the dispute between the two parties.
The electrical communications are still being interrupted.
According to the figures published by UNIDIR on the 30th of June, a severe earthquake and tsunami in the Sulawesi province of the country had resulted in 420 deaths.
According to William Rampangilei, head of the Indian Disaster Relief Agency, this figure is only the initial statistics of the city of Pupalu, the city of Central Sulawesi, about 80 km away, because of the lack of substantial rescue equipment that many of the city's hotels, shops and warehouses have not survived.
Local time, on 29 September 2018, Indonesia's Bar, a series of blast blasts destroyed by earthquakes and tsunamis.
Because of the severe destruction of electricity and communications facilities, there are still unconnected " island " areas in the vicinity of the Himalayas and nearby areas of the Himalayas, which are unable to record the number of victims.
Meanwhile, the media reported that the number of people or thousands of people were claimed by the Vice-President of Indonesia to be dead.
Power interruptions, communication interruptions, road interruptions, airport damage... and disaster relief work after the sea.
Because of the power cuts, some hospitals and relief facilities in the city of Palu needed fuel generation.
The road to the city, however, was blocked by the mountain peaks, including the oil tankers, which were unable to access large vehicles and made fuel supply very tense.
The Ministry of Social Affairs of Indonesia stated that, because of road damage, the Ministry had not yet transported emergency relief areas such as beds, beds, shoes, clothing, food and household supplies from nearby areas.
Disaster relief materials transported from the capital of Jakarta are being transported through air carriers to disaster areas.
In view of the damage suffered by the Palu airport command boards and routes in the earthquake, all commercial flights have been stopped and military aircraft for the purpose of transporting relief materials and personnel have been dropped.
In Indonesia's relief policy, the integrated minister of law and security requested that electricity supply and airport business services be restored as soon as possible in order to ensure the operation of relief agencies such as the hospital and to enable more rescue personnel and volunteers to transport relief materials to disaster areas.
On 28 January, the Sulawesi Province of Indonesia continued to experience a number of severe earthquakes, resulting in an earthquake at 7:7 p.m. on the local level of 17.02 p.m., resulting in a major disaster in the city of Palu, Cúgara, and in the Western Hemisphere.
In New York City on October 1st (the press) air-flowing as well as air-conditioning, air-conditioning, and a full-fledged day ... ... ...In the near future, Beijing will continue to launch the most beautiful blue-day model, and will attract thousands of people to the social platform, and will be happy in continuing painting, which is called "The Blue-Blue Line," which is the best list of Beijing's " .
Since August, Beijing has come to " the bluest sky " .
In Tokyo, people can always see or use a cell phone or take photos of a single anti-circuit camera.
On social platforms, such as M.O.S.S.A., you can always see the origins of your friends' head, the sky, the birds, and the birds... all buildings look different under the shadow of the blue sky.
There are net friends who say that such a "high-lighted picture" is the best city advertising in Beijing; there are netizens who say that if such a weather is long gone, people will get better; there are more netizens who hope that "the blues will be more warmer and more warmer for the day in Beijing."
What's the big day for the people of Beijing?
It is only because of the suffering of people living in this city who have suffered in the past, who are suffering from extreme weather, and who are fighting " the Blue War " , who are constantly improving the quality of air, who are becoming more and more blue and who are seeing the happiness of the people in their eyes.
On the day of the national party, Beijing was a good day.
At eight o'clock in the morning, the vast majority of 35 air quality monitoring stations throughout the city showed the green "level superiors".
The "Most Bluest Sky" film show on social media platforms is still continuing.
Why is it so blue in Beijing recently?
According to the relevant authorities of the Beijing City Environmental Protection Agency, in August this year, Beijing's microchip (PM2.5) averages 35 micrometres/litres and has created the best record for a period of almost five years.
The actual volume of PM2.5 between September is more frequent than the number of positions.
A major factor in the phenomenon of the "most blue sky" is the overall benefits of the recent climate conditions, and more importantly, Beijing's climate pollution management has been in progress over the past five years, with the continued release of air-cleaning plans of environmental benefits and reducing the total emissions of pollutants in the region, which have provided a basis for continuous improvement in air quality.
Beijing officially published and implemented " Clean Air Action Plan 2013-2017 " in Beijing in 2013.
According to the plan, the official continued to guide non-heading operations to promote energy cleanup and pollution reduction efforts, with total fuel consumption of 4923 people.
Beijing also became the first major cities to achieve global natural gas generation in China.
Data show that Beijing's PM2.5 average annual levels have decreased by 35.6 per cent between 2013 and 2017; air quality indicators have increased by 50 days; high-level levels have increased by 25 days; total number of re-infection days have decreased by 35 days and the rate of re-infection has declined significantly.
At the same time as continued air quality improvement, Beijing official analysis based on a new source of PM2.5 released in September this year ' s plan of action for " Combating the Three-year War against Blue War " , combined with the current governance phase and pollution characteristics of oil-consuming vehicles, fuelling vehicles, operating organic governance, improving transport structures, industrial structures, energy structures and land use structures, strengthening the regional Union's commitment to strengthening urban detail management, promoting global green development, seeking to make "the most blue sky" permanent in Tokyo, not " as a source of wealth " .
During this year's golden week, the relevant sectors of the City Commission, business, city administration, public security, etc. will strengthen law enforcement checks on "one day" markets, combine tourism with "six" distortions, and, once the offender is verified, he will be severely punished by law.
Yesterday morning, the city government convened a series of "an illegal day" themes and deployed specific actions aimed at further serious "a day" illegal.
The "Six" disturbances on the interconnected "black" link between blacks, blacks, blacks, blacks, blacks, blacks, blacks and blacks" were revealed, and the city launched a special campaign on 28 July.
The specific action has so far been undertaken, 39 complaints received from "one day" throughout the city, 63 per cent from 63 per cent; 270 complaints from "one day" have been received from the whole city since this year, and 62 per cent from 62 per cent from "one day".
In almost two months, the whole city has seen "black car" 248, 158 traffic violations, 29 purchases "black shop" and the theater, 27 black company "13 " , 27 " black " people", 26 million "abstaining illegal advertising, 31 million "days" advertising, 3rd public holiday tickets, 1789 traffic violations, 181 cases, 448 million serious penalties, 111 persons in detention.
Under the rule of order, the illegal "day of the "day" is basically controlled, and the "day of the "day" market is in a stable position.
It has been reported that in recent years the city has continued to increase its corporate power over the illegal "one-day journey".
In 2016 and 2017, the City Tourism Commission received a "one-day" complaint of 1612 and 897, with a reduction of 79 per cent and 44 per cent respectively, but the "one-day" was still ongoing, often counter-blowing, and created a "six-black" distortion of mutual interest links such as black, black, black, black, black and black.
In particular, street illegal customers are " blacklisted " , " blacknet " , " blacknet " , " travel agency or non-trafficking company property " , " black company " , " black company " , " black company " , " black company " without leading evidence or contravention of the law-enforcement industry , " black " , " car with non-trafficking property or " illegal " travel services for a day " , " black vehicle " , and eventually they bring the designated travel shopping store they brought into it " black shop " .
In this specific operation, the city continued to increase its regular inspection and mobile monitoring of illegal "one day" and to detect violations of evidence from a strict legal basis following a day of illegal "a " high-speed and high-impact tourist routes.
Among them, the "black car" and "black shop" have become two serious focusses in the special operations.
It is reported that without a black car, an illegal "day of journey" could not be carried out, that the black car was easily discovered, stored and searched, and that it was a fixed asset of a higher value.
The relevant sector uses road traffic surveillance to explore more control of road traffic on the " one-day journey" line, using technology and technology tools such as defence, as well as when it detects " black vehicle " .
The "black shop" purchase of travel goods has become a serious focus because of the limited number of business and sit-in.
In order to strengthen the threat and fight against illegal "a day " , the functional sectors are severely punished by law if they are found guilty of violations of the law.
This year, in August of this year, the city also held a seminar on the issue of the law of serious illegal "days " and on measures related to administrative penalties and criminal offences.
The City Tourism Commission indicated that more formal travel companies would be encouraged in the future to provide Beijing "one day " and to extend one day " a day" to further cover the living space "one day" of illegal tourism, and the current specific programme is also under research.
In addition, the City Tourism Commission has continued to improve the mission ' s electronic programme information system to ensure that each team is integrated into the control of the electronic schedule.
From a travel sign to a digital economic sign, what have these years experienced?
As a permanent address to the World Internet General Assembly, how Uu has taken advantage of the summit and is being taken into consideration.
Since the beginning of the first World Internet Conference, the change in the town has been seen in five years.
In 2014, only 12 businesses related to the digital economy were located throughout the city, and by the third quarter of this year, over 500 were already located.
This is a summary of the U.S. digital economy.
The convening of the Internet General Assembly to allow local enterprises to be separated from the digital economy, digitalized gadgets, the desire for enterprise transformation upgrades is very strong, and traditional manufacturing companies have increased their inputs and development in terms of machine exchanges, wisdom management, etc.
The Utown Party Committee notes that the future of Uu City will create a new economic energy centre.
The development of the digital economy is not open to infrastructure.
This year, Utown launched 5G pilot work on the basis of the implementation of the 4G communications network and free WiFi.
At the same time, the urban cities in Utah are also a hotbed for the development of Internet industry.
Since the first World Internet Conference, there has been a total investment of $377.25 million in 565 million in digital economics projects, with a total of 87.3 million in the three-month period preceding this year, with an increase of 13 per cent compared to the increase.
"In the past Uu was a tourist symbol, and then more plays and cultural symbols. Because of the Internet Congress, it is now becoming an Internet and digital economy symbol."
In the view of the UNMOVIC, it was important to build a platform with more people, projects, technology, and inputs from elements such as the World Internet Conference on Red.
In the 20 years since the Internet General Assembly had concluded that it had been working abroad, it had been back in business.
On 2 December last year, he took a high-quality digitalization technology solution and went to the fourth Internet-based World Cup and was awarded the award to several clients.
It's not just because we're home and home, but it's easier than I thought, and our applications are fast and we're in the U.S. Autostop project. "
One Utown Street has shown the impact of the Internet General Assembly.
This article is followed by a road in the north-eastern part of the country, not only by a tourist view, but also by an industrial road.
On its basis, the U.S. Road Section was born to collect areas for transport.
Newspapers have learned that in the future, Utown Street will become the capital of the development of the mining industry, with a high level of use of smart medicine, old ageing, smart governance, and a high-level population of GDP80 per cent of the city.
Indonesia's terrorist attack has caused at least 410 deaths.
According to the Director-General for Public Information of the Public Information Office of the People ' s Republic of India, no. 29 stated that the earthquake in the province of Sulawesi had now resulted in 410 deaths, 97 of which had been confirmed.
There were 29 missing, 540 injured.
The Palu airport is still closed.
Active treatment, up to 98 per cent of birth survival in China, 29 weeks and earlier, has reached the level of developed countries.
The National Children's Medical Centre at the Central Network on 30 September (Sustainment of Roxana) was revealed on 30 September at the University's Children's Hospital, which introduced a way of improving the quality of early birth in China's NICU residence project.
The results of the project showed that, with positive treatment, China ' s 29 weeks and earlier early birth survival rate reached 98 per cent at the developed countries level, but there was still a greater improvement in the number of early childhood and early childhood survival rates.
For nearly 20 years, the Chinese Government has been concerned about the survival of newborns.
At present, infant mortality rates in the above sea area have fallen to 3.71 grams, which is clearly lower than the national average, reaching the advanced level of developed countries.
"Protocol quality improvement of early childhood projects at the NICU hospital in China" has significantly increased the quality of early births through four years.
In his statement to the journalist, Professor Al-Qaedan, Professor of the New Child Rebirth Hospital (NICU), of the University of Rehabilitation, said that while improving early childhood survival, attention was focused on reducing the quality of early childhood survival, reducing the incidence of early births and improving post-natal development and improving the overall end-life of the child, which was important for improving the overall quality of early birth and the quality of the population, which was an important issue of the outer world, and which was also a key issue of concern for this project.
"Probability of early birth in China NICU" has been improved by four years of ongoing efforts to obtain nationally authorized 33 weeks of birth and below early births, resulting in a reduction in the mortality rate of early births and early births, while a significant decline in early birth and early birth rates has significantly increased the quality of early birth.
The project, through the establishment of a network for improving the quality of national births, introduces the idea of improving the quality of co-operatives, the deployment of 25 Chinese hospitals, the establishment of a set of co-operative improvements in national circumstances, and the development of a suitable early birth, to improve the integrity of the level of survival of new births, the system and the effective method of improving the quality of co-operation.
According to the project, a new generation of experience in the development of guidelines for the treatment of new births and guidelines for normal treatment of new births in China is being developed by the United Nations Children ' s Fund at the University of Redan.
It was understood that in the "Probation of Prenatal Quality Project in China", the Child Hospital introduced EPIQ methods into the 19 provinces of the country 25 major NICUs to address early childhood infections in the nursing home of China.
Over the past 10 years, Canada has been making progress, with an increase in the number of early births in Canada, and an increase of approximately 1/3, one of Canada ' s best post-global early births.
The EPIQ approach has been applied to all NICUs across Canada and has been adopted by six countries.
In the context of paediatric hospitals, the results of studies show that EPIQ is under 35 per cent of early childhood infections, while at the same time 20 per cent of the use of antibiotics.
In the future, the Child Hospital of the University of Redan will continue to extend and implement this approach to the national scope, with a view to reducing the overall incidence of early births and to improving the quality of care for new births in the country.
Under the circumstances, there were differences and inequities in the level of relief in the parts of China.
According to Professor Huang, as an important building unit at the National Children's Medical Centre, the Child Hospital will play a leading role, covering several Western provinces, such as New York, New York, Hong Kong, and Sushi, with a view to gradually promoting the simultaneousization and normalization of the new child's survival throughout the country.
It was understood that the Under-School Hospital of the University of Redan is in the United Nations Newborn Force, which, based on the experience gained from the project, develops guidelines on the treatment of new births and provides guidance and guidance for normal treatment of new births in China.
It was revealed that, in 2019, the focal point was based on China's new birth co-operation network at the Children's Hospital of the University of Rehabilitation and that 63 United Nations hospitals were conducting a next phase of national quality improvement in order to promote the overall development of the level of child recovery in China.
The Director-General of the Committee on Marine Health said that the sea could become the central city of the Asian Centre, not only for research now but also for the construction of the entire service system. The quality of service and service results should be one place in Asia, which truly reflects the health level of China.
Cindefiance: "Hero memory " -- -- -- written on the fifth anniversary of the massacre.
On 30 September, at the age of 69, we met on the fifth anniversary of the Republic of Washington, D.C.
At this point, wherever you are, please honor the wise.
It's a warm day. It's better to wake up.
It's a life of life after every tyrant's name.
They've got hot young people, they've got real love, they've got close families.
However, because they firmly believe that "our belief is the truth of the universe " , in order to "resolute the suffering of the next generation " , they are willing to sacrifice everything for themselves.
"I'll live one day and cry for China one day."
Over time, British people have set up a spiritual sign pointing forward.
"Where did you come from? Where did you go?" "What kind of person do you make," read English, and don't find it hard to answer.
The most important thing is to build up a "Hero memory " in the heart.
According to incomplete statistics, since the era of the Revolution, there have been some 200,000 people who have been victims of national independence, peoples' liberation and the country ' s strong commitment.
For various reasons, many do not even have a name.
There are a number of brilliant ideas about blood, living faith, remembering their geniuses and imparting their spirit are the foundation and soul of the people.
This "Hero-Memorial," without any damage or damage.
For a time, history has been inseparable, and popularized.
Scattering history, damaging practices, challenging justice, misjudged values and caused public awareness and awareness throughout society.
He doesn't care. He doesn't forget.
The conduct of the touched-up line cannot be heard, and it must be courageous to protect the dignity of the rule of law.
On 1 May this year, the Heroes Protection Act was officially implemented.
From the practice of justice, the decisions of some cases are of great interest, both to the effective maintenance of the glorious image by law and to the release of the hero and to the respect for the highest right of power.
A nation that has pursued cannot be heroized, and a nation that has an idea cannot be taken for granted.
He's a hero. He's become a universal social consensus.
At present, there are millions of Memorial facilities in the country, and more than a million people visit the Grandfather ' s Garden every year.
The heart is the strongest stone.
To make a hero, to protect a hero, to learn a hero, to love the hero as he turns into the wind, to integrate the British spirit into the blood of the nation, a "Hero-Memorial" will suddenly stand in the middle of the universe, with people in the heart.
The road to Brussels on 28 September - in Italy's view of the EU's demand for a large-scale budget deficit plan to make the market more vulnerable to Italy on Friday, but if Italy maintains its ambitious objective, the EU may take a more proactive position.
The Italian Government ' s objective is to provide a three-year deficit equivalent to 2.4 per cent of GDP, which shows that there is no debt reduction in the face of the deficit requirement alone.
" We are not interested in the crisis between the Commission and Italy " because of the EU's recommendations and sanctions that might have no effect on Italy, he responded cautiously.
EU officials and diplomats still wish to be officially submitted to the European Commission in October Italy, before the market forces will be able to convince Italy to adjust its budget plan.
After the Government announced its plan, the euro fell from five to almost two weeks at the minimum and Italy's debt rate was reached and three weeks at the highest.
If the objective of the deficit remains unchanged before the end of October, the Commission may reject the draft budget of Italy, which is something that the Committee has never done to any State.
At a meeting in the capital city of Latvia, the Vice-President of the European Commission, East Brovsky, stated that Italy ' s current financial plan " does not appear to be compatible with the stability and growth conventions " , which is the financial provisions of the EU.
But he didn't say what this would cause the EU to react.
The tenderer may submit an application to participate in this open tender before 26 October of this year.
The former Ministry of Agriculture considered China to be one of the priority markets for exports of Russian agricultural products.

China's women won the T-Turkey again on 30 September, following the first three:0 battle against Cuba, and the second match was won by the T-Turkey team in 2018.
However, this role of Chinese women is much more dangerous than that of the Prime Minister.
In 2018 there were 24 female genital mutilations, with Chinese female genital mutilation and Italy, Turkey, Bulgaria, Canada and Cuba in Group B.
In view of the world-class and overall strength of Group B teams, Turkey and Italy are the main opponents of China.
On the day of the start of the match, China's troops entered the situation faster, gained leadership, maintained their full advantage, and gave little pressure to attackers on both the game and the game network, with 25:18 more successfully to take the lead.
The second team of Turkish troops, which entered the second position, was very brutal and had reached 6.2 in advance, and China's request for a break-down was adjusted to 7 levels, and it would be gradually split into 7 levels and then split into 7.0 grids; the final Turkish team would be divided into 15.19; the strong Turkish forces would follow 2 points once again after the 24th. After the second request, the Chinese forces would be stopped, and the second round would be attacked by the Chinese forces at 25:23.
The situation in the third floor was very tense, and the two sides were up and up by 19 p.m.
At the critical moment, the Turkish army was mistaken, with 21:19 leading Chinese forces, and 24:21 fighting the most violent and violent attacks against the Huang, and then the Turkish army would be divided into 23:24, after the Chinese forces had been asked to stop, and the Chinese forces would have to take the lead, and the defeat was determined by 25:23.
China's women's diplomats say that the entire race is not easy.
"We are prepared to be more complete, better web-based, more complete than Turkish technology, we need to reduce mistakes and strive to win victory through our own initiative."
In the face of a well-known former teammates, the forces of the Turkish Wakif Bank were severely restricted at the first stage of the race, and then she began to seek change and took a strong step in the past.
"and the attackers are well known to each other, and the attack is normal, but the Chinese forces are doing very well, and they are doing well in the event of an inconsistency of the network and in the event of an attack. "
Next, women in China will take part in the fight one day and conduct physical and technical training; on 2 October, the third round of the team will be hosted by the Canadian team.

The Chinese Engineering Museum has a very good presentation.
New Zealand is China's most important breeding area, and according to the National Statistical Office statistics, new seedlings grow to 35 million tons in 2017 and account for 61 per cent of national crop production.
Since the introduction of land in China in 1982, more than 50 million tons of agricultural surface surfaces have been collected in new areas, using about 300,000 tons of land per year.
Of these, 100 per cent of the soil cover cover is about 60 per cent of the new soil cover.
Unsaturated testing is carried out with a total capacity of 320 kilograms to 350 kilograms.
As the number of new landfills has increased steadily, the rate of return remains low, the number of landfills gradually increased and a series of issues such as land-based destruction have a serious impact on sustainable agricultural development.
Fatigue not only causes serious contamination of soil but also has a significant impact on the quality of flowering plants.
Currently, over 1/3 of New Zealand has achieved mechanical extraction.
In 2017, about 14 million U.S. ammonia was absorbed.
A large number of soils have been collected during the process of the extraction of machinery, the breakdown of the soil and the complexity of the debris in the soil are difficult to clean during the process of the processing of raw materials and cannot be fully cleaned during the follow-up process and seriously affect the quality of the soil products.
On 28 September, an open-ended exchange of views was held in New Zealand.
In order to try to address soil pollution, simplify cultivation techniques, improve the benefits of soil, and take over his team for eight years, implement "The 619" non-ferrous plants for new agricultural green development " .
The fruit is presented as an early development of new types of seed through innovation. The new seedling system " 619 in the middle of the soil " .
" In the new South Hemisphere 619, a series of package measures, such as non-explosive mechanical kits, improved in depth and non-performance, are being implemented under the conditions of non-fertilization in the new South Hemisphere. "
Currently, Aksu, Curler, and Aral have established a free model base, up to 4800 square kilometres per square kilometre.
Unsaturated crops have been grown, and crops have been grown, cut, preserved, and improved.
The third agricultural artist from the Agricultural Section of the New York Ministry of Production and Construction said that, through a six-year study of non-ferrous cultivation techniques and models, the production of non-ferrous metals could reach a total of 320 kilograms to 350 kilograms or even higher.
"The promotion of non-ferrous cultivation technology is a great prospect. "
The Black Sea is of the view that, at present, non-ferrous cultivation technologies can fully address the problem of soil pollution, but at present there is a gap between cultivation and economic benefits.
"The promotion of the price of the fruit harvest will benefit the future. "
He and his team will continue to carry out in-depth research and large-scale dissemination of applications for non-ferrous metals, which will strengthen this non-ferrous industry and fully address soil pollution caused by landfills.

If Tranton is charged with motor vehicles, Mexico will receive $10.8 million per year for the exemption of motor vehicles and Canada will receive $324 million.
Both quotas are far higher than the existing production levels in both countries and provide growing space for both exports.
On Friday, 28 September - Mexico stated that, following a number of days of debate, the Government of Tranquo and Canada of the United States of America were working to resolve trade policy differences and that it was hoped that the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) would remain in the form of a tripartite agreement.
Despite the lack of details, the apparent progress mentioned above is sufficient to move Mexico and the Government of the United States to immediately stop publishing the text of the trade agreement to Canada for more time to accede to the agreement.
In Mexico, Mr. Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, Vice-President of Mexico, said to the press that the United States Government had made new counter-proposals to the Government of Canada and that he would continue to encourage all three countries to participate in NAFTA.
Ildefonso Guajardo, Minister of Economics of Mexico, said that the time allowed for the submission of the text of the United States trade agreement to Mexico and the United States legislation had been delayed because of "very serious" attempts by the Government of Canada and the United States.
Guahardo said, " In the next 48 hours, we will know that we have reached a third-party agreement text, or we must publish both-party agreement texts. "
Guahardo said that his United States and Canadian fellow officials "required special requirements" to delay the publication of the text.
The speaker at the U.S. Trade Representative ' s Office (USTR) did not comment on the United States trade agreement text and the consultations with Canada.
Officials of the Office of the Prime Minister of Canada and the Office of the Minister for Foreign Affairs have not responded to requests for assessment of counter-proposals.
According to the media, in one of the shelters in the Pretoria district of Pretoria, South Africa, there are two small cats playing together and it is difficult to see any unusual place, but they are not really alone.
The University of Berlin declared: "This is a young man who has been born in a way that was used to be professionally - the first of all in the world. "
In the school, scientists are working to study the reproductive system of motherfucking Africans.
Gansworth, Director of the Institute for the Phytosanitary Studies at the University of Berlin, said that these two infants born on 25 August were once healthy and normal.
His team, after 18 months of intensive testing, finally came to an end.
When Hanswent accepted a visit to the media, he said: " We collect sperm from a healthy human body. "
Next, when the number of hormones in the mother ' s body is reached, it is treated as humane.
Ganswent said, " Fortunately, the outcome is successful. "
He said that the researchers " tried several times, but it was important that they did not spend too much energy " .
He said that the above research had been reconfirmed by a reconnaissance that scientists wished to use this technology to rescue huge species of mammals.
The International Association for Natural Welfare noted that there was a total of 43 per cent decline in the number of wildlings that survived in 26 countries of Africa in the past 20 years, with only about 20,000 heads.
Africa is listed as an endangered animal by this organization.
"If we don't do anything about this animal, they'll face a lot of trouble. "
He stated that this new technology did not require that the eggs should be fed, but that as long as the embryos were inserted into the pregnant embryos, they were the same as those in North America and Europe.
Korea ' s exports fell by the greatest in September for two years, but the analysts reduced the number of working days and claimed that despite the rise in trade tensions in Central America, global demand for Korean goods remained strong.
Indeed, Korea's exports increased every day last month.
In addition, early disclosures of initial value data show that exports in the first few weeks prior to the holiday period have increased by twofold.
The country ' s exports in September and the maximum since July 2016 have decreased by 5.7 per cent of the estimated decrease of 11 analysts over the road.
The initial value published on the week indicates that the amount of exports in September was $55.6 million, less than $512 million in August.
Despite the growing concern about the growing trade in the United States of America that may lead to other neighbouring countries dependent on exports, in September Korea grew by 7.8 per cent against exports to China and continued its 23-month expansion.
Korea has dropped 11.8 per cent of its exports to the United States and has fallen by the sale of oil products.
The country's sales of fossil fuels and oil products abroad increased by 28.3% and 13.5% respectively, although the so-called "super-level cycle" of the market's concern may already have been seen.
" However, the impact of trade conflicts will be difficult to avoid, as Korea ' s exports are quite dependent on the US and China markets. "
Imports decreased by 2.1 per cent to $408 million, or growth by 3.1 per cent from road surveys.
The trade surplus in September was $9.9 billion, which was higher than $69 million in August.
The Ministry of Industry claims that the United States and the EU will continue its global manufacturing industry, which is a useful factor for Korea ' s exports.
The declaration states that " the export prices resulting from the increase in oil prices will also benefit exports in the next half of the year. "
" However, the continued trade conflict between the United States and China, as well as the increase in post-U.S. market fluctuations, is all the negative pressure that exports face. "
On average, each working day in September exports increased to $26 billion, with $21 billion in August.
This year, Korea collapsed from 24 to 26 September, resulting in only 19.5 working days in September and less than four working days last year.
Korea ' s exports increased by 4.7 per cent over the previous year.
According to the Director of the Procurement Index of the Day/Markit, the production activity of Korea was resumed in September, but domesticized as a result of a decline in the list from China and Japan, which would lead to other export prospects.
Korean media criticized the United States for not giving up its sanctions.
The post on behalf of the programme on 30 September " of the Korean Working News criticized the United States ' s lack of flexibility in seeking and dialogue in the morning, which is a "consistent" approach.
The article said that the United States of America ' s " 4th anniversary " of the non-nuclearization of the Korean peninsula was key to the implementation of the sanctions against the East " , stressing that the United States continued to implement the United Nations sanctions resolution.
In a joint statement by Singapore, the two parties committed themselves to establishing a new United States relationship that is consistent with the desire for peace prosperity for the peoples of the two countries of Korea.
One United States of America's increased sanctions force demands dialogue, and such practices are undoubtedly contradictory.
The article said that, if a new Korean relationship was to be established, a lasting peace-building system in the Korean peninsula and the achievement of full non-nuclearization of the Korean peninsula, trust in the construction should be put at the top of the building, starting from what could be done and gradually resolved.
The article also said that the United States should understand that sanctions did not interfere with the practice of Korea.
The article says that even the "Northern Devensk" that preceded "Kakasan" also praised the U.S. Army.
The National Interest magazine called the U.S. Navy opinion saying, "We'll meet a powerful potential opponent.
The current U.S. Army Commander General for the European Sea also has the honour of the "Northern Deveńsk" submarine.
He said: " This potential factor is very impressive. See the development of the Russian Navy, how resources are being used, and the main efforts it has made in research and development are first to strengthen the pathogens. "
However, the National Interest magazine continues to believe that the United States maintains its advantage over Russia in this area.
Vogo says: " I believe Western countries still have no claim for advantages. "
It was previously reported that the Russian Navy would include the canton of "Kakasan" in 2019.
Kashan, New Zealand, Krasnoyarsk, Alhangersk, the multi-purpose submarines are the type of "whitewood-M" and the volume of water is 13800 tons, 520 metres below the potential, 64 people are prepared, 31 sections below the water, will carry watermines, fishmines and "fowls" and "M" jet missiles.

No threat to the United States!
EU or will reach agreement with Iran on the purchase of oil
The Government of the United States announced that in November a new round of sanctions would be reopened against Iran, even urging other countries to reduce imports of oil into Iran.
However, it seems the U.S. allies didn't listen.
According to the U.S. "New York Times " report, on 29 September, Iran's Minister for Foreign Affairs Zarif was informed that despite the threat of sanctions against any State that deals with Iran, Tehran was close to reaching an agreement on the sale of oil.
The central purpose of this agreement is to try to create a new payment mechanism, i.e. to replace US$ transactions by an easy or current price.
The purpose of this approach is to take over the United States and prevent the United States from preventing financial transfers.
At the same time, while the EU is committed to the promotion of the agreement, some French and British officials are concerned that if the agreement can be reached, it would be the most open opposition between the EU and the United States of America to withdraw it.
The American media claim that in an hour of interview, Zarif's words are more optimistic than they have been in recent months.
Since the agreement has the ability to "disappear" American traditional allies, the United States has effectively broken down its efforts to reduce Iran's income.
" This will ensure that we sell oil and benefit " , Zariv believes that States have the legitimate right to trade with Iran in accordance with the agreement reached in 2015.
Prior to the day of the EU Foreign Policy Officer, Erica Moguerini also stated that " no sovereign State or organization can accept other persons to decide who can trade with them " .
However, she also predicted that a number of financial instruments could be taken by U.S. leaders before the United States Government launched its next sanctions in November with a view to dealing with commercial banks, traders and States in Tehran.
This year, in May this year, the United States Government declared unilaterally withdrawing from the INU agreement and stated that it could not permanently prohibit the production of nuclear fuels in Iran.
The United States subsequently threatened to prohibit companies that bought Iran oil and other goods from operating in the United States.
This threat has led to the withdrawal of some companies from Tehran, Iran's currency.
Businesses such as air passenger companies and French oil pipelines have eliminated millions of dollars ' worth of investment for I.
British and French officials have stated that the United States Government may " take over " .
However, according to a recent Turkish media report, the United States sanctions do not seem to have had a significant impact on Iran ' s oil exports.
The Minister for Oil of Iran endorsed the fact that no other country could stop buying Iranian oil except Korea.
Zarif and President Luhani of Iran believe that a series of American acts are intended to "instrument" Iran in violation of the agreement.
Zarif also felt indifferent to a series of U.S. oral attacks when it was asked whether the United States would exert a growing financial pressure on the current Iranian government, and he even laughed, "It is a more effective strategy of government, which is the real purpose of the United States. "

The journalists learned from the National Health Commission, and my country's malnutrition rate for young children has fallen significantly, compared to decades ago.
In this regard, experts have noted that the most important concept of maintaining health is " disease-free " , a strong scientific effort to promote health and reasonable nutrition.
In accordance with the " Central Information and Explanation of Health Education for Young People in China (2018 ) " , the maintenance of health is key to a reasonable diet and science movement.
Overweight, weight loss and weight loss are not good for health.
The health behind the "Little Beast" is not ignored.
The China Centre for Disease Prevention and Health Control has stressed that overweight adolescents are prone to normal development, negative effects on their mental, behaviour, awareness and intelligence, even leading to high blood pressure, high blood sugar and high blood pressure.
At the same time, adolescent obesity will be more likely to continue to persist to adulthood and increase the risk of high blood pressure and chronic diseases such as diabetes.
Tinku stressed that the food and health test for the population of China from 2010 to 2012 showed that our 6-17-year-old adolescent was 9.6 per cent, 6.4 per cent pregnant and 16 per cent respectively.
At the same time, adolescent pregnancies are higher than women and cities are higher than rural characteristics, and obesity rates are significantly higher in recent decades.
How can adolescents cope with obesity?
The Deputy Director of the Research Centre for Health and Health Promotion of the National Sports Directorate-General noted that the main causes of teenage pregnancy are excessive and insufficient physical activity.
For such a simple pregnancy, the scientific movement should focus on a reasonable diet control.
The emphasis is on maintaining health, which is the most important concept of " disease control " , one of which is the importance of the full-fledged Copenhagen education for schools, parents and students, which is a widespread and widespread threat to pregnancy and raising awareness of the prevention of adolescents.
Young people should be regularly examined and monitored for high levels of growth development indicators such as weight gain, and early findings of scientific judgements on obesity and pregnancy in order to take timely interventions.
For adolescents who have already become pregnant, it is strongly recommended that, in addition to the scientific effort to organize diet and exercise, adolescents should avoid the use of hunger or half-life treatment to control and reduce body weight, and that they should not be deliberately used to reduce pregnancy.
On Friday, 28 September - Facebook (FB.O) said that the capture of the digital land code by strangers had made them access to nearly 50 million users' accounts, involving unprecedented history, was the most serious security gap in their history.

This is also a two-year drive-up test, officially aligned with the ship.
In addition to the three-storey long-distance modelships, the new energy power fleets are at the top of the priority level.
At the same time, the "transitional procedure" will be adjusted from the "road management area of navigation" from 180 km near the water area to the main water area 541.8 km from the Great Wall to the Great Wall, and the " core area, near the water area, control area, flow area " .
This will help shipowners to choose suitable water treatment and reduce the back pressure of the coastal zone.
The "transitional procedure" also provided for the removal of the ship's declaration of violations on the basis of the current ship's characteristics, and for the extension of 24 hours of the ship's credit-compliant measures.
After the triangular waters, the conditions for air navigation in the basin improved and contributed to the rapid development of long-term long-range navigation.

On 5 November, on the way through the old house, the Japanese Prime Minister of the Black Land indicated that it was aware that the long-term implementation of the overcrowding monetary policy could undermine the financial institutions' interest rate and could undermine the stability of the banking system in the country.
However, he indicated that, given the uncertainty of low inflation and the uncertainty of foreign economies, Japan needed to maintain its large-scale incentive plan and to pay close attention to the benefits of its policy.
" The Japanese Centre fully recognizes that, under the continued money-laundering, financial institutions will be increasingly affected by the power of the financial institutions, " in a speech by the People ' s Republic of Montenegro on behalf of the leaders of businesses.
He said that if financial institutions were more actively taking risks to compensate for the impact of low interest rates over the years, and when serious negative shocks occurred, the banking system would be able to act.
" While these risks are not high at present, the Centre will focus on developments and encourage financial institutions to take the necessary measures " , he said.
The record of the Japan Central Conference, which was published earlier this week, indicated that the Committee on Central Policy discussed the growing cost of long-term relaxation policies at its September meeting.
The record of the meeting shows that if the economy continues to expand, " the future of Japan ' s centre has more pluralistic space in policy. "
The record of the meeting showed that another member said that, given its limitations during the policy period, the Committee should discuss how long Japan ' s centre could maintain policies.
The East Bank claims that the Japan Centre will assess the financial risks posed by the policy of relaxation and consider the uncertainty surrounding Japan ' s economic prospects, which may affect global needs due to trade fraud and increasing protectionism in Central America.
" The impact of such issues on Japan ' s economy is temporary, " claims the East Bank.
" But how the issue continues, the impact on Japan ' s economy may be significant," he added.
" There is a need for a strong monetary reconciliation policy to be pursued on an ongoing basis, while considering positive and negative effects in a balanced manner " .
Despite an increase in the cost of promotional plans, as long as the long-term low interest rate violated the benefits of financial institutions, the slowdown forced Japan to maintain the plan.
Japan ' s monthly monetary policy is maintained; the risks posed by global trade disputes are excluded from the possibility of recent rise in the Black Sea.

Steven Heim, Head of the Boston Common asset management agreement, said that the reconciliation agreement should give Moscow more supervision, while not taking the "destructive" measures he had taken out of Thessallah.
The asset management company holds Panasonic's shares of electricity manufacturers in TSLA.
In accordance with this proposed agreement, it is necessary for TSRA to appoint an independent director, two independent officers and a Board of Supervisors to develop control over external communications to Moscow.
" This matter is quickly resolved in accordance with the conditions agreed upon by our market and our investors, including the best interests of the Thessaloniki Party, " said President Cleton in a statement.
The fourth complaint resulted in an increase of approximately US$70 million in the city of Tésla, which was worth $452 million on Friday, less than $475 million in the ordinary car.
SEC recovered the demand for Moscow to hold large doors in the reconciliation agreement.
Many investors say that this punishment will be disastrous.
"I believe this to be the best possible outcome for all relevant individuals, " Ivan Feinseth of Tigress Financial Partners said that Feinseth gave Tsla secondary " rating, and that the punishment of SEC for Moscow is " from a light penalty " .
"He's still an important CEO for Tessra."
In the reconciliation agreement, both Moscow and TSLA did not recognize or deny the allegations of SEC and did not immediately reply to the request for reparation.
The reconciliation agreement is still required for approval by the Court.

The NEPAD made a very important statement at the Civil Enterprises Conference, which included strong confidence in a broader approach to civil economy.
The recent book of Apache stressed that "let businessmen down their minds and move ahead" has a strong influence on large businessmen and innovative entrepreneurs.
Market vitality comes from people, especially from entrepreneurs and from entrepreneurs.
In the process of reforming the 40-year opening of Boulevard, there are millions of business business innovations, and the growth of business groups has continued to push forward the collapse of China's economy.
For a period of time, people in society have voiced some negative doubts and doubts about the public economy.
Mistakes such as the so-called "New Public Camp" have raised doubts and concerns among some entrepreneurs.
In recent years, some civil society enterprises have faced a number of difficulties and problems in operational development.
For example, international economic change has affected some export enterprises; rapid adjustment of demand structures has resulted in a transition of pressure; some policies have not been coordinated, policy effects have been combined with overlaps or simple working methods, resulting in some initial good policies, etc.
The number of factors of exchanges, difficulties in the civil economy, difficulties faced by some civil enterprises, and a number of concerns were expressed by entrepreneurs.
In this context, correct areas of misconscientiousness, undermines the thinking of entrepreneurs, puts businesses at the heart of development, and encourages the Government to develop, with market confidence and development expectations, with a particularly profound reality.
The meeting once again stressed the important conclusion of "Three unchanged": "The status and role of the non-public economy in our economic development has not changed!"
From the in-depth promotion of the right to political simplification, the establishment of a regime of powers to the rule of law for the legitimate interests of entrepreneurs in the workplace, the creation of a fair competitive market environment, the creation of a society-wide respect for entrepreneurs, and in recent years, the importance of the central party for entrepreneurs, before the system's security power is empty.
This conference has made it more clear to support policy initiatives in the six-part field development of civil enterprises and to launch a series of operational actions aimed at "lightly advanced" civil enterprises.
All of this is very encouraging to business groups and more to society.
Deployment, the approach is defined, and the key is to implement.
To continue to build a better development environment for the civil sector, to help civil society enterprises address development difficulties, to help achieve the Chinese economic transition level; to ensure that entrepreneurs feel fair in market competition, feel secure in legitimate business, respect for social life, promote innovation and create potential.
China ' s economic entry into the process of high-quality development requires more entrepreneurs to provide more space and performance for entrepreneurs.
We have reason to believe that with further deepening reform and overcoming obstacles, the civil economy will be confronted with better development prospects and development opportunities and will move towards a broader stage.

From the beginning of this year to the present year, Korea has broken the lines of dialogue between strong ice openers, and Korea, the leaders of the United States, continue to maintain the situation of the peninsula and to maintain the principles of the dialogue to address the question of the peninsula.
First, the fact that "the nature of the question of the peninsula is a matter of security" has not changed, that it is good to achieve peace on the peninsula, that is, to balance the legitimate security concerns of the parties rather than focusing on peer pressure.
Secondly, in the dialogue to achieve a non-nuclearized half-isle, the various parties differed from the steps and ways of achieving a non-nuclear-sylvanized half-isle, and since there was a long lack of political confidence between the United States, the "who's the first one".

In view of the positive progress made in the current relationship with the United States, as expressed by the Chinese State officials and the Queen of Foreign Affairs, China believes that it is important for the Council to take into account the appropriate introduction of counter-terrorism clauses, thereby encouraging Korea and the parties concerned to take a greater step towards non-nuclearization.

The oil price or the "Three Coins" can be added to the country's production.
On September 30th, the New Beijing Network will open a new round of oil transfer windows in parallel with the national holiday.
Many institutions predict the price of oil will significantly increase and achieve " three-fold " .
The car owners who plan to drive out of the car may be able to fill in the car before the price is paid.
According to data from the census estimates, domestic oil is expected to be approximately 190 per tonne and 220 per tonne of the capital statement.
In September, the oil price had been doubled: on 3 September, oil was added to 180/tonnes, oil was added to 170/tonnes; oil was added to 145/tonnes on 17 September and oil was added to 145/tonnes.
The domestic oil price is linked to the international oil price, which has continued to be investigated since the current cycle of international oil prices, after the fall in the amount of $80 per cent of Bronte oil.
As at 28 September, the United States of America received $1.13 for the original WTI and reported $73.25/pack.
The amount of US$ 1.0,2,72/tonne from the Brent oil supply.
" From the international situation, the US sanctions Iran has increased its tensions, the overall trend of oil prices, followed by a clear rejection of growth, market confidence and the steady movement of oil prices. "
In fact, it has been said that there is a great deal of reason to believe that it is not possible to know what is happening.
In terms of sales, oil is currently in Beijing, and oil prices for oil stations 92 and 95 are 7.66 per cent and 8.15 per cent respectively.
The Dalon People's Information Analyst Leigh explains that the preference for the sale of oil stations has not changed so much and that the main stations, such as the current rocking, are higher than 0.5-0.7 per cent, while the advantage of the local oil stations is higher than 0.5-1.2 per cent.
"The price of this round is going to be 'three' and the price of the increase is about 0.14-0.16, and it is recommended that private car owners go out again before they're allowed to do so."
First-school students made a mistake by the teacher's body.
In response to the fact that "the first-year-old student had been punished by a teacher" incident, the official report of the New York City Board of Directors of New York City reported yesterday that the fact that the case of a teacher in foreign language, RoXX, was verified, had been transferred from the teacher's post to the school, which involved the elimination of the age of "equation" qualifications.
There were parents in the past, reflecting the widespread concern of a six-year-old girl in the first school because of having made a mistake in the school's field of mathematics.
Subsequently, the Institute for Social Affairs in the New Southeast Region of the City of Mainland formed a group of investigators into schools to investigate the relevant personnel, ask them to collect evidence and to transfer the teachers concerned from their place of school.
Last year, the official release of the Cincinnian New District Control Commission, Microbo, reported that there was a fact that RoXX, a teacher of the foreign language school in China, was actually a criminal student.
After the study, the " one vote " , which was considered at the end of the year of primary foreign language school in Chechnya, was rejected.
It was also reported and claimed that a collective dialogue was held with the Department of Foreign Language Schools in the state of Chechnya, which dealt with the management of the division and division according to the relevant provisions; the transfer of the teacher's position to the teacher RoXX, and the serious treatment under the relevant provisions; the commissioning of the foreign language minority schools in the State of Chiangé, and the effective measures taken to eliminate such incidents.
At the same time, schools need to initiate communication with students ' parents and to deal with good follow-up work.
69th International Space Agency Open-up Network in Germany
New York Society did not come to the screen at the 69th International Space Agency on 1 October in Germany on 1 October and attended by more than 6300 astronomers from around the world, space agencies and business representatives, experts and youth students.
The President of the International Space Federation, Mr. Jean-Ef Legal, made a statement at the opening session that the global space industry is no longer a minority country and institutions, and that this year the number of participants has increased significantly, indicating that more and more institutions and individuals are participating in it.
He called on States to strengthen cooperation and innovation and to promote the development of space industry together.
The Deputy Minister for Industry and Information Affairs of China presented China ' s space plan in the presence of the National Space Agency, and indicated that China would expand international cooperation in the field of space and contribute to human space affairs.
China Space Technology Group companies, relevant agencies such as China Space Science Group companies and some representatives of civil enterprises have demonstrated the latest achievements in China's space, including various transport rockets, satellites and space technology applications products.
The International Space Conference has been held once a year since 1950 and is the largest meeting in the world's aviation environment.
For five days this General Assembly was co-organized by the International Space Federation, the International Space Sciences Institute, the Mei University Centre for Science and Micro-Scientific Research, such as the International Space Law Institute.
According to a press release by China on Friday, 5 November, China's foreign trade centre had shown that China's foreign trade situation was still complex and 80.6 per cent of the companies expected to export year-on-yearly over the previous year or with balance.
However, given the continuing rising costs of integrated elements such as domestic raw materials, labour force, and the increased external environment of Central America trade motifs, the company's view is that the export situation is not pleasant for the next year.
At the 124th Chamber of Public Information closed press release, the Under-Secretary-General for Communications, a press speaker, and the Deputy Chief of Foreign Trade Centre of China, stated that the number and export volume of the purchasers from outside this Chamber was slightly lower than the number of customers.
The current buyers reached 189,812 persons from 215 countries and regions, with a decrease of 1.11 per cent.
Exports amounting to $2064.94 million (consisting $298.6 million), falling by 1%.
From the market , Japan , the Ten Asian States , the " Golden Four " countries , Korea accounted for 74.4 per cent , 11.4 per cent , 7.2 per cent , 2.5 per cent , the traditional markets , such as the United States , Australia , Canada and the EU , decreased 30.3 per cent , 8.9 per cent , 7.3 per cent , 0.8 per cent .
Industrially, transport tools, mechanical equipment, construction and packaging materials, electronic consumer goods and information products, protective equipment increased 24.8 per cent, 21.1 per cent, 20.0 per cent, 15.1 per cent, and 7.6 per cent, clothing and household appliances decreased by 13.0 per cent, 6.7 per cent.
The military indicated that, as a rainy and windy sign of China ' s foreign trade, the situation and export data of this broadband purchaser showed that China ' s foreign trade development continued to face many uncertainties over the next year.
However, with the in-depth progress made towards structural reform and the ongoing policy measures in recent countries and local landlocked countries, such as " 6, " , China ' s new momentum for foreign trade is accelerating and business diversification is constantly making new progress, which is an important and powerful condition for foreign trade development.
" The factors of integration are expected that exports from China throughout the year will continue to continue to be stable and to increase quality and effectiveness. "
The Chinese Customs Office published that the price of exports in September was 14.5 per cent higher than the growth, that imports were 14.3 per cent higher than in September, that trade was approximately $316.9 million, and that the export rate and trade rate were at the highest since February this year.
Despite the growing rise in trade patterns in Central America, China's export performance in September remained extremely high, with the need to be abroad, the value of export price for the people's currency before the United States tax is added, or the main price factors, has also shown some degree of comparability in China's foreign trade.
A road survey showed that the United States Fund, which recommended increased cash retention in September, continued to maintain a cautious position as a result of the introduction of the latest round of import tariffs between the United States and China, and that there was no calm sign of the dispute.
However, according to the 12 management recommendations of the Fund involved in this survey, the increase in North America ' s assets has been at the highest since June 2017 and the fall in the euro area, particularly in the emerging markets.
The global proportion adjustment is 56.6 per cent , and the debt ratio is 35.5 per cent , which is basically consistent with the previous month ' s survey.
Its most obvious change is that the cash ratio rose to 5.1 per cent, the highest since December 2014.
A fund manager of a large fund company stated that " some economic data have led to market confidence, but trade wars are still the greatest concerns, so it is best to be prepared to enter the market when it comes back. "
However, in September the Fund managed the best shares, in particular the United States shares, even if the United States shares were considered to be high.
Today, in China's open-label sea, the world's first major national exhibition on the subject of import — China's International Import Museum, which is expected to officially take the screen off from the world.
An event is like a window, which gives the world a better understanding of a city and a country.
Through this "window " , people see " open China " at the highest level; thanks to this "window " at the entrance , they welcome the victory between the world and the "openness" of China.
" For a country, open as if it had been broken down, although it would experience a time of pain, it would be replaced by a new life. "
A summary of the road to open access was provided by the close-to-pearl Repubblika Ping, which gave an important reason for China ' s "Why It Is Possible ".
Recalling the 40 years of reform, it was difficult to reach China, the Great Lakes of the World Market, despite the drought and storms, to continue to face all the risk challenges and to be free from internal energy and to continue to increase competitiveness.
It can be said that China has been able to explain the values and meaning of openness with its own sincere achievements.
At the beginning of the new history, a major decision-making initiative by China to launch a new high-level open-air initiative to open the world market in support of economic globalization and trade liberalization was the real action by China to show "that China's open doors will not be closed, but will only increase" its strong and clear will.
In contrast, the country's visitors are known as " a demand " , which is the largest sure and best response to China ' s greater scope and wider spheres of development of the open economy at the deeper level.
More importantly, the current global trade order has reached a cross-border route.
Some countries have built a high wall of trade protectionism, repatriated the path of unilateralism, increased the international community's concern about the prospects for free trade, and added a number of uncertainty to the ever-increasing world economy.
In the context of such a period of time, this summit of the Günthers represented the protection of China against free trade and made the world see the open market and share its own confidence in the future with China.
Get out of here. Get out of here.
China's greed, the hold of the world, has not only contributed to its development but also brought to the countries and regions of the world a " Chinese opportunity " .
In recent years China has provided a series of international public products for the promotion and promotion of " one-way " , creating investment in Asia and establishing a " fast-track " vehicle for China, providing real-time export markets, development opportunities and jobs and enabling companies to combine China ' s " car " .
It is also a public product such as a large global trading cooperation platform.
On this platform, more than 130 companies from more than 3,000 countries and regions have a unique high-quality product and service fair with a new step in China's market.
In addition to national enterprises, domestic consumers benefit.
Through the development of this "choice improvement" platform, multi-channel quality supplies have been provided for consumer upgrades to meet the needs of the peoples for individualization, diversification and diversification of consumption needs.
As China’s open door expands, it is becoming more and more popular and it is becoming more stable in its use and in its pursuit of a life of beauty.
From a more objective point of view, the significance of the forum has gone beyond the scope of economic and trade, but in the future, it is open, inclusive, well-balanced, balanced and shared ideas that form a common consensus in response to today's challenges.
The world is good, China is good; China is good, the world is better.
We look forward to the future of the World Cup for beauty and satisfaction; we look forward to the bright future of the world's "open China" and the higher-level "opening world" community for human life.
External media: United States reached framework agreement on the North American Free Trade Agreement.
[ Summary] The agreement included opening up to the United States of Canada its dairy market, as well as the United States of America ' s temporary non-expenditure on vehicles produced by Canada.
According to the media, a newsman from Canada revealed his local time on September 30th, and the United States and Canada had reached a framework agreement on the North American Free Trade Agreement.

More than nine out of nine Brazilian women voters claimed that the presidential candidate did not consider women ' s needs.
According to South American Newspapers, recent data published by the Brazilian National Geographic Institute (IBGE) show that more than 90 per cent of Brazilian women do not consider women ' s needs to be considered by the presidential candidate.
It is reported that the number of women in Brazil has now reached 10.7 million and that if women from all parts of Brazil are gathered together into a country, the population of that country will be ranked global 13 and more than twice the national population of Spain.
In Brazil, the number of female voters is 52 per cent of the total number of voters and 48 per cent of men are 48 per cent, although women are very high among voters, only 10 per cent are women in Brazil's national parliaments.
Of the 193 countries in the world, the participation of Brazilian women in politics is only 154, higher than in the Arab countries.
After more than 20 years of human rights struggle, women in Brazil have not been able to obtain their own rights.
Brazilian sociologist Natalia Mori (Natalia Mori) noted that this phenomenon was the result of the common role played by ancient patriarchal societies, racism and capitalism.
"Politicals should be democratically democratic of civil rights, identity, access to public products and the same society as many social groups, but Brazil's politics belongs to one group and most populations are not represented. "
A study previously conducted by the Brazilian Institute of Vehicle Studies (Locmotiva) also noted that 94 per cent of Brazilian women did not think that political candidates who had been elected could not represent their rights, 90 per cent of Brazilian women did not agree with the decisions made by politicians and 93 per cent of women did not agree with the current government ' s governance policy.
"We need to turn the issue of women's representation in Parliament, which remains under the influence of the political system of Brazil, and so far there are serious gender, class and racial discrimination in the political sphere of Brazil. " Nataliya Mori said.
Although women ' s rights are inadequate, most Brazilian women still believe in the power of democracy.
According to the survey, 76 per cent of women felt that they could be represented in the democratic elections and 72 per cent of women were interested in politics.
In addition, 55 per cent of women believe that democracy is the best way of reducing women ' s vulnerability.

The T2 airport was officially opened on 30 days.
The ECOWAS record noted that the new airport could meet the needs of 12 million passengers per year after the launch of the new airport, creating new air traffic preferences in the forest and making a significant contribution to further improvement in the trans-shipment of the Atlantic Ocean, the shipping of the seas, the waterway and the entrance to the four modern system of transport.
This year, it is estimated that 9 million people will be killed by tourists in the jungle.
The T2 International Airport and the T2 airport complex expansion of facilities are a major public benefit project for the 60th anniversary of the establishment of the Basilica Self-Government Region, as well as a landmark project for the international tourism site of the Forest.

It was reported that the new airport in Berlin could meet the high flow of almost 4,000 people every hour to enter ports using intelligently operated lighting systems, security to platforms, identification of the "wise airport" technology, and planning a wide range of business areas such as food, goods, tax and recreation.
As the growth in Asia and the emerging markets in Europe cannot be encouraging, the United States is becoming the main driver of global economic growth.
On 23 September 2018, New Jersey, U.S.A., a warehouse truck stopped inside the port.
However, as the current growth in the United States has benefited from a reduction in the financial incentive for tax, the country ' s economy is also deeply concerned about the external environment.
"As the United States returns to full employment, the economy is at its worst. "
He said that the only problem was when it would happen and that he seemed that he might not move ahead.
Despite a positive outlook on the economic prospects of the United States before the end of this year, the Bank recognized that it was much more difficult to predict for longer periods of time.
" In the absence of more sustainable investment growth to boost the potential for economic growth, the current growth encouraged by financial policy will be difficult to follow, " says economists in a study.
" While there is no investment growth, the economic risk of land undermining in 2020 will rise," they say.
A series of business surveys will show that major economies are at the economic cycle stage at the end of the third season.
The Eurozone and the United States manufacturing surveys, which will be published next week, will be concerned and the third will be published.
However, the focus of the next week will be on the United States non-agricultural employment data that will be published in the next five weeks, which will provide guidance on whether the labour market in question is moving towards a significant increase in wages.
Its importance is not only because of its purchasing capacity for profits and consumers in business, but also because of the increase in wages or the rise in overall inflation, which may cause problems for officials of the United States Federal Reserve Commission (USF/FED).
" The pay will be taken into consideration, as it may increase significantly over the previous month.
More than September last year's progress may not be a 3% break, but we can expect a break in the following month, "The International Group of Economicists (ING) of the Netherlands wrote in a study.
While the release of vacations in China and other parts of Asia has led to clear weekly data under the region, the European Political Office may be a source of market fluctuations.
The Italian Government's financial commitment to the EU before it was taken into account will have to decide quickly whether other EU Member States would be strongly opposed to that decision in Italy.
As Britain's return to Europe enters a key stage, the British Conservative Party may also fire at its annual meeting in Birmingham.

"The strong winds that flow from the coast, the sea is really too severe. "
"In such a case, no one knows what time the wind is going on to the ship.
It's the smartest option to get out of the race near the city, in the current situation."
There are still some frustrations for those who are ready to sail.
"The boat is ready to stop, and we're in good condition."
"But I know that the turn of the game is the right choice, and I hope today's wind is small, and we can play one hand."
The New Zealand Star of Hope, Omika Wilkinson, who was respected for the 2020 Tokyo sports team, said: "It took a day to make the competition more interesting.

The President of the Central Bank stated in the bill that, at the beginning of the Central American trade war, Hong Kong and the new market share indexes were in conflict with the United States unit index, and until the end of September, the market situation began to turn upside down after meeting the U.S. market index in early October, as investors became aware that the trade war was also detrimental to the United States itself.

However, he believed that, as the Hong Kong Bank began its inflation cycle, its interest rate would be normalized, and that future portfolio interest rates would change in terms of the dollar interest rate.
" Portable interest rates will be more consistent with US$ interest rates, all need to be more careful about managing risks, preparing and responding to market fluctuations. "
With the full funding of the port, the port has been further declining, with a fall of 0.9 per cent to 2.0879 per cent per week, ranging from 46 points to 51 bases in the United States; one month has created a new five-month drop and 120 points in the United States.

Does the new tax law also favour foreigners?
The Ministry of Finance, when asked by the Director-General for 30 days by the Commissioner-in-Office of the Tax Administration, stated that, in order to maintain policy stability and the next step in the implementation of the tax law for new individuals, it would consider continuing to make preferential arrangements for foreign persons, including port Australians.

In the next step in the implementation of the Act, is there any additional preferential arrangements for foreign nationals, including Port-au-Princess?
The controller replied that the existing tax legislation imposed on individuals outside the country had a special advantage over tax-free persons who had lived in China for more than five years but who had been resident in China for more than one year and who had come from abroad could only pay personal tax on part of units or individuals paid in China.
The Heads indicated that, in order to maintain policy stability, the next step in the implementation of the new tax law would consider continuing preferential arrangements for foreign persons, including Port-au-Princess.

A new mother who lived told the reporter that she had planned this month's meeting just eight months earlier.
The monthly services project directly affected the level of rest during the month of the mother and the situation of physical recovery. Some small months could provide only a few simple monthly services, including drug abuse and the easy transmission of infectious infections, and the problem of eating a single non-scientific food.
The head of this moon centre said that they were the only one of all five-month-old centres in the city of Giazin and had been certified by the B level.
" While some customers do not at first understand the meaning of B certification, it is important for the long-term development of enterprises to benefit customers through certification of the process that forces firm standards. "
The Deputy Director-General of the National Markets Controls Division, Jean-Mariefin, said that the certification of services was based on customer awareness and that a new type of certification system for quality management and service performance was an important component of national quality infrastructure and was a key component of quality improvement services and had a positive role in enhancing international competitiveness of Chinese services.
Since the beginning of 2004, my country has experienced a lack of and progressive development of service certification projects, such as financial services certificates, maternity care certificates, post-marketing services certificates, e-commerce certificates, health services certificates with a certain impact on a set of services such as health certificates.
According to the Statistics of the Director-General of the National Markets, there are currently 130 certification bodies in my country, two thousand certifications in service, and nearly eight thousand valid certificates.
UNICEF indicated that further guidance and promotion of the development of service certifications would be needed in the areas of health, education, sport, financial and electronics, and to contribute to the development of service certifications in the areas of health, sport and sport, financial and electronics.

Systemic red blood cells are a long-lasting and multicellular doubt, which has been considered to be " maladies " .
Because of its inexplicable mechanism, it is difficult to address doubts and lack of effective treatment.
In recent years, the United Nations Group of Directors of the Institute of Life Sciences of the University of Chicago and the Center for Immunization of the People's Hospital of Beijing have found that there is an increase in systemic red blood cell sensitivity, which is involved in the transmission of immunization B cells.
In short, two groups have confirmed that one of the most unusual immunities in the human body is the underlying cause of systemic red blood cell disease.
According to one of the authors of the article, the North American People ' s Hospital has reported that the group has collected and conducted a number of systemic red blood cell patients, such as nearly 2000 and has found that there has been a significant increase in the incidence and severity of
Several research methods, such as animal testing and testing, have been identified by 600,000 groups of vaccines that have changed their life-threatening transmission routes and have contributed to the spread of B cells by many of their own immune mechanisms.
The journalists were aware that the two groups were strong and well equipped to pursue their own advantages and achieved a close link between basic research and bed application.
The group is committed to the identification of B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-
" This study is one of the results of two teams' multi-year cooperation, and it is also the first time that the academic community has recognized in the mechanism that immune proteins will often develop systemic red cells and provide a solid basis for further academia studies and treatment of sleeping bees.

It's not short, it's legal.
Lawyer's wearing the head of the court?
The news was really exciting, and it blew up in the legal circle.
The Law of the City of Fountain later applied for the fine of 500 lawyers concerned and recommended in writing that the City Law Association deal with investigations.
And according to the New China News, the city council of the former state of Hong Kong issued a formal statement that the conduct of the two lawyers did not involve violations of law and that they were not punished by law.
It is reported by many that the treatment of the city councils in Hong Kong is not short-lived or contradictory but has been approved by the state court.
Together with events that may have caused tension within the legal community, it was finally well resolved.
The reverse, from a more complete truth, is also based on the same type of co-operation between the lawyer's head and the defendant's vehicle and the same type of murder, but not on the same basis, only as supporting evidence round-the-wall of evidence and without fear of movement or "risk security of the court".
The decision on whether or not the act of counsel is illegal and four very important details need to be taken: for one thing, the local court has not been able to contact the judge; for one thing, the whole of the court has not been motivated or misused; for the other, the lawyer has been publicly convicted and apologized to the court for the first time.
In combination with these circumstances, it can be seen that the lawyer concerned has nothing to do with bringing the court to trial, just to defend himself.
After clarifying the whole fact, the City Council of Hong Kong did not waterproof it but decided to refrain from punishment.
This decision was also tested by facts and law.
In the absence of a court permit, it would be easy to cause insecurity and misunderstanding as a weapon of control.
In view of security and caution, the previous penalties and judicial recommendations of the House of Commons are also ineligible.
In order to protect the dignity of lawyers, to prevent the personal court from having failed lawyers, the highest law issued in 2014 " the rules for the security of the judicial police of the Court of People ' s Court " , establishing the principles that the court does not need to conduct personal security checks.
Since the issue of the rule, a wide range of lawyers have been acting as a result of minor incidents affecting the security of the Tribunal ' s security.
In such very special cases as the United States, there is no difficulty in eliminating misunderstanding if one has respect for one another, understanding, and understanding.
The Law Association, as a self-law organization in the counsel industry, carries on a double mission of punishment and legal guarantees.
In the past, individual law organizations have been deprived of their security and disease due to their preferment to discipline.
However, the decision of the State Law Association, whether from the process or from the outcome, is worthy of commendation and has set a pattern for more law-making.
Since 1 October, what tax benefits will affect our wallet?
The New York Times tax law on 1 October will be implemented by new individuals on 1 January 2019 in order to allow the general public to enjoy the highest rate of tax reduction as early as possible, and will be first to remove from 1 October the payroll actually paid by the taxpayers by $5,000 per month and apply the new tax rate table.

It is worth noting that for reasons of the holiday season, a new basic reduction of costs and tax rates could be applied by the units which were due to be issued by law at the end of September.
In order to do so, the tax sector-based contracting client software that has been used uniformly has provided the corresponding tax function, but the corresponding tax is still to be reported during the period of the statutory declaration.
Good-bye 2: The low rate record is clear.
In addition to raising points, a new tax rate table will be applied from 1 October.
The current salary, which has been paid, has not changed, but has changed significantly, 3 per cent, 10 per cent, 20 per cent, and 25 per cent, and 35 per cent, and 45 per cent of these three higher rates remain unchanged.
It is worth noting that the tax law has also adjusted the rates of taxes received from production operations, with a maximum rate of 35 per cent higher than $100,000 to $5 million.
This means that individual business operators will benefit from the tax change.
" From an early point of view of the individual tax reduction estimates for senior managers, the benefits of tax reform, particularly those of low-income groups, will be clearly evident. "
The Head of the Tax Office of the National Directorate-General for Taxation of the Ministry of Maritime Affairs expressed his satisfaction with the individual tax authorities.

Since the mid-2000s, as China's demand for oil has grown, it has grown to grow more and more fat in its territory as farmers in Paul Thomas, North Dakota, U.S.A.
This change reached the highest peak this year, which he produced in 5,000 pounds [1,600 kg] of copper and reached an unprecedented size.
However, Thomas and many farmers like him planned to transfer their primary crops from the former U.S. agricultural area in 2019: corn and corn.
This year American farmers grow more than half a ton of maize, for the first time in 35 years.
It is therefore planned to transfer other food crops because, in the context of the start of the trade war against China, U.S. farmers are facing a difficult situation.
China usually buys about 60 per cent of U.S. exports of cotton, but in recent months almost zero purchases of U.S. cotton have resulted in a decline in the price of cotton to 10 years.

Thomas said that the big price of beer " brought us a painful fight " .
He said that there was no need to buy China, the present price of cotton near its farm was $7.10 per litre, while the cost required was $8.50.

New York International Time Review: Protecting multilateralism, China's knowledge of China.
Under the influence of unilateralist revolutionary movements, international rules and multilateral order were violated.
To some extent, unilateralism and multilateralism have entered a critical period.
As a responsible major country, China has a huge position, a shared concept and a powerful action in the broad way, and together with the international community to maintain multilateralism and to promote the continuation of multilateralism.
Faced with new challenges in the new situation, China sent a clear voice on the development direction and ways of multilateralism.
As the Secretary-General and the Minister for Foreign Affairs had said in the general debate of the 73rd United Nations General Assembly, modern multilateralism should continue to work together to overcome the goal of cooperation on the basis of a rule-based order with a view to fair justice and to lead effective action.
At the same time, China called for the construction of the United Nations core, the central channel of North-South cooperation, the complementary global development cooperation framework for South-South cooperation, and for the creation of a cooperative community for human life.
China's thoughts and voices reflect the leading voice of the international community.
As stated by the 73rd President of the General Assembly, Espinosa, under the present situation, " the United Nations needs to promote multilateralism and maintain an international system based on rules " .
The President of the International Monetary Fund, Lagad, said that the international community should continue to maintain a strong multilateral trading system, maintain international trade rules and resolve differences through consultations.
In recent years, a number of emerging markets and groups of developing countries have played a greater role in international major multilateral mechanisms to provide new development forces for anti-competitive multilateralism.
Standing at this level, China's advocacy for building a large family rather than a small circle of cohesives, and maintaining a shared and non-profited multilateralism, in line with the age-old flood, is a response to global challenges and a solution to the world's problems, representing the common demand of most countries in the world.
There's a forward-looking idea, a more realistic approach.
China's "one-way" initiative has become the largest international cooperation platform.
China ' s joint " one-way " , the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, the International and Regional Cooperation Initiative " 16+1 " , promotes cooperation in the international region and complements existing international systems and order and contributes to innovation for multilateral cooperation and contributes to a more equitable approach to development in order to promote international order.
China ' s actions are increasingly powerful at this multilateral United Nations stage as international defenders and practitioners of multilateralism.
Round international hotspots, climate change response, participation in peacekeeping operations, massive poverty alleviation and assistance to other countries in the implementation of the 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda.
As Secretary-General of the United Nations said, China has become an important pillar of multilateralism.
When the world's "trust deficit" is intensified, as democracy and an act of extremism, it is the most urgent time for multilateral cooperation.
In such historical contexts, the international community needs to step up and co-ordinate itself into action, firmly protecting multilateralism and promoting the creation of a community for human life.

The book of Appellate Pépé notes with deep appreciation that " the loss of tradition is basically like the destruction of its own soul " .

The fifth "Sustained Moon" came to focus on the problem of disability in youth education - a new network.
In recent years, the issue of adolescent education in China has been discussed widely, but the challenges remain difficult for young people ' s education.
In recent days, a workshop on the challenges of comprehensive education and practical strategies for disabled persons was held in Beijing.
How to conduct sexual education for disabled children and young people as an important topic of this seminar.
The "Sex-related knowledge of Chinese disabled children and young people, attitudes and behaviour reports" at the meeting showed that children with disabilities suffer from sexual harassment and sexual abuse are higher than children in health.
In the case of disabled children, adolescents are also more concerned about "sexual protection" in society.
The seminar aims to support family support, school education and institutional services in three areas of the promotion of comprehensive education for disabled children and adolescents in China, from the source of support for disabled children and adolescents, and to enable them and their neighbors to enjoy the right of love.
Experts believe that China's public awareness of disadvantaged groups has long remained at an inadequate level.
The effects of traditional concepts have not yet been sufficiently profound in China ' s comprehensive education for persons with disabilities, especially children and adolescents.
In recent years, however, with the support of UNESCO and the public, there has been a happy development of sexual and reproductive health education for Chinese persons with disabilities throughout the entire cycle.
The "report" shows that obstacles, barriers to vision, hearing, mental and physical barriers to children and young people's access to sexual knowledge and understanding of intimate relations may be more difficult than common ones, but in general, they have made it easier to accelerate and enrich development.
"Comprehensive School of Education for Persons with Disabilities and Practice Seminar" is organized by the Public Welfare Foundation of the Overseas Sea, the UNESCO Office of the United Nations Office at Vienna, the International Union of Disabled Persons (France) and the United Nations Office at Beijing, the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) Joint Support Office, with a view to discussing gender- and reproductive health education and ways to promote policy makers in the field of special education and integration of education, educators, researchers, social services organizations and stakeholders; and the right to health of children and young people with disabilities to comprehensive education; wide-ranging exchanges of strategies, challenges and resources on how to conduct comprehensive education on the basis of disability and youth in the future and how to develop a support network.
On 30 September - The Chinese Central Bank's publication of net data on short-term flows of foreign assets revealed that as at the end of August this year, foreign currency was zero for the remaining 12-month period for the long-term and long-term contract for which no additional capital remained.
This previous data show that as at the end of August last year, foreign currency had been held at $60.44 million for the current long-term contract and freight contracts, which remained unchanged for the fourth month; an empty capital size of SDR 42.76 million was estimated at the end of the year.
After that, the distance from the central line has always been zero.
The central line first published the data at the end of March 2016; data show that foreign currency in the central line at the end of February 2016 amounted to more than $24.38 million for the current long-term contract and freight contract, with an empty head of $289 million.
The data published at the end of October of the same year, the net increase of $164.1 billion to $453.1 billion was first reported.
The Central Bank had previously stated that the long-term and long-term capital of foreign currency was mainly reflected by the conduct of the foreign exchange securities exchange operations carried out with the commercial bank, which would continue to provide long-term insurance products in accordance with the principle of necessity and would have a lower impact on future foreign exchange reserves.
On the evening of 20 September this year, K158 cars were on their way to the wall of a third-party joint school car in Chechnya.
One of the grandparents who bought a car without a ticket, she took her seat: " Take a picture " .
Two hours' drive, and the driver's driving took him an hour off.
Finally, a man's passenger in the car doesn't look down and pick up a giant.
From the point of view of the fact that, although most of the latter were condemned by the public, the public was sentenced to administrative punishment in the public sector, and even included in the list of honest faiths, the public still felt that "no objection " was not allowed to be punished by the public: why not?
Why can't the place stop its immorality or even illegal acts, but then be punished?
And why is it that only a man's passenger "sees the wrong way" to raise it?
The main reason for this is that only on long-distance vehicles have multiple police and short-distance vehicles are not generally available; even if there are multiple-deck police, the police are concerned about the possible non-reactivation of residents and do not take compulsory measures to remove them.
The incidents of rape have made it clear that forced fugitives must be taken out of their places of detention and even punished.
This requires that our motorcycling police be bold to take strong measures at the right time and that there be no motorized vehicle as soon as possible to set up police officers to ensure that acts of violence are stopped and combated at the right time.

The issue is simple for the public police.
"The more the thief gets caught, the more their eyes, the more they see, the different behaviours and the usual passengers, they don't care about their mouths and their back pockets, they also like to go to the crowd, not to hide. "
The police also told reporters that suspects often had no purpose in driving, and that they liked to ride in the parking lot, and that they would end up after finding the object of the undercar crash.

In response to an old country ' s 2005 mark, it was found that the new country ' s brand has not only been converted from " national proposed standards " into " national mandatory standards " , but has increased a number of elements, including rigid requirements, physical capacity, ageing capacity, non-vehicle content requirements, protection of high-temperature content requirements, physical and non-compliant material constraints, and non-solid and solid materials.
In particular, it is worth noting that the new country has limited the potential harmful substances in the construction of the school-based railways and has increased from 7 to 18 from the originals and has established, in accordance with house-to-house standards, the operational limits for post-construction railways.
For example, "the amount of harmful substances and the requirements for the release of harmful substances in present-type and pre-preventable-type components" has been clearly defined by the requirement that the total organic compounds shall not be higher than 5 mg/litres, that they shall not be higher than 0.4 mg/litres, that the carbon dioxide shall not be higher than 7 mg/litres, that the carbon level shall not be higher than 0.1 mg/litres and that the temperature level shall not be higher than 3 %.
The new national brands also provide detailed rules on sampling requirements for the secondary school-based racetracks, testing rules and determining rules.
In addition, field workers were first included in the country ' s mandatory testing scope.
In recent times, targeted work on the implementation of the new country ' s brands has been deployed and the Department of Sport and Art Education has reported on the implementation of the new country ' s brands within one year.
On 30 September, the new internet client came to power (the Queen) at 30 p.m., and the " domestic war " for the 2018 World Cup for Women in the World Cup.
In the end, a team of soldiers who had won a battle in the capital of Tinni 4.0 and who had been fighting for four years were resurfaced from the World Cup of Women, which was also the 21st anniversary of the Chinese women's contest.
Dinin and Juju are friends of the team and friends, and both are well known for their technique.
Whether they're ready or they're hot before the game, they're both like a picture.
In the decision-making process, at least two of them have indicated that they have completed the competition.
But there is a greater degree of competition between tinnitus and rain, known as lightning.
In the first place, the experience of the Great Lakes is a three-way process, followed by the failure of rainwater to track up to 3 degrees.
Later, there began to be an increase in the failure of the attack, and Tinni took the opportunity to take the lead at 3 o'clock 9:5 and at 10:6 p.m.
Dinny is still using the game at 11:9.
In the second place, the failure of Juju's rain continued to be high, thanks to the advantage between them at 6:1 a.m.
In the event of a fall of 2.7, the current changes are 2 minutes, and then the use of the attack will be divided into 8.9.
At 2 o'clock, T'inn won another round.
Thirdly, the two of us have to get up at 3:3 p.m.
Dinn then failed to increase by 3 per cent during the attack, but she then used 3 per cent of the success attack as a result of 6 per cent.
The rain level is twice as high as it is, and at 10.8 degrees.
But Dinn's attack was violent, and four minutes later, he took the third floor.
Fourth floor, the rain floor was headed by 4:2.
However, it was later shown to be a super-powered attack and to stop raining after four minutes.
After a pause, the rain came back to a few conditions, and it would gradually be 8 feet [8.8 m].
The key time, Dinny didn't get it. Two minutes to get it.
As the rain comes down on the ball, Tinni's 4:0 against the enemy.
In the past month, Tinny won a public match in Bulgaria and ended her 14-month-long championship, which ended, although she claimed that she had not set the goal of the race before, but in the final half of the morning, Tinny said that she had completed her mission.
She expressed her satisfaction at her demonstration: "It is important for every movement.
I didn't think of it before, just saying one place to go and decide whether to do it or not."
When her sister, who was fighting in the capital, Rainbow, received a bank that did not fulfill her defence goals and asked whether the people who saw her enthusiasm were going to put pressure on her, she said: "I think that the whole struggle I can deal with in the face of pressure is very great today, leading to the fact that she has not always been able to find a show. "
Employed rural consumption, based on the standardization mechanism ' s clean market, leading health consumption needs and increasing access to agricultural consumption.
Data show that the potential for continued release of consumption of rural residents, the increase in the volume of local consumption for the first half of the year is 10.5 per cent and an increase of 1.3 per cent in urban areas.
In a village in the western part of a poor village, there was only one convenience shop in the village, and some of the goods seemed to have been known as "Ginnfish" called "Ginn oil", "Wang" became "Wann" and "Sunji" goods.
In recent years, similar phenomena have appeared, some rural fake brand names, called near, packaged in the same way, have proved to be deceptive and inevitable.
A consumer survey report published in one Western city showed that rural merchants were serious about overcrowding and that 66 per cent of users bought overcrowded goods under the urban line, of which over half the food was consumed.
The sector in question manages the rural market, year-on-year strikes, and why is the "Leagan" still going on?
Unlike urban markets, the right of farmers to preserve is relatively weak, as well as a number of rural areas, where control forces are limited enough to allow counterfeit goods to produce soil.
A commodity has a multi-heading price, a sectoral control price, a controlled production, a market, a functional shift, a year-on-year holiday, a focus on controlling a wind, a short walk away from the wind, and a slow exit, and a new holiday.
The lack of long-term control mechanisms, the difficulties of the rural market, the low cost of violations, and the high interest rate led to the trafficking of some illegal traders in the mountains and some rural areas to become " waste markets " .
From winter to small health, large-scale farmers are focusing on developmental consumption.
Earlier in the day, the Central Party, the State Department, issued " a number of comments on improving the capacity of the consumer system to further enhance the consumer capacity of the population " , which offered to promote the increase in consumption of rural people with a view to enabling large farmers to use " willing " consumption " and to make rural consumption more attractive.
In one way, there is a need for deeper reform, the elimination of multiple market regulation, multi-manager management of wastes, health-care security, product quality monitoring networks, constant pressure on rural vacations and space for sale.
On the other hand, in order to increase law enforcement efforts, to combat the regulation of " hairdryers " , it is essential not to allow counterfeits to thrive in rural areas.
The severe punishment of farmers is the protection of farmers, regardless of the fact that they are hiding too much, should not be a reason for the generation of counterfeit goods, and the relevant sector should be given clear responsibility, the control forces of the ground, the issues of which are complex, the responsibility to be followed, the forgery and the sale of counterfeiters are not hidden.
Ensuring strict market access, rigorous quality review of producer operators, access to local market flows, direct access to products, clear roads, source of origin and general thinking, the safe operation of legitimate vendors, and the acquisition of confidence in farmers.
Active rural consumption needs to be guided by health needs.
With increased consumption, many farmers are not only looking for food, food, and a high quality life such as culture and health, but are unable to place rural markets with "low-quality " " price" pictures.
This needs to promote the expansion of e-commerce across large rural areas, the promotion of cross-border sales channels for both urban and interconnected towns, the integration of industrial development platforms and online trading platforms, and support the development of new patterns of consumption into rural markets; the promotion of conditional urbanization of trade flows with recreational agriculture, rural tourism and product processing; the healthy rural modern communications network system, the optimization of integrated storage facilities resources, and the effective reduction of rural flows.
The creation of a clean and market-oriented environment for rural farms, which keeps farmers from worrying about their consumption, has increased their rural consumption and has contributed to the awareness and happiness of farmers ' consumption.
Since 1 November, my country has reduced the rate of duty of the most favourable country of goods, and the overall level of duty will fall to 7.5 per cent.
In accordance with the 26th regular meeting of the State Service, it was decided to issue a notice dated 30 November 2018 from the Committee on the Customs Code of the State Service that reduced the rate of duty of the most favoured State of the goods since 1 November 2018.
According to the Public Service Tax Commission ' s notice on the reduction of the import duties on partial goods, the cost of the enterprise and the needs of the population have been reduced by reducing the rate of duty of the goods, such as partial industrial goods, since 1 November of this year.
A total of 1585 tax objectives, which is about 19 per cent of my country ' s total tax rate, averaged from 10.5 per cent to 7.8 per cent and averaged by 26 per cent.
This tax is mainly related to textile materials; stone materials, rubber, cotton; parts of iron and steel products; electrical equipment and parts thereof, such as metal processing machines, ironing machines, mechanical machinery, electrical equipment, electrical equipment, paperboards, etc.; resource goods and primary processing products such as non-metallic minerals, non-chemical materials, wood materials and paper products, precious stones.
At the same time, with the overall level of duty, in particular drugs, the daily rate of duty on imports of goods is reduced by the rate of duty on imports of goods.
In order to carry out the central implementation of the decision-making process of the State Service, my country has implemented zero-rate duties on most import drugs since 1 May this year, reduced vehicles and parts of the vehicle, partly by import duties on consumer goods, and implemented the third-phase tax on products.
The Committee from the State Service's Tax Code was aware that since this year, after continuing self-government adjustment, my country's overall rate of duty would fall from 9.8 per cent to 7.5 per cent last year and averaged to 23 per cent.
The appropriate reduction of tariffs is conducive to the promotion of the development of external trade balance, the promotion of higher levels of external openness and the integrated use of two international domestic resources and the promotion of structural reforms in the country.
The Committee ' s relevant officials indicated that this year was the 40th anniversary of reform and that the initiative to reduce the overall level of tariffs was to implement the practical action of the Secretary-General for the implementation of the key speech in the Asia-Pacific Forum, as well as to increase openness on the basis of my country ' s own high-quality development, and to promote major import expansion initiatives, which indicated that China would not move towards a mutually beneficial open strategy, while enhancing its own development momentum, also making China's development better and better for the world.
On 29 September, the regional public goods card for agricultural products will be issued in the South-West district of Gandhi Province.
Red Army memes, black beads, mountain goats singing black sheep, hard teasing paper, handcuffs, handcuffs... ...and a full set of beautiful agricultural products on the show, they have a common card called "crowds."
"The creation of 'circuits' regional cards effectively solves 'more and less-favoured agricultural products' and becomes a powerful component of poverty-responsive development. "On 29th, "circuits" of agricultural products will be placed in the South-West City area.
The district border between the province of Zhangin Province and the " Chinese " Chinese " Chinese " Chinese " film, as " National Food Production " , is a long and resource-increasing area.
The sheep's flesh, the honey, the oyster's face, the sweetest place to eat is the most often remembered tastes in his village.
As the urbanization level in China grew, the urban population grew rapidly, and a large number of rural young people left the countryside began to live in urban areas.
China's Agricultural Card Study expert says well: "Now the city's life is fast, stressful, and more and more people are beginning to forget the life of the village for a little while, but, 'The most beautiful memory is village ' , 'the roundabout' card design is named after the circumstances and the noise of the people who live outside the countryside . "
The weather conditions are special, the weather is long, the night temperature varies, and the special low-food conditions are unique.
There are more than 20 types of small-scale farm produce in the country, which is the main food source in China, which produces a high level of livestock production and quality in front of the country.
The King Lee was the daughter of a circuit girl who was in heaven, who, as a volunteer, attended the presentation, she said: "The most beautiful family of the people of the house, the most beautiful taste of the tastes, the 'crowds' of our cards have grown so much, remember, remember, the more beautiful food there is, the more away the 'crowds' is, the more big it is."
Dr. Güngen, researcher at the National Food and Material Reserve Institute of Science, said that by testing data for more than 900 indicators of the group, there was an increase in the quality of the crop, the suffering, and the preference of agricultural products such as black and white, and that many genetically active substances were higher than the standard data and that "roaches" had an advantage in the domestic high-temperature food market.
The Committee on the Environment notes that, through the release of "circuit" cards, it is possible to further enhance the quality, standardization and scale up the level of innovation in order to contribute to the production of good overall images of CFPs and to speed up knowledge, competitiveness and added value.

Korea's first joint visit to the port in 65 years
The Korean Ministry of Defence confirmed that Korea had launched a joint survey on Hanun and Al-Qaida into the seawater area that day.
This initiative is an early preparation for ensuring the free navigation of both civil ships.
A communication from the Ministry of National Defence to the media that day revealed that this was the first joint survey on the entrance to the port of Huang.
Korea has signed a military agreement in September this year, agreeing that a joint visit will take place in the area of water such as the sea since November to ensure environmental protection of the water area and the development of tourism.
In October, Korea planned a joint water-related survey at the General Military Conference.
On 5 November, a joint visit to the Korean waters area was officially launched.
The joint mission consists of 20 members of the Korean army, including experts.
According to the Ministry of National Defence of Korea, both parties were not carrying weapons during this investigation and were prohibited from using words that encouraged each other.
" Since there is no military demarcation near the sea, the region has been an emergency high point, but through joint visits, the future will become a new zone of peace. "
This area of the Korea Joint Research Area, the Director-General, approximately 70 km, totals some 280 square kilometres.
The Ministry of National Defence of Korea introduced that Korea would only conduct a survey of 6 ships at sea depth, providing basic information on the safety of the water area; after completion of the investigation, it would provide a guide map for the civilian ship only.
In October 2007, Korea held a summit meeting in San Juan and reached an agreement on the common use of Hunan and Al-Zin in the sea, but the follow-up negotiations were tense because of the situation on the peninsula.
In accordance with the military agreement signed by Korea in September, future ships need to be notified to each other only before they can travel in the common water zone.
On 5 November, the new Internet electricity was released on 4 November, according to China's Embassy website in Mongolia. In recent years, Chinese citizens have lost their shoes and shoes during tourism.
It was understood that two Blue Day Relief Team members, on 19 October, two of whom were contacted by domestic friends, indicated that they were about to enter the mountains near Kusugul Lake, and that they had shared their location by micro-conference and then lost their connection, which seemed to have gone to the unknown.
China ' s Embassy in Mongolia has always attached great importance to the protection of legitimate rights and security of citizens in Mongolia and the protection and assistance of consultants.
Following the lack of information from the two visitors mentioned above, the station immediately launched a premise on capital security, tried to take the time to save gold and do all it could.
The mission maintained close contact with the family of the party, assisted the family immediately to report to the police and provided a translation list for the family to choose.
At the first time, the Mission met with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Mongolia, the Chief of Police, the Head of the Emergency Directorate, informed the relevant situation, requested Montaparta to be rescued as soon as possible and to maintain close contact with Montaine during the search and to ensure that the latest progress was made in time.
At the same time, the mission assisted families to launch search in Monbo and to launch a wide range of active participation in the finders in Monwa and central finance companies, provide effective guidance, and provide relevant assistance to numerous blue-day relief teams assisting Lummon.
Under the great impetus of the embassy, Montague sent relief teams for the first time and committed to the elimination of rescue costs.
The Directorate-General of the Police and the Directorate-General for Emergency Situations were instructed to seek full relief from the police and emergency services of the Kusugar Province.
Because of the fact that the Kusuguil Lake is located in the north of Mongolia and the Russian border, it is far from the area, far from the area, and far from the people, the transport and communications are scarce, and currently Mongolia is in severe, temperatures below 20 degrees Fahrenheit [20 ° C], the local police and the emergency sector has faced great difficulties, almost all the police have been mobilized, and local shepherds, through horse mackerel, travel, and visits the two people around the length of the missing area are being rescued on a daily basis.
At the same time, with regard to the special situation in the pastoral area, Montaine has been sending out searchers through the radio cycle for several days.
The staff of the National Blue Rescue Team have also been active in the rescue with Montapart.
The security of the two missing people has always touched our hearts.
Two of them have been missing for over ten days so far, allowing the settlement to continue to receive some lines, but they have not been found, and the rescue operation is still under pressure.
The mission will always be "in principle" and will continue to be concerned about this and will encourage the Montaparta to continue to seek its full salvation and provide maximum assistance to the family of the party.
The embassy called on Monrovia and the company to contact China ' s Embassy in Mongolia for the first time if it was available.
