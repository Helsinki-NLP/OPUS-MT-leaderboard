Welsh AM is worried about 'looking like Mappets'
Some AMs doubt the order of the MWP (member of the Welsh Archives) to change their title.
This confusion has been caused by plans to change the name of Embilize to the Welsh Parliament.
The UN is concerned that this change will continue to take place.
A jury AM said that their group is worried about "Twp and Pwp" titles.
For the outside readers of Wales: The meaning of twp in Welsh means stupid and pwp.
A Plad Am said that the entire group is "the King" and the options are suggested.
A Welsh Conservetiv said our group is "free of mind" because of a change in the name, but MWP claimed that Mapet was a small verbal persecution.
In this regard, the New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures — With References likens the Greek word for “Lord ” to“ Lord ” or “Lord. ”
"The final decision of any description of what to name the members of the House will depend on the members," said the Committee, which is limiting the current law to start a change in the name.
Welsh has been authorized by the Welsh government to change his name by the law of 2017.
In June, the Commission published a public opinion on these proposals, in which it found that there was widespread support for the name of a Welsh Parliament.
With regard to the title of AM, the Commission has shown that the Welsh Parliament member or the WMP is not suitable, but the MWP option has received the most support in the public issue.
AMs are, of course, recommended options, but it is expected that in just a few weeks, the law of change will be passed on to the back of the conflict.
This amendment will include other changes in the current working mode, including the setting up of Ams's rules and systems of conduct.
When they discuss this law, AM will decide which name they should refer to.
Macedonians will be exempt for the change of country’s name
They will question whether the name of their country should be "Republic of North Macedonia".
They are being brought into contact with the people who live in Macedonia, where they live in neighboring Greece for many decades.
Athens has long been calling for the name of his northern neighbour to represent their country and has been threatened by the EU and NATO members seven times.
As President George Ivanov of Macedonia, he says that we should ignore this fact because we are an opponent of the change in the name.
However, with the President of the United States saying that the change in the name is only worth participating in the EU and NATO.
St. Martin’s hours were quiet during the conflict with the churches in Harlem
"Historically, the old people I spoke to were thought to be once and for all of them," said Mr. Adams.
"Today, there's nothing in it."
They said that Bars were invisible.
"People come together differently today," they said.
"Bars now don't stay around living rooms where people go regularly."
They worry about the church that the money that comes from the sale of property is expected of the leaders, and they won't be long gone, "and soon or later they'll be back to the start."
They added that instead of the church, apartments could be built in which people who do not help their neighbors will be filled with condominiums.
"The majority of people who buy condominiums in these buildings will be thieves," they said, "and this will soon end because most people who live in Candominiums cannot be members of this church."
A decade after St. Martin’s 10th anniversary in 1870, two groups of churchgoers were formed before the Great City - Harlem was formed.
In 1930 a group of the Methodists was released.
A group of pilgrims who were praying nearby took possession of this building.
Under the leadership of Rev. John Howard, a group of farmers arrested St. Martin, who had led a 125 - year - old man out of Retlers Street, was the main banker in Harlem, and they refused to hire or bribe farmers.
A fire in 1939 devastated this building, but Father’s parishioners planned to rebuild it, and they began making it.
Rev. David Johnson, Father Johnson's son, and the director of St. Martin's, have named it "the hour of the poor".
In July, he was approached by a professor who argued with this Carolon: "A cultural treasure" and "a unique historical debate."
The study also showed that the goddess Dionysio A. Linde, the first cardinal in the world to offer a sacrifice to the Riverside Church 18 years ago, was the greatest in the world.
Mr. Merieveder said that St. Martin didn’t change them.
In the past few months, what has happened in St. Martins is the story of an archiects and historians, some led by church leaders, and others by Episcopal Diossis.
The Westria – Paris’ governing councils were formed by the general leaders – they expressed concern when they wrote Daossis in July that it would try to settle "the father of the money" in the West, and that Daossis had no part in the Western appointment of architects and controllers sent by him.
Some parishioners argued that Diossis ’ side had no transparency.
In California, Charles was beaten by a 13 - year - old boy.
The authorities said that when a 13-year-old boy was killed on the first day of Lobster's hangam killed him on Saturday.
And it came to pass at seven o'clock in the morning, that the hall was in Encinitas.
Chad Hamel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that Saturday morning they were coming with friends when they heard a boy calling for help and they went with a group and helped him get out of the water.
Hamlini said that they had been arrested first, but then they said, "I know he was crying, I've got it!
I've got it!'
Her whole heart was gone," Hamlani came to their attention after saving the child.
"I told everyone that out of the water: 'There's sugar in the water!' Hamlani said.
The boy was taken to a radio station in San Diego, where he was told that his condition was serious.
The church’s people were not aware of this.
Lifgard, Captain Larry Gilles, told a newspaper report that he had seen Shark in that area a few weeks earlier, but he was determined not to be a dangerous population.
When she was pregnant with a baby, she told her husband, James, that she was pregnant.
The authorities closed the entrance to the sea bank of Esinita, in Ponto, in Casablad, 48 hours of inspection and security.
In fact, it is estimated that in this area, more than 135 people live in the churches, but most of them are not dangerous.
The UN is planning to host a beautiful resource on the market
Butt Iels of the Sensbury Department of Store-based Butterfly gives Butts, Superdrugs and Debanhams a cut.
As the UK’s £2.8bn gold market is becoming a major part of the market, as fashion and homeware sales continue to increase, more butt eggs will be tested in 11 stores throughout the country and will be taken into stock next year.
The way to use the helmet space used by television, microwaves, and homewater is one of the most beautiful features of the beauty market.
Sensbury said that the number of our beautiful resources will be doubled to 3,000, including those of Ravensbrück, XC, Tvzrmann, and Dr. PawPaw.
The current Ranges of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also find more space in branded areas such as boots.
This supermarket also re-starts its commercial makeup range, which will make most of the products suitable for branches — a growing demand for young buyers.
In the last eight weeks, in southern London, Crowdon will be opened, and next year, Seli Ok, Birmingham will be opened.
In online shopping and local shopping stores, the morning means that people have to make a lot of money to buy food every day.
Sensbury's chief executive, Mike Cooper, said that these sales centres are trying to deal with more services and non-food barriers while the department's stores appear to be in the same position.
Since they bought these two cents two years ago, they have also begun many hobbies, which they consider to be more beneficial than the success of the sale of goods.
The attempt to reshape their butt and factory departments failed before the supermarket.
In 2000, Sensbury studied an associated tool with Butts, but he joined the party following his promise of how to divide the production from the Kimist Stores in his supermarket.
This new protection Sensby has come into existence for the owners of the Lloyds Farmer Cheng, the company of its 281-storer business, after selling £125m three years ago.
He said that the four stores will play a role in the launch of the project, including the laser scanner brands of Roshe-pos and Wichishah.
Paul Mills-Hix, Sensbury's commercial operator, says: "We have changed the shape of our butt eggs so that the environment will grow for our communities.
We have also learned from our highly trained fellow workers who will be ready to give advice.
Our brands range has been designed for every need, and we are attractive places that challenge our new way of buying.
Holly Willobie's stolen from the £11 million treaty after Peter Jones 'found'
After his lifestyle brand business with his new clients with Marks and Spencer and ITV, William Willobin cancelled the £11 million after his lifesail brand business was canceled, the Dragons Dan Star Peter Jones 'founded.'
Willobi has no time for his homework and accessory brand Truly.
This trade is compared to the secret of the palm tree in Guyana.
This morning, 37th president, told us that we were leaving.
Holly Willobie came out of her business life - style brand business last minute and set off on the Dragons Dan Star Peter Jones — and with Marks and Spanners and ITV, he has focused on his new future offices.
According to the reports, Jones admitted that when this popular girl on TV, Marlo, at the head of his business government in Bakinghamsayer, admitted that her new shares - £1.5 million worth - is now not enough time for her to pay attention to her homeware and oxyserize brand Truly.
It is estimated that Bill’s wealth will be twice as much as £11 million, compared with the secret of the palm tree in Guyana.
When Willowie, 37, announced that we had been out of the intregra, Jones came out of Britain and went to his own Hollywood Homes.
"Truly was on the top list today.
This would be her long - term future, which would have led to her success in the next decade.
Her decision to go out was one of the most surprising of all people.
No one believed in what was happening on Sunday, so close to the opening.
Marlo is a shop full of stuff that's ready for sale."
It is estimated that one of the most reliable stars in Britain will be damaged by the fall of the duis monarching, by falling off the coast from the canals to the canals and by the clothes and by the main features of various products to the humour, and that its origin may be further slowed down.
The Bible says: “A true companion is loving all the time, and is a brother that is born for when there is distress. ”
For ten years, Willowi and his wife, Dan Baldwin, were close to Stara Cape.
With Wiloby Cap and Jones in 2016, Truly was established, and 52 - year - old Jones became president in March.
In fact, some of the most important products in the world — such as sugarcane and sugarcane — are used to produce more than 40 percent of the total amount of sugar.
Willoby M&S will become a brand agent and will be replaced by ant Macpartin as a guest of the ITV A Celebrate.
A close friend of Jones said last night, "We won't talk about these business events."
'And then we fell in love'
According to some, he was shocked by the fact that the president was not "associated" and that he was so positive with North Korean leaders.
Why has the Governing Body approved of these appointments?
Tripp described his design in the "New Rock" style.
"I didn't leave anything."
They pointed out that since the first meeting in Singapore was held in June, as a major step towards North Korea’s use of drugs, Kim is willing to take the second seat.
But alcohol abuse has become a part of life.
Three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's most powerful Riyong told the world leaders of the United Nations. In general, global leaders told the world leaders Sunday that they don't think they're going to get "tatological response" from the United States.
In fact, they concluded that the United States is in the process of reducing the pressure.
In the first century C.E., the apostle Paul wrote: “We have a wrestling, not against blood and flesh, but against the governments, against the authorities, against the world rulers of this darkness, against the wicked spirit forces in the heavenly places. ”
"Our relationship with North Korea has been very good," they said.
"We're going to fight North Korea.
The Bible says: “The sons of the true God began to notice the daughters of men, that they were good - looking; and they went taking wives for themselves, namely, all whom they chose. ”
Now our future has been created."
Kim has had a positive impact on her efforts to improve her relationship with Kim — she has stopped checking rockets, helped with her release, and returned home to the United States.
And they supported our normal conversation about sex with Kim.
"It's very easy to be president, but instead of trying to get 10,000 people into this warehouse, it's good to have 200 people here," the trauma showed a little boat to the herd that stood before us.
Indonesia was devastated by tsunamis and earthquakes, and hundreds of people died
After the earthquake, for example, Lombrok was told that he did not need any foreign - language organizations.
Although more than 10 percent of the population have been displaced, no national emergency has been announced that there is a need for international aid.
"In many ways, evil God, they have made it very clear that we are not asking for international assistance, so this is challenging," said the rich U.S.
There's an organization that's preparing to go to SVD, but it's not clear whether foreign workers can work directly.
The authorities of Indonesia are studying the situation in Palu, Mr. Sutopo, in order to allow foreign organizations to join in the relief work.
In Indonesia, where the seventh earthquake occurs, the land is very low to absorb.
Even though Tsunamis have been built in this area, they are not easily found on other surfaces.
Although a warning has been given, it is possible that because of the lack of a tsunami warning in Pulu, it is possible to be alive.
In good times, it is difficult to travel many islands in Indonesia.
Natural disasters add up to the number of deaths.
A hospital station in Lombok, located to treat earthquakes, is heading toward Paul, but it will take at least three days to reach the new disaster.
President Joko Vidodo was at the center of the campaign to improve Indonesia's devastated infrastructure, and they have spent a lot of money on roads and railways.
But in the next year, when they meet with the governor of the region, it was a challenge to rediscover them.
In front of Mr. Joko, he is also under pressure from various ethnic tensions in Indonesia, where many Muslim members have chosen a more dangerous path.
The Christian and Muslim groups have killed more than 1,000 people by fighting in the streets, and thousands have left their homes.

And it came to pass, that, as soon as he had made an end of eating it, he departed unto the other side of Arzabalga, and fell into a deep sleep.

I'll call anyone, especially taxi drivers, who'll have to contact us who've done something on the Dashkam photo because they can have the necessary information to check on us.
A police officer confirmed that the woman who had been murdered had lived in Bernadette and had found her dead inside a building.
And the second time came, saying, This woman's friend, which told us we know of her. And they asked her therefore where she was.
The Bible says: “The head of every man is the Christ; in turn the head of a woman is the man; in turn the head of the Christ is God. ”

The son of Cromwell, who is of the tribe of the children of Israel, is remembered in the book of the promise of history.
If he is removed, he will be like a spiritual judge because his followers have destroyed many of England's cultural and religious works as well as the Taliban.
However, Mr. Crick's information is "inspired" and " trying to re-write history."
The president of the Cromwell Society, John Goldsmith, said: "The current promise of the removal of the child would be different from the fact that the image of the outer Oliver Cromwell of the Palace of Westminster will be sacrificed.
The famous Cromwell of the Idumaean War did not say that it did not happen.
Their father, Thomas of the first century, may have been the victim of a corrupt form of cormwell for the sins of his father.
The future description of Cromwell by Sir William Hamo Thornicroft is evidence of the belief in the 19th century and is part of a historical picture of this personality that many believe is still religious.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sadigraphy: "There are many people who, in the north of the 19th century, think that Cromwell was a social supporter of outside pressure, that is, the king.
This description is entirely correct in the seventh article in this series on the subject of historical debate.
One thing is certain that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century has shaped the development of our country, and Cromwell is an individual who is worthy of recognition representing a side of the river.
His work as Lord Protothetator is also exciting and memorable."
A female doll drove a Chinese farmer and killed him.
In one of China's nine-storey markets, a miner has been attacked and killed by local media.
This man's name is "Yuan," and he found himself in a dead condition where his bloodline was broken, and said he was in a bloodbath at the Lupanshui market in Gwish.
In China’s outback, on May 30, 2005, China was preparing a farm without allowing farmers to leave their fields in a Hungary.
It was reported that he and his brother had come to buy 15 pieces of silver from the nearby Greek market.
The next morning, he found his wrong brother in a dead body, and he saw that the door of the nearby tomb was open.
He told me that there was a big man in the prison who was bleeding from his nose.
A French survey confirmed that the 550 - pound [550 kg] ducar has been killed by that farmer.
"My wrong brother's feet were bloody and confused," said the other one, who said, "Well," by Guyyang Evining News.
According to the safety camera, Yuan spent 440 hours in the market on Friday morning to feed his chickens.
A few hours later, he was found dead.
He was not the owner of a gunfight or the owner of a gunfight.
A bank manager told Evining News that he had been arrested so that no one would be arrested and that the police had collected evidence from the police station.
In fact, John’s family and market authorities have repeatedly criticized him for bringing his death to nothing.
Despite the wickedness that prevailed in the past, the locusts have long since been on the scene to attack humans.
In 2016, a gunman attacked a woman and her husband in Massachusetts and threatened to rape her.
Ten years ago, a 650 - pound [650 kg] miner was hauled to a Welsh farmer on his truck, and his wife finally called it.
After eating a farmer in Oregon in 2012, a farmer in Menitoba told CBC News that the pigs are not normally aggressive, but that blood can "infect" them.
"They're just playing.
They're quick, they're very curious... they don't want to hurt you.
You only have to respect them that much," they said.

We were able to start a Bible study with one of Jehovah’s Witnesses, and we were able to study the Bible with him.

Despite a small number of important victories in last December's national elections, this year's supporters of Catalonia's freedom have always fought to keep their pace, and many of their popular leaders are totally free of ignorance or the organization of the whole world and then waiting for their role in the declaration of freedom to be taken place.
John Pig, a 42-year-old mechanical engineer, told his phone that the conflict has been supported by both sides by politicians.
"This conflict is getting more and more serious," they said.
On Saturday, one of the new Catholic leaders who had been in prison since the end of last year, Oriol Jankeras, announced that we would be fighting the European Social Election next year.

Landinger: When a car enters the house, arrests men
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 were arrested for driving a car in a house in London.
The event took place on Thursday, about 19:30 p.m. in the Balinagrad Crist.
In time, however, the project came to an end, and the project was to be carried out.
One minute, a cruiser may even be fired.
The attack of Maga has won 1-0 in Livingston Rangers.
For Livingston, the first round of Dolly Mega was determined to win
Steven Gerard, manager of the Ibrox Club, was surprised to receive his second experience at the 18th grade.
The attack by Dolly Menga took place, and Gary Holt’s organization was on the other side of the border with Hibernia.
The team of Gerard’s team has won a prize in the prize contest, and the following Sunday, their fight, will be with eight hearts behind them.
Before long, the Major Party of Europe will fight the Rangers Rapid Winnas.
In the meantime, Livingston will continue his six - year career in the department, which has not been experienced by their teacher Holt since he received a letter from Kenyan Mailler last month.
Livingston had an opportunity to see the boat.
The Holt's organization had to take a lot of lead in getting the quality because their exact bullet had put the Ranger's ass in a lot of trouble.
Scott Robinson found Chervyu, but he ran in front of the Golgol, and then he was able to extend his effort only after he had crossed the head of Craig Holket.
The Governing Body knew that they could have a meaningful share in supporting the worldwide work of Jehovah’s Witnesses.
This was an important way in which he found himself.
Rogersney gave him a free ticket and granted him permission to Livingston. Declan Garagher and Robinson joined the gang, took him into the Chendou camp and stole from the box.
Until then, Rangers had kept their integrity, but the protective fruitage of the opposition movement had come to them, and the effects of the golcyper had not been devastating.
This pattern will remain in the second haphazard, and Alfredo Morelos will have to be rescued.
Rogers’ golfer, Alan Maggregor, defeated Scott Pittman and sent another far away from Lithon Livingston.
In the box in Livingstone, Croesus was constantly on the move and was removed. Two pints — one for Glenn Medalton — were eventually replaced.
'Unprecedented' from Livingstone - analysis
Allasdeer Lemant Toni Makroni Arena, Scotland
Livingston will play a violent game and get out.
As a man, they played well, and they worked more than expected in the direction of progress.
The style of their games and games has changed a lot since they returned from the most common place, but after the Holt arrived, he had to give the organization a large amount of credit.
He had many health problems.
He played with the hearts of Captain Halkat, who took the lead in his well - designed defenses, and he kept his eye on Connor Goldson and those of Warrals.
Even so, Ranger’s movement declined.
As they were under the leadership of Gerard, they were less likely to fall than they were.
Their final game was nothing — they had just met a local organization — he was a kind of warning to the high - ranking Ranger.
A Visit to the Colon of Erdogan
On Saturday (September 29) when the Turkish and German leaders met for trial in Berlin, they were thrilled.
President Erdogan's argumentative German era is aimed at improving relations between Nato friends countries on the last day.
Human rights, the freedom of the media and the involvement of Turkey in the EU were at odds with their leaders.
Then, in order to open up a new building, he went to the capital city, Colon.
This city has the largest number of Turkish inhabitants outside Turkey.
The police explained why 25,000 people were safe in front of the police, but many supporters gathered near to see their leaders.
Hundreds of people — many of whom were court - martialed — also listened to their voices, denied permission from the German government to accept the threats of Erdogan and their country.
Some German Turks represented the parting image of these visitors, who were understood by some as heroes and who were regarded by others as having been commanded by them.

In Indonesia, earthquakes, hundreds of deaths in tsunamis, as well as the number of deaths
After a massive earthquake and tsunami on the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia struck large Latin borders, at least 384 people were killed, many of whom were killed on Saturday.
When hundreds of people gathered around the city on Friday morning, they climbed six meters (18 feet) high on the floor, many died of a car, and all of them were destroyed in the streets.
7.5 After the earthquake, this tsunami came.
"When the time came for the tsunami, people were working on the border, and they didn't leave immediately, and they were killed," said Sötopo Povo Nugroho of Indonesia's BNPB president.
"This tsunami didn't come together, in which Cars, Ondek, Homes were taken away, she tried everything on the ground," Nugorho continued, saying that this tsunami flew 800 kph (497 mph) from the open sea shortly before the tsunami hit the shore.
Some people went up and down trees to read from the tsunami.
About 167,600 people were taken safely to the 24 - center center of Pulum.
Many buildings and shops were destroyed by air raids carried on by nuclear power stations, explosions, and explosions.
Later, the neighboring city was still in an earthquake.
It was found in this part of the world, where 2.4 million people lived.
In a survey of Indonesia’s values and technological applications (BPPT), a survey revealed that over 200 times the number of atomic bombs dropped on Jerusalem during the second world war was more than 200 times the number of bombs released from the main earthquake in January.
It says that the city’s ruins, which were situated on the edge of the valley floor, would have grown to such an extent that it would have risen to a size greater than that of the ancient city.
Nugroho described the damage as being "dangerous" and said that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels have been damaged.
They reported that 540 people were injured and 29 injured.
Nougroho said that the area was close to the center of the earthquake, which could be more than 300 kilometers north of Paula, in the area called Dungala, and the number of deaths and damage.

The earthquake and tsunami devastated the region, and the resulting natural disasters devastated the authorities ’ efforts to save lives.
The authorities said that the army had begun airing Cargo from Zakarta and other cities, but the rescuers needed food and other basic supplies.
The city’s airport has only been reopened for relief work, and it will be closed until October.
The president will visit the relief centers in Pulum on Sundays.
The number of tsunami victims in Indonesia reached 800.
This is a serious matter.
While World Voices workers arrived safely in Palu City, the workers who had built the paper in their office were told that they had seen a look on the road, Mr. Doseba said.

According to Indonesia’s laws, only foreign officials, employers, and workers can travel there if the area is declared a national disaster.
It is no longer the case.
"It's a very difficult area," said an Indonesian Red Cross agent, Olivia Ariani.

Mr. Roa Roa Hotel said that just hours after the news of the fall in the Paraguayan community, they had sent a message of the fall of the Loa Roa Hotel to those who participated in the Beach Festival, where they had sent the Watts Map message.
Yet, their message, rather than two hidden traits, remained but only a single fictitious one.

So I am you, and I am yours.

Double-declining depreciation [d]
Since China is more active in Crim wisdom, American researchers and AI business kya-fuley say they work for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The United States has no official AI threat, at the same time after various parts of the U.S. government have announced the AI.
During the past year, China has begun its plan, which has been scheduled to become the No. 1 in the A.N. by 2030.
"Dubt AI research journal will be a good start, because all other countries are far behind the United States, and we are waiting for the next degree in AI," Li said.
In the United States, for example, U.S.A., U.S.A., U.S.A., reported a meeting this week with CNBC.
Lee's book "AI Superpowers: China, silicon Valley and The New World Order" has been published in the month by Hutton Miflin Harcortt. They are CEO of the Sinaiving Ventchers, a leading AI company in China.
In the 1980 ’ s, they worked on an AI system at the University of Carnegie Melan, which destroyed the most popular American atello player and later was the head of an exotic and Google’s Chinese branch in the Microsoft Research.
The defenses and research projects, such as the Robotics Challenge of the Agency, have been cited by former U.S. government experts and asked when the next attack will be to help people find the future.
In the United States, researchers say that it takes a lot of effort to get government benefits.
"Scientific scientists don't stop China, they're taking corporates," Li said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have appointed people from schools to work on AI for the past few years.
Li said that the changes in the immune system would also help the United States to intensify its efforts in its AI.
"I think I'm going to automatically get a Green Card for PhD in AI.
In July 2017, the Chinese government passed its plans for the next generation.
In the same way that the National Sciences Foundation in the United States and other government agencies provide money to researchers in China, China’s National Science Foundation has controlled people in scientific institutions, but China’s educational work is low.
At the beginning of this year, the U.S. Security Department set up a Joint Crime Center for Wisdom, where education and education will be part of the area, and White House announced the establishment of a select group with Crim wisdom.
And this month DARPA announced $2 billion in a leader named AI Next.
With regard to NSF, it employs more than $100 million a year in current AI research.
In the meantime, a U.S. law designed to create a national security application for cream wisdom has not been recognized for several months.
The Macedonians gave their country’s name to everyone.
The Macedonians decided to change their country's name to say "Republic of North Macedonia" to the government on Sunday, which would result in many decades of quarreling with Greece because Greece has banned their membership in the European Union and in NATO.
There is an area called Macedonia in Greece where they wish that the name of the neighbor in the north is the right to his country and that he has denied access to Nato and the EU.
The two governments signed a new name in June, which is based on a new name, but national opposers claim that this change in the name will result in the ethnicity of the number of people in Macedonia.
President George Ivanov said that in this universe we will not agree and that the number of balances will be at least 50 per cent in order to make the overall balance.
The question in the Universal Charter is, "Are we on the side of NATO and EU membership by accepting the agreement with Greece?"
In addition to President Zoran Zawan, supporters of the change claim that the EU and NATO are a valuable asset for Macedonia, which is a country that has come to the fore since the fall of Yugoslavia.
I have come to agree today on my country's future, for Macedonia's young people, since they can live freely under one picture of the European Union because this means a more secure life for all of us," said 79-year-old citizen Olivera Georgievescu.
Although not legally binding, many members of the society have said that we must comply with this principle so that we can make a decision.
This change in name will require a two-thirds majority in the society.
The National Electoral Organization stated that there was no irregularity until the second half of the second half of the year.
In 2016, however, only 16 percent of the total attendance was 34 percent, when 66 percent of the registered candidates said that they were not interested in the previous social election.
I've got to go out for my children, our place is in Europe," said the headmaster, 62 years old in Skopje, Tawansky.
On September 30, 2018, the President of Macedonia, his wife, Gorika, and his son Dosco, presented their opinion to the President of Macedonia on 30 September 2018. This change will open the door to entry into the NATO and the European Union.
In front of the school in Skopje, Vladimir Kvardarkov is a 54-year-old house with a small building built for those who leave the world.
We are on the side of Nato and the EU, but we want to participate, not through the back door," Kvardarkov said.
Our land is poor, but we are poor.
If they don't want us to be Macedonia, we can go to other countries such as China and Russia and be part of the Euro-Asian Union."
The president said that NATO membership would make it very necessary in Macedonia because there is more than 20 per cent of the daily rate here.
"I think that many people will support us because more than 80 percent of our citizens are supporters of the EU and NATO," Zayev said after he left.
They said, "Yes." If it comes out, it'll be, "A guarantee of our future."
A report published by the Institute for Police Research in Macedonia stated that 30 to 43 percent would participate in the general government — a percentage less than the required amount.
Another study by Thelma TV in Macedonia found that 57 percent of people planned to vote on Sunday.
It was estimated that 70 percent of the population would be left behind.
To succeed in all of this, it takes more than 50 percent to reach that conclusion.
If all this fails in the past year, the threat of the Western and Eastern governments that are in power will be a great shock.

After all, I'm the latest on the MP line, which was said we don't welcome, just because we're talking about it.
John Ryan, who was a member of my family, was treated the same way because she had taken a firm stand against prejudice.
For I was accused, because I had not consented to the judgment of Jeremiah the prophet.

Most of my eight - year - old experience as a local lab MP was the same as the GC's Saturday night meeting.
Unfortunately today, there is no such environment in many seats and the word of the government "more merciful, together," has always been forgotten if it really began.
This increase is evident in the fact that opposition is not tolerated in the flock, and each issue is rejected as a basis for accepting the leadership of the flock.
Soon after Jeremiah became leader, it began because I would be surrounded by colleagues I had previously expressed such political views and I would never have accepted any other role -- whether it was national security or the EU single market.

Ir 38 - 17 miles [17 km]: The underprivileged Irish capital arrived
The two cuts will have a positive effect on the final outcome, but there is no doubt that Ireland's remarkable-minoratory Tenents were the winner of this event's day in Premiership.
Now they are the chief priests, the one condemned among the ten.
Finally, their salvation was as beautiful as the great opportunity to take the opportunity, which gave both the local organization and the teacher Peter Mark the right to be happy.
"We've been tested so much for our game and we're still guilty, so I'm glad," he said.
Melrouz's Robin Christians said, "It's going to be ironic, they've been taking advantage of opportunities better than us."
The 14th-minute train from Grant Anderson, operated by Frazier Climodor, won Air, but a incoming card released by Variers for Scotland's Cap Rory Hughes, got Melrog's number, and Jason Baggett took the train for a crime.
Climony got a gun with a pentish iron before half-time, and then he turned the iron into a single train to get a gun at the time of the break.
But Melroz started off well in the second quarter and reduced the five points in the bag to the rear of Patrick Anderson's train.
Then, because of a serious accident in the Red Nott, the game was stopped for a long time, which had been taken from the stretcher and had since returned to Air Stafford McDowell.
The Irish Hangami dye was awarded after Blair Macpherson, and once again, Melroz took advantage of the extra game of Bruce Colvin's Triasah in a change in the end of his very heavy left.
The local organization then returned, but also took a card from the Penty Line-Out to the Bolvina Climo when it was received to the Strun Hachinson, and took the next Ierre after Macpherson left.
After David Armstrong’s box boxing took Kyle Row and sent him away for the fifth trip to the local organization, he changed his mind as he returned.
In the morning, we can enjoy a good time together as a family.
After learning that the Steel Game Star Ford Kirn was appointed director of the approved restaurant company, he took steps to return to the state of state.
This 56 - year - old man has played a role in the popular BBC show, where he writes his own essay and collaborates with Greg Hempfield, a long - term contestant.
This couple has announced that the new owner of this company will be the last one to come in, and that he will plan his life after the work in Kirnan Cregelg.
According to the official record listing, they are the drivers of the adreftmorn limitade.
Although a Scottish source indicated that the "favoured restaurant business" of Kirnin Glasgo would be part of the business, it also refused to comment on this point.
'The sea is ours' is the hope of Bolivia's globalist approach to the judicial system.
Galashi is being sent to the head office of the Riging-Clade in the West.
On public buildings, colorful flowers are poured into the sky.
But Titicaca appears to have written the following statement to the bottom of Nausea until the Amazon: "We have the right to the sea.
It's our job to get him."
The memory of the sea anchor lost in the bloody conflict with Chile in the 19th century in Bolivia is still alive today, and it is still alive to sail into the Pacific Ocean again.
That hope may be the most in this decade because Bolivia is waiting for a decision from the International Court of Justice on October 1st.
"Bolivia is fast, united and courageous, and that is what she looks forward to with determination," says Bolivia's President Roberto Kazedila.
Many Bolivians will see an Ecija census across the country, hoping that the ruling in Hegham will be elected in the direction of Bolivia – after the words of many decades - Chile has accepted the right to take part in the process of providing Bolivia with its own way to the sea.
Bolivia’s attractive local national leader Ivo Moreles — who are facing a fierce war for elections next year — is also dependent on a large number of Fridays.
At the end of August they promised, "We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean."
However, some analysts believe that the possibility of extradite by Bolivia is very low, and the situation will not change much.
The Netherlands-State Union has no authority to give Chile land, and they have maintained that they will not be affected by any possible speech.
Only six months after the election of Iceze, the final debate arose, which indicated that the campaign was "not a bandit," according to international law experts from Chile.
And it shall come to pass, that after four years they shall lay hold upon it for the sake of Bolivia.
"The current Bolivian government has been disappointed to find a way to the sea," Zurata said.
They suggested that the remains of the remains of the remains of the remains of the remains of Moralez.
At one time, Bolivian and Chinese will begin to speak, but afterward it will be very difficult to talk.
Since 1962, both countries have not changed.
The representative of Bolivia in Hegg, Maj. Eduardo Rodriguez Wellse, has expressed the conviction that the court’s decision is an unusual one.
"The summer of Bolivia will have a wonderful opportunity to start a new era of Chileese relations," he said, and will have the opportunity to put an end to an agreement for 139 years."
Moralez is still the most popular leader in Latin America, and Calzodi also rejected it and said that they were using the seabed as a political bridge.
"Bolivia Pacific will never leave our right to find the way to Madagascar," they continued.
"It's an opportunity to see what we're going to do in the future."
North Korea said that if you trust the U.S.
“ If the country does not trust Washington, ” said North Korea’s Foreign Minister Riyong, “it will never be enough for the first time.
At the same time, I was able to give a talk at a convention of Jehovah’s Witnesses in New York City.
They urged the nation to follow the words of the United Nations at its meeting in Singapore, U.S.A.
They believe that when the U.S. State Secretary of Mayo Pompio, Kim Jong of North Korea, in Singapore, was on his way back to the United States, more than three months after his visit.
Rey said it's a "visitor" that has made it possible for a press release and has kept the U.S. surfaces forever, which will end the Korean war and bring the North Koreans to the grave.
Washington, D.C., is a newsmagazine who acknowledges that Piongangang’s first - ever assault on drugs.
Kim and U.S. President Donald Tramp need another meeting.
However, Pyongyang is very likely to be serious about leaving his Bible literature, since this country understands only one way for his safety.
They plan to visit Pyongang in the next month to prepare for the second session between Pompio Kim Tripp.
In Paris’s fashion show, a large new class was presented to reach your neighbor’s main street.
Do not look at others if you want them to grow up in your neighborhood or if you want them to protect you from the sun.
The designers Valentino and Tom Brownie presented large-scale teams for their SS19 collections, which made Paris' fashionable style of eye-catching in fashion.
In recent times, such highly useful topics have appeared on the Instagram and have been sent by these designers to the cataclysms of their natural creations.
Valentino's long piece of paper was an over-d-top paint hat, which was decorated with a piece of wood like a pistons, which was painted on the heads of Models.
Among other things, there were precious gemstones made of gold, a magical hat, and an Annan — but they were not designed to wear your head.
Tom Brownie also presented a group of such leaders -- and they were also in Halloween.
Many of the colors were painted, and they looked much more like a Hannibal than a fan.
One design was like a scuba diving giraffe, where there were air and goblets, and another seemed like an isolated ice cream cone.
And if you can use this great deal of fashion statistics, you'll have yours.
These methods were designed to monitor the size of this group on the main road to your neighborhood.
High-size Hats appeared on the tops of 'la Lanba', two-footed rounds of wood, Stro Hats, Rihana and Emily Nightajosky.
This is a very unusual feature that has been referred to as the social media by sending another major design cataclysm -- a stereo bag, such as a young model that took a young kid from a movie set.
Rafia was cut off by Zalard, and a white sheet with a handle on the top was the best piece of the James Jamesmaze in the Rivoire SSS19 collection.
Well-known Stylist Luke Armitage told Fimel: 'I'm expecting big hits and mid-bags on the main road for the next winter -- design has made it difficult to ignore the demand for this large size device.'
John Edward: Language skills are needed for global citizens
Scotland's Free Schools maintains academic excellence, and it is also being held in 2018, which includes another set of extraordinary test results, which is given only to individuals and communities in games, art, music and other social instruments.
With more than 30,000 students in Scotland, these schools are represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCS), which are dedicated to their students and parents.
Free schools are designed to prepare their students for higher education, for their chosen career, and for their place in the world.
As an educational field, a well - known school curriculum can be developed and organized, resulting in modern languages for a popular and desired choice in schools.
They said to the assembly, "If you speak with a man in the language of his heart, he will go to his head.
"If you speak in the language of someone who understands, it is simple in his own heart.
It's a very important thing to remember that we can't just rely on English to establish relationships and faith with people from other countries.
As a result of recent tests in India, we can see that there are high levels of speaking among the most influential in schools.
The 68 percent of the students who learned foreign languages received a high grade A.
According to data collected from 74 SC's members from the schools, 72 per cent of students in Madrid received high grades, 72 per cent German students, 69 per cent French students and 63 per cent Spanish students in Madrid.
This shows that free schools in Scotland support foreign languages that will need children and young people in the future.
As a matter of choice, language is now considered to be the subject of free schools and other STEMs (scientific, technology, engineering, and mathematics).
In 2014, Yuke’s survey of the daily population and the polls revealed that for reasons given by the organizers, there were 17 per cent of the lower number of cases of language deficits due to the reasons given by the Authority for filling the space.
Therefore, language skills are increasingly needed to prepare young people for their future careers.
With the increased potential for language work, these skills have been needed in a world that has become globalized.
If they have learned another language, they may be able to enjoy a measure of success in the future.
The ability to communicate freely with people of a foreign background will help make it possible for an immigrant to become fluent in his or her own language.
In 2013, according to U.S.A., over 4,000 adults in the United States could not speak a foreign language, and only 15 percent could speak French in two languages.
That is why the teaching of languages today is so important.
If there are many languages, especially those of the developing world, they will provide a good opportunity for their children to have a meaningful share in the ministry.
In Scotland, each school teaches different languages.
Many schools focus more on modern languages, while others teach languages that are considered the most important for Yuka by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Even if your child is at school, there are many languages in which he can choose from, and there is also a qualified teacher in the field.
The Scotsian Free Schools are dedicated to providing a educational environment that will prepare students for and improve them in the future.
At this time, a global business cannot deny that language is of paramount importance to the country’s future, so it is impossible to be in a representative education.
Indeed, modern languages need to be considered as "International Dialogue Councils".
This choice, diversity, and excellence will continue for young people in Scotland’s free school.

Lebron San Diego is to be sacrificed on Sundays
For example, when he was in his late teens or early 20 ’ s, he found himself in a very difficult situation.
Luke Walton, a lecturer for Lechers, announced that James San Diego will play against the Newgates in the early morning of Sunday morning.
But he still has to decide how many minutes he will play.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," said Walton on the official website of Lakers.
The report by Mike Trudel has tweeted that James is likely to play within minutes.
On Sunday this week, James asked about his plans for the previous six games of Leckers.
He said, "I don't need to play before I get ready for this stage of my career."
The time when I was on my way to West Virginia, U.S.A., U.S.A., U.S.A.
The president of the Watch Tower Society, Donald Tramp, launched a campaign to spread the good news in West Virginia by night.
The first of the five determined religions of the next week were Ralei, who stood on their suitable places with Tennessee and Mississippi.
By blocking his stand for his election to fill a position of independence in the Supreme Court, he aims to stand up for the mid-term elections that had arrived in November because he is afraid of losing control of the Republican Congress.
How does Raleigh, who lives in West Virginia, deal with the trauma tonight, and how can you see it online?
The trip's sailing is scheduled to take place at the Raley Seintime in West Virginia. It is scheduled to take place tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can see on-line live streams on Rale Yutub, West Virginia.
A member of the Supreme Court may refer to this week’s report by Bret Cawano, who has been disturbed by the charges of sexual immorality, which has prevented a Senate from having a week to check.
However, the main purpose of these talks is to help the people of November to get some speed towards the upcoming elections.
Thus, the preacher of the trumpet said that this next week's five religions "the aim of the Republicans Senate and House of Representatives is to maintain and increase their enthusiasm in self-serving and support," says Reuters.
"The control of Congress is so important for their work that as we go through this busy preaching campaign, national leaders can travel to as many countries as possible," said a spokesman to the trumpet announces his name.
Wesbanko, who is appointed for Erina at Willing tonight, says: "Raly can be a great support from Ohio and Pennsylvania and can be obtained from Pittsberg," West Virginia Metro News said.
The second visit to West Virginia will take place in one month, where they won more than 40 per cent of their prizes in 2016.
The West Virginia Republikasen Senate, which is located in the Tramp elections, is trying to help Patrick Morici on Monday morning.
"It's not a good idea for Morici to come to help him in these elections," said political scientist Simon Head of the West Virginia University.
Reuters Cup 2018: The U.S.
After three sessions, on Saturday afternoon, the window gave a show that the driver wanted.
The two of the Helkaves are a whole set of games, but it's one thing that the games believe in, and it's never more than that.
They will then say, ‘ Where is that? ’
"They had six numbers, and now it's four, so I think we're going to get some speed now," Jordan Smith said on the last day.
Europe is in the right position, that is, four points ahead and twelve others in the game.
According to the U.S.A., Spit says there's a lot of wind on their roads, and they have a lot to encourage, not just because of the form of Spith and Justin Thomas, who played together every day and each got three numbers from four.
The Bible says: “The head of every man is the Christ; in turn the head of a woman is the man; in turn the head of the Christ is God. ”
When he and Thomas were both in the background, the four of them made a significant contribution.
When he was 15 years old, he was responsible for his son's death, which made you know that he believes that Americans are still in danger.
"You really want to make a lot of effort now and take care of your face," said Spith.
Each game has its own game of its own.
There are 18 hotels to create a brand.
In the last two days, more games than Smith and Thomas — Francesco Molinary and Tommy Fletwood — have been discussed in the debate on the radar.
There were four or four pairs of Europeans on the board, and there was no fault in them.
"Moliwood" was the only pair that couldn't shoot a book twice a week, but they also avoided a book twice a week in the morning, on Friday and supported the new one in the morning.
He was running, and behind this alarming crowd, he felt that they were just playing games on Sundays, and there was no other popular game to win, as was the case with Le Golf National.
There are two different hotels at the same time that are more suitable.
However, the story of the European Union was soon to come to an end.
The Bobba Watson and the Web Simpson reduced the work of Sergio Garcia, who was responsible for morning baseball, when he was married to Alex Noren.
The Spanish and Swedish that had two pairs of bungalows on the New Front Bridge never reached a closet of a hole.
On Sundays, there was no one to help you with your lunch.
The couple had good communication, advice, and counsel that they had not given, and there was a time when they needed to change.
As an organization, Europe has played a key role in the last days, but during this forum, the team of U.S.
Europe took 10-6 on the last day of the Rider Cup.
After coming out of the forums and forums on Saturday, Europe will benefit from a strong benefit on the last day of the 10-6th anniversary of the Reuters Cup in the United States.
Tommy Flitwood and Francisco Molinary, a married couple who fought with Tiger Woods, took the lead with two winners and took the golf course on four issues.
Two years ago in Hezelltin, the 3-1 World War II in the morning tried to keep track of the European team of Thomas Georgen.
The Europeans were more opposed to the Forum, and they won the favor of the Doctor, but they were not able to do any harm.
To keep the organization in focus, Jim needed eight of the 12 single sisters in front of him on Sundays.
Fleetwood is the first European game to win four points in the line, and he and Molinary, who were called "Moliwood", were all the same in their early four faces in the history of the Rieder Cup.
After surprised Woods and Patrick Reeds in Fortbols, they spent more than five and four years playing chess for the frustrated Woods and the Great Depression of the United States.
The Woods, which had been pulled by two harbors on Saturdays, would show the wonder of excellence, but he was now surprised by 19 and seven of his 29 faces in Forebols and Forsam.
In the morning, Justin Day, who was resting at the Forebols, returned to the Forum with the participation of Henry Stences, and Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, one and three of the world’s top rankings.
There was nothing to do with Europe in the day when a south-western Parisian and Havre was a skirmisher.
Three times the main winner, Jordan Smith and Justin Thomas, set up a scale for Americans on a Saturday with two issues.
They won 2 Anni1 in the Concealed of John Ram and Ian Polter in Forebols, Spain, and then, after losing two initial halls in Forsems, they used Politer and Rory McCallroy as a surprise at 4 Ani3.
Although it takes only one clue to keep the former Führer's watch, it has also occurred twice that a company used four numbers in the history of the Rider Cup to go to the Singlings.
And after two days they looked, and, behold, it was a sabbath. And they were all without the camp.
North Korea has refused to become a bird of prey without trust
The National Council of North Korea told the United Nations on Sunday that the United States continues to rely on permanent restrictions, and in such a situation, it will not leave the country alone on its own.
Reyong said in his annual session of the World Organisation that North Korea had done "the most significant method of droughts" last year, such as halting the testing of oil and fuel, the destruction of nuclear testing sites, and the promise not to increase clothing and technology.
"But we didn't find any response from the U.S.," they said.
"No confidence in our national security in the U.S. and we will not compromise ourselves in any way at first."
Where Rinie's "topy" was re-examined with North Korea's ongoing complaints about Washington's opposition, including the fact that the North Koreans would be forced to leave the north, their argument is significant, which did not allow Pingangang to close their own invitation as soon as possible.
The first meeting held on June 12 in Singapore between the U.S. and North Korean leaders during the Reini process referred to a series of joint statements by Kim Jong and Donald Traps, in which Kim promised to work towards "close the Korean island of disintegration", while the trumpet gave us protection from North Korea.
North Korea calls for an end to the Korean war in 1950-53, but the United States says Pyongang should leave his clothes first.
Washington also objected to the request to follow up on the difficult international obstacles imposed on North Korea.
"The U.S. is strengthening the first "stopping of civilization" and the pressure is increasing through obstacles to achieve their goals, and the declaration of the end of the war is also increasing," said Rei.
"It will bring us to our knees, but it will be the thought of those who don't know us.
But the problem is that we're losing our confidence because of our constant opposition."
Rey didn't mention any of the plans for the second session between Kim and Trump, which were mentioned by the U.S. leaders at the beginning of this week.
Instead, they denounced the three seats between the leaders of Kim and South Korea in the past five months, and said, "If South Korea had one side to stop the process of decommissioning, and if it hadn't been for the U.S., it wouldn't have been a candidature for the Korean island."
However, the sun was different from the last year when they spoke to the U.S. General Assembly that North Korea's rockets were not able to target the main part of the U.S., when Mr. Ivil President's trumpet called Kim a "rocket man" on the goal of suicide.
In the United States this year, which had threatened North Korea "completely destroyed" last year, they commended Kim for her courage for her efforts to avoid alcohol abuse, but said that she still wanted to do more and that she had to continue to resist until the North Korean Revolution was over.
Wednesday, the trumpet said that they had no windows for this, they said, "Jeri started two years, three years, or five months -- no difference."
China and Russia argued about it in the U.S., and they should be given a pingangang for the security products.
However, the U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompio U.N. said in his safety report: "The security ban must continue to continue and must continue until the end and the end of the investigation."
Security reports have been jointly banned from North Korea since 2006.
And they went out to meet Pompio, and said in the public sitting, They will come again to Pjonggang to prepare another meeting in the next month.
Pompio has already visited North Korea three times, but his last visit was not good.
In July they left Pyongyang because they've made progress, only for North Korea, in a few hours, they're "demanding" for this announcement.
In this month, North Korea promised that if it applied to the United States, they would destroy its site and its compound."
They said Kim told them that the "related applications" they wanted, that is, the security security promised by Trump in Singapore would go up to normalize the relationship between us and Washington.
Herd’s students are determined to take sufficient rest.
This year, the Harvard University offers a new school for all its former students to sleep in order to face the marijuana culture that has been developed by the Kafen-Sevenna.
One scholar found that it was often uninformed about how to care for a certain number of students in the world.
Professors of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist Charles Chizler at Brigim and Women’s Hospital have designed a study program that is thought to have been the first time in the U.S.
And when they were come out of the sleep, straightway they received the saying, and were sore amazed, and spake of the things which were done.
At the end of this she came to me, saying, "Why did this thing happen to me in my last year?
She said, "No one told her about the importance of sleep, which I was amazed at."
The program presented earlier this year explains how students need good sleep habits for their work and for their normal health.
Paul Breera, professor of mental health at Harvard Medical School and health - care professionals at the university, said that after finding that the student had been severely paralyzed from sleep for eight weeks, the school decided to start the study.
This one - hour study program is one of the most rewarding goals anyone can pursue.
In one area, there is a picture of a dorm room where students take coffee, the effects of caffeine and light and less sleep, and the importance of cortants, teachers, and books on the importance of bedtime rules.
In other parts of the world, it is reported that prolonged sleep increases the risk of heart attacks, strokes, strokes, strokes, and heart failure.
After the project of the Campus, Ikonsa and I encouraged the participants to consider their schedule.
"We know that this will not change students' behavior immediately.
But we believe that they have the right to know, as you have the right to know about the health consequences of smoking."
The culture of pride is still in existence, in which modern science and the constant pressure on students was a growing problem.
A secret weapon to control the student’s anxiety, fatigue, and anxiety is to make sure that the right level of sleep is kept safe, and they say, “I’m going to avoid spending too much money, because if you put it away from sleep, it’s gone, and it keeps them out of it forever. ”
The 19-year-old Raymond Gold Professor Chizler, a professor of chemistry and physics, helped design the curriculum that they took during his first year in Harvard last year.
And he said, The officers opened his eyes, and commanded that they should bring him into the village.
He hopes that in the next article, all the students will be told that they must complete such a program before they can enter the university.
Professor Chizler has recommended that students be warned when to go to sleep and when to get up, and that they be careful about the harmful effects of the 'low Light' triggered by electronic screens and LEDs, which will separate your body from the light of your body, which will cause problems with sleep.
Livingstone 1 - 0 Rangers: The gang of Maga showed no respect for Gerard’s organization
Reagers had another decision when Dolly Magga's strike took place in Livingstone at 1 to 0 of the organization's division of Steven Gerard.
After winning 4-1 in February in St. Johnston, the IYB was on their way for their first victory, but Gary Holt’s organization had only the second 18 games to host Gerard, with eight points more far from the front of the Ladbrox Premiership.
The gang of Rangers, who were less than half an hour ago, never saw the gang of Rangers working together.
Now that the Rangers are on the sixth floor, Livingstone has reached the third floor, and they are only following the Hybrid.
And there may be other problems for Rangers because one object has to be treated for the damage caused on the head of the linsman column.
Gerard changed his organization eight times, which followed the changes of Ireland in the Betfried Cup.
On the other hand, Holt, who played with the 11 Levites who had a number from the Hearts in the past week, and how every turn of their opponents was to be with their beautiful moves, he was very happy.
Even though Rajers ’ heavy load was more heavy, Livingston used more than his chandeliers.
It could only be scored in two minutes when the first-time Le-off sent Scott Pittman into the cave of An McGregor, but Midfielder took his great chance.
The Kigan Jacobs sent to the Free-Cheap Color Holket, but his defensive partner, Alan Lithgo Back Poster, arrived.
But the children of this city were not worthy to be called according to the custom of the feast, because their new faith was waiting for them.
Alfredo Morlos and Steven Loles were determined to obtain a penance on the market, but Alfredo Steven Thompson dismissed the Columbian app.
Rangers were targeted by only two front-haf shots, but Magi Ibrox Golkiper, the leader of the Liamed Lasana Colibeli and the undamaged strike by Ovie Izeria.
Lewis was against the first 34th-minute golf game, but no one will regret his efforts.
Re-discovering the set of Jacobs in the Ranger's Dip failed.
After Declan Golger gave the Chendau Scott Robinson no response to the Scotsfield, which quietly chose the needle for easy performance.
Gerard called at the Royal Cant in Brek, and demonstrated his ability to work, and the results of the change were immediate. Morloss, in Winger, came from his line to block the violent player.
However, Lithgo and Holkat killed a boxer, and Livingston continued to play with the visitors in their favorite way.
In the latter case, Holt’s light could have increased their intensity, but he stood firm to protect Jacobs until Lithgo’s departure from the cannon.
Reynthes’s substitute game, Glen Medalton, later complained to Jacobs about his work on the bridge, but Thomas did not notice it again.
Almanac: Searcher for the Gegar counter
And now a page in our "Sande Morninging" Almanac: 136 years ago, 30 September 1882 days ago, and even more... this day the future physicist Jonas William "Hans" was born in Germany.
Gigare developed a method to search for and measure the microorganisms, which led to the search for a device called the Gigare Counter.
Since then, the main entrance to science has also become the pop artist of the major entrance, such as the "Bels of Coronado" in the 1950 film "Bels of Coronado" that appeared on the radio Rogers and Del Evans:
And he said, "What is it?"
Rogers: "This is a Gegar counter that is used to search for a nuclear bomb like uranium.
And when ye blow an alarm, ye hear the sound of the trumpet, and the trumpet shall sound the trumpet.
Evans said, "They're popping now!"
In 1945 the death of Hans Giger, their 63rd birthday, was only a few days off.
But their name was called Rachel, and their name was Ham.
The new laser system in Kerkerga will be taught to 'pass' the bad side of the disease
The new L.A. in Kerkerga will teach the sickening power of the disease and teach them to kill.
LS teaches the patient’s immune system to identify harmful parasites as part of the treatment
In this way, the patient’s patient’s legs are replaced by the patient’s right hand.
After that, many cancers can be contracted and then retraced in the body.
This study shows a positive effect on the properties of various cancers.
When a woman was treated by a doctor who taught her to identify the disease system, she found that her kidney cancer had gone out for more than 18 months.
In this way, patients are removed from the patient’s patient’s patient’s body and changed to the hospital, where they can be replaced by the common “drug” that is common in many patients called HER2 and then reattached to the body.
The president of the U.S. National Caser Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, who said, "Our results suggest that we have a lot of hope."
HER2 "There are a number of causes to increase carcinogens," according to President Berzofsky, which includes stems, dimmgrantis, funfus and colorectal carcinogens.
Similarly, the “learning” of blood clots is used in a form of blood clotting system to remove the patient’s legs from the lungs and release them from the cancer.
After their presence in the SNL, Kenya West hit the MAGA HAT, and they hit the trumpet side.
He doesn't like it.
After a demonstration in the Cany West in which they praised the U.S. nationalist Donald Tramps and told them to fight in the election in 2020, people recorded their events in the studio during their Septemberday Night Live.
After singing a third song at night, they fought against the Democrats and once again declared their support for the trumpet.
"When I spoke to a young man, saying, 'How do you like tropics? They're from the family.'
If I were concerned about family life, I would have left America a long time ago."
SNL did a scan at the beginning of the show, which included the role of Matt Demon, in which the Hollywood Star had exposed the witness of the synnett by the court of justice to the charges of sexual harassment by Christine Blaise.
Although this was not popular, the West Bank’s fashionist artist Chris Rock released on social media.
It is not yet clear whether the West was trying to play with rock.
In addition, the West complained to the overseers that his head had to endure a severe beating.
"They put pressure on me after school.

And we are also free."

Game of Thrones Star Kitt Harington solved the issue of identity
Kit Harington is known for his sword fighter John Snow in the game oftrons, a violent medium - sized HBV.
However, 31 - year - olds complained about Herod’s success, saying that such roles on the screen should make young children more likely to be respected.
When he spoke to the artist, Kitt said that he believed in 'the truth is wrong' and asked how to deal with the issue of identity in #MeToo's community.
Recently, his partner in the game of Thorns, 31-year-old Rose Lesley, admits that he wants 'very strong' to solve the problem.
'What's wrong with my personality?' they said.
'What do we teach them about the problems we are seeing now when people are growing up?'
Kitla believes that the most deadly deaths in television are responsible for some of the growth in the media.
They say, 'Is he born, and what is taught?
Do they feel that what they are taught on television and on the streets should also have a special place for young people to be men?
I think this is really one of the big problems in our time -- how should we change them?
For there is certainly something wrong with the young children."
In the interview he admitted that after the end of the game oftrons in the next few months, he didn't want to prequire it or squeal it, but he's 'he's beaten up and killed horses'.
Since November, Kit Sam Schaferd has been working in the backyard of the Tru West, a filmmaker and his brother.

HIV/AIDS: 14% increase in new cases in China
China reported a 14 - percent increase in its cities of HIV and AIDS.
According to health authorities, there are more than 820,000 people in the country.
In the second year of 2018, there were about 40,000 new cases.
Many of the new ones in the group were subjected to physical abuse, which is a reflection of the changes in the world today.
In some parts of China, HIV was rapidly spreading blood.
But this happened in Greece, that the number of people who were infected with HIV was very small.
However, the number of HIV and AIDS-related people in China has increased by 100,000 per year.
The HIV virus is a major problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Since 1997, there has been no crime against homosexuality in China, but there has been a growing gap between the Elzbits.
The study concludes that 70 - 90% of men and women marry at least two women because of the country’s high standards.
In many cases, such relationships have been affected by other diseases.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised global access to HIV drugs as part of its efforts to address the problem.
Mackin Waters refused to break the data of the GOP Signator and said there was 'hazardous fraud' and 'dangerous fraud'.
U.S. Republican Mackin Walters, one of her employees criticized three U.S. senators for posting personal information on the media's Wikipedia sites.
The Democrats of Los Angeles specifically told the fans that they had been given air by "the right-hand group" planes and websites.
"Treaty, fraud, and even more hateful lies," said Watson in his tweet on Twitter.
According to a report published by the U.S.
The information posted by the Senate panel on sexual misconduct in the Supreme Court of the Court of First Instance was found online during the hearing of the Senate panel of sexual misconduct.
After examining the three synenters, she became ill.
Gateve Pundit and Radstadt reported that the post-recognitioned IP card was related to the Waters office, and a Waters worker reported that Dr. Heil.
"These accusations are completely wrong and are false in the minds," said Walters.
"A member of my staff -- whose identity, personal information and security have been distorted by fraud and false accusations -- is not responsible for breaking this information in any way.
These false accusations are all wrong, and they're all lies in their mouths."
A recent online attack on Walter’s claim included the White House’s prime press, Ari Flescher.
"It's easy to refuse," the flasher writes.
"It shows that her own membership of Congress is not a matter of becoming a member.
They should not be provoked when they are accused of something they have not done.
They were not to be neglected.
They do not want to take sides with those who claim to be Christians.
They need peace and happiness."
The reaction of Flesher Walters was seen as the judge of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, who was accused of being very angry during the hearing of the war.
On the other hand, many of the people who attended the Memorial of Christ’s death were deeply moved by what they read in the Bible.
"Well, it's very big," they tweeted.
In their question, Walters said that their office "has indicated the proper authorities and law enforcement agencies about these frauds.
"We will ensure that the criminals are exposed," he said, "and they will be held liable for all such acts of violence and threats to any or any member of my staff."
John English Strings Agen - The secret video of the less effective Rowan Atxination
In any new film, British art has now succeeded in reaching the results of Brexit, and this Johny English Action-Commedi Widmingen French - which started to be Johnny English in 2003 and was reborn in 2011 as Johnny English Reborn.
How much do we really value the new country's exports?
In any case, the disabled Johnny English has been re-introduced into the English of Rabbiry's face a second time - he is reminded by his name that he has a great comical design for those who see cinemas in the English field.
He is certainly an intelligent secret agent who, although killing various glimmers of glass, he feels a little bit like Clauso (Murky Police) and who contributes a note in the Chariots of Fire Theme in the 2012 London Olympics Explosion Office.
The book Atkinson, based on a travel and deep - rooted international character who has once been forgotten by Barclaykard TV, has added to his confusion.
This latest JJ film also has one and a half hours.
I wore John English middle - aged clothes and went to the helicopter, and he liked the theme as he played his harps and bells.
The offer of physical petition received by Atkins appears to be very low, and in particular, it seems extremely unnecessary to include the petition as a part of the country as a part of the "generic" film brands such as the mission impossibilities.
I don't think it's like planning for young children, and I don't think it's the idea and the focus of the motion picture of the action panel.
Now the general basis of the issue is that Great Britain is in serious trouble.
A cyber-hacker Britain's top-secret Web site reveals the identity of all British employees who are surprised by the agency's role - Kevin Elden.
It is hoped that the last requirement of Ugar and Bandakhor and of the political population that has already begun is: Emma Thompson has lost a lot of weight like yours, but she has no choice but to do something else.
Her secret counselors point out that every active secret will have to bring something that she has chosen because of the information she has received.
And this means that stupid Johnny English is working as a school teacher in the current Elishan district and giving out a series of studies on how to make secret surgery: there are some six types of contests here because the English school makes the rock-type hero.
English is again called in Whitehall in a crisis and is met with Boss with his long-term partner, who played the role of Bill Miller.
Bo is now married, he married a Sumerian commander, a Jolly-Hocky-Stix role in which the ability of a artist like Viki Pepperdin has been exercised.
Batman and Robin come in the secret ministry of every magician, facing a beautiful woman from Olga Kurlenco, O’Bulletova.
In the meantime, the threat posed by the Krishma Tek Corododad, who claims to be able to solve the problems of the British computer, comes under the threat of a terrorist attack by Jackson Volta, who was killed by Jack Lassie.
The English and Boe begin their march at the moment: they fire a French restaurant in the summer of the day; they fire their own pictures of the wolf’s elephants; and the English asks the priest to take them to the bottom of the Volt’s house for granted.
For the last days have passed away in vain, and also now has come to nothing; but now that it has come to pass, as a snare and a trap.
A lot of content.
And just like other English films, I wondered, couldn’t British film star Rowan Atkinson play a role?
Leber’s party decided that the British would work four days a week and make five days ’ pay
The German Corbins report that the British Party is planning to work four days a week and take five days off.
The party believes that the owners of the company must pay the money they have saved for a single day's salary.
For this cause the workers will receive three days' wages in the week, but they will not fast in the harvest.
According to sources, this idea is "sudden" in the financial journals and threats to attract workers to the country of birds.
The Trade Union Congress has approved a four-day reminder of how workers can benefit from changing circumstances.
A Green Leber Party source told The Indian Times: 'This year, changes in threats are expected to be announced.
'It's not going to happen at night, but the memory of four-day work is a sign that works in the hands of workers that is related to the view of the bird to restore the situation as well as the whole of the bird's potential protection.'
This is not the first part of the opinion, but the Green Party promised four-day work week in their 2017 public election.
Even so, the party did not fully approve of the present approach.
The authors of the Liberian party said: 'The four-day workdays are not protected by the party, but not by the birds.'
John McDonald’s comments about the social order of the system were made more widely available by means of a recent series of articles.
Mr. MacDonal said they're determined to take power from the company's 'non-faced operator' and user companies.
The plan of the authorities also means that current seafarers will not be able to recover their entire assets because they can be forced by the government to 'response' on the basis of what they see there.
They also promoted plans to set up a total of 10 per cent of the social partners in the areas where workers could be admitted to the company's management bodies, and to establish a total of 10 per cent of their annual income.
A study by the FBI on Kavanu's change of mind told Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy "60 minutes"
The investigation into the charges against Justice Bret Kwanu has raised a question as to whether any members of the Republican side can be duly supported by the Bureau for at least one week.
In a meeting held on Sunday, the newspaper Scott Pelly, "60 minutes", asked Senator John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham of the Republican side whether EfBIA could change their mind.
And he said unto them, Candida, which is in the south of Carlin, hath a willing spirit.
"Oh, of course," said Kennedy.
"I went to the court of justice, and spoke to the judges of Kavanu.
All of this happened, and then I called them and asked, 'What did you do?'
They were deaf, dumb, and unchaste."
In time, however, he found himself faced with the question of whether he would be able to stand up for what he knew to be right.
"My decision is about Bret Kwana and it can change a big deal," they said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know that Bret has rejected him in full technology," Graham Christine Blasie continued referring to Ford.
"and could not criticize anyone she named.
It was June 36.
I don't think there's gonna be any new changes in this."
Have they done anything to eliminate the poverty of the world’s citizens?
In New York on Saturday, the annual Global Sitisan Festival is organized and will be part of the most powerful stars in the world, and the goal of the summit is as strong as ever; it is the birth of world poverty.
In the seventh year of the Global City Festival, thousands of people gathered to announce the true purpose of this school. It is meant to bring the world's Danish poor to 2030.
The Global City Festival, which started in 2012, is an extension of the Global Porterty Project, which hopes to increase the number of people who are trying to eradicate poverty and to eradicate poverty.
To get access to this library (if you don't want to buy the VIP portal), you need to do some work or "work" of the school's entire property, such as working as a volunteer to promote their global development, emailing a world leader, removing or relying on any other important route.
But how successful has the global city been when it was 12 years old?
The idea of creating a free music show for people is a true way to encourage people to do what they think is just another kind of "cliktivism" that people think they're doing right on an online website or sending a TV that doesn't make any difference?
Global City says that since 2011, their supporters have had more than 19 million "work" notes for different purposes.
They say that global leaders have been helped to promote more than $3700 million or more of regular promises and theft, which will affect more than 225 million people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group illustrated 390 promises and declarations created by them, of which at least $1,000 has already been distributed or collected.
It is estimated that as many as 649 million people around the world have been affected by this trend.
Some of the important promises include the power of innovation. The power of innovation is part of the policymakers and organizers in the U.S., who are "helping small children to progress with their full potential" and who are promised to pay $35 million to the country to avoid pollution in Rwanda after more than 4700 from citizens around the world.
With the help of the U.S. government, donors, national governments and other world citizens like you, we can make a community like a class of social injustice in the history of poverty," said the Deputy President Tracy Olman of Power in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 efforts were made to improve the clothing of mothers and children in the United States, the government announced that it would give power to the paper project, which would reach 50 million women and children.
"Why do you think we can eradicate poverty in a very bad way?"
And the Global City said, "This is a big and difficult road, and sometimes we fall and fail.
However, we will succeed as long as our rights and our differences are those of general interest, since our strength is increased as a result of our unity.
Janet Jackson, The Vicend, Sean Mandices, Cardie B, Jean-Mone will be one of the most famous artists in New York City's annual college.
Can use the U.S. Notation to block Russia's vertical export
Washington Examiner, U.S. International Fair Zinc, explained that Washington would use "if necessary" to prevent entry into other markets in the Middle East.
Zink has claimed that Russia’s participation in Syria, especially where Russia is working at its official government’s invitation — that of seeking new markets in Urje.
"They're in the middle of the world because I think they're trying to figure out Urje as part of the south of Europe," Zink says.
These are the ways of man, according to the word of men.
They said, "If you need to make sure that the seaways are open to ensure that they don't reach the market, then the ability to freeze is due to the United States.
The Zink Consumer Energy Alliance was speaking to a group that worked on the principle of nafa, which was organized by a group that called themselves "The Voice of the Urja Churches" in the U.S.
They compared Washington’s roles with those of Russia and Iran and showed that they were equally effective.
"The use of the engines and the use of the replacement engines is less than the quality option for Iran and Russia," they said to Russia as "Van Trik Ponie" and said that Russia's natural life is dependent on the engine.
This process has been carried out as the regime tries to replace Russia with its own choice of own.
According to the U.S. President Donald Trump, the authorities of the government of Trump are trying to get Germany out of the "Inadequate" project of the North Stream 2 pipeline project. According to the trumpet project, Berlin has "crazed" Berlin.
Moscow once again stresses that 1100 million dollars’s North Stream 2 pipeline project is a fully quality project that will double the current pipeline’s capacity and will be 11,000 cubic meters.
Cremlin argues that the opposition to this project from Washington is only for economic reasons, and it is an example of injustice.

"After November 6, I will pay close attention to the presidential election."
President Donald Tramp said "This account was headed in the wrong direction," Warren argued with Town Holderman Temp.
He said, "I'm very concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to his people."
Warren is making a clear statement when he accuses Camp and Kwanu of being named in the Supreme Court.
In a Twitter post last February, Warren said, "We must have an AFB's test before the end of the day."
However, a well - known vision revealed that most people in Warren’s own ranks do not think they should fight the presidential election in 2020.
According to the Safoke University Political Research Center/Boston Global Pool, eight percent of the masssets said that Warren should not vote.
Twenty - one percent of the population supported this choice.
This morning's survey revealed that Major Governor Patrick received 38 per cent of support for the possible election and 48 per cent of opposition.

The number of dead in search of the dead has increased dramatically in the search for the living
The situation was even worse for the animals. The Bible says that “the sons of the true God began to notice the daughters of men, that they were good - looking; and they went taking wives for themselves, namely, all whom they chose. ”

The U.S. Prime Minister accused China of ‘dangerous’
After the official Chinese newspaper published four pages on U.S. business profits in a U.S. daily, the U.S. government decided to use the U.S. government press to preach to farmers for one week.
After he accused the president of the U.S. president Donald Trencht of having been embroiled in the elections of the United States Congress on Monday, November 6, in China, which had been fired by China - the most expensive newspaper in the state of Ayowa - admiring the Chinese daily in the register of 12 Mines.
China's attack on the US elections is a new chapter in Washington's growing pressure on China, as the U.S. authorities told Reuters.
While it is common for foreign governments to issue commercial advertising, today’s growing trade in Beijing and Washington appears to have been the result of their overcrowding imports.
China and U.S. experts say that the construction of the anti - Semitic shell at the beginning of the trade started in China to influence exporters in such countries as the Ayoyo tribes that supported the war.
The long-term government of Aiowa, who exported agricultural land to China, said Teri Branstad of China, said that Beijing had damaged American workers, farmers and businesses.
In an article in the Moins Register on Tuesday afternoon, Branstad writes, "China is now reluctant to publish a press release on our own paper."
"The Chinese government has published a free speech in the Ten Mines to preach its own message and has benefited from the American press's free speech and media," says Branstad.
"On the contrary, the anti-Surrender magazines on the streets of Bijing find that the sun does not reflect the real representations of the people of China's different ideas on the problem of China's economic movement, as China's media is under heavy control," they write.
They went on to say, "One of China's main newspapers has made an offer to publish their articles," but they didn't mention the name of the newspaper.
Pre - Middle Eastern researchers have warned that women are being abused by the paralyses of the Republic of Cawano
Researchers have warned that many major republics are standing alongside Brit Kawano, the leading court official of various cases of sexual violence, who has been warned that female genital mutilation will occur during the early Middle Ages.
This is so strong that most of the republics are reluctant to agree with it.
It can't go any further," said Grant Reyhar, president of the University of Maxwell, of the University of Zurich, in an article published in The Hill on Saturday.
Rihar said that Senator Jeff Flick (Ar-Arison) wondered whether the offer to examine the FBI would be sufficient to satisfy the hungeriest criteria.
According to Washington D.C. Newspaper, "Women will not forget what happened tomorrow - they will not forget tomorrow and will not forget in November," said Carin Jean-Pierre, chief adviser to the rebel group on Friday, Muvon and the national expert.
On Friday morning, after a witness from Dr. Kristin Blasie Ford, the director of the judicial committee, Republiquíni Kavano, who supported the director of Kawano's appointment, announced that the supervisors in the Sinait Valley are coming "November!" said Mike.
"Democrat's zeal and movement are taking over," political analyst Stu Rodenburg told the news site.
"People say they're already on the top; they're true.
But it can also increase, especially for the stable women in the city, as well as for young people aged 18 to 29, when the country doesn't like them."
Even before the public evidence of her sexual harassment against a person named by the Supreme Court, it was suggested that if researchers agreed with the credentials of the Republican authorities, they could be punished.
"This has now become so deep for the GOP," says NBC News, the head of the National Council of the Republican, Michael Steele, quoted earlier last week.
"It's only about the subject or the last subject or whether Kawano will be selected, but it's not limited to how the republicans handled the movement and how they treated it," said the presidential U.S. Group contributing to the Democrats' election, Ga Cecil told the new channel.
In the United States, however, there are doubts about who can be trusted on the back of the Ford and Kawano Witnesses, and there is much more tomorrow than that of Kawano.
If 41 per cent of the respondents believed in the new wave of Yugwan, or possibly a witness to the Ford, 35 per cent said they believed in Kavanaugh.
Also, 38 percent said that if Kawana was to lie during the time of the witness, only 30 percent said about the order.
The Guardian reported that after Flak asked for an EFBI forum and at least one other prosecutor was investigating charges made by Deborah Ramirez.
During the past eight weeks, Ford testified before the Sanhedrin that at the age of 17, Cawano had tried to force him to drink.
Ramirez complained that during his studies in the 1980 ’ s, a leading court official in a party opened up his phone.
Plans are under way to start a new Internet site to confront Google and Facebook
World Wide Web explorer Tim Burners is launching a startup that will confront Facebook, Amazon and Google responders.
The most recently-known system project, 'Inrupt', is a company with a free source platform 'Solid' for Burners.
Solid users choose where their data is stored and which information they want to access.
In a special interview with the firm Fascist, Burners-Lean commented that the original purpose of the inrupt is "the global warming".
"We have to do this now," they said about the startup.
"This is a historic moment."
This app Solid's technology is used to create their own "private online data storage" or pods.
It can include contact lists, lists of tasks, calendars, music libraries, and other personal and commercial tools.
This is similar to having Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slick and Spotfia all at once in one browser and at the same time.
This is the special reason why the user will be fully able to manage the personal online data storage.
The company calls it "personal capacity from data."
According to the company’s CEO, John Bruce, the idea of entering is to provide each one with a solid supply of resources, process, and appropriate tools.
The company has a security platform purchased from Burners-lei, Bruce, IBEM, which is part of the team of some of the development teams and self-sustained self-sustainment codes that are agreed to work on the project.
From this week onwards, you can make your own independent apps using the devices available on the global scientific input website.
Burners said that they and their colleagues are not talking about Facebook and Google, which makes all their business very dangerous at night.
"We don't ask for their permission."
Burners writes in a post published on the media on Saturday that "the goal of the entry is to provide a business degree and a system of circumstances to help maintain the integrity and quality of the new website created on the sodium."
In 1994, Burns-Lyn set up a World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Burns-Lean has raised an effective voice in the Net Neutrality Dialogue.
While uploading, Burns-Le will remain the founder and manager of the World Wide Web Consortium, The Web Foundation and Open Data Institute.
"I'm very hopeful for the next century," Burners-Le added.
Bernard Von: The first Victoria Cross Clerical celebration of World War I
In the first world war, Victoria Cross, the only church in England that won the battle, was celebrated 100 years later by its original enthusiasm.
On September 29, 1918, L.
However, four days later they were killed by a group of hideous brothers, who never knew that they had won the most respect of the British army.
On Saturday, in a parade in Rusden, Northamptonshire, two of their neighbors took over their monumental monument.
One of their grandsons, Michael Von, said that it was very exciting to be indistinguishable after 100 years of the victory of their ancestors.
According to London Gazetton, on September 29, 1918, Colonel Von passed the Canal de St. Quentin under the leadership of the Batalian "from a very heavy mine and from a heavy miner and from a machine gun" in Canal de Saint-Quintin.
Then they went to the Firering Line, and they went on the "very sharp" line before the three dates they met on the ground alone.
About a month before the end of the war, L.
Michael Von, 72, said that their actions today "I can't do it, but I can't do it."
He and his brother, Dr.
Michael Won said that they were "participating in the parade" and then they said, "With the support of all the people, the real virus has become the star of the real man."
The M.M. went all night looking for 206 pilots, but instead they had to pick up the Peppa Pig.
Imagine that you were awake all night to see your 206 - voltball player, but you had refused to show him the main program.
San José had 13 battles in his belt, which included six main cards, and the U.S. Channel 5 was to be displayed all night.
In the morning, at 6: 00 p.m., Gerard Mose and Roy MacDonald were ready to meet each other, and Pope Pig threatened the U.S. audience.
In particular, some who were caught up in the war were disappointed.
One wanted to get rid of the children's cartoons on Twitter, saying, "Some kind of cruel shit."
When asked about advertising, "The government's law said that the content was not available at 6:00 a.m. in the morning," Belater's director-in-chief Dave Schwartz said.
"Peppa the Pig," yes.
The president of the lottery company Scott Cooker said that they would renovate their magazine in order to meet future U.S. audiences.
"I think that when I thought about Ripple we could do it," said Corker.
But there were six o'clock in the morning, and we were not able to do it until noon.
But we are working on it.
Believe me, and they shall all be changed; they shall be changed: they were not all my friends.
We were trying to avoid him, and we felt that he had a technical problem.
However, it was not so. It was a government campaign.
I can promise that it will not be so any more.
We have fought five times over six; we have fought six times over six; we have fought many things, but we have failed.
It was a bad situation."
Dezart Island Disks: Tom Delly felt 'immortal' from sexuality
The book The Bible — God’s Word or Man’s? explains: “It was not easy for me to do so, but I was moved to make progress. ”
24-year-old Delly said, "I didn't know that everyone wasn't like me until I went to high school.
When speaking about the first radio 4 Dezart Island discs presented by Lauren Lavern, they said they talked about the rights of the Samilingi people to give others "a hope."
They also said that as parents, they were less concerned about winning the Olympics.
In the United States, for example, in the United States, the number of people who live in the United States has increased by more than half the number of people who live in the United States.
Dellie said they were older than everyone else because they didn't like the love of their parents and girls.
And they said, Unto this day have I power, and am brought into subjection by the law of liberty.
They said I wanted to show them who I am because when people actually know about their sex, they won't disappoint them.
Deli Hy-profile ElGBite, two-time constables in Olympic, became a publisher and used their presence in Australia's National Park in the year, they urged more countries not to take a criminal offence of homosexuality.
They said these things because they feared the evil of the things which they had done. They didn't know that they had seen a good report, but they thought they would see it.
Three times the world's winner said -- the man who met in 2013 -- to fall in love with the US film-maker Dustin Lance Black -- "they were surprised."
Délie was married to Oscar, who was 20 years older than they were, but they said that this was never a problem.
"When you were so young," they first took part in the Olympics when they were 14 years old, and then their fathers died within three years -- they said that it was difficult to find this old man who was so taller than they were.
In June, it became the father of Robert Ree Black-Deli's son, and Deli said they had changed their "all views."
"If you asked me last year, you would have told me that I want to win."
"You know, there are more important things than Olympics.
Robby is my Olympic artist."
Their son was named Robert, who was diagnosed with brain cancer when he was 40 years old in 2011.
Dale said that he did not want his father to die and that one of the final things in London was for 2012 - because they wanted to live in the first row.
"You can't sit in the first row, I didn't want to tell them Dad."
And when they had taken the breath, I caught them by the hand, and they stood still, and I was not sure that they had no power until they died.
The following year, Deline joined the 2012 Olympic Games.
"I knew that the dreams I've had all my life--dive in Olympic games before home viewers," they said.
It was also the motivation of his first song's selection -- the Pound Bay Hidder Smol -- who eats bread with him in preparation for the Olympics and still breaks his leg.

Michaelson took non-formal games for the radar map
The U.S. Phil Michaelson will play with his 47th or radar hat when he will reenact, but he will have to get his form back so that it won’t hurt.
Michaelson is playing in this 12-time biannual event and is playing as an additional game for the Foreballs and Forums for the New Year's Eve.
Rather than directly participating in the game, as he always does for the United States, he was encouraged by the five - time success of his day and the hope of removing the causes of the game from the race.
Even though his career has never been the most simple driver, at age 48, Michaelson is not an example of a 48 - year - old golf course where long - standing high - ranking shots are never forgiven.
And if the course itself is not as challenging as it would be, then Michaelson will face a British open - air winner, Francesco Molinary, who has fought with Roki Tommy Fleetwood for all four of this week’s win.
If the United States began 12 single - parent families while following four qualities, it could be very important to meet Michaelson in a good start.
But he believed the games, and didn't know what to say.
And he knoweth his role this day, and set his foot on my back, and laid his hand upon my neck, and said, He will be ready tomorrow.
"There was a lot of faith in her."
He has given these organizations much earlier and in this week. He is a member of the Governing Body of Jehovah’s Witnesses.
I didn’t even think he would play with me.
I had many things to do, but I was determined to do so, so that I might go to him.
And he desireth to be present with them, and to be present with them.
The New York Times said: “The most important thing in the world is that it is possible for people to have a good relationship with God. ”
This may be the end of his career, which he will never be able to do with his personal achievements.
Michaelson won 18 wins, lost 20, and left seven with him, and said that his presence had an immeasurable value.
"He's an alcoholic, a thug, he likes to have fun and he's a good person to be together," he explained.
"You'll have fun with her in this week, and you'll like to play with her.
Not only does he play, but he also gives more."
The European dyeist Thomas Burn knows that a major catastrophe can soon disappear
The European Colormaker, Thomas Born, knows from experience that the only way forward of the last day’s radar can easily turn into an undisclosed train.
In 1997, Dan died in the state of Walderama, when CV Balestero's lead organization attacked the Americans, but when it ended, they won only the lowest share of 1411⁄2-131/2.
"You remember that we had a great disaster in Valderama; we had a great disaster in Brooklyn where we were killed, and we won Valderama, but only by a small difference," Born said when he saw the two 5-3 victories in January 2018 and tomorrow, which led to a 10-6 hit in the Lee Golf National.
History will show me and everyone in that organization that this has not been accomplished.
You will have to complete the rest of the morning.
Go, then, and learn what this means: ‘ I want mercy, and not sacrifice. ’ ”
This does not end until you break the quality of the board.
Our goal is to win the race, and we will focus on it.
I have told all the children that I focused on 12 games beside us, but we know who is next to us, and we are the most important games in the world."
His games are happy with his show on the open golf course, and he says, "I can't go in here.
The challenge is different in the morning.
In the morning, the appearance of the sun will be different.
It’s good to play with your mate when you’re all good at it, but when you’re alone, how do you feel about being a golfer?
This message must be delivered to the players to show your best tomorrow.
Now therefore, if ye have returned from the evil work of your doings, ye will show yourselves to your husband to be like unto him.
Instead of Born, Furik in the opposition group will complete his personal performance better than his games combined, three of whom received three qualities from the contestant Rodon Spyth and Justin Thomas.
Furic himself faced Europe with the "miracle of the Day" before the parade, both sides of the Great-Day Tournaments were part of the victory movement.
In 1999, Colonel Crenson asked how his games were going down to the end of the day, and he answered, "I remember every word of it."
"There are 12 important things to do today, but you'll have to start as soon as you see in Brooklyn, as you see in Midian.
When he is on the other side of the road, he puts much pressure on the inner surface.
Let's set our line-up according to it, and let's keep our games in this state that we think we're going to do something tomorrow."
Thomas was assigned to work in the fields to try to fit in, and he wanted to face Roy McCallroy in the capital area, where he was the middle - class head of the other European order.
"I put these games in order because I thought they'd all go to hell," Born said about his own choices.
A new German warship was reconnaissanced
In 2014, Germany’s latest nuclear war had to be launched in order to replace military personnel during the war, but the local media said that they would not enter until at least next year because of the corrupt system and high prices.
According to a report by a military agent, the operation of the main "Rayland-Faage" ship in the Baden-Wuttburg category has now been delayed until the first six months of 2019.
The ship was to be launched in November 2014, but the future of this important project was lost by worrying distribution-after problems.
In November 2007, the four Batman-Wuttberg-class ships will come to take place in the Bremen-Class.
It is understood that there will be a strong tower, an airway, and an anti-shipment vehicle, as well as some hidden systems such as radar, spaceship and sound signals.
In other important areas, long stay time is involved - the most recent war refugees must be able to flee their homes for two years.
However, the meaning of the permanent delay of the modern warship - Germany - which shows power over the sea - was recorded by the Dai Zitt when the service was already in progress.
The F125 battle was fought last year when the German Norwegian authorities refused to operate the ship and returned him to Lom And Fos Shipyard in Hamburg.
When the ship was caught, and couldn't face the wind, he gave way to it, and returned to the other side.
There was little information about the reasons for the return, but the German media said there were many important "software and hardware errors" and that it was not used to combat wartime.
Software was particularly important because the boat will be run by 120 names in the Baden-Vuttberg category - half of the human strength in the war crimes in the Junia Bremen category.
It also became apparent that the ship was extremely fragile and that it would not be able to support the ship’s crew in the future.
Germany's 7,000-ton "Rayland-Faage" is considered to be twice as expensive as the same-class ships used in the second Great War.
Along with the criminal hardware, the entire project has become a problem without the training team.
It has reached over €2.2 billion at its beginning - this amazing €3.1 billion ($3.6 billion).
In the context of the warning that Germany's nuclear power was declining, the problems of the new war were particularly important.
At the beginning of this year, the Chief Hans-Peter Bartelsini of the German Society's Security Team admitted that the ship's indeed "the ships are ready to sail."
And he said unto them, The time is coming, and is now come that all the workers of the vineyard shall awake, and shall no longer come into them.
They claimed that no war in the Baden-Vuttberg category could be involved in any war.
National Superstitions on the Secret of Life
A new study was carried out in the Scottish mountain country to open up the land for the search for food.
It is hoped that new research will shed fresh light on the behavior of other flying creatures and will help guide the development of the future.
The study of National Trust of Scotland’s researchers will take place in the Inquiry Gardens of Western Russia of Long Cana and Dobington of the Soprano Pipistrelles, as well as in the western Hemisphere Gardens.
In order to obtain the full scope of the work, special audio cameras will be set in place at the back of the office.
The NHS workers and volunteers will also use hand-held detectors to do mobile surveillance.
All sound systems will determine the frequency of the calls of the speakers and what kind of people they are doing.
The design and reports of natural habitats will be prepared to create a wide picture of their behaviour on Earth-scale.
The ENT’s safety consultant, Rob Deber, hopes that the results will reveal what areas of natural habitats are important for species, and how each nation uses them will be revealed.
The benefits of natural habitat management will help to determine how best to keep vegetation suitable for the production and distribution of birds and other related species.
During the last century, there have been significant increases in both Scotland and the United States.
They are at risk of losing their habitat and their natural habitat affected by construction and development.
Air turbines and alloys also cause dangers, as well as some of the chemical processes of fliers and construction literature, as well as the solutions of performers.
The Bible says: “He that is walking with wise persons will become wise, but he that is having dealings with the stupid ones will fare badly. ”
Yet their ears are more precious than eyes because of their nightly custom.
They use the modern ecosystem system to find out about insects and obstacles along their way.
The ENTS, which is responsible for caring for 270 historic buildings throughout the country, 38 important gardens, and 76,000 acres [76,000 ha] of land, has taken on a huge scale.
There are ten trained scholars who regularly observe, observe, and at times even deliver.
The Society has established the first and only open - air rivers of Scotland, in the tributary of Dumfriz and the Gulf of Galway, which are home to eight of the ten tribes of Scotland.
David Thompson, the director of the State Department, said that the State is a model land for them.
"There's a good place to stay in Treve," they said.
"We have a building of jungles, a lot of trees, and all the best natural habitats.
But there are some things which we don't know, which we do here, and the rest of the things which we do: and these we do.
They stress the need to examine the remains before they can be stored because it can destroy the identity of the single mother, which can cause the death of 400 babies and children, and the risk of the total destruction of the local population.
It is a crime to kill them, to torture them, to torture them, or to destroy them in their place.
Elizabeth Ferrel, the Scottish director of the revolutionary expansion Trust, encouraged the people to help.
They said, "We want to learn a lot about our ancestors, because we don't know what's going on in many of our peoples."
Ronaldo broke down the charges of violence and was prepared to file a complaint on German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has become a "false news" of his violence and people use his name to say "they want to preach."
His colleagues prepared to print a copy of the German newspaper Der Spigel, which published the charges.
In 2009, a woman named Catherine Mayorga, a woman named Portugual and Juvettes Forvard, was accused of rape in a hotel room in Las Vegas.
Deer Spigel reported on Friday that he had been given $375,000 to stop her from talking about the incident.
A few hours after David's story, Ronaldo, 33 years old, spoke to 142 million of his followers in an Ingram State video.
"No, no, no, no, no.
They say it's a lie today," said Balen D's five-time speech to the winner camera.
"They want to preach themselves using my name.
That is normal.
They have borne my name and have obtained my glory, but this is the work of bearing witness in my name.
I'm a happy man, and everything's all right."
Ronaldo's colleagues are preparing to file a report on Der Spigel, which they consider to be "the negative report of the crisis in the area."
Victim Christine Shorts said that the game "is probably one of the most serious violations of human rights in recent times, which can require sufficient balance."
The attack took place in June 2009 at a meeting of the Pams Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
According to the documents presented at the Clark County District Court in Nevada, after meeting in Nitcolib, Ronaldo and Mayorga returned to the opening of the game, where he raped her.
Majorga claimed that after the incident, Ronaldo pointed out to her that he was "99 percent" as a "good man" and that "one percent" disappointed him.
It has been claimed that Ronaldo accepted sexual relations but said that they were married.
Mayorga also claimed that she had gone to the police and had photos of her fears taken into the hospital, but then she allowed her to understand the court-outer because she thought she was "study" and "publicly embarrassed".
The 34-year-old Mayorga says she's now confused because she's still raped by a story.
Ronaldo Manchester from the United States was willing to participate in the real Madrid, and this time he went to the Italian General Juve at $100 million in the year.
Brixite: Uukela will become 'Kayam after 'of Carmeckers'
If Yukela became the world's car manufacturer after Brekzit, businessman Greg Clarke said "Kaym will be late."
They went on to say "The Father of Care," that Totota Yuken told Bibici that if the British did not do it, they would stop their production at their office in Dr. Burnston.
"We need a child," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese author said that if Nodil Bricht became a part of the border, the border would fall on workers by the edge of the bridge.
Burnston Plant - where Oris and Avansi were produced in Toyot - about 150,000 cars last year, 90 percent of them were exported to the European Union.
"I believe that if you get out of the British March YU, you'll see that the production in our office has been stopped," said Marvin Cook, executive director at Burnston, Toyot.
Other Yuke cars, along with Honda, BMDBLU, and Jagwar Land Roover, were concerned about how cross-border trade would take place if they were not signed.
For example, a month after Brexit’s BMDBLU says, they will stop their mini plant in Oxford.
This is the main concern of the industry that will be at risk if Nodel Brixit is present.
Toyot's production line is based on a "sometimes" principle, where escapes from the Yuk and YU suppliers for the required course.
If Yuke died on March 29, no more than a few days later, it may be possible to cross the border on the coast, and the weather may slow down for the rest of the day and reduce their risk of falling.
For Totota, it will be impossible to keep more than a day’s worth in his business plan, and it will stop the production.
Mr. Clark said that the Czechs plan for future relations with Teresa Mei "is precisely part of the process which can prevent border checks."
"We need to make a deal for ourselves. We need a great deal of trade, as I said for now, not only to make us happy but to take advantage of this opportunity," they said in today's BIBSI 4.
"This evidence is not only from toots, but also from other manufacturers for whom we need to keep this thing forever, which will make it very successful."
Totota could not state how long the production would last, but in the meantime, she warned that the increase would result in increased productivity and employment.
Peter Suvellaris, who has worked in Bernstone for 24 years and who is a U.S. senator on the plane, said that their members are very concerned: "I think their job has never come back.
A government official said, "We have made an accurate and reliable plan for our future relations with Joshua."
In the United States, for example, in the United States, the number of people who attend meetings at the Kingdom Hall has grown to a high level of spiritual growth.
With the defeat of Donald Tramp, General Atterny Rod Rosenstein, the Supreme Court of the Supreme Court, began a dispute with Brit Kwanu, who was named after the Supreme Court, saying "May be thrown another week" by White House on Sunday.
Specialist Professor Robert Mueller oversees the work carried out by the Russian electoral board, the assistant of the trauma team, and the Russian National Court of Justice.
For months, the trumpet blast has spread in Washington, D.C., about whether or not the General Athenians will show the way out, thereby endangering Mueller’s freedom.
At the beginning of this month, New York Times reported that Rosenstein had launched a virus to record a discussion with Trump, which could eliminate national leaders by 25 years of age.
The story was rejected by Rosenstein.
But on the other hand, they went away into the country of the Gadarenes, and reasoned with one another on the way about this matter.
Instead, a meeting was announced at the time with Trump, in the United States, in New York.
The trumpet said that taking Rosentina out "will not like her," but she was extended to avoid her meeting with the report of the Senate judiciary, in which Kavanu and one of the women accused of sexual misconduct were to be arrested by Dr. Christine Blasie Ford.
On Friday, the trumpeter ordered a week’s official investigation of the charges against Kavanu, which further deepened the whole syndicate’s argument.
The pressure on the tramp was real, and Sara Sanders focused on the New Year’s Eve.
When she asked about Rosenstein's seat, she said, "There's no date for her. I think she might be in this week, and I think she'll be back in a week when she sees other fathers walking with the Supreme Court.
But we see it, and love to tell the press."
Some journalists argued that Anders did not give a description of the White House press since September 10.
The organizer, Chris Welles, asked why.
He also said that there was no "show" on television for at least a few of the details he said. "I don't really reject this reality."
They then suggested that there would be a steady contact between the storm and the press."
"These people are planning sessions of more questions than any of their leaders," he said, and then he said, "We've seen them here."
Anders said, "If the press had an opportunity to ask the U.S. presidents straight away, they'd be better than talking to me.
We're trying to do this, and you've been in the last few weeks, and you can talk to the U.S. officials, and they'll be able to explain the press."
And when they leave White House, or when they go to public places, or when they meet with high officials, they are regularly asked questions by the trumpet.
In the United States, for example, the number of people who live in the United States has increased by more than a quarter of a million.
This week, the presidents in New York may have given them reasons to be careful and to present a different picture.
Healthiers wrote to the UN workers in the United States in Scotland about the concerns of Brazil.
Health authorities wrote to EU workers working in the ESC in Scotland to express their gratitude to the country and to express their desire to live after Braxit.
Gin Freeman MSP sent a letter in less than six months to get out of the U.S. U.A.
The Scotsian government has already been opposed to paying the costs of state aid for EU citizens working in public services that are responsible for us.
In her letter, Miss Freeman writes: "In all ages, Yuke and Yüu have been involved in falling out, which are expected to be decided in the future.
However, the U.S. government is also preparing for a possible business-other than situation.

That is why I now want to reiterate that regardless of their nationality, I appreciate the value of each member of the working class.
The IUD products and products from the office of Jehovah’s Witnesses provide valuable tools to enhance and improve the quality of life we enjoy.

In the Saturday game, 31-27 found out that the Chinese State Tigers Linenbrucker's Christian Abercromby had been launched by the Tenetian Mayan Organ after he was hit by the head in a strange face in front of the vanderbilt Comedors.
The principal teacher of the state of Tennessee, Rod Ridney, told reporters that he had just finished half an hour earlier.
"He came to Sydney and tried there," said Reed.
The teacher and medical staff gave Abercrombly an oxygen on Sadlin before she was put on the strike and brought to the next trial.
One of the officials of the state of Tennessee told Chris Harris of the DWSV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercromby Vanderbilt Medical Center has been involved in an operation.
Harris went on to say, "There's no information about the type or the evidence yet," and he's trying to find out when the state of Tennessee was born.
Abercromby, a second year student of a Radshert, was first to play in the tennis stadium after moving from Illinois.
On Saturday before the current game, he received five tickets, which resulted in 18 tickets from the scene.

According to one estimate, 13 per cent of newly built property in London is purchased by Non-Yuke, which makes it more difficult to buy homes for the first time.
Many of the country's rich areas, especially in the capital, have been "crazed" by foreign buyers because they spend most of their time abroad.
A few weeks after the printing press was announced to help many young people to buy their first home, Boris Johnson.
They accused large construction companies of buying land but not using it, and they demanded that Miss Mess be removed from quality houses so that "houses could be destroyed" in Britain."
Mr. Corbin announced that the owner of the proposed building improvements included control over the wall and completion of the "unless" exit.
They also want to have more authority to build new houses.
And he said unto me, In the last year I said, I will sacrifice my feet to make my dream come true, that I may make my dream come true, that I may live again for all the new generations of the British.
It means that the building of a house in a mollusc can be built on the market.
Britain will always be open to those who want to live there, work, and make life possible.
And it shall not be easier for them to buy houses for the people of the land, and for the stranger, and for the sojourner;

And it shall come to pass at this time, that the measures of Jesse shall be accomplished for me, whether I will bring this club into the love League.
This club is definitely allowed to go to the favorite league because of its design and popularity," they said.
"It's not easy to get there, but if I could take the club back there, maybe I'll find myself successful."
After a 15-month period of training at the assistant owner and in Harts in Dumberton, the work of the Russian administration has been completed for only three years.
They then helped to fix Aloah to the third tier from his fall and brought St. Merenn out from his post-cise into victory.
And Rose says that they feel more content than they do at the games they play in their classrooms, at the heart of their friends, at the heart of their friends, and at the center of their lives.
"To accept Aloa's burden is to say, "Maybe he was really cruel," they remember.
"I really think that the arrangement was more suitable for me than playing."
For I was an hungred, and ye gave me meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink: I was a stranger, and ye took me in: I was a stranger, and ye took me in.
But it can be difficult to play.

In the past, the heat has increased the pressure on restaurants and restaurants in Britain.
In July the pope and the bar groups increased by 2.7 percent — but the restaurant’s business declined by 4.8 percent.
The commercial advice of the Centre CJ's Peter Martin, who has compiled the cables, said: "The permanent sunlight and the vast majority of the universe of England, including the recast of the month of June in July, where there was more than 2.8 per cent of the business of the poppy in the restaurant.
In June, there was an increase in the cost of 1.8 percent of the restaurant business.
In the United States, for example, there is a growing number of people in the United States who live in the United States.
Even tax collectors, even if they were not as friendly as those who were in the restaurant, were also weak.
They thought that they were going out to drink.
In that month, the sales of well - organized tobacco and beer increased by 6.6 percent, and the share of the fruit grew by three percent.
Peace and dignity analyst Paul Neuman of the ARSM said: "We see this as the end of April.

Russian Grain Love: Louis Hamilton Yoon, who was sent to the field under the direction of the organization, won a worldwide victory
It was clear that the order of the Marsids was now going to be important.
Botas had started out well from Paul, and instead of Hamilton on the first two tournaments, he had taken him out close to him, so it was time to leave Bethel to his own organization to play with him.
Hamilton left at the end of the package and went to Pitts before Wettel arrived.

Christine Blase Ford has been accused of sexual harassment by the Supreme Court's Nominee Bret Kavango. However, the author's letter to the defendants did not appear to have been a lie to the President Donald Trump.
While speaking at a meeting in West Virginia, the Heads of State Ford said that they did not mention the witness given by the Senate Judiciary Committee ford that people were 'how happy, worried and deceived' from what's going on in the Senate."
"What can happen in a few days when you've been in the Senate... when you see anger there, you've become angry, angry, selfish, and deceived."
"When you look at the famous paper, it fades and then you say... oh... I didn't."
I didn't."
Do You Recall?
DEN FENSTEN, DID YOU KNOW?
Remember his answer... did you write these papers... "Kay, what did you say?"
Oh, no.
I didn't put it down."
Yeah, hold on a minute.
We did it... no, we didn't do it," the presidents explained it in the style of the next senator.
Ford was sent to Fenstein, an anti-Cavango prosecutor in July, and they were pleased at the beginning of September... but Fenstein denied that this letter had been received from his office.
I didn't hide Dr. Ford's charges, but I didn't make their letters.
They told me to keep them secret, and I kept them.
But they didn't give up on them. They said at the meeting on Saturday night, "I tell you, this is a very bad thing."
It may be that they will not do it, but the evil thing which I have seen it was this day."

They explained to Zühren what had taken place the night after the death of 19 - year - old Pediatrician Jessica Chembergs and the 29 - year - old European Quentin Telis to find out what had happened.
On the night when Shembers died, they gathered several cell phones together to confirm that she was with her at night, and they said Rolett checked the population data. She had previously claimed that we weren't with her that night.
According to the available data, his cell phone appeared to be near the Chambers' cell phone at the time and Teles said that he was at the time with his friend Michael Sanford.

Another fascinating person?!
A woman in New York who dropped her job on the basis of the "Colorful" message found a couple in court in New York.
The message that claims to be ""Another Kinder" is that Mother has sent us wrong after she has sent us a letter of resignation to a Neani couple in New York. "
The charges against the family have been dropped by the couple that they claim to be a "probably" way of asking for a divorce.
The new woman who came to take care of the children in 2016 noted that she had come to work for the first time in 2016, and the mother of two children, Linci Plasco-Flaxman, said that she hated her mother.
"NoSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS is another beautiful story," wrote a century ago to send the woman.
However, instead of sending this message to the woman, she misdirected rich Morris twice.
After this profound observation, Pwasco-Flaxman removed rich Morris from his job. We had formerly been an African-American, and she was doing bad things.
The money was given to Maurice for one day’s work and then sent home.
Now the rich couple, Morris, are playing in court to change their jobs. For six months, they're asking for a full-time salary like $350 a day. They've been hired with a full-time contract.
"I don't want to show them that you can't do this," they told the post newspaper on Monday. "I know this is the description."
The related couple have rejected the claim that they are cruel. Because of the suffering of rich Morris, they can't trust them anymore.
"My wife sent them wrong what they didn't want to say to her."
It is not a description.
We're not people who disagree," says Joel Plasco to Post.
"But will you be able to deliver children into the hands of the same person after you have committed an act of betrayal?"
Is the person you have in your youth a good influence on the person you are raising?
It's not possible."
This is what Plasco said when he accused her of having a "birth" type of baby two months ago and she's now "in a very difficult situation."
"Can anyone follow someone like that?"
"It's not a good thing," said the business stocked with investment.
The court's judgment has already begun, but the court has dismissed this couple by means of social media, and their conduct and their arguments have been severely criticized.
Concerned that readers would not be able to accept the idea that the reader can't accept it, the publication of Paddington was opened in a new letter.
And it came to pass, as soon as the book was accepted, that the daughter of the newborn band said to Karen, "It's hard to understand who's going to read the book before it's published."
It's so much fun to know what we know about the great success of Paddington."
She says that although the book was rejected after working as a cameraman in Bibisi, the author of the book was moved from a small ass to play and said that the book had been rejected. The last year, she says, the publication of this book has become 'Summisher' on the 60th anniversary of its publication.
Padington described as "a very important member of our family," and she said that the last parents of Jesse were very proud of him.
"It was so quiet, they never wanted to do their own team," she said.
"But Paddington was like they really existed for them, so if our son succeeds, we're proud that he doesn't make it, and that's what it was.
I feel that this is how they looked at Paddington’s success.
It was their creation and their imagination, but they were always going to give it to Paddington."
My daughter was on her last visit, and I had to call her over the phone
After Lading, her daughter was brought to the hospital in Luu, in the western part of Nices. The doctors tried to save her, but she disappeared.
"Nad was calling me regularly and said that the situation was very bad. She didn't think she'd come out of it," said Ednan-Laquiz.
"And Nad's phone came to me and he said she's gonna die in the next two minutes and I'm gonna call her Godbai.
I told her that I was not interested in religion.
I said, "Well, I love you very much, son.
I will soon be with you.
I am with you all the days until the conclusion of the system of things. ”
The doctors gradually reduced the effect of medications on her heart to begin her heart pumping, and all of her systems were closed.
She had died shortly before, and everything was closed.
I would only sit and wait. I knew that things had gone wrong.
I couldn't cry, neither could I cry; for I had many relatives and people around me.
I really had to take care of myself."
And at the end of the hundredth century, Adnan-Laparus and his daughter-in-law, and their companions, and they that were with them, had not known what day they were going to go out.
"No one knew," she said.
"I've been downgraded, and I've always had tears in my eyes.
It was not easy to explain this, but when I was on the plane, I was able to express my feelings about the snow.
He needed my love, and I needed to understand him.
I know how much she loved him."
A woman who has spent all her labor for the sake of selfish gain.
Two women who have lost loved ones in death are now working to escape the suicide of the rest.
Sharon Devis and his brother Moffreis Welsh Bridge post encouraging messages and phone numbers. People can get help by calling them on their phone numbers.
From the time he was 13 years old, his son Tyler, who had been raped by Narassia, was 18 years old.
"I don't think it's time for parents to come up with what I eat every day," he said.
And at the end of forty years they dwelt in Lidna: and their son was Shephat; and they laughed him to scorn.
"Everyone wanted to know him for his memorial.
And they were all saying unto him, He hath gone out of his mouth.
But he had left his job before he died because he was really in the dark.
In 2014, Tyler committed suicide and was sentenced to 11 years in prison by his 11 - year - old brother.
The rich David said, "I'm worried that something will happen to him."
The rich David made the cards, "To let these people know that you're people you can talk to, they can be your friends.
Don't sit still. You need to talk."
The rich Moffreis and the rich Devis have been friends for many years. The rich Mampiris lost their 15-year-old companion Mark, who died shortly after his mother died.
"He never said that he was upset and disappointed and that he didn't say anything," she said.
"In two days after Christmas we became aware of a little change in his behavior.
And there was nothing hid from his eyes when the children were assembled unto him.
She said that his death was a very serious threat to their family, but we got out of it.
This led to a disastrous turn of events.
But it's just that we're going to keep going and fighting."

The future of Bret Kavanong is a small shilling since the FBI began its investigation
"I thought if we had found something exactly what he was asking us to do -- if we had done it in a certain period of time -- we might be able to hear a little bit of it," said Mr. Flake Saturday, then they also said that they thought they were falling into the practice of the Party Gredlock.
Why do Mr. Kwanong and his Republicans need to examine Efbia?
Their destruction is of no more use today than in the past.
There are only six weeks for the midweek election, and six days for the November 6th. If the work of the Republican has been in vain, then it will be very humiliating to send a man to the Supreme Court of the land.
Mr. Kavanoghana called for a phone call from the President of Buzani. Mr. Kavanog Wiat House worked for Mr. Bush, and in their midst they met Mr. Kavanog's wife, Asshale, who was the owner of Mr. Bush.
What will happen to the news media?
It will be discussed in the following article. It will be published in the next issue of this magazine.
It is not clear whether Mr. Kavanogwana would have at least 50 views in Cinnet, which enabled Mike Penns, the president, to take them to court.
Under Kim's leadership, the number of people in North Korea was "kim".
When Kim Jong came to power seven years ago, it was said that the number of knights from North Korea had fallen to South Korea, and South Korean lawmakers said.
Commenting on data from the South infection Ministry, Park Bung-sung said that the last year was 1127, compared with the 2706 rounds of 2011.
Mr. Park said that it was an important part of North Korea’s and China’s narrow border control and the acquisition of more money from human resources.
Pongang made no public comment.
Many tourists in the north have been granted the citizenship of South Korea.
Saul says that at the end of the Korean War in 1953, more than 30,000 North Koreans were unchallenged.
Many people have lived in China with the North Korea border, and this border is easier than the DMZ.
In fact, it is not unusual for the Chinese to consider them to be refugees and send them back to their homeland.
Despite the beginning of the civil war in North and South America, there has been a marked improvement for some months.
At the beginning of this month, the leaders of the two countries in Pongangang were visited to discuss parts of the country that were not able to use force.
This was followed by an extensive discussion of the nuclear-powered Korean dualities at the historic meeting in Singapore, held by US President Donald Tramp and Kim Jong-An.
But since Saturday, North Korea's national friend, Riy Yong Hoo, has been on the U.S. front of the press.
"No one will believe in America without faith in our national security and we will not be able to defend ourselves in such a situation," Rey said in a speech to the United Nations Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosie Brat Kavanog says she can't serve in the Supreme Court
Home number leader Nancy Pelosie called Bret Kavanoggo, the Supreme Court's director of the House, and said they had been unable to serve in the Supreme Court for some time.
The apostle Paul wrote: “The word of God is alive and exerts power and is sharper than any two - edged sword and pierces even to the dividing of soul and spirit, and of joints and their marrow, and is able to discern thoughts and intentions of the heart. ”
"I can't do anything about it, but it seems that if a woman does, they'll call her 'Bébhan'," said Pelossie about the witness of Kavanaugh before the Senate.
Cavanogo, both of whom were in a state of Poland, was emotionally involved with the sexual abuse committed by Dr. Christine Blasie Ford.
When they started speaking, many of their relatives, including some of their relatives, sometimes shouted at them when they spoke to them about the day of their school.
This charge against them, Hélire Clinton, gathered to express his anger at the 2016 presidential election, "the so-called murder of art and art."
According to Pelosie, the Witnesses in Kavango have proved that they cannot serve in the Supreme Court because they prove that they are neutral in the affairs of democracy.
"I think they've made themselves miserable by their terms and by Clinton and Democrats."
When Kavango was appointed and the House of Representatives of the Democratic People's Republic of the Congo was visited, it was silent after asking if Pelosi would be present on their terms.
"I'll say -- they won't tell Congress or the FBI, they're not even in the love court, they're not even eligible for the court they're in," Pelois said.
Many present - day judges are judges at the Appellate Circuit Court of D.C.
Pelosini said that as a democracy, the kawangos are concerned about the possible charges against them because Kwanong is considered to be a traditional judge.
During the hearing of the trial, Kavanaugh asked questions about the decision of the Supreme Court.
"It's not time for an innocent man to go to court and say to us, 'What a shame!'," said Pelosi.
And women need to use their weapons.
The sound was heard, the months and years passed, and she had no choice but to cry.
"We cry when we are angry," said Mrs. Steinem to me after 45 years.
"I don't think it's unusual, what do you think?"
She said, "The laboring woman gave me strong support, saying, 'She has been very angry, and she also wept.' But she has developed a system, that when she began to cry, she would say to the man who spoke to her, 'Take care of me, for I am in pain.'
I'm angry."
Then they continued to tell him.
And I thought it was weird."
For instance, the Bible says: “Let anger alone and leave rage; do not show yourself heated up only to do evil. ”
One of the memories of my early work is that in a man-made office where I once saw myself crying suddenly, an elderly woman -- I was always scared by a heavy blood manager -- took my hand and passed through the walls of China.
"Don't let them see you when you cry." She said to me.
"They didn't know you were angry.
For they think that thou art in the wrong, and they are glad.
So Petricia Soader, a woman at the Democratic Congress in Colorado, worked with Gary Hart for the president's election.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was arrested on a boat named Manki Biznes, the rich man Schroeder became very discouraged and wondered why we should not stand up for the presidential election.
"This situation wasn't a decision," she said laughing to me 30 years later.
"There's already seven o'clock in the morning and their last wish is one o'clock now.
"Snowite and seven Dorfs."
"Mohimel's fall was after the settlement and they decided that they wouldn't go into this war until $2 million."
It was a war that broke out.
She found that the men who contributed $100,000 to her support amounting to $250.
"Do they think I get it easy?" she was thinking herself.
When they announced that they would not get involved in civil strife, they became so angry with representatives and sexual abuses that they complained about the people who supported them, and about the hard work of raising money.
"You may think I'm upset," said the rich Shoader about their reactions.
"You must have thought that Clenecs was my corporate user.
I remember thinking, ‘ What will they write on my gravestone? ’
"Why did she cry?"
How the U.S. and Chinese trade can benefit vegetation
The United States and China’s trade gap and the lack of signposts of the end of the war are said to have contributed to the long - term prosperity of Biding.
The president of the United States, Donald Tramp, warns first about major Chinese exports with solar panels, steel, and aluminium.
This week, $200 Abez (£150 Abez Dollars) has increased to a large extent with these new levels, and China is in the United States.
In comparison with the smallest of 60 ounces [60 kg] of U.S. goods, five to ten percent of the imports have been denied by God every time.
China has sworn to comply with the United States’s policies, and soon the world’s largest natural system will never be forgotten.
After Washington’s resignation, the public address to the United States will be a very awkward father for China’s president Si Jinping.
However, experts say that gambling could be played properly, and the pressure from the U.S. commercial forces can reduce the interoperability of the two environments and provide positive support for long - term China.
In fact, when a political decision has been made in Washington or Bijing, one of the two countries where the financial revolution will begin is more dangerous than they have previously accepted, "So Abigail Grace will contribute to an investigation that focuses on the Central For New American Security of an idea in a group of Asia.
International friends say Syria 'tajara' to return to exile.
Syria is ready to return voluntarily, and they have been asked to help rebuild the land that had been destroyed for more than seven years.
Speaking at the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Valid Al-Moleme said that the situation in the country is improving.
"The progress made to fight the decade today is more stable and secure in our area," they said.
To improve the situation in general, governments have begun to resurface in areas that have been devastated by earthquakes.
Their daily lives and livelihoods - these tenacious and one-fishing financial benefits are now well suited for the voluntary return of refugees who have to leave their country.
It is estimated by the United Nations that 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the war started in 2011.
There are still six million people in the country who need help.
Al-Morlam said that the Syrian government would help rebuild the country that was devastated.
However, they insisted that they would not accept assistance or help from military sources.
