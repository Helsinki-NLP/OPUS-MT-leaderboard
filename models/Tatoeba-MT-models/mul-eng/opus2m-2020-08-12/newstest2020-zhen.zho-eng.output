The women are looking forward to protecting the world!
On 27 days in the game against the women in the Netherlands, the Chinese forces were retreated into a city in the event of the victory of the two stations, finally at 3:1 p.m. and arrived at nine.
The World Cup event is nearing its end, although it is waiting to be defended, in the face of the Serbian army, Chinese women's exodus cannot be relieved.
With the two pre-combatants in the Netherlands, the Chinese women's race was as strong as ever, with 25:19,25:16 in front of the two cities, up to the third.
The number of women in the Netherlands has increased the number of attacks on the game, and China's troops have been attacked, and more girls are alarmed, and the failure has begun to increase, finally returning to a city at 21:25.
After the race, the battalion also stated: " Third floor because of our mistake we sent about eight minutes. "
Of course, it was not easy for the Dutch women's efficiency to win, and it was difficult to prepare before the Chinese women's race, although it was missing, but everything was still under control, " and the forces were normal, and the five were normal, so we told the military to be careful, " The Quartet said so.
Fourth, the troops are actively adjusting their situation, and they are often running through the fires of the attack. The unit is eight minutes away and has a great success in fighting against the team.
To date, only two rounds of 11 fighting have been left, although a Chinese woman's escape, although one hand has already touched the prize of the army, has indeed been warning Chinese women against the fight against the Dutch army: the more critical time it is, the more hard it will be to fight.
In another 27-day competition, the Russian and U.S. women's ranks were filled with five positions, and the United States Army was unable to take all three of them from its opponent, so that China's women's ranks could be secured as long as the three-thirds of the match against Poservia.
All kinds of situations are facing developments that are beneficial to Chinese women.
However, although Serbia ' s largest number of positions of power are known, this does not mean that they would easily be sent to China by third parties.
From the current form of ambiguity, Serbia ' s troops have been largely without prizes, which means that they can " stand up " in the race against Chinese women " , put down the package to the full range of attackers, while China ' s back is under pressure, and the situation is likely to arise.
In addition, the complementary Serbian army is not a sheep of "mandatory division" and, in the course of its role with the Dutch Army, the two sides of the conflict, the two sides of Serbia, have finally turned their sovereignty over the Netherlands's position at 3:2 and can therefore be seen in its depth.
Before the third phase of the game, the team also expressed its concern: " The big game is going to be very difficult, and we're going to have to be ready as soon as possible. "
Now that the line of defense has been broken, the competition has actually entered "the white phase " .
In fact, China's women's ranks are on the counter, and only the final key is to see if women's ranks can take a normal level and free themselves at the competition.

On 24 September, "A boat ticket to see me" was held in the capital of Saukhi, where 100 more disabled persons from Sakhaz were invited to the East Asian e-mail and appreciated the light of the sun and celebrated the New China ' s 70th anniversary.
Most of the 100 persons with disabilities who participated in this activity were on the first post.
At 56 years of age, John was just a poor man who had little access to the door because of his lack of both legs.
He said: "This is the first time I've been sitting in the post office today, and I've been away from my precious old-fashioned shoes, I've got a deep sense of development, I've been so excited and I can't forget."
Volunteers from the São Paulo City Centre for Social Services and the Blue Age Relief Team provided a comprehensive range of services for persons with disabilities.
Especially with regard to severe health disabilities, volunteers will turn to their post.
The relevant heads of the Health Social Services Centre stated that for 70 years, with the support of parties and governments, the long-term development of disabled persons in Saar City has continued, and that more and more persons with disabilities have become truly involved in socio-economic development, contributors and beneficiaries and are interested in helping persons with disabilities and are interested in supporting the activities of persons with disabilities as a whole.
The Republic is about to arrive at the seventyth anniversary, and the mass media are lit up, making many people think we don't remember much of the image, the light is shining — they are those who, for our beautiful days, bring heat and light.
However, if the hero goes next to him, it looks like you're just like me.
A study of al-Zuluan, the potential water cycle, and the birth of a beautiful winter, led to the loss of millions of people from hunger and hunger, as well as the death of an elderly farmer who likes to swim in the middle of the countryside; the Southeast, the Xiaoian, the leading scientist who is angry with China's "day" eye, a man, a cat, a cat, a cat, the only thing to do in the deep mountains of the U.S., and an old man in the jungle; and a red student, a young boy, a young boy, still in the middle of nowhere else, learns to sit in the middle, and learns to laugh at the heart, and laugh at laughter; and the Red Midday artist, who is over 90 years old, and also enjoys a little old woman in the "Hand-fashion" ...
They ask for a cure, they live in luxury, and they keep it simple, and it is easy for them to live up to their self-reliance and not to be known by others, rich and famous.
Like the goldsmith, the miner hid the tomb of his master, despite his enchanting and inexhaustible world army.
Every "circumcision ", every sub-species heart, there's a family that cares about who I am.
The family is concerned not only about the hero's hair but also about the welfare of millions of people.
Once, when a woman was a student, a friend of the Internet was turned crazy, "When she was on her way, there was always someone sitting on the street screaming... I didn't want to be a hero, I wanted to be the one who was sitting on the street. "
In fact, when he calls and calls, he doesn't disagree.
Those who call on the street, they're also carrying heat and light, and they're light.
If you're like me, there's always a lot of machines in your life, there's a few moments, there's a day when you're tired, and it's like a hero.
The Supreme Court of the Sea, under the responsibility of judicial reform, has given its own story at the annual meeting of the President of the Chamber of Communications, who has received a number of press letters for a year, without any mistake, " to do simple things, not to be easy " , and the Chief Justices will send a vote to this "crowding."
That's the difference between heroes and a hero calling another hero.
There's a miner's store store, there's a water experiment in Zulun, there's a " sky" in the South East, there's a stage, there's a show, there's a show... ... whether he's a hero, he's going to rely on his own efforts, better the environment, and he's going to encourage the mechanism.
Like "China's Day Eyes," it looks like it's the same thing.
In the 1990s, China's sciences were still in trouble, and the " three " had not yet been written.
At that time, the most cow's eye was a single-voice radio remote from the Puerto Rico Mountains of the United States — Aresbo, 350 meters away, is considered the world's most "inexhaustible" world.
At that time, China's radio broadcasts were far from home, as if it were one of the most common people.
In Japan, however, South-East countries, enjoying scientific conditions and paywater at the world level, were forced to return to their country with a rather crazy idea: the construction of a new nuclear power " great distance " in China, to receive more messages from outside space!
China's hundreds of people are missing, and the big deal is for stars?
My grandfather's trust in the South East, "The Eye of the Sun" project opens.
The address was used for 12 years, and the position was 9 years.
In 500 meters, the sky is opened, China is making no precedent, a unique scientific engineering in the world.
So, "the sky's eye" is awesome, the South East is awesome, it's huge, the far-reaching republic.
With the confidence of the State, the good will of the national people, the South-East has an opportunity to become the root of the people's souls.
There are young people, white heros, and people on the street, and such a country is beautiful and peaceful.
The primary education of the garbage class went into the garden of giraffes and kept them from the bottom of the pit.
On 27 May, a small village in the city of Gilin, Jillin, was held in the school of education of the classification of waste, which taught young children to wish to recover waste and other types of waste.
It was reported that this was the first time in the local school of education for children.
In the past, nine sectors of the province of Jillin were jointly launched " Programme of work for the treatment of the classification of urban wastes in the area " .
In 2019, based on the test of the mandatory classification of waste for long-term urban life, the province decided to carry out work on the classification of waste for life in urban areas.
The city of Gillin is one of them.
We would like to adopt this activity to promote environmental care through children's families, children's gardens and children's communities.
In the event of the holding of the event, the President of the International Children's Garden was told.
On that day, the mayor read the Environmental Security Initiative, hoping that the garbage distribution would be done by children.
After the low-carbon bee dance, children grouped into waste-class small games.
The guide also issued the " recoverable " label " for other trash " and recommended that children post their notes to the trash bin and record the video.
In the introduction, the little girl has been promoting low-carbon, green care, and regular opening of the gym.
In the field, the investment office has also set up a category of trash bins and notes above the investment category.
What are the teacher's children capable of returning garbage?
According to preliminary statistics, urban waste production in the province of Jillin was about 546.5 million tonnes in 2018, all entering the waste disposal facility.
Of these, 329.29 million tons of health care, 209.2 million tons of fuel, and 8.1 million tons of integrated use of technology.
After many years of effort, every village in the province has the ability to treat life-threatening waste.
In the programme of work for the treatment of urban waste classifications in the province of Jillin, which has been published, it is clear that there is an urgent need for a comprehensive range of waste classifications to be carried out by teaching materials and activities such as classrooms, by creating waste classifications, songs, films and videos, by strengthening the interaction between students and parents, and by achieving "Education of a child, affecting a family, moving a community and building a new generation of people."

Herac's dead. Political heritage survives.
On 26 local days, former French President Hilhak was a long man in his 86-year-old life.
The many political heritage that this French politician had left during the years of his reign was still worthy of our thanks.
Hirak has been the President of France for up to 12 years in a very personal way.
He has inherited a spirit of diplomatic independence on the basis of the joys of self-reliance and firmly supports the integration of Europe, which is being pursued by representatives of "European dreams".
At the same time, he was a strong advocate for multilateralism and multilateralism in the world, a politician with a strategic perspective.
For that reason, the French media have assessed him as " the great representative of France on the world stage " .
Iraq is one of the political decisions that has been made in the Zinjiang Valley, which is against the war of Iraq, which is the leading cause of the United States.
Under his leadership, France took the United States into its hands and went ahead of the war.
After a year of war, he predicted that the war would increase terrorist activities and make the world more dangerous.
The facts later proved that the warning of Hirak was correct.
In Europe's integration, the United States' unilateralism is becoming more and more evident, followed by a strong demonstration of Iraq's strategic thinking and choices on international political and global affairs.
Hirak is another French politician who has given Chinese experience and affection.
He was one of the advocates and creators of the "Golden Years" of Inter-Law Relations, and after his first election to the President of France in 1995, he was promoted to the rapid development of law relations with the strategic eyes of politicians.
In 2004, the Central Law established a comprehensive strategic partnership, with the bilateral participation of the Central Law in the new phase.
During the Hirak regime, bilateral trade between the two countries of central law has rapidly increased, and cooperation between the two countries in many areas, such as aviation, nuclear power and railway transport, has made significant progress.
The Year of Culture in the Hirak Initiative has created a whole new model of cultural exchange in the history of Central France.
Hilhak's life is particularly deeply affected by the prejudices of Chinese culture.
According to his Chinese diplomats, Hirak was able to turn white, some of the duchess's beads, and even the historical history of the Chinese beads.
"No matter how much gold is actually going into Egypt, no matter how much copper it really goes into China " — this is from Iraq.
In response to a visit by the New York Times, Hirak said: " The political and social development of China in the West, the ecological problems arising from economic growth in China and the political status of China in the international context.
But I myself am very confident about China.
I believe that China is a country with long-standing civil history, whose experience is sufficient to help it build its ideas and values for achieving and development and to carry on its responsibilities on the world stage. "
I also believe that the resurrection of China will bring about a new generation of world cultures and a rich world culture.
Sikhs have gone, but Hirak remains to the world's political heritage and will be with the world.

The Hong Kong legislation will build parliamentarians at UNU against the Inter-American Port Act
A joint statement issued by a member of the Hong Kong legislative part of Parliament on 27 May expressed strong opposition to the adoption of the "Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act 2019" by the United States Council of Foreign Affairs Committee.
This statement made by 40 founding Members of Parliament, stated that the right currently enjoyed by Hong Kong is granted by the basic law in the Hong Kong region, including the maintenance of free trade ports and individual customs zones, in various areas of economic, financial, shipping, trade, communications, tourism, culture, sport, with the name "Hong Kong" with global trade, cooperation and development relations, and the conclusion and implementation of bilateral and multilateral agreements.
These rights are not conferred by any foreign government or legislative body.
For a long time, Hong Kong has strictly adhered to international agreements, international rules, laws and business ethics, its participation in cooperation with different countries and regions, its participation in many relevant areas, and has been successful and transparent.
It was stated that it was not necessary for the two Chambers of the United States to visit the Committee on Foreign Affairs through the relevant legislation to respond only to the call of its representatives in Hong Kong, as a means of cruel interference in domestic affairs in Hong Kong and for its representatives to seek political co-ordination in Hong Kong.
The construction parliamentarians deeply regret this United States meeting and strongly oppose it.
The declaration stated that Hong Kong was an important trade partner in the United States and the largest trade dispute.
A good rule of law in Hong Kong, a fair and free business environment, a clean society that makes it a good choice for US businessmen.
The United States, such as through this bill, will, in addition to fighting the interests of Hong Kong and the United States itself, increase the snowfall of Central America without any benefit and damage to its victims.
The declaration stated that Hong Kong would continue to enjoy the right granted under the fundamental law and effectively fulfil its obligations, as it has always been and without prejudice to the "two-State" approach.
In the past, now or in the future, Hong Kong will continue to contribute to the international community and international trade.
According to the "European Time Report"26, the French Parliament will discuss immigration policy reform next week.
The French President Mackron recently claimed that France could not " accept everyone " , but at the same time try to " accept well " .
It was reported that Makron tried to find a road line in immigration affairs and slowed down the upcoming debate.
Recently, when Macedonia participated in the general debate in New York, it was expressed that it was hoped that there would be a genuine "two-way" programme on migration policy to find a balance between humanitarian and efficiency.
Macron said: " If France wishes to receive (immigrants) properly, it will not accept everyone " .
Four priorities for the development of migration policies are set out in Macedonia: as soon as refugee protection is needed; more effective promotion of migration integration; reception and protection of all migrants entering the French territory; and more effective re-establishment of illegal entry into France by persons who do not want to stay.
Whether illegal migrants should be protected from the protection of the National Medical Assistance (AME) system is the theme of most previous discussions.
Marcon indicated that he hoped that this system could be "assessed" but not eliminated but limited to it.
Following the release of this statement by Macron, the leader of the " National Union" was very right to submit a statement that the appearance of the Mackon is " air talks " .
The members of the right party and party, President Lacher of the Senate, also stated that migration policy should be discussed in a "silence and "but face reality" way and that it should be criticized directly.
The left-wing social parliament member Valua believes that France should " accept more, better " , and criticise the issue of " operating" on the issue of migration.
The new "Protection and Migration Law" has been promulgated for a year, which has led to internal differences of opinion by the ruling party, but is also unable to guarantee right-wing opposition parties.
In the next general election in 2022, the topic of migration policy will once again become a very right-wing focus, which will need to be addressed on this issue, but will also pose a risk for left-wing people within the political party.
It has been reported that the French National Parliament Chamber will hold a debate on immigration policy from 30 September and the Senate will hold a debate from 2 October.
There is evidence that China's A is welcome to " buy back " , and many city companies are taking " real bank" back the company's shares.
According to the statistics of the wealth of the East Bank of financial services, as at 27 May 2019, the total amount of the purchase by the A company in the city has been over $1 billion (peoples, etc.) and over the same period of time as it has created a new historical high rate of the acquisition of the A unit.
In this regard, the Director-General of the Overseas and Overseas Information Advisory Board stated that the overall market value of Part A this year was lower, with relatively low price repurchases, which contributed to the efficiency of the use of funds by top-market companies and demonstrated the willingness and cash flow of market-based companies to take the initiative in managing market values, and the confidence of investors was enhanced.
In addition, the continuous improvement of the repurchasing system has also contributed to the active repurchasing of the shares on the market.
For example, at the beginning of this year, the rules for the implementation of the market-owned purchase unit issued by the Overseas Bank and the deep-sea banking firm have provided detailed rules and guidelines for market-owned companies.
In addition to media statistics, over the past year, higher-priced companies that have been implementing enhanced procurement plans have focused mainly on the infrastructure industry, the ground industry, the information technology industry and the electronic equipment industry.
In addition, 6 companies in the city have received more than $100 billion this year from the reimbursement of the purchase.
Among these, the first was the Ili portion, which returned the amount of $50 million.
What impact will the market have on the market by the company's repurchasing?
The Deputy Director General of the Financial Institute of the People ' s University of China, Mr. Zheung, said in his interview with the new journalists in China, that the repurchasing was one way to demonstrate the economic strength and better financial situation of the city companies, the ability to maintain the unit's price stability and confidence in investors; and that the mayor's company and its control unit were responsible for companies and the market and the consideration of investors.
The former was established in good business performance of the company and the latter demanded higher quality of the company and its control unit.
For the capital market, these are all the core elements.
The higher market company's repurchasing shares are conducive to boosting investors' confidence and contributing to the higher market's share prices.
In addition, according to the East Bank survey, according to the total number of expected shares settled by the company on the market since the beginning of this year, as well as the total value of the recovered shares, this year the amount of additional funds brought to the A unit market was expected to exceed $15 billion.
In the next two months, the National Focus-Purchase Unit will be reopened on 26 days after the day-to-day "Secret Map" of the Great Wall, which will be reopened during this year's season.
The "Sacrifice of the Heavens" is a comprehensive reflection of the great traditional walls of Mother's birth.
With the approval of the State-related sector, the capital of the Museum of Civilization of the Ancient City of Petroleum (Denmark) was formed from 1991 to 1994.
It is understood that this wall painting was painted in the south of the sky, on the north wall, 32 meters long, 2.6 m high, and the two sections below, with a rise in the sky and a rise in the sea, and more than 30 stories, including the rise of the sun, and 358 people re-showed the birth mark of their ancestors.
In recent years, according to the U.S. Secretary-General's report, more rain and winter rains have resulted in the collapse of the wall, which accounts for 60 per cent of the entire wall's surface.
In order to protect and save the mother-to-morrow wall, the Ancient Cultural Street Commission and the Post-Day Buildings of South-Westphalia launched a reconstruction project for the House of Heaven and the House of Commons.
The rehabilitated project was hosted by the Grand Duchess and invited four national artists to participate together.
Rehabilitation was based on the principle of "rehabilitation as old as" and was also adjusted to the content of the original building and additional repairs to the site where it was originally imperfect.
In rehabilitating, we have also done innovation and experimentation in color, materials, paint.
After the restoration, there were the wind, the spirit, the spirit, and the art of the original wall.
The sundial was built in 1326, the original name of the goddess, which was known as the daughter-in-law, and has been remodeled several times as one of China's oldest structures in the district of Mainz, as well as one of China's oldest grandmothers in the present century.
On 25 September, Beijing was hosted by a large international airport.
Beijing's international airport's construction site is called the "Seven Miracles of the New World."
At the present time, Beijing's international airport has been overloaded by overloaded by 1 billion + passengers last year, and the second year the world's second-year passenger is overcrowded.
It is expected that by 2022 the number of international airports in Beijing will reach 45 million times and the number of international flights will be 20 per cent; by 2025 the number of passengers will reach 72 million and the number of international flights will be 30 per cent higher than expected.
As "the new door," how cool is it?
Beijing's largest international airport between Beijing's metropolis and the city-wide district of North Carolina, which is 46 km away, is now the largest new site of global construction.
The surface of the roof of its buildings is 18,000 square feet [18,000 sq m], with 25 standard football sizes.
Beijing International Airport is the world's first airport with two arrivals and two departures — F1-F4, respectively, international arrivals, domestic arrivals, domestic departures and international departures.
The two-dimensional bridges outside the airport are connected to high-speed and airports, F3, F4 — international departures and both domestic departures are possible.
Beijing's leading international airport opened the Beijing "Two Airports" era.
The new airport is located as a large international airport, a new source of energy for national development, an integrated transport chain in the Kenzing region, which is now built in Beijing, with a total of 66 airlines aiming to enter Beijing International Airports, of which 20 are domestic airlines, 46 Porta districts and foreign airlines, and the number of airlines is on the increase.
In the winter of 2019, Beijing International Airport is expected to launch 116 lines of aviation, including 101 domestic airline, 15 of which cover 112 global flights, including 97 domestic air traffic, and 15 international airports.
This resulted in coordinated development with Beijing International Airports, an appropriate competition, an international two-way "Binn" airport platform with competitive international momentum, which has both reduced the size of the capital airport and reduced its operating pressures, and could better meet the urgent need for rapid growth in air transport in Beijing and around the surrounding areas and effectively boosting international competitiveness in our civil aviation.
In order to ensure efficiency and quality, Beijing's international airport has taken full account of its geographical location, its relationship with the surrounding area and its operating environment, its routes for the first time using "all types" in the country, the use of the world's largest air automation system, and the establishment of China's maximum terminal control zones, which can maximize aviation efficiency.
For the first time, national-scale airports have used national-produced railways and information management systems to develop innovative rail transport models and to improve the efficiency of rail systems.
Beijing is the head of the international airport, and it is predicted that it will hit the ground.
It has created 40 remaining international and first nationally, reaching more than 98 per cent of new airports, which will have a direct and indirect economic impact on the industry in the surrounding areas and will contribute to the entry into space for the economic development of Beijing.
It is proposed that the assembly be transferred to the Party by 16 years of age.
In early November, Malawi provisionally convened the Central Representative General Assembly, which proposed a revision of the Party ' s chapter into the Party ' s age of 16 years.
With the adoption of the Assembly of the General Assembly of the 66th Central Representative to be held this year, Malawi announced its proposal to amend the chapter of the Party, including the movement of the Party from under 18 to 16 years of age.
Director-General Nassuzrei said that the Commission was originally scheduled to convene the Central Representative of the General Assembly on 2 and 3 November this year, but that the date of the Conference may have changed as a result of the election of the Danish National Meeting.
He said that since the election committee would meet only on 1 October on the date of the nomination and vote in Denmark, they would discuss whether the date of the Central Representative of the General Assembly would be changed on Friday, 2 October.
He also explained that yesterday (26 days) the purpose of the Committee's convening was to set the date of the General Assembly and amend the chapter of the Party, and that it was only a matter of focusing attention on the issue of the right of association of the Conference of the parties to indigenous solidarity in Denmark to ensure that the laws of the Republic of Moab were not ill-deserved and therefore joined in the agenda for the election of the State party.
The King of the East East East Light Commission — The New Yorker of the Heavily Ingenuity
Kung-Bungao, East-Easter, born in February 1943 and in 1967 involved in the work, and later served in the Citizens, Citizens, and Mayors.
In 1986, King Ben-Bird signed the Treaty of Light in the province of Sang-Sang-West, while the light was the poor.
During the five years of the work of light, the King's heart was moved by three things: the promotion of food production; the development of North-Westphalia; and the development of industrial rotation; and the encouragement of the lighthouses from which lighthouses were encouraged; and the setting up of boards.
There are traditional food and lessons for the hungry farmers.
At the beginning of the 1980s, there was no sale of food for farmers, and it was buried in the ground.
The King's Landing Research found that it's key to getting food.
Light rates were first built on the market for the distribution of food and opened the front door for the development of the market economy.
The party members are taking the lead. They're fucked. They're all lost.
In 1989, with the support of the Kingdom, 17 party members, such as the three-day triangular kingdom of Judiciary, gathered 17 cold-cold meals and released 17 " two million books " in the village that year.
Later in the circle, a dispersion group was established and, under the influence of the Queen, the kingdom was headed around the villages; in the first year, more than 5,000 grain farms were grown and the grain was then spread to the whole country as a result of the drought.
For thousands of years, 160,000 landland in the north has been covered with sand, which is the seabed.
The local people live very hard.
There's a lot of food in the south, right?
Ten million people were killed in the Battle of Queens. They lived in the wilderness for forty-five days.
The government's leading department in the province is eating on the ground, driving a car like a civilian worker, opening up the air, and seeing the old people with their big fingers and eyebrows... when the north of the country produces 150,000 wells, 220,000 wells, and 600,000 wells, and on the hills, they develop " " .
In July 1986, the first time that King Burmese participated in the Industrial Conference in Zhao City.
During the meeting, an " industrial economic figures for the 12 district districts of the city of Chihuahua " were issued for comparison, with the total industrial value of Chihuahua, also good lighting, and grade IV.
But if the original is removed, the pure industrial product of light is only $119 million and the third is reduced.
The Queen has more than 70 crews running into the field.
In less than a year, the total investment of $150 million was based on 77 projects.
Every year thereafter, it was organized to " take the team " into deep, east and upper seas.
Immigrants, more entrepreneurs.
The President of the Queen-in-Office of the Council held a panel of thematics: 40 "entrepreneurs" from the public electoral director throughout the province were set up on an industrial line.
In 1991, the lights entered the country's hundreds of railways, and the Governor was appointed Vice-President of the City of Zhaoq.
He's left with more than 200,000 food stores, with 1.2 million rice fields, with 4854 companies, with more than 100,000 "cookers " , with hundreds of recognized forces. The Chinese people still call him "our bibliography " .
On 26 September local time, members of the State and the Queen of Foreign Affairs took the lead at United Nations Headquarters in New York, in China and in the African Council Member States.
Tono, Foreign Minister of Côte d ' Ivoire, Ojono, Foreign Minister of Equatorial Guinea, Pandor of South Africa and Cala of Niger, Foreign Member of the Council, and Jaginavi, Minister of Tunisia.
The Queen made four recommendations on strengthening cooperation between the two Central African parties in the Council.
First, it's a united force.
The greatest challenge in the present international situation is unilateralism, which directly results from the challenge of the basic norms of international relations, the role of the United Nations in shock and in harming the interests of large and small developing countries, including African countries.
In response to this challenge, there is a need for Central African handshake, arms and arms, and solidarity.
In the Council, three African countries spoke with one voice, and the combined segment was not only three votes but the entire continent of Africa.
China and Africa are represented not only by four votes but also by other countries, which will influence and shape the Council's agenda.
Since 2018, China has established a "3+1" coordination mechanism with members of the Council to make full use of this coordination mechanism.
Second, consult the dispute.
China has been promoting a political solution to the hot spots, a good tradition of consultation in Africa, as well as a successful round of experience between regional and subregional organizations in Africa.
Many complex issues on the Council ' s agenda, particularly Africa ' s hot spot, are largely colonialized and are directly related to external factors.
We need to make good use of Chapter VI of the Charter of the United Nations and play a good role in the rotation and mediation of the United Nations.
Third, rely on your own strength.
African countries and peoples are best aware of the problems of Africa, and Africa is also able to address their own problems wisely.
When addressing the issue of Africa ' s hotspots, the Council should focus on the will of Africa and should play a role in regional and subregional organizations and should encourage and support internal solutions from Africa.
China would like to strengthen its coordination with non-members and to strongly promote capacity-building for self-peace operations in Africa.
Fourth, based on development governance.
China and large African countries are developing countries, and we want to continue to put economic and social development first and support each other ' s ways of development.
China would like to build a " one-way " with the African Union " 2063 agenda " , the United Nations Sustainable Development Agenda, the 2030 United Nations Development Strategy for Africa, and to help African countries strengthen their development capacity to eliminate the root causes of conflict.
We would like to work together to promote the increased involvement of the United Nations in Africa ' s development.
The situation in the Congo (Kin) has again worsened, China has and will continue to support its efforts to provide capacity and human resources and material assistance, and will be willing to act in coordination with African countries to mobilize increased assistance efforts such as the United Nations, WHO and to play a role in the United Nations Stabilization Mission in the Congo (Gin).
The New Birth Section will be able to save small lives.
It's amazing!
A 32-week-old pregnant woman was forced to be born on her father's side of the car while working on the road to the hospital.
Fortunately, both the maternity section and the new pediatrician have been treated in a timely manner and have been able to regain this small life.
In fact, on 19 and 21 days, three premature babies were born on the road, and two others were born on 120 emergency vehicles and 29 weeks of early birth.
Ms. Jan was a second pregnant mother on 19 September at 7:00 a.m., thinking that she had been pregnant for 32 weeks, and the first one was early, and she had picked up the product and prepared to wash herself directly to the hospital.
After nine and a half hours, Ms. Gen was able to get his husband to the hospital from the east.
I don't think it's time for the car to open the door, and the baby will not be born on Dad's side of the car.
After 20 minutes, Ms. Gandhi and her precious daughter finally arrived at the Mother ' s Hospital for Baby Health in North Lake.
The hospital security was able to see the couple and the little baby, who immediately informed Mother's house that four doctors and assistants were waiting to see her pack and bags.
"At that time, half of the mother lay on the back of the car, under the skin of sheep and blood, and a male was next to it and tied to it. "
The baby is a 32-week-old baby. The parents don't come and cover their children's packs. The early morning mornings are full of purpose. He has washed his skin white, without crying, and four-year-olds.
She hurried to the back of her home to treat the baby's stomach, and quickly opened the mother’s pack, which she used to store her baby’s pills and the baby’s packs, and cleaned the bathroom (such as the picture), which she then held on to 12 new baby beds.
After the birth of a new nurse, the hospital was immediately able to rescue this precious former lady from the ground.
At that time, he was diagnosed with rare reddening and lack of oxygen. The doctor immediately gave him a ventilator regiment, not for a minute, and a beautiful resurgence, and a gradual reddening of red and success.
After entering the hall, this 32-week baby had a breathing machine, a continuous rescue, a breathing system, and a successful withdrawal machine on the second day.
After a week of treatment, precious life-sustainment, breathing, and breast-feeding have begun.
In fact, on 19 and 20 days, 21 days, three early births on the road were contacted by the Pregnant and Rebirth Section for three days, and two others were born on 120 emergency vehicles, 29 weeks of early births, and are currently active in the New Child Rescue Section.
In recent years, a number of women in the province have been born on land, and the preciousness of their private car, which is not a good deal to deal with, is a threat to the mother ' s safety.
The Director reminded me that when my mother became pregnant, when she suffered pain, water, and red blood cells, she should be treated immediately.
If the child is pregnant in the home or on the road, the mother should be at least at the level of the child’s weight, such as the baby’s lower leg, prevent the baby from falling from the back of the head, and the child should be breast-feeding immediately after the child’s birth, and the doctor should be informed as soon as possible.
More official operations of the New Air Technology Company
The establishment of VSTEA was one of the details of the memorandum of cooperation signed in April 2018 by VAECO and ST Engineering Aerospace, marking the question of the first Vietnamese aircraft maintenance and maintenance company.
Two air navigation technology companies in Viet Nam and Singapore cooperate to provide air navigation equipment and maintenance services to domestic airlines.
Over the years, the Director-General of the Aviation Company has expressed his commitment to the company’s related partners — ST Engineering Aerospace — the world’s largest and highest-level aircraft conservation group.
The more we navigate, the more we believe that this cooperation will bring benefits to both sides, as well as the opening of a wide-ranging future partnership.
The Head of ST Engineering Aerospace, Lim Serh Ghee, said that the sharing of experience with ST Engineering would help bind companies to provide international conservation and maintenance services to ensure the safety of flights from airlines.
VSTEA's survival has helped to increase its navigation towards a wide-ranging potential for accessing large-scale aircraft equipment for conservation and maintenance markets.
At the same time, there is a great opportunity for modern technology and training in air technology personnel.
It is therefore better to meet the sustainable development needs of the Vietnamese aviation industry.

The armed forces are promoting the intellectualization of industrial enterprises, giving the highest of $2,000 million.
The city series "Wonderful New China ", which was released by the Government of Washington, D.C., on 27 February, was announced at the city series "Worming China " and has been speeding up industrial engineering developments since this year and implementing the best transitional aid measures for 2000 million dollars.
At present, more than 800 industrial enterprises have been collecting information on demand-renewing capacity-building.
The Deputy Directorate for Economic and Information Affairs of the U.S. Department of Economic and Social Affairs has introduced a plan of action for the intellectualization of industrial enterprises this year to provide free advisory research services and solutions to the needs of higher-level industrial enterprises and to step up a new cycle of high-level enterprise technology.

Trudo's "people are breaking up," and can he succeed?
This time, when Trudo was pulled out of one of his heads, it was Trudo himself.
Recently, Canada's media linked several old photos of current Prime Minister Trudo, who portrayed Trudo as black.
This was seen as a clear racial discrimination, which soon led to widespread violence in Canada.
After the incident, Trudo apologized again to the public.
However, the Canadian population did not buy it.
Trudo's count is to move the stone to his feet.
As political commentators say, after the rise of the " Black Face Movement" from the United States, Trudo and the Federal Free Party have consistently been accusing the opposition party or the parties with a " great deal " in this regard, and many statements " should be dismissed immediately by any person who makes such a mistake " .
It's simple, this time, when Trudo was pulled out of a "big hole" with his head, it was a little bit of a hole in Trudo's head.
Trudo was the son of Pierre Trudo, former Prime Minister of Canada, a young British man who had just launched a "political image" on his way.
He was originally a "political figure" who, following the election of the Federal Free Party, fought a beautiful milestone in the 2015 federal legislative elections of Canada — half of the fedian Free Party's presidency in the federation's sub-station and received a precious privilege of unique group.
At that time, Trudo introduced many exciting political formulas, such as " " Eco-security " " " economic revitalization " , stressing corruption and " wrong wind " .
However, for five years in power, he had almost all of the above-mentioned haircuts, " high-fashioned walking " .
With regard to "ethnicity and gender equality" he did not speak of this "black face" incident, which he had previously done in a series of indigenous peoples ' oral benefits " , which led to indigenous groups leading to the transfer of protest accounts to the gates of the National Assembly during the 150th anniversary of the construction of Canada.
In the area of corruption, at the end of last year, Trudo was involved in the famous "Millions of Spirits" events.
It has been removed, and the construction company of its own village has been seriously infringing on private dance cases, pressureing the authorities and officials responsible for the investigation and demanding " high-handed " .
In addition, Trudo, who is angry at officials who have become angry at the disclosure of the case — the Kingdom of Canada mentioned in the preceding article — has been the first to disclose the case and is directly responsible for the conduct of the case.
Despite the fact that the case itself is still questionable, it is difficult to explain.
Many observers have noted that Trudo's five-year-old government has collapsed, mainly due to its own "floating" and that the largest "float" goes beyond the "floating " self-product" and "floating" of the law, which is more serious than the law.
The most powerful Anguis-Radder media data from Canada show that from 2015 until now, the number of visits to Trudo has increased from 60 per cent to 30 per cent from 60 per cent, while the opposition has increased from less than 30 per cent to 60 per cent.
Although other opposition parties and their leaders have shown similar ill-will, even a considerable part of the voters who still want to vote in the Federal Free Party are still unwilling to present themselves to this Federal Prime Minister, who is the head of the political party.
On 21 October, a new Canadian Federal legislative election was about to begin, and could Trudo replay a five-year-old winning drama?
The answer may be one word: difficult.
Whether from the level of business competition, the level of experience of consumers, or the integration of regional aviation, and the level of integration of Kinshasa development, have a profound and positive impact.
On 25 September, Beijing was officially transported by international airports.
Newspapers from Beijing City revealed that the capital airport had been in a state of emergency and operation and that international airports were in a good mood and would improve its airport service capacity.
Following the sea, Beijing became the second city with two airports with my own city, serving mainly in domestic aviation services with respect to the above-mentioned international airports, while the airport was similar to international aviation, and the future capital airports and major airports would also provide more detailed services to serve with a distinction between domestic and international aviation operations.
Global airport traffic, from an operational development perspective, has a more positive impact on capital airports.
The number of passengers in the capital airport fell by 10 million in 2018 and the country's capital, but there was still a clear lack of transport, especially international aviation requirements.
In order to serve better inland travel, to meet the needs of foreign tourists, to adapt to the growing needs of Beijing, to open-up urban development trends associated with international connections, and to set up large international airports as international airports, which plan to meet an estimated 10 million passengers per year, and to transport 4 million tons of mail.
As a result, the two airports are not revolving and there are also sufficient market space for different customer groups.
From the economic perspective, international air traffic in large international airports is clearly a two-off effect, reducing the pressure of Beijing air traffic, speeding up the growth of passengers and freight flows, and creating increased fuel for both operations in the capital.
From a user's point of view, the future would not have to focus on the launch of a major international airport and could also reduce a series of problems caused by over-focused airports, such as over-the-stop security times, increased travel speeds, direct increases in aircraft and passengers' stays at airports, increased the burden of operating at airports and reduced traffic through capital airports, and, in fact, improved the customer's performance experience.
According to the media's calculation of the number of travel times and costs for large international airports, such as the launch of a high-speed high-speed high-speed high-speed train from the South to the South, 50 minutes of driving can be achieved, the cost of oil is approximately 40 dollars and the cost of 15 dollars; and the choice of a high-speed rail train train is only 20 minutes away from the road and 30 km away, the price is $10,25 and 35 dollars; citizens can also travel from Kyongyon City and from Beijing to the major airport only 20 minutes.
In general, there are a number of transport tools available to citizens at major airports, and costs and time are also within a more reasonable range.
From a trendal development point of view: The location of the airport is the Künzin airport, so it is far from Beijing City, but it strengthens the north of the river, the launching of the tsunami, making it easier for more people to go out, and the economic development of the Rally River is important to the north.
In the future, in the north of the river, passengers will be able to enjoy more international air traffic services provided at international airports, which can be seen from traffic planning at large airports.
In addition to the new airport line in Beijing City, there are a number of high-speed road-connected airports and surrounding areas.
This is just as true of the east coast of Beijing, as well as of the city-to-the-petroleum, along the Broadway and high-speed roads, and of the green areas around Beijing and the inhabitants of the JoAnno district will also benefit from the airport and get efficient air services.
It can therefore be seen that high-level international airports have not only increased routes and several aircraft, either from the level of business competition, the level of consumer experience, or the integration of regional aviation, and the level of integration of Kinshasa, have a profound and positive impact and meaning, not only on the long-term long-term and development of the Cuban shipping industry, but also on the development of diverse options for the output of the general population of Kinshasa, to further enhance the quality of the Beijing shipping services, and to facilitate the integration of the Kinshasa development process, and to facilitate the development of trade in the surrounding areas of the airport.
Therefore, with regard to air traffic at large airports, we need more than a small individual account in the economy, rather than a whole development account.

Meeting of the Forum on the Economic and Social Affairs of Viet Nam, 2019 in the province of Al-Qaida
At the beginning of this year, the Vice-President of the Economic Commission for the Conference of the States of Viet Nam revealed that there were many new developments in the socio-economic development of Viet Nam and that the situation continued to grow.
This forum focused on economic social issues highlighted several months before 2019 and proposed measures for economic social development at the end of 2019 and 2020.
In the Forum, representatives of the Board expressed their views and views on the impact of the 2019 Economic Development and Part of the Trade Agreement, some of the issues highlighted in the 2019 Vietnamese economy, the 2019 Vietnamese social culture, and four topics such as the forecast and recommendations of the 2020 Vietnamese economic development.
The representatives generally believe that global economic growth slows down, increases risks and challenges in the first few months of 2019.
Trade molluscs among large economies further tighten global trade and investment.
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) found that, although the global economy is inexhaustible and 70 per cent of its global economies are in the state of growth, there are still many positive developments in Vietnamese economic development, macroeconomic stability, inflation being effectively controlled, and the average growth of population consumption index for the first half of 2019 is 2.64 per cent and the lowest growth for the next three years.
GDP growth of 6.76 per cent in the first half of 2019 , although below 7.05 per cent in the same period last year , is still higher than the level of the same period from 2011 to 2017.
In predicting the trend towards the development of Vietnamese economy in 2019-2020, Vice-President of the National Economic Prediction Centre for Viet Nam stated that there was a higher growth trend in the world economy in 2019 in the context of the global economy.
It is expected that by 2020, the Vietnamese macroeconomic economy will continue to remain fundamentally stable, and the implementation of trade agreements will contribute to trade development, economic structural adjustment, increased business environment improvements and the impact of trade fraud on foreign export activities in Viet Nam.
It is therefore necessary to strengthen the monitoring mechanism for early warning mechanisms to seek trade relief measures for Vietnamese export goods and to look for opportunities to develop new export markets and facilitate exports of various goods, such as agricultural products.
At the same time, inflation rates will be controlled at a reasonable level, thereby contributing to industrial development and supporting the development of high-tech agriculture, organic agriculture and organic agriculture.

The average monthly traffic between the government sector in the province of Zheun has reached 120,000 times, and the flow of data on the ‘Sweet’ can mean that the number of people running on foot is low.
Be careful with a cup of tea!
According to the "Central Society" report, a recent Canadian study found that one package of cookies could release billions of and even more than one million microwaves, significantly higher than one person's estimated annual intake, but there is no evidence so far that it would pose a threat to mankind.
Researchers at the University of Magyar, Canada, reportedly found that the bottle of tea was packed into almost hot water (95 degrees Fahrenheit), which would release about 11 billion bottles of tea and 3 billion smaller vitamins into the cup.
This figure is significantly higher than that estimated by one person throughout the year.
According to research content previously published in 2019, at least 50,000 microbes are consumed each year and consumed by the same amount of microbes.
The study was published in the "Environment Science and Technology Journal", where researchers tested four different types of Montenegrin Stores and the coffee office to open the tea packs and then to collect the tea bags into almost boiling water for five minutes after washing them, using electronic light bulbs and light bulbs.
According to this study, they found that a single cup of tea released more than 11 billion microchips, " several levels higher than those of other foods before. "
It is reported that most tea bags are made of natural rubber, but many of them are still used for natural tea packaging cards.
Part of the cardboard boxes are not used on paper, and instead they are used on paper, which is the subject of a test of researchers.
The microchip is a small fraction of the shellfish, and researchers define these sizes between 100 and 5 kilometres, mainly from the bulk of the shellfish.
Researchers around the world have found these microorganisms in the air, soil, rivers and deep seabeds, from water, bottled water, sea and beer.
For the first time in October 2018, researchers found microchips in samples from various countries around the world.
In order to test the potential toxicities of the microorganisms, the Canadian study team found that the microorganisms would affect the behaviour of these tissues and that they would be exposed to the development of the cascades.
According to WHO, there has been no evidence to date that the seizure of mercury poses a threat to mankind.
However, WHO noted that more research was needed to fully understand how these particles spread into the environment and how they affect mankind.
Researchers estimate that these packs may be due to large amounts of mercury and may involve contact with drinking water, even when the “food level” fat is heated up to 40 degrees Fahrenheit [40 ° C], or toxic substances may also be separated or extracted.
Gutres stated that the climate emergency was the greatest threat to the survival of small island States.
There, a natural disaster will affect the development of one generation.
Barbados, which has been attacked by hurricanes since this year, Dominica and the Bahamas have described the situation.
About one quarter of the island developing countries live in 5 metres or less of the sea.
Migration may seriously affect their social and life-styles, even leading to sovereignty and national identity.
At this week ' s climate action summit, small island States jointly committed themselves to achieving 100 per cent of carbon renewable energy by 2030, thereby re-directing the world in the right direction.
Gutres said: " The climate crisis is putting new injustices on the back of the old.
Despite the small island developing countries ' contribution to global warming, they paid the highest price.
Because these countries are in the middle-income state, many countries are also in the accelerated and unsustainable cycle of disasters and debt.
The world must take action, now is the time to make important decisions and to invest in small island developing countries. "
A political declaration was adopted at today's high-level meeting calling for assistance in disaster management by small island developing States, investment in climate-adjustable infrastructure and methods of transition to renewable energy; international institutions urged small island developing States, particularly middle-income countries, to obtain funding.
Small island developing States are at the front line of the oceans for the protection and preservation of life on Earth.
The latest special report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change this week confirms that the oceans have had serious consequences for the climate crisis.
By the middle of this century, many regions may have had an annual rise in extreme sea levels by the beginning of the first century.
The report warns that if there is no large amount of funding for adaptation, some island countries are likely to be unable to live.
Pollution, overfishing and acidification have caused great losses.
In the past 150 years, the world has lost half of all living cells, and in the past 40 years, the carbon pollution has increased tenfold.
The needs of industry, shipping, mining and tourism are leading to resource reductions, including the maintenance of many island communities.
Small island countries also face high costs of transport and energy and infrastructure.
They are heavily dependent on some external markets, which make them subject to price fluctuations on the right.
Some countries are also working to address the security effects of illicit trafficking in persons, arms and drugs.
Gutres said: " By solving a problem in the most challenging environment, it can be solved anywhere.
The efforts of small island developing countries to achieve the 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda will provide us with tools, lessons learned and examples that can be considered worldwide. "
He stressed that small island developing States were examples of sustainable development.
They need long-term attention and investment throughout the international community.
The Ministry of Finance of India has shown sufficient flexibility in the financial system.
On 26 September, the Minister for Finance of India stated that the current mobility of the financial system was sufficient and that India's economic growth was expected to recover during the next half-year of the financial year under the chain of consumption requirements.
Sitaraman made the above-mentioned statements after the meeting with the Indian private bank, non-bank financial institutions and housing banks.
Sitaraman did not describe the targetness of those words.
The past part of India's media and overseas media have been constantly slowing down the current economy of India into the dynamic tensions of non-bank financial institutions.
Sitaraman, for example, was sold by a car and denied mobility pressure as the reason for the sale.
Sitaraman noted that traffic sales were mainly affected by seasonal factors.
Sitaraman expects that under the chain of consumption of Sundays, economic growth in India may be restored in the next half-year.
The purchase period in India once a year will continue from September to the end of the year.
The market expects that the consumption of goods will significantly contribute to economic growth in India.

"I and my grandpa are talking about the school to make students "unhappy."
During the 70th anniversary of the establishment of the People ' s Republic of China, four leading seafarers, whitebirds, were invited to attend the " Artificial Party of the University of First World Trades " on 27 May, when four middle-historic representatives of over 90 years of seafarers described the origin of more than 200 young students, and the national soul.
List of products for which the current item has an old card.
The excitement in the classroom made the students uncomfortable, and outside the classroom, they carefully put on the product list of old-age cards, and "I and my grandparents" were "unfortunately happy" to the students.
The big white bean, the big white bean ice bean, as an old symbol card, the big bean bean are looking for positive changes in recent years, triggering attacks, maintain innovation and cross-border.
She was born in 1959 on her 60-year-old birthday this year.
Thousands of lives will also focus their attention on young consumers.
In a book by the Ministry of the Limitation of the Seabed Foods, Deputy Director-General Zhej mentions "the desire to eat fish, the hunger of the winter, the hunger of the winter, the hunger of the winter, and the hunger of the winter" as a reflection of the growing innovation in "food".
In addition, companies are increasingly collecting card culture in terms of food innovations and packaging designs, such as to adapt to the transmission of young consumer groups.
The old-fashioned representative describes how innovation is described in the "Artificial School" scene.
"All innovations leave no real basis, and every age innovation is a complex process.
Everyone's heart is hidden from the hope for the old one.
As a center of the product, small and beautiful times should begin."
As one of the first national "China's Old No. " , it was also possible to adapt rapidly to market flows, to the VI-visual upgrade of the cards, to the introduction of professional operating teams, and to the achievement of a significant increase in business volumes.
"In addition to these traditional channels, such as the supermarkets, the old codes can now be seen as active participation in new retail and activities.
All of our changes, finally to achieve such a purpose, are to enable consumers to see, hear, and finally get. "
The Deputy Director-General of the Overseas (Group) Limited Company said.
In the future, seabeds will also sustain high-performance development, develop a broad vision of the system, develop user-satisfied environmental products, maintain high levels of scientific technology and the path to high economic benefits.
Through this art party class, students received a scholarship.
The old-fashioned number, along with my grown-up, has contained a beautiful memory and feeling during childhood. "

" Some over-age farmers are estimated to be over half.
Where are you looking for young workers now?
There's no way to use so many 'olds' on the farm. "
In recent days, there have been a number of cases of over-age agricultural workers (over-retirement) who have been working on construction contractors for many years.
In recent times, high school seniors have been carrying out rain-distorting projects, where there have been a number of agricultural workers in the school, and if they have been observed there are a number of older farmers.
The work outside the age of farmers is not " unsatisfied " , but because old people who are "unsatisfied " have to do so" — whether they have money to solve their old age and health problems or to help foster children — continue to work hard.
It's not as easy as we thought.
Raising children, raising older ones, raising children, reading books, helping children to buy housing cars, helping children to become businesses, sometimes raising livestock, when these farmers have completed " life-long tasks " , the money bags have been emptied even a number of debts, and there is a lack of wealth.
In order not to discourage children from amassing some wealth for themselves, a number of farmers insist on " working hard until they are inactive " .
Many of the 80 "90" to "00 " generation-old farmers are unwilling to work under conditions, work-intensive secondary or low-service industries resulting in structural " waste " , which are not attractive and provide opportunities for older farmers.
In view of the lack of long-term skills, physical and labour capacities are also declining, and workers underage are working hard, low-income, high-risk and low-risk jobs.
A day is one day and a little more than a moment, and the living conditions of over-year-old farmers are not ignored and destroyed.
The problem of unemployment and unemployment, health protection, reduced security risks, increased labour income and improved the living conditions of over-age farmers, in addition to their " self-sustainment " , has also been avoided by the public sector ' s system of protection and human rights.
It was noted that over-age farmers could no longer rely on the possibility of returning home to solve their home and medical problems, and they had to step away from home by other means.
Reading the wisdom and strength of the "not to be shaken" workers helps us to better understand the love and pain of the workers of the past.
Seeing the background of over-age farmers, listening to their relief efforts to bring them back to their villages, they really achieve " old-fashioned " , they need the public sector, the market and society share responsibility in good interaction, and they need multiple strength.
Chemezov said that the Russian system would not be exported in the next five years because " the supply of its own army is first provided and then exports are produced " .
This practice is entirely in line with international practice.
The main producer countries of arms and military equipment always ensure their national defence requirements first and then deal with export orders.
In the early days, the Deputy Director General of the Russian Air Force, General Yuri Glehoff, indicated that the system's development work would soon be completed.
S-500 systems are developed by the "Cinconstone-Anti-Air Protection of the Sun.
This is a new generation of air defence systems that have applied the principles of work for the destruction of ballistic and air-powered objectives.
The main role of S-500 is to capture the average ballistic missile, which can be fired within 3500 km.
In addition, according to some information, S-500 could also destroy high-speed passenger missiles and aircraft, almost all types of non-aircraft, more than 5 times high-speed missiles, even in close space.
Such weapons can also be combined with other air defence systems as a single network, particularly S-400 systems, which is very important from a national perspective.
Sergei Chemezov expressed particular concern about S-400.
He said that the system was currently in great need in the world, but the Russian army also needed it, including in the northern region.
S-400 air defence systems are engaged in UNMEE.
According to a report dated 15 September, the work of the New Isle ' s NRA has been completed in the replacement of the S-400 air missile defence system.
This is not the militaryization of Russia in the northern region.
The Ministry of Defence of Russia claims that this is entirely the process in the transitional plan towards the north-east strategic direction.
The North-Easter Force News Service reported: " With the transition to the new S-400 air defence system, the control areas of the North-East region have increased significantly. "
It is very important that, according to military assessments, the system is successful in its use in the northern and northern regions.
The air defence officer trained the new system and prepared to enter the combat value field.
Formerly equipped there is a S-300 remote air defence system, which is still a part of it.
As for the air defence system, it must have weapons that can destroy all kinds of air targets, whether they are targets of high-speed flights at the external level or close to " fishing nets of protected facilities " .
According to public information sources, the S-400 " Triumph" system designed to attack strategic and tactical aircraft, ballistic missiles, high-speed targets and other air weapons, is designed to protect against radiation.
This weapon could attack air-industrial targets within 400 km range and fall within 60 km of distance with ballistic targets flying at 4.8 km per second.
Russia will never hide its deployment forces in the northern region in order to ensure the territorial safety of the North Sea.
Recently, the first 12 sets of Tor-M2DT air missile protection systems were delivered to the Russian Arctic region, which were sufficient to form an air defence camp to strengthen the North-Easter air defence system.
At that time, the Ministry of Defence of Russia indicated that the future of the North Toler Force would extend to the complete construction of the tourism structure.
The newly deployed S-400 remote systems on the New Isles and Kollah Islands as well as the Pantsir - SA short-range systems in the northern region, which have been highly protected by advanced air defence weapons.
The enemy's aircraft, helicopters and unmanned missiles will be difficult to break.
According to the Russian Government's view, the flagship will become a platform for the Russian manufacturer of goods to avoid its complex and long-term process.
Russian multi-enterprises, which are market operators, focus on selling Russian goods in China.

In the past, the car scene was played almost every day at public stations.
It is difficult to predict the time of public traffic, the public traffic situation and the location of vehicles, and the problem of public traffic congestion, especially in some large cities, road traffic leaders, and the complexity of road traffic in the early hours of the night, have made it difficult to guarantee public traffic benchmarks.
To this end, the South-South wisdom movement with the high-speed map of the high-speed Internet+transport service is in the process of exploring new directions for the public service and launching the first national "Internet + Smart Station" intelligent service project.
It has been reported that the first national "Internet + Smart Cards" in the South-West World has integrated high-level data as well as high-speed vehicles' ETAs, and is based on public e-stars and mobile Internet traffic data upgrades, both public wisdom stations and e-Maps, and public communications are expected to be available in time.

It was announced that the exhibition would continue until 30 January 2020.
The New York Times commented: We are definitely not going our own way.
In response to the White Paper "New Age China and the World" published on 27 years: for 70 years, China's development has been successful, mainly because under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese people have found the right path to development and are firmly moving along this road.
China's course of development is the choice of history, the choice of people.
Since the recent century, in the context of the accumulation of poverty and the spread of foreign diseases, one generation of peasants have sought refuge on their way to the rescue of the nation and followed them.
However, "You're the head of the constitution, the reconnaissance, the parliamentary regime, the multi-party regime, the presidential regime, you've tried, the outcome is not necessary. "
As long as there are China's Communist Party, there are new China, the Chinese people are gradually opening up a special socialist path in practice.
The road that China leaves is the path of the happiness of the people of China, the path of the People of China to the resurrection of the People of China, as well as the way in which China and the countries of the world are developing together.
It is because China is in the right way that it can do what it can to become the second largest economy in the world and that the largest countries contribute to global economic growth can continue to make a better world through its own development.
As indicated in the White Paper, this way of development in China, in line with China ' s state of affairs, meets the demands of the period, will become increasingly evident in the light of the development prospects in advance of the era.
Back in the first place, the Chinese people knew how difficult it was to find a right path; the Chinese people were more grateful for the right path.
The Chinese understand the logic of the South Pacific and understand that others are not necessarily suitable for themselves, but are best suited for themselves.
It is with such confidence and strategic strength that China has created a miracle for the world.
In the pre-human process of interrelationship, "the end of history" has been called one time.
Today, the success of China's unique socialist path has been announced as the end of "historic conclusion", the collapse of "China's collapse" and the failure of "Socialist failure".
China ' s success has strengthened the confidence of developing countries in the achievement of rich countries and has expanded the way in which developing countries move towards modernization, and has provided experiences and lessons for those who wish to accelerate development and maintain their own independent countries and nations around the world, in line with their national circumstances.
The world is rich in colors.
China has always respected the right of States to choose their own national path of development.
China will not "enter" foreign models nor "export" Chinese models but will be determined not to remove its own ways, achieve its continued development, strengthen its political exchange with countries and contribute to the common achievement of good governance.
In the Fair Work Commission, the chief of the city of Foodworks found that a 66-year-old female employee was employed by a letter of resignation, who was more willing to employ employees from the Asian background, who had been severely beaten by the boss as " poor " .
The Committee said that Ms. Gail Ayton ' s chief, Jianbin Wang, who worked in Wagga Wagga store for more than 20 years, had been working " very unfair " and could have violated anti-discrimination law.
Ms. Ayton told the Committee that Mr. King had taken charge of this store in 2016 and he had " wanting to kill me " because she was not a WAY.
In this case, Peter Sams, Vice-Chairperson of the Commission, conducted a search online and found " Mr. King's previous announcements of recruitment in various Australian employment forums " .
Among the requirements for work listed are the words " Ms. President of Asia " , the other words " First President of Asia " .
The third column says that he " tends to be more inclined to the outsiders (as originally did). "
Mr. Wang hired Ms. Ayton in April of this year by letter of resignation, which was later claimed to be due to her disability and the alleged lack of cash from $5.10 to $30.
However, Mr. Sams said that Mr. King had dismissed Ms. Ayton's reasons for employment, and there was no evidence.
For three years she's been missing only one job, "lost amount" for a few Australians.
He said that Ms. Ayton had been fired " without her behaviour or expression " .
He said: " I believe that, with the support of the evidence of the announcement of recruitment issued by Mr. King, the real motive of the defender to hire her should be that he was more willing to hire a staff member with an Asian background.
In accordance with article 772 (f) of the Fair Work Act, Mr. King ' s conduct constitutes a violation of the law of discrimination and/or of the dismissal of the applicant. "
Mr. Sams said that in view of Mr. King's treatment of Ms. Ayton's "advised " hearing," he considered it inappropriate to restore her position.
He should consider paying Ms. Ayton compensation, who was a temporary worker and who paid 26 Australian dollars.
In view of the possible violation of legislation against discrimination and labour relations, Sams stated that he would submit his own decisions and documents to the Committee ' s head to consider whether the conduct of Mr. King should be transferred to other bodies in order to investigate possible violations of State or federal law.
He said that Mr. King had no opportunity to respond to Ms. Ayton's alleged dismissal.
He said: " I believe that the defender should have taken unfair and prejudiceful procedures to disengage the applicant, Mr. King, " waiting for this opportunity, and he believed that it would be fair to end the employment of the applicant " . "
"He's wrong ... ...and the defendant should be totally ignore any natural fair treatment he has received when he has opened up the petitioner, and it's amazing that he is rude and very unfair. "
Mr. Sams said that although Foodworks was a small enterprise, " it must be said honestly that any qualified employer would not be able to eliminate employees in the most unfair and dishonest manner recognized in this case. "
He said, "This is ridiculous and very unfair. "
I'll bet you'll see how it's done.

A large number of tourism platforms show that our tourism consumer market needs two prosperity.
According to the country's travel report, it is expected that over 80 million domestic tourists will arrive during the holiday period this year, and more than 75 million people will travel.
There are currently more than 500 urban tourists from the platform, including 100 countries and regions, who are involved in the preparation of mass and free movement, the development of tourism and local entertainment.
According to the Chinese Tourism Institute, last year the country ' s holiday season totaled 726 million domestic tourists, with 9.43 per cent growth.
This year's holiday season will not only improve the number of visitors, but also become the " main rule " of national holiday season.
According to the report, over $3,000 was spent in the country during the holiday season and increased over the same period last year, resulting from the general choice of best-tested products, such as high-quality card hotels, no-procurement travel missions, smart young people, and car dealerships.
A similar trend is demonstrated by the planned Mummy Travel Network data, which is used throughout the country's long-distance model, and the "private mission" below is more welcome than last year.
Travel data from the spring revealed that its consumers were more obese than they had experienced, serviced, and varied " from slow to slow " .
The bird data show that our country's four-line, as well as the planned growth of visitors to the following cities, is faster than the increase of 30 per cent compared to the increase in the number of areas in which the population is exposed to increased consumption in more regions.
Personalization is a great feature of this year's "11" gold week tour.
According to the schedule data, the national holiday rental schedule is expected to be about 60 per cent higher than the increase, the short journeys of the small town along the border continue to be heated; the number of private missions is up to 155 per cent higher than the increase.
Share the pleasure as the main purpose of the holiday.

The world's highest-age actor died at 108 years of age.
Anthony Mancinelli, the world's highest-age actor in the world's gold record, in New York, has never retired as a guest at 108 years of age but died of cancer and cancer on 19 days of his life, telling him that he was born at 96 years of age.
According to the "CNN" report, when Mansinelli was 8 years old, she moved to the United States and had recently helped to clean up the space in a movie store, and at the age of 12, she began to take a knife to serve as a customer, thus reducing the economic pressure in the home.
Although there was a primary school in Mansinelli at the time, there was no formal education later.
Robert (Robert) of Mansinelli's son reveals that his father loved his work, and people from all over the world liked him, but his father was diagnosed with cancer this year, and he died about six years before the death of his body, but this was not a retirement, as he imagined he would have to go back to work again.
After his death, 82-year-old Robert said that he now had to find a new actor because he had been able to help him cut his hair.
In the past year, city companies have recovered over $1 billion from their new high-new-new generation network.
In order to maintain company prices, maintain company images, start the market share frequently over the next two years and collect the company's value to the market by determining the way in which it is to buy back and collect the transaction, thereby increasing investor confidence.
The Eastern wealth of Choice data show that in 2017, municipal companies used US$79 billion for the repurchasing share, which increased to $5.1 billion in 2018 and since 2019, A companies have been repurchasing over $1 billion in total implementation, creating a new increase in the acquisition amount of A once-in-a-life, and far beyond that previous year.
For the purposes of the repurchasing, the repurchasing portion of the company appears to be similar to the increase in large shares, but there is a significant difference in the implementation of the subject matter, the source of funds, the purpose of the repurchasing, the right to own shares.
In receiving the "Journal Journal" press interview, the Head of Company's Limited Information Advisory on the Overseas Seaport said that in November 2018, the comments " in support of the market-based repurchasing share " , had been revised by the Department ' s decision-making procedures and the problems of the existing unsound system of stockpiling, which had begun to encourage market-repurchasing shares in the past year.
In January of this year, the Office issued a formal " rules for the implementation of the Societies ' Procurement Unit " , which were issued in January of this year, which expanded the market's financial resources, duly streamlined implementation procedures and led to better governance arrangements and encouraged the implementation of the Societies Unit or the Staff Unit Plan.
Following the comments from the Board, the conduct of the repurchasing operations on the market was more applicable and the repurchasing process was simpler and the repurchasing of the shares was more positive.
In the relatively low-position recovery segment, it also contributes to the efficiency of the use of funds by companies at the top of the market, thus increasing the level of profits per unit, increasing the net asset profit rate and reducing the pressure on corporate profit indicators.
In comparison with the increase in the shares, the value of the acquisitions of the shares is greater than that of the capital companies, and there is also an indication of the market value management will and cash flow.
In his view, the price of the unit was underestimated as the main factor in the acquisition of the company at the top of the market, and the price of the company was no longer reflected in the future development prospects of the company, so such companies were worthy of the concern of investors, but could not go to investment for blind purposes, and needed to be concerned about the financing of such companies as well as specific operating conditions.
A large-scale repurchasing company at least shows its developmental confidence and financial strength.
The increase in the rate of return on the market and the normalization of the repurchasing has shown that nearly a thousand municipal companies have already been able to implement the repurchasing in this year and that companies from different sectors of the steel industry have become the dominant of the repurchasing market.
China ' s recent progress in the disclosure of returns in China has indicated that the company has accumulated a total of 57.5 million units of unit A through centrally purchased transactions, representing 0.315 per cent of the total unit of company, totalling $5.5 million (excluding transaction costs), and that the repurchasing unit will be devoted to the entire staff holding plan, including the long-term service plan that was considered by the General Assembly at the start of its consideration.
ILI has paid $5.92 million for the repurchasing and recently adjusted for the purpose of the repurchasing, and the original plan " will replace the entire repurchasing unit with " a total repurchasing of $183 million, of which $152 million will be used for the repurchasing of the repurchasing unit " , and the remaining 3049 million will be used for the cancellation of the recapitalisation capital " .
The ILI indicated that the cancellation of the repurchasing portion would help further increase the level of income of each unit and effectively improve the investment returns of the company ' s shares.
The TCL Group's progress report on 25 September revealed that the TCL Group had a total return of 3.59 per cent of the company's share and a total cost of $16.5 million.
The TCL Board Office of the Board of Directors of the TCL said to the "Court Journal" journalist that the repurchasing unit would be used for a staff member's plan to encourage or convert into a company that can be transferred into a unit.
The TCL Group maintains established operational strategies for increasing competitiveness and sustainable health development.
Based on the maintenance of the trust and interests of future corporate investors, the company shares are reflected in the second market for nearly a year and are integrated into factors such as the operation and financial situation of the company, which are planned to use their own funds, their own funds and other ways of financing.
The main economists of the Pre-Section Fund stated that the operation of the capital company's repurchasing shares could, on the one hand, reduce the number of shares that flow on the market and increase the income of each of its companies, which was an important benefit for the second-level market unit; and that the venturer's willingness to move out of the bank to the bank to withdraw from the shares's repurchasing shares, which greatly boosted market confidence.
In recent years, domestic municipal companies ' repurchasing has been a very good way of boosting investors ' confidence through partial repurchasing, which is also worthy of certainty and encouragement.
The Central Commission of the University of Leachon, the San Francisco City Commission, remembered the four main ports of Hullinwa and the engineering machinery — New New, Stiggen, Sanctuary, Aeroplane, and the "Sa's" round " from the engineering plant to the intellectual production of "a " target" — a world-led engineering industry group that was created three and a half years later.
In the long-term design of the world's leading engineering industry group, it is now " the strongest map " .
As the city of the province of the Netherlands, it's a long story. What's going on?
It's the power of the wind.
The four engineering machines that participated in the dialogue, one of which was covered, covered the sky, the ground, the entire area of the earth: the light planes of the mountain wisdom, the mixed soil transport of the Central Section, the three-worked ground flooring machinery, the construction of the railway structure, its "hard force" under the so-called unique sky, are visible to the crowd.
On several occasions, China did not have the right to speak in the construction of engineering machinery.
When Wei moved, China's companies introduced "Go Out" two-wheeled motions, combined with "One-way" initiative on the east wind, acquisitions, mergers, constructions, and launchs into the global engineering industry.
Three of them, the Central and Central Section, the construction of railways and the construction of mountain wisdom, engineering engineering companies, their product value, market ownership, sales, major economic indicators, such as the same type of enterprises, have been largely leading.
It's time for the camera to move.
The " four-pound" mechanical engineering team is the leading enterprise in the global engineering engineering industry.
Who survives and thrives in the lakes of global industries is the hardness of speech.
In the past years, the global engineering industry has suffered cold, and a number of internationally-known engineering machinery has collapsed, but long-term engineering machinery has built companies " milk " as " cold " , self-pressure, self-stampling, transforming through industrial structures, transforming into wisdom, not only in the past but also in the health of the body.
It's a political party that gives power to the moon.
The development of the priority industry, both in terms of active access by enterprises and in terms of government.
As a result of the long-term glory of "all engineering machines", it was in the form of a combination of all industrial links from above to below, a number of related industrial groups were formed and, through the improved business environment, a complete set of services, a simplified process of processing, enterprise development, production and sales costs were significantly reduced.
Good business environment, let the engineering machinery build up business.
History has led Sasha to the creation of a world-leading platform for engineering, when I do not expect it when I do not allow it.
Both Governments and businesses, including those related academics, should seize opportunities, on the other hand, to set goals, to continue to work hard and contribute to the building of strong South Powers.
The Queen presides over a meeting of the Foreign Ministers of China and members of the Council.
The King said that China and the African countries were good brothers and good partners.
In the past, now and in the future, China stands firmly with the African brothers.
We advocate the holding of this Foreign Presidential Meeting, which is a concrete initiative to implement the important consensus reached at the meeting of the African Cooperation Forum in Beijing last September with the leaders of African countries, to strengthen cooperation between China and the African States in solidarity with the Council and to promote the better support of the international community for Africa in achieving peace and development.
The King stated that Africa was the most important and trusted partner in China.
As a permanent member of the Council, China has always been a major developing country, including African countries.
In the face of the new situation, China, together with the Council and African States, is committed to strengthening solidarity and maintaining common interest.
Both parties should rely on the strength of solidarity, on consultation, on self-reliance and on developmental governance.
The Foreign Member States of Africa were grateful for the Chinese initiative to hold this meeting and welcomed the establishment of New China for the 70th anniversary.
Foreigners indicated that non-interferences were established on the basis of equality and mutual respect, and Africa and China were always the most reliable and demanding partners.
Non-Stately, China, as a permanent member of the Council, has played an important active role in Africa ' s affairs and has contributed to the promotion of a just and just solution to Africa ' s problems and great efforts and contributions to the protection of the interests of Africa and to promote peace in Africa.
Africa is currently facing a threat of terrorism and extremism, and only addressing security issues can Africa really achieve long-term peace development.
I look forward to further coordination with China in the Council and strengthening cooperation in solidarity.
The King said that today's meeting had reached an important consensus.
We all support multilateralism, strengthen the authority and role of the United Nations, protect the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations against unilateral and degrading practices; we all agree to strengthen cooperation between Central Africa in the United Nations and the Council, to maintain the common interests of the countries of Central Africa and the developing countries; we all support African countries in Africa in addressing African issues and in calling for the financial support of the United Nations for self-sustainment operations in Africa; we all support "cooperation in development, development" in order to help African countries achieve self-sustaining development; we firmly maintain the legitimate interests of developing countries against any country to create obstacles to developing countries and deny the right to development.
Günnnücken: The sheep of the lake are coming out of poverty.
In September the soil was contaminated.
The 58-year-old Shevili, a civil-profit professional cooperation company in the town of Zhao, adds the last piece of food in the sheep's yard and keeps it on the side of the hill and sees the white sheep’s mouth.
"It's good to eat, and when the winter is full, you can sell it at great cost."
Shaville said he gave the sheep "special food " every day, regularly to treat health care, to kill drugs, and to be patient.
She has fed over 20 years of sheep until the cooperatives have worked, knowing how poor sheep have been left behind in the past.
Shevili is a village in the town of Zheung-Zung-Sung-Sung-Sung-Sung.
His left-hand side is a shepherd, but he insists on traditional ways of breeding, sheep's quality, and sheep's size.
In June this year, under the direction of the Government, 140 poor people in the villages joined the cooperative and all began to change.
Shaville was also the first to have an abortion all day, because he always had one in his heart.
Those in the unit are poor houses, they're all handed over to their cooperatives, they can't share red, they're selling, they're waiting for him.
With the guidance of a technical person, he slowly learned how to prevent vaccines, had a scientific upbringing, and became a " good practice " in the village.
It is a standardized cooperative with 16 sheep and nearly 1400 sheep.
The co-owners of the cooperative said that there was a lot of doors outside of the standardized sheep.
"The sheep are dark, vulnerable to germs, the sheep are not allowed to stay in hot spots, the sheep must be built around and dressed in exchange for air. "
In order to prevent infections, it is also necessary for the treatment of foot-and-mouth disease and for one quarter of the sheep to have three to four vaccinations.
In addition to living well, "little sheep" must be eaten with vegetables such as wheat, corn, corn, and wheat, and have enough extensive "playing" to make their own bones.
Co-operatives have taken care of their livelihoods, leading local farmers to invest in good sheep here, to bring together feed, management, sales, well-being, scientificization, standardization and collective cultivation.
Today, more than 6,000 reds per year have been built with 140 poor households in the sheep unit, four of whom work in cooperatives.
From "full pasture" to "farmer" , from "local co-operation" to "man-made" " , from "body-made, skin" to "b" B super" . ... in the spring, sheep breeding is not only a way of feeding , but also a more changing view of "primary business+co-operation+farmer" of sheep once upon "mountaining, collecting sheep in the city" and overcoming the weak days of traditional farming and the poor days of farmers because modern shepherds have become well-adjusted.
It is said that, if market prices are low, local companies will be able to expand their agricultural development by cutting down on low-priced farms, which will help farmers to share market risks with the market base of 27 kilograms per kilogram.
According to the consultant-General for the Rural Development Limited in Ghenni, the company's services include the provision of loans to the poor through the provision of loans to the poor, the provision of sheep, the provision of individual crops, the payment of purchases, the uniform sale of processed services, and the growing awareness of " sheep " .

France's finance said the next year would reduce the tax by EUR 1 million and call for Germany to proceed.
On Thursday, 26 September, the French finance officer Bruno Le Maire stated that France would reduce the tax rate of €100 billion (US$109 billion) next year, while Germany should follow the financial incentives of France to revive the economy.
In introducing the French budget for 2020, Lemer stated that the latest European Central Bank monetary disbursement initiative created an additional investment opportunity for those Member States with capacity.
The European Centre landed on 12 September to record new lows and planned to reopen its debt to reduce borrowing costs, hoping that this would encourage economic recovery and increase the rate of inflation.
" Low interest rates will not bring Europe back to its current prosperity, and monetary policy measures are essential but not enough," Lemer said to the journalist.
"Germany needs to invest, now needs to be better. Don't wait until the situation gets worse," he added.
He has made this appeal to Germany several times.
France has implemented more than EUR 100 billion this year, which has greatly boosted France ' s economic growth.
And the global economy has lost its momentum, depending on the German economy's export leader.
Lemmer noted that the tax burden on the French family would reduce €9.9 billion next year, including the tax relief received from €500 million.
In addition, corporate tax rates will decrease from 33.3 per cent to 25 per cent over the five years, while corporate tax burden will be reduced by nearly EUR 100 million.

Research: A small increase in U.S. health eating indicators, but still having challenges in the new network
A recent study by the United States of America shows that the United States Government's health food index has grown from 56 to 58 over the last 16 years.
But in the case of 100 minutes, this is not worth celebrating.
American citizens are still facing " significant challenges " while eating.
One of the authors of the study, Dr. Tavez University of Massachusetts, stated that Americans are still getting too much food that can lead to heart disease, diabetes, diabetes, and diabetes, which are the most common diseases in the United States.
The study was published on 24 days in the U.S. Medical Journal.
The study was based on the conclusions of the United States Government's health survey of 4.4 million adults between 1999 and 2016.
The authors wrote: " Despite tangible improvements, significant food challenges remain " .
These challenges were reported to include reducing the consumption of food for the United States of America, including wheat and barley.
Studies have found that people's intake of these unhealthy foods increased from 11.5 per cent to 12 per cent, above 10% of the recommended intake.
The biggest improvement in U.S. food is that the intake of sugar decreased from 16 per cent to about 14 per cent, but the volume of intake is still high.
Officially, the amount of added sugar should be less than 10 per cent.
For reasons of reducing sugar intake, researchers believe that the reduction in sugar intake is related to the reduction in sugar intake, but stress is stressed that sugar-types are often added to non-sugar foods such as sugar and sugar.
American adults have a small increase in their intake of food from fruit, vegetables, vegetables and other types of whole grains.
However, the 2016 data showed that these food levels remained below 5 per cent of the daily food consumption.
Despite a slow reduction in the intake of the particles, the decrease in the intake of low-quality hydrocarbons, however, indicates that they are still higher than 42 per cent of the daily temperature, many of which come from white surfaces and other stimulants of processing.
This study is based on an individual health survey every two years, which will bring to mind the food they eat within 24 hours.
These health surveys have been asked twice every few days since 2003.
The U.S. Food Guide on Food, published by the Government, recommends that people use " healthy eating patterns " to reduce the risk of chronic diseases.
The Guide points out that more food should be absorbed into food intensively, such as food, fruit, whole grains, low milk products, and can be supplied with protein, meat, meat, meat, eggs, seeds, seeds.
During the IP, the number of people suffering from diabetes in the United States increased almost once and more by over 7 per cent, and the rate of obesity increased during the many years of the movement — such as today’s 70 per cent adults who are overweight or who are pregnant.
In addition, heart disease remains the main cause of death for U.S. citizens.

"Electronics, weather data, other major data, such as weather data, can help us better focus on a region, an industry's vitality and climate."
In addition to risk mitigation, large data technologies will also contribute to improving air control capacity.
The most deep record of the Chinese railways has been printed.
On 27 September, the New Hampshire National Park (Central Park) was built for over 1200 days of night construction, completed on 27 September at the foot of Mount Lisbon, and reached the ground below 762.59 meters, and destroyed the deepest record of the Chinese Railway Railways, which was created in large quantities of water.
The Highway Highway of the Alley of South-Westphalia, 34.5 km long, is located on the south-west bank of the Great Mountains, the longest road on the Asian Bilinear Line.
This road passes over 19 sections and covers a maximum of 1155 metres, since almost all road construction workers are exposed to the negative and serious risks that can be identified as the " geological museum " built by the mountain Highway.
It is one of the most important support routes in the mountain range, which is responsible for increasing the performance of the "long-distance" and later rail traffic.
Number 1 successfully landed at the bottom of the well, marking the formal entrance of the High Mountain Road to the levelway construction process, which could increase four operations at the bottom of the deck and after replacement of the parking lot and equipment.
"The whole area of the flower tree, the size of which is more than the size of the flowering area, the size of which is not inhabited, and the constant flow of water from above, is basically how much deep water there is. "
The Director-General's Director-General of the Central Railways Project of the Office of the Central Bank told the reporters that there have been a number of accidents in the mining industry, such as floods, droughts, and construction sites and 20 other seminars on the treatment of waste.
"The largest inland waterway, up to 300 metres per hour, and 700 metres deep, is equivalent to 700 metres deep. "
The show said, "If it wasn't time to draw water, it'd take about 10 hours, we'd be almost 85 percent time to fix it, and 15 percent time to get it in."
In order to overcome the development of the 1st circle of the wall, tortoise water, geogeographical issues such as well-favoured water wells, to use "exploration, note, codification" combined system water management measures to reduce construction risks.
After several improvements, the construction of the 1st floor has created an open-up system, an out-of-room system, an elevator system, a motorized water line such as the vehicle upgrade system, an explosion, an outlet, a model installation, a full-time mechanization operation such as the mixed-ground.
Finally, after more than 1200 days of night construction, it was successfully completed with a depth of 762.59 metres.
The total length of 330 km of the road, which is an important component of the Mediterranean international road, is the implementation of an important transport infrastructure built by "one road".
After the construction of a motor vehicle, largely due to the 6-hour road time of Reyrie, the road will be reduced to 2 hours, and the road transport system will significantly improve in the areas of South-East Asia, which will often play a role in promoting cooperation between China and South-East Asian countries and their friends.

This took the children away from France.
It was reported that on 16 September, when the British family visited a river in France, she was not careful to turn a package into a car key into a lake.
But they've spent a few hours, and they couldn't find the keys.
And they're all locked up in the car.
Despite the earlier purchase of insurance by British tourists, insurance companies refused to help with vehicles that had not been stolen.
They just hired a truck to get the car back to a repair plant and then refurbished the keys from the car manufacturer.
A few days later, British tourists finally received the key of adjustment, which led to children leaving France for their husbands.
And their planned journeys were forced to be cancelled because of the loss of the vehicle keys.

On 27 May, the Overseas Market Control Board signed a memorandum of work with the Government of the new Prussian region and introduced 20 market control reform measures, some of which fall within national priorities.
It was stated that the commitment to inform the Administrative Authority in dealing with the matter of registration of licences was in writing to inform the applicant of the conditions under which the legal provisions were laid down and the request for one-time notification.
Once the applicant has signed its commitments, the Administrative Authority can be addressed directly.
According to the memorandum, the Overseas Market Control Service will support the registration of business names in the new and overseas-trafficking areas in the new and overseas-trafficking areas, the operation of simple manufacturing processes, low-risk food production permits, the type-approval of parts of measuring machines, and the promotion of business access.
On the 27th day of May, a limited number of marine food companies obtained " food production licenses " through the notification of their commitment, becoming the primary undertaking for the benefit of pilot raw materials.
The owner of the company stated that food licenses could also be obtained at the premises and that he had also adopted a " non-acceptable" approach, i.e. allowing the undertaking to submit part of the material within the time limit agreed to by the notice of the undertaking " .
The Overseas Market Control Service indicated that the implementation of food production authorisations was a national priority test.
After the reform, the review cycle was "registered, accepted, verified, tested on site, sampled, tested on materials, checked "6 rounds" to "registered, accepted, reviewed" 3 rounds, completed 20 working days prior to the reform, and completed on the site.
In view of the high-level characteristics of the economy outside of the East, the Overseas Market Control Service has placed the registration right of permanent representatives of foreign (region) enterprises in the Upper Sea region, which facilitates close management of enterprises.
Statistics show that the decentralization of this right relates to the total number of 1592 permanent representatives from the Upper Sea of the region, 99 of which have been regulated by new regulations.
"11" is a long-term consumer survey: choose more than a tourist priority.
The President of the State has been lying close and people's holiday plans are being phased out.
The "Court Journal" newspaper recently launched a small survey on "11" holiday arrangements on a friend's circle, showing that although there are different plans, "Tourism+ consumption" is the key word for "11" holiday season.
In particular, more than half of the people chose to travel in response to the "Court Journal" of the newspaper.
" During the " 11 " period, the plan was to take the family to the sea, the first stop, and then to the surrounding city " ; one of Beijing's women chose to travel to our country, " a three-day trip out of Taiwan on 28 September and a ten-day trip on the island " ; a re-sounded young lady planned to travel to Singapore for a purpose; a voice from the North Sea was chosen from the beach, saying " The daughter is not two years old, she is not too easy, and she is planning to go to the mountains and play on the coast " .
The joint "Report of the 2019 Golden Circles and Travel Trends" published by the Coalition Coalition and the Coalition Travellers show that this year's Gold Week is on its way out and is on its way to stay and that there is a clear trend in consumption growth in three different areas of the journey.
Aeroplanes, high-speed high-speed upwards, star-level hotels and individualized non-marked accommodation requirements are higher.
On 23 September, the United States "Tourism trends report for tourism" showed that tourism consumption continued to deteriorate and that the situation of "eating" is becoming more and more multidimensional.
More young people are looking for high quality greens, with special experiences, cultural tourism, inter-night tourism.
In addition to tourism, all types of consumption needs are also concentrated during the "11 " period.
Mr. King of the House said to the paper newspaper, "This year's main plan is to buy cars."
In Beijing, 4S car ticket staff reported to the "Court Journal" journalist that it was common to say that in September each year, gold was sold in October.
A number of activities will be initiated during the "11" period, such as the prize, to the downsizing of the store.
A number of new types of vehicles have been introduced in recent times, and it is expected that new products will be significantly more effective in reducing the impact on consumption.
Under the rising trend of consumption, consumption of services, such as culture and education, is more important than ever increasing.
" Since the birth of children, culture and education have become the major cost of family consumption, Ms. Dou of Beijing.
This year's "11" is completed to go to the "Taka's" theater, the Children's Theatre, about a few weeks later to the "Ca" museum and the "Cao" museum and the "Cao" museum, and arranges for some hearing test courses. "
It was stated that, theoretically, the growth in the consumption of the population was driven by sustainable consumption to developmental consumption and enjoyment of consumption, some of which enjoyed a relatively small part of the consumption of services.
As our economic society continues to grow and the level of income of the population continues to grow, people are increasingly focusing on mental needs, tourism and tourism as a good way of doing so.
In particular, the "11" country's long-term holiday is more time-consuming and people are more willing to travel and consume, which is both able to meet their spiritual needs and represents an increase in the consumption of the population.
In the morning, it began to rain, and it was not willing to go out, and it was not possible to adjust the situation of the children.

Look at the wall, just at 7:00 a.m., and the sun's rising early, and the sun's down.
It's been months in my friend's circle, and it's really late today.
He washed a friend's purse and left half to Boo, and left the rest in a favorite little flower and went out to see the moon.
And Nana's sitting on the ground, I ate her skin, and I used her hair as far as I could.
The light of the moon is hidden in the darkness, and the light of the moon is hidden from the light.
The brain is full of words about the moon, and it has a clear preference for the word: every three-fifths of the mission round/full of the light shield/last-day round/sighted thousands of people.
Maybe we're giving too much of a month's colour, and I'm talking about what I'm talking about now, actually, that's God's return to God, Caesar's reward is best.
The moon turns into the moon, the love of you.
It's finished. This mission is cold.
Nana had a small voice at her feet, stood up, and put the little goat of Nana on her small house, and Nana liked to sit on top of it.
La Open the door. Are you ready to wash the water?
The window from the bathroom is not looking for the moon. It only feels the moon, closes the light of the bathroom, and opens the window.
I didn't eat the moon. I didn't drink.

"The most important thing is that we are from what organization and political union?"
"This is a great test of our political union for many years, and we believe that the country is on its way to hold some valuable values. "

A village in the North Sea for the purpose of catching wild animals was sentenced to 15420 dollars in compensation for environmental damages to the North Sea (people's currency, below).
As a result of the poverty of the family of the accused, the prosecution authorities have launched an alternative cost-repetition of work and an opportunity to achieve legal and social effects.
The Deputy Prosecutor-General of the Office of the Defence Court presented on 27 February that, through alternative work, such as the three-month "obligatory mountain " , the defendant had already developed a deep feeling and a wild pig and had been responsible for previous hunting.

The United Nations has issued " Earth Guard Awards " for "Sweet Forests "
In a warm tone of voice and rehearsal of music, the head of the "Water Forests" project, the representative and the user were thrilled to go to the leading platform and received the United Nations "Golden" award in 2019 from the president.
The 2019 Earth Guard Award was held in New York, U.S.A., on 26th anniversary of the "Estimulation and Action Award" of the "Stimulation and Award" project involving millions of people participating in environmental operations.
A week ago, the United Nations Environment Programme announced a list of prizes at the headquarters in Nairobi, Kenya, but those who participated in the award still had difficulty.
When the Executive Director of the United Nations Environment Programme, Mr. Enno, accepted the interview of the New Yorkers, he said that "The Rain Forest" was an exciting innovation that enabled billions of people to take action to understand what the environmental challenges facing mankind and what humans can do for the environment.
It combines technology with the environment and enables each body to participate in action to protect the Earth, which will have a significant impact.
In August 2016, "The Forests" was launched by the Chinese Financial Service Group on Winging (the so-called Golds) to pay off the precious platform, and the user to record the greens of his daily life through the Red Forests, and the low carbon actions, such as the cost of paying for water, collect " green energy " , on the phone " . "
Every time the user grows a tree, "The Forests" and public partners will be the next tree in the desert area.
As of August of this year, 5 million "Sweet Forests" users have reduced their total carbon consumption by 792 million tons, and they have grown to 1.22 million tons in desert areas.
In the " Earthguard Award" issued on that day, Costa Rica ' s national security efforts were rewarded, where former Costa Rican President Carlos Alvarado, who was present at the summit, commended the contribution of "The Rain Forest", " which could stimulate so many people to participate in green action and make them think deeply " .
The Chief Chief of Golds and Chief Executive Officers said "The Earth Guard Award" was certain of the "Sweet Forests" project.
The technical and open platform makes it possible for people to participate in low-carbon life, which is an honour for all participants.
In the past three years, the "Sweet Forests" has affected 5 billion people, and in the future three "Sweet Forests" has been aimed at encouraging the global involvement of 100 million people in low carbon operations.
In combating desertification and protecting the environment, they are also exploring ways to increase farmers ' income from green water.
In addition to the provision of employment through trees, it is also hoped that the electromagnetic platform will help farmers achieve their growth through agricultural development projects.
The model of public environmental protection based on digital technologies created by the " Forests " has also been successful and is taken into account by other countries.
In June of this year, the largest "GCash electronic money package" launched the "GCash Forest" version of the Philippines, encouraging the Philippines user to better protect the environment through low-carbon life.
The GCash will join the Philippines Environment and Natural Resources Ministry, such as environmental welfare organizations, and plan to start 365 million trees within the Philippines within a year.
The Earth Health Award is the highest award in the United Nations field of environmental protection, issued once a year.
The "Water Forest" award was awarded after the construction of the China Seung Jo Forest, the Chinese province of Zhaoji, the "Million-Lun village" model, and the "Waham village" project, which continued in the third year from China's green innovation project.
The U.S. " performance list " has an impact on the US economy.
The United States ' second quarter economic success list this year shows that private sector investment and exports have a significant downward impact and that the United States GDP increase is significantly slower than the previous quarter.
The analyst noted that the uncertainty of trade and its effects was a factor that led to private sector investment and export downturns in two quarters.
The final modification data published on 26 April by the U.S. Department of Commerce showed that the United States GDP grew by 2 per cent at the rate of 2 per cent in the second quarter of the United States, while significantly lower than 3.1 per cent in the first quarter.
Data show that consumption growth is a major factor in the economic growth of the United States of America in the second quarter of the year.
The United States total consumption of approximately 70 per cent of the individual consumption during the season increased by 4.6 per cent, with a slow economic growth of 3.03 per cent.
In addition, Government consumption expenditure and investment slow economic growth were 0.82 percentage points.
However, private sector investment in the second quarter decreased by 6.3 per cent in the second quarter and delayed during economic growth by 1.16 per cent; exports by 5.7 per cent at the highest in the second quarter, and net export delays by 0.68 per cent in the period.
The U.S.A. Joint Managing Corporation of Ensed Micro-Economics, Bari Kneap, said that private sector investment was not only able to keep growth growth in the past year but also significantly reduced because of economic and uncertain growth in business confidence.
Knap believed that, under the uncertainty of policy implications, future U.S. capital expenditure was expected to remain below the current situation.
The analysis suggests that although consumption growth has created a strong impact on the United States economy for the second quarter, there is growing evidence that the uncertainty of trade and its consequences have affected consumer confidence and has a negative impact on the future of the United States consumption.
Researchers, Professor of Economics, Chad Quentin, University of Michigan, noted that 38 per cent of consumers in the recent survey reported the negative impact of tariffs on the United States economy, which was a new one-and-a-half year.
For future economic developments in the United States, analysts generally believe that the United States economy will continue to slow down.
However, experts have also indicated that the United States industrial sector and financial markets will be improved if the economy has been eased.
British economists Global economist Kevin Berchi expects that the future United States economy will continue to slow down its trend since this year and increase to a level of less than two quarters.
MUDI's lead economist, Mac Zaddy, predicted that this year's economic growth would be 2.3 per cent and that the next year would be further slowed to 1.6 per cent.
The investment manager of the Patton Investment Company, Ellen Hae, said that the biggest concern of today's companies was the uncertainty of trade and its consequences, and that, if it could be resolved by trade, uncertainty would be significantly reduced and the industrial sector would be much better represented.
Mélie, a member of the Miller-Tabakka asset management company, said that the business remains " the main problem " , which is also the main cause of the major fluctuations in the U.S. capital market this year, which will be key to affecting the movement of US capital markets in the rest of the year.

The transfer of central enterprises has a certain size.
At the local level, pre-term work on enterprise transformation was carried out on a continuous basis.
As at the end of 2018, Zhao-Qaida had completed its pilot work in the two provinces of the South and had $15.5 million in capital allocated to the countries concerned.

The transfer of funds from the real company security fund — from the start of the "full company security fund" — is aimed at providing strong support for pension guarantees.
However, the author believes that this is not a simple unit " physical transfer " but a " mathematical law " .
On 20 September, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Human Rights, the National Finance Commission, the General Tax Administration, the Credentials Board issued " notice on the work of the Comprehensive Capital Transferred-Access Fund " , a clear timetable for the Fund for the Fund for the Fund for the Financing of Transfers, i.e. the work of the Central and Local Transferred-Accessed-Accessors in 2019.
After the publication of the document, the financial sector, such as the Ministry of Finance, was implemented quickly.
On 25 September, the Ministry of Finance will transfer the business bank held, 10 per cent of the shares of the Agricultural Bank's right to a company security fund, and two units will transfer the total value of more than $11,500 million.
According to the provision, entities such as the Social Security Fund as a financial investor enjoy the right to income rights of the included State with unitary rights, the right to disposal and the right to information.
In the press, agriculture indicated that this change of interest would not result in changes in the original and actual control unit of this line.
In this regard, it was felt that the conversion of the same State Entrepreneurship Act was not a simple change in the inheritance of the Unit, but rather a " legal settlement " that could stimulate a series of effects.
The first step of the State ' s transfer guarantee " is that it is natural for the State to have a business for all its citizens and to share the development results with all its citizens.
Over the years of reform, the country has focused, in particular, on major sectors and areas in our economy, which are stronger and more stable in overall profit-making capacity.

The second phase of the " results of legislation " , which is the basis for strengthening the sustainability of my National Social Security Fund and further strengthening the old-age social security system.
With population ageing, our community security funds are under pressure, and this time as a country-owned resource, most of which have sustained profits and redundancy, it is not only possible to supplement the social security fund effectively, but also provide source-based water for the social security fund.
It has been estimated that each conversion of 3.8 per cent of countries has capital, i.e. one per cent of the holdings of basic old-age insurance can be supported by enterprises.
The third step, translated " results of legislation " , is an increase in the stability of capital markets.
The way in which this subcontractor receives income is " red-headed and executed as a supplement " .
As a financial investor with national capital, the Social Security Fund is indeed the master of the share capital of the unit.
As investors in the capital market, however, the social security fund has a stronger capital operating capacity.
For sovereign capital assets in the country, the social security fund will participate in the holding unit, further upgrade the governance structure of the corporate law in the city and contribute to the promotion of business operating levels and have a positive positive impact on companies and capital markets.
At the same time, the Social Security Fund, as a target of investment, has a strong influence on the promotion of unitary rights, will contribute to further strengthening its market impact and to the role of "stabilizers" in the market.
In addition, the "values" of institutional investors have been found to be useful for the full performance of their "value" functions, leading to the rational investment of investors and investment.

The United States Senate on 26 September in Washington, New York, has voted on the nomination of President Taranup to Mr. Yukin Skaria as Minister of Labour.
The vote was adopted by 53 votes to 44 with none in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
The Co-Parties believe that the experience of Skariya makes him very suitable as a minister of labour.
However, it appears to the Democratic Party that Skariya has been standing in the face of workers and trade unions for a long time during the life of lawyers.
It will replace Alexander Acosta.
As a result of the " extensive treatment of the United States of America's billions of girls involved in alleged rape and trafficking in girls, the Minister of Labour, Augusta, announced her resignation in July this year.
Skariya is now 56 years of age, a partner in a well-known law firm in the United States whose father has been the judge of the Supreme Court of the United States.
The Ministry of Labour is the Federal Government of the United States of America's senior branch, which is responsible for labour-related matters.
The White House also issued a statement on that day that Taranup had appointed the agency officially led by the representative of the Federal Emergency Measures Agency, Peter Gena.

The presence of the armed forces is highly appreciated for their ability to eat, to fight, to fight, to fight, to give special attention to the spirit of dedication, to serious training, to the training of the army, and to show good strategic military images and to give greater attention to serious winding events.
This time of military training, whether general or military, requires strict standards for the construction of mines and ordering hard work that is prohibited.
They also focus on the spirit of generosity, taking every detail of technology, skill, training, and wind, forming a feature such as "majority, rapid movement, speech clarity" and increasingly making a weapon missile platform with greater emphasis on scientific innovation.
As a high-tech strategic army, the rocket army is a well-established and innovative one.
This time, they were trained by the military, based on their previous experience, to break the pattern of maintenance, break traditional approaches, use satellite positioning, radiation detection, high imagery, real-time speed analysis, improve training levels and quality efficiency, ensure that cars are combined with poor quality, that the team is able to act in a more favourable manner, and that it is more in line with the standards of war.
The armed forces are subjected to the same standard of access to the military and launch sites, which is more demanding to accommodate each bridge, to force every detail, to allow the force to be seized by fire, and to truly allow the State to access military stations as training and training stations for the promotion of force combat.

China ' s development is an opportunity for the world, not a threat and challenge.
White Paper: China ' s development is an opportunity for the world, not a threat and challenge.
The White Paper notes that China ' s development is an opportunity for the world, not a threat and challenge.
The White Paper says that as China's combined national and international influence rapidly increased, some international concern was expressed by China ' s " strong " path, and some suggested " China ' s threat " .
This has been known as a well-known misreading, deep-rooted prejudice, strong mental imbalances that have led to the removal of the mental imbalances, and has resulted in a sharp disturbance in the maintenance of their own interests.
The realization of the country ' s wealth, the people ' s well-being, the people ' s happiness, both the dreams of the people of China and the common dreams of the peoples of all nations.
" China ' s development is an opportunity for the world, not a threat and challenge. "
The White Paper notes that China is the main stabilization and source of global economic growth, China is the largest contributor to world economic growth, China's technological innovation is introduced into the world economic growth, and China's future stabilization and the role of energy sources is more evident.
The current global economic growth is inadequate and the strong Chinese economy is increasingly important to the world.
China ' s economy is moving from high-quality growth to high-quality development, new industrialization, informationization, urbanization, rapid progress in agricultural modernization, deep economic structural adjustment, continued improvements in industrial improvement, and new economic growth.
" The study of the Mackenzie Global Research Institute believes that by 2040, China and other economies in the world are expected to create an economic value of $22 billion to $37 billion, corresponding to 15-26 per cent of the total global economy, and that increased cooperation between other economies and China will create a huge economic value. "
The White Paper emphasizes that China ' s economy and the world economy have undergone structural changes and is closely integrated.
Economic operations are more stable, higher quality of growth, and China's prospects for growth are long-term benefits to world economic development.
Viewing China ' s economic development as " threat" and " challenge " as an attempt to pull China out of the global industry, supply chains, value chains, link China to the world economy " , is both impossible and harmful .
The White Paper notes that openness on the part of the whole creates more opportunities for countries to share " Chinese Red Cross " abroad.
China is firmly determined not to move towards an open strategy for mutual benefit, to achieve greater strength, to open up to higher levels, to have the world's most potential consumer markets, to be the most attractive investment destination in China, to move out "for the benefit of more countries."
" The opening should be bilateral, mutually beneficial and not one-way and beneficial to one another.
Both benefits can last a long time."
The White Paper states that China has committed itself to continuing to expand its imports, to extend market access, to improve the business environment, to strengthen intellectual property protection, and that other countries should also expand openness and take appropriate initiatives to work towards improving their own business environment.
The only way that all parties can produce an open, inclusive, balanced and mutually beneficial development environment is by increasing the growth of the "product" of development together and creating a mutually beneficial community of interests.
The White Paper notes that China provides more public products to the international community.
Including the promotion of high-quality " one-way " , with multilateral dialogue and cooperation platforms, active participation in international and regional affairs and active external assistance.
" China ' s development benefits the international community, and never forgets its return to international large international families, providing better public products to the international community. "

Russia is interested in promoting diversification of supply in these areas and promoting the export of deep processing products.
He stressed that Russia was going to move its exporters to the global value added chain, one of which was China ' s development direction.
Manufacturers in the areas of Russian agriculture, coal, oil and coal are fully able to participate in this process.
At present, two countries need to continue to deepen their cooperation between enterprises, " establishing more inter-Russian co-financing enterprises and joint development of exports to third countries " .

The President of the demonstrations wanted to rain down on the Mount of Egypt. The authorities showed a strong pressure.
The topic labels and social media are strongly encouraging the people of Egypt to go on the streets today and in a peaceful manner to appeal to President Cessie's successor.
But the authorities have shown that they intend to use force pressure.
Since the launch of the military coup in 2013, Ceci, who has been the military leader of the army, has expressed his opposition to such a situation in Egypt almost defunct and any form of protest activities will be more likely to be put at greater risk.
The United Kingdom " Security News " reported that the non-governmental organization in Cairo, Egypt ' s Economic and Social Rights Centre, indicated that there had been more than 1900 arrests since last week ' s recent appearance of the petition for a petition to be filed.
Sésie and his family were in pursuit of a notoriously corrupt charge of corruption, leading thousands of people to march on the streets on 20 days.
The Egyptian Ministry of Internal Affairs has firmly stated that any attempt to break the stability of any State will be counterproductive and will be futile.
The city centre of Cairo had been severely guarded, and it was found on the streets around Tahrir Square in 2011 by the Egyptian Revolutionary Exploitation Station (Tahir Square).
The Half Island Television Institute reported that the security forces had detained many important students and social workers on 25 days, including Professor of Political Science of the University of Cairo, who was well-known writer Nafa.
He wrote on 24 days: " I have no doubt that continuing to let the ultimate rule of Cessie cause disaster. "
"He's right down there in line with the interests of Egypt."
Prior to Nafa's arrest, Hosni, who served as Egypt's former military officer, was arrested by Chief Anzo.
Anja was arrested last year after she was arrested by President Cessie.
The President of the Constitutional Party was also arrested.
Analysts and political figures believe that, at this time of increasing economic hardship for the poor and middle-income, the dissident practices reflect the instability and vulnerability of the Government.
The opposition leader Ayman Nour once quoted President Nour as saying: " The occupation of the people of the regime is evident to the people of Egypt, as well as how frightening it is. "
" Since the economy has been achieved by him, as well as by the general implementation of political pressure, Cessie has tried to convey clear messages of importance to the leaders and political people in its potential for recovery. "

"I've been working on two major high-pressure projects."
On 26 days, from the east to the south, ± 1100,000 high-performance electric power plants, the total of which is 1,000 per cent of GIL combined high-pressure power outputs.
Both of these projects, based on the high levels of existing global telecommunications technology in their respective fields, will greatly improve our energy efficiency after the explosion.
The Director-General of the National Energy Agency has wisely stated that the world's largest power source of electricity from the East to the South is the remotest power plant.
Its inputs are important for promoting the development of new energy bases and for ensuring electricity supply in the Wa East region.
GIL, that's a gas-depleting metal shut-down line.
The U.S. Commanding Engineering has created the highest global pressure level for GIL, the highest capacity record for transmission and the " exchange of bi-cycle networks" for the highest power level of the WWC network.
According to the National Electronics Company, the distance from the East to the South is 3324 km.
If conventional technologies were used, more than 15 per cent of electricity would be lost along the way, and the project had been developed through the attack and had significantly increased economic transport distance to over 3,000 km.
At 8: 20 a.m. on the east to the south of the project, it is possible to transport 100 million electricity per hour to help address the problem of the elimination of existing new energy.
In accordance with the estimates, electricity will be delivered per year on this line to 600 to 8500 billion dollars, and more than half of the year spent on the sea.
The Soviet GIL integrated circuit project is a special pressure exchange network with a long-term control project.
If regular airline crossings are used, it is necessary to build two large towers over 450 metres along the long slopes and to build a small, four-footed business island for each.
In this regard, the national telecommunications network has been highly innovative and has developed a high-pressure exchange of GIL electricity technologies through the waterways and has avoided the impact of gold shipping.
Two projects to promote the production of our electrical equipment have produced new flights.
At present, the national electronic network has been built as "10 to 11" high-pressure engineering and "4 to 3" in construction.
The Foreign Exchange Agency: our foreign debt structure continues to improve the stability of foreign debt.
" Overall, the structure of our foreign debt continues to improve and the stability of foreign debt increases. "
As a journalist of the National Foreign Exchange Authority, Governor-General of the Economics at the turn of the 27th century, he stated that my primary foreign debt indicators are generally subject to external debt risk control within the internationally recognized security line.
The Royal British was the day when the Foreign Exchange Board published its external debt data at the end of June 2019, which was made in response to the press ' s questions.
Data show that, as at the end of June 2019, our total external debt balance (including foreign currency) was $19.9 billion, which increased by $26.3 million at the end of March 2019 and increased by 1.3 per cent, mainly from debt securities.
In the second quarter of 2019, our total external debt increased by more than seven percent by the purchase of people's currency in the country of non-residents and mainly by long-term investors, such as central residents.
At the end of June 2019, the average long-term foreign debt was higher than three per cent at the end of March 2019 and the current foreign debt was higher than one per cent at the end of March 2019.
The United Kingdom indicated that as people's currency in our country was incorporated into the Global Global Index in Chibobakle in April 2019, international investors increased their credibility in China's debt markets and continued to promote people's currency in the country.
"My country's international payments are generally balanced and foreign debt risks are controlled. "
The 27 journalists learned from the Agricultural Sciences Institute in the province of Huangan that the night-time drought was under effective control and did not result in a major explosion and a phased result in the prevention of work.
This year, in January of this year, the city of Hunan-Mama was the first to discover the nightfall of logging that had emerged from the border, followed by the fact that there were 129 villages in the south, and the spread of logging in China was a direct threat to China ' s food production.
Forestry nightlife is an important food-emission-dating agricultural pest in the United States of America and the Arid region, characterized by "internationality, flightivity, violence and destruction" of the United Nations FAO global warning.
More than 80 crops, such as wheat, wheat, and wheat, can be consumed in large quantities, resulting in up to 70 per cent of production losses.
The difficulty in combating the disease is great, and the registration of non-predominant pesticides in China.
Since the night of the landing in the south of the forest, the Agricultural Sciences Institute has selected East Asian researchers to lead cross-border agricultural associations in the Agricultural Sciences Department of the Agricultural Sciences of the Agricultural Union, with a green protection team, one line, field surveys, sampling, and technical guidance and test models.
The Eesti Group has initially acquired the characteristics of a group of nightly bats, sky-dry resources, extraterrestrial characteristics, flight trails, drug-toxicity and inter-field control effects.
They actively carried out green control research and applications and implemented new green prevention technologies, such as pesticides, scientific drugs and agricultural measures through cluster monitoring, and achieved over 90 per cent of the impact of prevention in the model area, while reducing the use of chemical pesticides and protecting the environment of the heavens and the atmosphere, providing technical assurances for the development and sustainable management of forest fires.
At the present time, the night of the tsunami had been effectively controlled and had not led to a major wave of disasters, and the prevention work had been phased out.
The next step will focus on the introduction of a multi-flight ecological mechanism to disrupt the structure of a biological control and green protection technology system.
At the same time, active international cooperation has been promoted in order to develop joint focused laboratories and joint monitoring networks and model areas outside of the border in order to improve monitoring and early warning capacity for the whole night of the South-Westphalia.

The Beijing youth journalist was aware of how important it was to amend the "optimal document" published for the first time.
The revised " rural land contract law " has clarified the scope of land flow and has fulfilled the concept of " third-party distribution " , specialization of " land contract operating rights " and " land management rights " , clearly differentiated between the transfer of land contract operating rights, exchanges and the transfer of land management rights (retirement, transfer, unit or other ways).
In this "optimal document", for the purposes of pursuing the " triangular distribution of the concept of " effective response to " rural land contract law " , and taking into account the greater difference between the movement of land ownership and the transfer of land contract rights to parties, procedures and regulation etc., this revision has been defined for the transition of land ownership, including the transfer of land land rights, including rentals and units, as " rural land contract transfer management" as " rural land authority transfer management " .
The transfer of land contracts ' operating rights would replace other exit management methods.
The Commentary noted that in the context of "Third Deployment", the unit had only one fixed-term land operating right.
On the basis of the theory that even if there were insolvency settlement, farmers were at risk of a loss of a fixed-term operating right and therefore provided that the original contractors had not been required in court and that there was a conflict with "Insolvency Law".
A priority unit has emerged in practice for the prevention of the risk of loss of farmers, first renting units, and second-hand methods of repurchasing.
Taking into account the more mature theoretical examination of the priority unit in corporate law, it is recommended that it be promoted as a precautionary provision to prevent the risk of loss of the unit.
