What should they do, the ČSSD? The Czech Social Democrats in Prague do not know either the full location or the "Conductory".
In order to understand their former colleagues from the ODS in Prague Council and in the city's representation, the new Raspberryers of the capital from the ČSSD series must obviously overcome certain language barriers.
The newspaper Aktuálné.cz has been a little "decoupled" by members of the new council from the ČSSD once as they have ruled the notorious Slang that has invaded themselves in recent years, in which today's coalition partners were in Prague at Ruder.
The coded speech rate introduced by the Prague political elite is some of the most famous actors, situations and causes.
Surprisingly, the new lines in relation to these new concepts were lost in the dark.
At least they said it.
"Who's Voldemort?"
"No idea."
"I am rather a novelty in Prague politics," replied Lukaš Kucký, the new raptler for culture, on the "Paten Wartsche" test.
But also Rasher Karel Brézina - a political veteran - reacted in a similar way.
For example, on the term "Golfloch".
"That's the only expression of those you're presenting here to me that I'm going to use again."
" Otherwise, I don't care much about snakes."
From the speech chart published by the daily newspaper Aktualné.cz in June this year before the ODS election convention, the editor drew out six words, particularly those that are notorically connected with the Prague Magistrate.
The Social Democrats should define the terms "Voldemort", "largest Prague Golfloch", "Go to the Preventory", "Steernacks", "Chief of the capital" and "Remote".
Three Pragueers agreed to the test, the fourth - Antonín Weinert, the future head of Prague University - first discussed his participation in the conversation, but then did not stop the audience.
The fifth Ratcherr, Petr Dolínek, dropped the test from the front.
"I don't care about these things, and I don't judge how citizens' democracies treat each other."
"It is important for me how we understand ourselves in our programmes," he said.
As already stated, Lukáš Kaucký had apparently not realized in the above-mentioned cases that he was the talk by the influential entrepreneur and friend of the former Mayor Bém, Roman Janoushek.
The term "Voldemort" says nothing at all and the only thing he did in the test was "the largest Prague Golfloch".
"That's the Blanca tunnel," says Kaucký, adding to security: "But I know it better from the newspaper."
And she says, "I'll probably have to start a language course."
The "Golfloch" will then be identified not only by Matador Karel Brézina, but also by the Rotherrn for environmental questions Lukáš Plachý as the Blanca tunnel.
But both social Democrats also know who the term Voldemort is and Lukáš Plachý even knows where to find this figure and by what it means to "go to the Preventory".
"I think to go into some of Prague's gastronomy activities," Plachý is quite close to the solution of the race when it is known that it is about the seat of Janousheks companies.
In line with Brézina, however, he meant that these knowledge had been created earlier from the newspaper than he would have had this vocabulary.
In fact, under the social democracies, it does not seem to be a similar civilized snake to judge the test participants.
"I've asked my colleagues too, but obviously there's no such thing with us."
"We call on the name, back and again we also use short names or top names," says the president of Prague ČSSD Petr Hulínský - by his partner salopp "Hulda".
"In school I was called Bríza (Birke), but I don't know whether I am my colleagues," Karel Brézina told us his name.
The newspaper Deník Aktualně.cz has tested the names and see that - it works.
Rasherr Winert is a friend of the party members of the "Opa" or less friendly of the "Opa", the representative of Miroslav Poche, who paid attention to the elections by the party sponsoring, is called by some colleagues "Igráček" (known Czech Lego-Figur).
Spice names are the only one that allows social Democrats to use their own language.
Hulínský may not be known if he is called "Hulda", but Deník Aktuálné.cz registered another name of the president of Prague.
His tiptzname "Doctor of the Gumikinüpple-rights" claimed to have acquired his title Doctor juris at the Bratislav Police Academy.
The government wants to connect the folder of "Hexen" and issued a brochure
Women in Burkina Faso to Hexen usually show some common social characteristics.
They belong to the older generation, they don't find work - for example for health reasons, they're empty and they don't have children.
If one of these women goes to the hex, they are strictly isolated so that they cannot be threatened by the rest of the village.
"Men are very rarely affected by this shipment."
"Even young and healthy women are affected by this because they are involved in their work and have children," explains one Ordinance sister, who has been taken care of in the capital of the West African state Burkina Faso in a special home for over a hundred women who were expelled from their communities.
The local government has now decided to take action against this abnormal "social action".
And for this reason there was a brochure that should link the "Hexen persecution" to it.
But it's got a hack.
"More than 70 per cent of all adults in Burkina Faso can't read," said the newspaper "the standard" on the dilemma of the written statement.
However, in other African countries, hexerie is also involved.
In Ghana, the 27-year-old Ammy Hemmahová was tortured by three women and two men to death - they crossed them with Petroleum and simply sinned against them.
This event was also reported by the BBC server.
However, the aunts claimed that the matter would have been only a combination of unfortunate circumstances.
Your version follows oil leaking which will be used for ritual storage.
And although after the group tried "a bad spirit" out of the woman.
The isolation of "Hexen" supports people here without any background in their education.
"The Standard" quoted a 42-year-old entrepreneur from Burkina Faso: "Fressering human souls are as dangerous as today," he said.
While the government in Burkina Faso is at least trying to eliminate the hexenjagd, the Gambian President has been properly co-ordinated in the last year by the President himself.
"After the death of President Yahya Jammeh, a monster hexejagd found out that they were likely to have a share in their death and would now try to bring the president himself through black magic."
"To this end he called for the help of the nearby Guinean police, soldiers and the Leibgarde of the President, who carried out violence against women and men out of Gambian villages and brought them to the President's farm in Canalia," the Amnesty International noted in its report.
On the farm, people were forced to drink from plants with a hallucinogenic effect, but also caused sleep and kidney problems.
Two of the people arrested did not survive the stay on the farm.
As a result of international pressure, nearly a thousand prisoners were released again.
A renter from Babala: He is here in the evening - still paying higher rent
An older supportive man just leaves the client centre of the company RPG Byty of the "Colebaron" Zdeněk Bakala, the largest private owner of apartments in the Czech Republic.
Under the arm a map with three new leases to three apartments: for the own and for the apartments of his daughter and his son, who owns just a port penalty.
All three were raised in the framework of the so-called "deregulation" just above the rent.
Instead of 3500 kronen Monthly rentals, the son will be awarded a 2-room apartment with kitchen of the second category 4400 kroner in the next year.
"And there is no flowing hot water in the apartment and here you must be in a simple fridge," he writes with his finger on the son's new lease contract, to which he has full power.
"But what - signed me," he explained half-advised and resigned half.
BytyOKD.cz, which called the new rental conditions "inaccurate and immoral", is intended to not sign the new contracts and to wait until 7 December for them to publish advice on how to deal with such contracts.
But the man's just disappearing.
"One says this, the other says it," he makes a window face.
The Ostrava region will therefore be the major deregulatory laboratory.
After a new year, this deregulation is preceded by the majority of rental apartments in the Czech Republic, whose tenants have not yet paid a market-based rent.
Currently.cz decided to visit this "Labor" personally.
The RPG room in Havířov is one of four in the Ostrava region and is already nine o'clock in the morning on this Tuesday.
At the same time, the bodyguards of a security agency are standing next to the door.
"Mite 2011", so lights a special keyboard field on the touchscreen.
Briefly clicks and the device is already popping out a number line.
We have hardly identified the number "157" and have already touched them on the large display at the cover of the waiting room.
A half-second later you're on the line.
Some time later an older couple join the waiting room to ask for the rent, but the ansturm in the waiting room is obviously not even valid for the new rent.
Most people are here to solve the usual problems - repairs, insurance matters and similar.
From mid-November, in the Ostrava region, the Kuverts, with the new rental contracts, were the most tenants of the total 44,000 apartments of the RPG portfolio in the letter boxes.
The RPG Byty suggests in writing a rental increase of approximately 15 to 38 percent.
The special locker for the new rentals in the client centre has been opened since 18 November.
"The action is going something over a week, which means it's just the beginning," the ladies answered behind the locker after a moment when the "Client" emerged as a journalist.
The deregulation and balalas former mountain workers' apartments are a disturbing subject.
Prior to the election, the Vice-President of Parliament, Lubomír Zaorálek from the ČSSD, who was from Ostrava, had adopted this issue quite slowly, no wonder that today the newspapers are full of it.
"Twenty years I want a new floor from them."
"Not even well. WC-Brills could exchange them," says the man mentioned at the outset.
So far, the employees are expected, in particular, to stand at the stake to make sure that they are actually receiving the promised rental balance that the RPG promises to them when they sign the special offer at the right time.
For the benefit of a half-timed February army, the other tenants who sign the new rental contract by 15 December should also come to the benefit of the remaining tenants.
So far there is "deregulation switch" in Havířov, but everything else is beyond demand.
"From the recent 360 customers, only 40 to 50 of the rentals were due here in 2011,” estimates the Schaltermans.
RPG offers individual rental agreements on both their websites and wall tables where it appears necessary.
However, if the rental parties do not agree on the new rent, they shall be determined by an independent court.
"This is not supposed to be a drive, but it is like information on the only possible and completely legitimate legal means," RPG explains on its website.
"No one goes before the court," says one of the employees of RPG Byty and a man on the street before the client centre is at least partially right.
"I have 13,000 (Kronen) interest, of which I have 5,000 left for food, where I should take the money for a trial," he says.
Then the employees will be insecure.
"Don't see."
"Mr. Zaorálek tells them about the media that they should not sign and so wait for the people to leave," she says.
The regulated rent ends in most of the Czech Republic in New Year 2011 and RPG Byty follows the rent increase is an economic necessity.
"The existing height of the rents is not enough to maintain the housing fund," argues Pavel Klimès, director of the housing portfolio of the company RPG Byty and - just the cancellation of the housing fund criticised by the tenants is in the opinion of the owners of the main basis for the rent increase.
During the years 2005-2010 RPG was able to invest four billion in the apartments from the rentals it was expected to be 5.2 billion in the four years 2011 to 2014.
On the large-format LCD display at the deck against the polyester cells in Havířov's waiting room, a few more red light information is coming up.
"The rent increases in 2011 were 15% and less than 31200 apartments, which is more than 90% of RPG's apartments."
"Always means a maximum of 7.50 CZK per square metre and a month," is read on the LCD monitor.
Only with 400 apartments from the RPG portfolio will the rent increase by 38 percent.
"In these cases, it is about increasing extremely low rental prices of 19.66 CZK per square metre," argues RPG.
At 2600 apartments, the rent remains at the same level in the next year.
RPG Byty promises that the deregulation does not push the rent to the height, but gradually within four and eight years.
What is more - the company has another obligation: all revenue from the rent increase (see chart) wants to close the company back into the apartments, especially in heat savings - in new windows and in heating.
But - above all - these people should be welcomed who sign the agreements on the increase in rent.
The architects saw - the office also includes a children's garden
The office building Avriopoint in Brno is the new seat of Arch.Design.
But who would have waited here for a mini-kinders garden, with all that it includes: colorful walls, creative furniture, a lot of toys and even a mini-game on the outdoor terrace.
These children's gardens have been available to the staff of Arch.Design since last year.
The design and architecture office Arch.Design, from which its workshops are composed of a series of well-known brüner buildings, was calculated by the first designs for the new building Avriopoint with the rooms for its company miniininder gardens.
In a sense, because most of its 90 employees (in) are in the babyboom age and the company is responsible for returning project and architects to their workplace as soon as possible.
Together with the opportunity to work shorter, the children's garden is another bonus that the Arch.Design has to offer its employees in the concept of their social program.
The construction engineers and architects have so much easier to carry their demanding profession and childcare under a hat.
The Minikindergarten is an original idea of the staff (in) Arch.Design and with the support of the management, they were able to win the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social for their project.
The operational mini-kindergarten is funded by the operational programme of human resources and employment policy through the European Social Fund and the Czech Republic's state budget.
Thanks to this funding (CZK 2.8 million grants), the necessary facilities and equipment could be acquired and for the duration of 2 years it is provided for qualified staff and for the operation.
After the grant is granted (2 years), the company Arch.Design is obliged to continue operating the Minikindergarder garden for 3 more years at its own cost.
The preparation of this project took place for a whole year, where the company provided substantial assistance in the development of the application.
In order to care for children with fully qualified staff - a nurse and a childcare teacher, children’s gardens can visit without any restrictions, although most of them are over three years old.
And since it's about a mini-child garden, only 5 children can be present at the same time, but the day is changing over several children.
The child garden operation is flexiblely aligned with the needs of the parents, the children of all employees have the same rights in relation to the use of the child garden - without regard to the business hierarchy and their respective positions.
Although it is individual training and care, the content of the programme in the mini-children's garden is still comparable to the pre-training framework programme.
The children not only play here, especially when they are offered excellent education - from basic knowledge to pre-school education, they also learn English.
The classroom is equipped not only with toys and creative games but also with a computer that is available to the children.
What is more - the presence of small children in the company contributes to a friendly and positive company environment.
Parents can look at the children at any time and thus reduce the stress when the children are late for abortions from a far away garden.
Therefore, parents use their working time more productive.
No wonder there are natural and loyal employee relations here too.
Arch.Design was thus selected among the Czech companies that offer significant benefits in the application of new employees who are family-friendly and by such programs strengthen their personal marketing.
A bone house is also fascinated after 100 years. Look at the interiors of Gaudi
The roof has to be like the back of a prehistoric oak, the steps such as the spinal column of a dinosaur and the balconies are raised fish molluscs.
This is the Casa Batlló of the Catholic architect Antonio Gaudi in Barcelona.
The house with its organic shapes was named "Knochenhouse".
Organic shapes, wild colours, the unusual use of stone, stone fragments and mosaics, which remind us of ships and current soft lines, all of which are typical features of Antonio Gaudi's youth style.
The fascade of the house plays with dreamy lines, artificial colors and textures that remind nature and animals of nature.
First, it is noted that everything is controlled by geometry, rhythm and through thought.
In the night the whole fassade still works more plastic, dramatic and special lighting enhances the brightness of the colors.
The same swinging lines and cutting shapes also control the interior of the house.
Well-formed wood copies the window frames, lands, drawing elements of doors, even guckluchers and performances.
The house Batlló in the fourth Eixample at the live shopping street Passeig de Grácia Nr. 43 was built by the construction of a house from 1877, the architect Emilio Sala Cortese.
The reconstruction took two years and was completed in 1906.
The investor, the well-being industrialist Joseph Batlló, originally lived on the ruins of the old and the construction of a completely new building, but finally he agreed to the idea of Gaudís on an unusual and even cheaper reconstruction.
However, Antoni Gaudí did not design the House Batlló.
He worked with architect Joseph Maria Jujol.
The decorations for the representative residence of the real owner and also the use of Mosaics at the fascade were created on this board.
However, many other artists and artists also worked with the creation of the Fassade.
The joint work on design for the Casa Batlló was the beginning of fruitful cooperation between Jujola and Gaudí.
So Jujol also participated in the construction of Gaudís House Casa Milá in the park Güell, where there are other works of Antoni Gaudí.
Not long after his completion, the house was obtained by these residents of its organic forms because of the top name "Knochenhouse".
Others called it the special window opening mechanism because of the "coming house".
It is also said that all above the building was the sword of the Holy George, the patron of Catholics.
But other visual elements also symbolize hidden religious motives.
Gaudí designed for the house a unique central heating system for the time being with ventilation channels and typical stones.
It's kind of strange to see her 45-grade ignition.
Gaudí ignored all the construction regulations at the time, and did not allow any of them to stop.
Before the construction began, he held the relevant construction approval from the city, but the information he had made on the planned reconstruction was so clear that two years later the city fathers were so late in the completion of the result that they requested aid.
Among other things, the rafflese were that the building with its pillars even entered the public square.
However, there was no longer any change - only fifteen days after the city district's request was made - Joseph Batlló submitted an application to allow the rent of the two highest-ranking warehouses of the house - and it was immediately distributed to him.
The owner himself went into the lower floors.
In the gallery at the 2nd floor is a social salon, and in the third floor are the bedrooms and private rooms of the apartment.
The land was packed into a jewellery business.
The entire six-story building runs a step up to the roof terrace.
Through the basic elements of the building, all right angles and straight lines were removed and replaced by raised and pushed walls.
But Gaudí also worked with a modern concept of interconnecting rooms.
The social part can be fully connected through the opening of the halls, thus enabling a larger society to be able to sit quietly without having to rely on a certain intimacy when talking more confidentially.
In addition to a new façade, Gaudís built the house also received a very unusual roof and two other warehouses.
Gaudís is also impressive with the light as well as the blue and white glazed necklaces with which the inner courtyard is dressed and the lighthouses.
The game of these two colors gives all floors of the house a maximum amount of light.
In doing so, he failed to take advantage of the principle that white reflects light better than dark colors that absorb sunlight in contrast to it.
The Casa Batlló House, which was included in the 2005 World Heritage List of Unesco, can be visited by everyone today.
In the first floor, the most spacious and great apartment in the public is made available.
The owners of the house decided to take this step in the year and this on the basis of the 150th birthday of the famous Creator.
When it was established that this is a legitimately sensitive business, it was observed that visits were also extended to other joint and roof spaces, including the roof terrace.
However, the price to visit the building floor is not a piece of paper, which is 16,50 euros, students, renters, groups and owners of tourist attractions get 20% discount.
This amount exceeds the entry prices of other Gaudí buildings in the city.
Anyone who wants to know the real atmosphere of the house with his dragont darkness should try to close friendship with one of the residents and visit him at home.
The right matrices and the right bedrock? Women have other wishes than men
Not the best beds, but the quality of the bed area - so mattace and rose make the bed nice.
However, these must be achieved in a harmonious manner in order to meet the needs of the specific user.
Many things in the selection play a role - the weight, the size, the health status and not least the gender of the sleeper.
It is also important for the interior in which matrices and roses have been submerged.
A typical example?
In a weekly home where it is not regularly heated, latex matrates are not well suited because they need much longer to "heat".
In addition, they are much more difficult than normal polyurethane matrates.
And - they should be used regularly.
If they do not have enough dehydration channels in the core and are still on a fixed plate, moisture is attached: it is therefore not excluded that it is formed under its shape.
Of course, the choice also plays a role in what you are accustomed to.
Those who have been abroad for a long time, where very high matrices are common with wet weight, will be able to get used to a low matrice with hard surface.
"Although all Eishockey players who have returned from the NHL have complained to me that they can no longer sleep properly here."
"For their exhilarating shoulders, hair and hair they simply need a soft layer of visco foam."
"I recommend this, among other things, to diabetes patients who suffer from a breakdown of the nervous system so that they can receive the "information" from the joints and the skin badly," explains Sylva Hadamkýková, who specializes in plastic furniture.
That's why I've had a lot of iceckey players years ago, but other customers are worried about these matrates with Visco-schaum (Memory Foam).
"Today this is no longer a problem, as such matrates are offered by the manufacturer Tempor, the Italian company Magniflex or the Czech producer Tropico."
And you don't have to be a famous Eishockey player to appreciate the benefits of the Visco scheme.
This "Wunder" actually works very easily.
The sheep optimizes its strength and shape according to the absorbed heat, i.e., it smiles regularly at the warm body.
No matter where it comes from, at night you don't stand back like after a tough fight.
You just sleep a lot better.
In addition, the viscolastic layer offers protection against decubitus (Wundbrand).
At the choice of the matrix size, you should still calculate the length of the foothills to the size of the body, so about 21 to 34 cm.
Men and women who are 180 cm tall need a 210 to 220 cm long bed.
Each strand should be available at least 90 cm wide, so together 180 cm.
In single beds, for example in Singles, are 120 to 140 cm.
The comfort is half as well as for any visitors.
On the other hand, the following fashion rules apply to the ideal bed width: "If you are on the back, there should still be enough space for the easily rounded arms," says Ing. Helena Prokopová, the Deputy Secretary of the Pollsters and Space Station, who has been dedicated for years to the problem of healthy sleep and ergonomics of furniture and this subject is also presented to schools.
In a double bed, everyone needs his own rose and his own matrices, but be careful when shopping, so that the matrates are equally high.
Otherwise nothing else remains than to mount the rocks at different heights and this is no longer possible at all.
At least 14 cm high, matrates with federskelet 15 cm, of which at least three centimetres should fall on the shape sheet and the fine pollster.
"With your hand or in your hand you must not spy on the feds in any case," warns Helena Prokopová.
Each matrate makes a special strain type necessary.
All-polluted beds with matrices and floor coverings like built-in Siamwillings have nothing to look for in the bedroom.
These matrates are not allowed to lift and the relationship cannot be washed away what is already going on and given today.
And since you lose between 0.2 to 0.75 L of Switzerland in one single night, it is clear that the matrices will gradually become a huge (and hidden) seed after five to seven years.
This is also why experts make advertising decisions that promise a life expectancy of up to 25 years, even long life insurance.
It's all about you and Aber.
And that's why a practical advice from the dealers: When maturing 120 or 140 cm wide, you should not look at the hygiene of washable, attractive relationships, but it is recommended to use a matratzsoner, which you can easily remove and wash.
Even if it is usually made today with round-wheeled matrices so that you get two-halfs after opening (but important for washing and washing machine sizes!), manipulation with larger matrices, especially performed alone, often as the unequal struggle between David and Goliath.
Do they have a solid plate in their bed instead of a rose?
Oh, my God!
Or most for a bed for unloved guests and for a single night.
They should also provide the plates with air bubbles (if they are not yet in there) and matrates with federskelet and 15 cm minimum height with so on. Towels and fanpolsters should be used.
Polyurethane matrates are not included in such a description.
For non-committed latent strains of 14 to 18 federations (lamellas), latex or sandwich matrates (see also combinations of latex and coconuts) are always counted with a higher number of latent strains, i.e. 28 and more federations, with host support in the field of landfilling and the possibility of regulating latex.
There are no matrates with a fat skeletal as they do not respond to ergonomic exposure.
In addition to setting the flagship steps, special flexible shield modules are offered.
This involves a special confirmation of the federal duties which enables them to press the federal duties or even slow them down so as to allow them to cut the penalty on the debtor's shoulders.
Especially for men with broad shoulders an important thing.
There are even matriculation manufacturers who have started to use "master machining" wech areas for the shoulder area.
The ladies are also thought to - they are given these weach areas in the main area.
For the most demanding customers there are spotless flight feedback systems (lattoflex) or roses with pointless contact paths with so on. Multitoration federation.
The pressure is divided into several points, reducing tension.
But - if you use bad (for large and full) head pockets for the right matrice and the right rose, most benefits will go away again.
Here is also a rule of fashion: the head pocket should support the head, its top should reach the shoulder only so that the shoulder muscles can relax.
Ideal therefore appears a 50 x 60 cm large kitten, like for example the Scandinavian.
In the side position, the head box (with the shoulder load zone in the rose or the wech zone in the matrix) should be equal to the shoulder height.
Something has happened to our modern matratus with the only (filled with hay) strawberries.
Modern manufacturers use more and more natural materials or at least their fittings.
The new word "Bio" is also used for matrates.
Instead of fossil fuels, it is used to produce polyurethane foams more often natural oils - for example rice and soya oil.
Soja is probably used by all known manufacturers.
"Bio means that in matrates its core consists of material of pure natural origin," explains Petr Vasěček of Tropico Plus.
But natural substances are also used in the production of matrate relationships - one of the first was Aloe Vera.
However, you can also smell microscopic islands that spread fresh forest or lavender duft while sleeping.
There is also a difference between a man and a woman.
While men are used as a "cooling" plant extract from Birken leaves to absorb the heat and cool the body, women have "heating" effects.
Extracts from red paprikaschots smell the blood circulation, which makes the weaker sex cool during sleep.
And today's favorites?
Caltschaum matrates (he has larger pores with damaged cell structure and is therefore more active than commercial polyurethane and also much more flexible).
Through the combination of the various stages (hards) of colds and visco scars, multi-sonal matrates are created, which know exactly where head, hip and thighs are located.
For a high-quality matrice, however, you have to raise $7,000 and more.
However, health assessments are usually taxed with lower added value, since they are considered medical aids.
As the first Czech company, Gumotex was granted this advantage.
It's not that easy to save on the matrice and on the rose.
Here and again there are special offers from manufacturers and dealers who offer two matrices at a price.
This is how the brand Magniflex offers the matrices of Duofreeze with Visco-shaum memory for 11.990 CZK.
The second one gets free of it.
It was the material Tempur that led the era of viscolastic foams with open cell structure and high density in almost cosmic time.
No wonder they were developed for NASA because the astronauts are exposed to huge overloads at the start.
Temporarily it will cool when it's warm, in cool Millieu it's going back.
So it suits the human body perfectly and optimally distributes the body pressure.
It is therefore not only ideal to prevent pressure fire, but it generally increases sleep comfort.
Viscolastic foams are used not only in matrates, but also in other health products, such as in special toes, which are intended to relieve the legs and fats.
For example, domestic manufacturers use Eucatherm C, Twinsaver or similar products.
More and more parents want human surveillance devices to have the kids under control
The fear of growing up on their own children, and so on, more and more parents are considering monitoring them through GPS.
The system that was originally found for driving can be as good as good people can, even in such cases, help as soon as possible when the nine-year-old Anička Janatková disappeared.
The device is now about as large as a cigarette shop, but it must not be bigger than an armchair.
Many people have replaced the case of the missing Anička with fear and fear and thus keep them looking for means and ways to protect their children better.
Also for the price of an influence on their private sphere.
"We are trying to tell everyone that this is not about spying on space, but about an effective means of reducing the likelihood of tragedy," says Petr Pilin of the company Macro Weil, one of the suppliers of GPS location devices on the Czech market.
"I would suggest that in one case such devices could come into use, for example if they were to put someone in the bag without knowing it, but we had never recorded such a case before."
"Most customers really buy it for security reasons," Pilin adds.
But his opinion is that the child should always know what purpose the "chatel" serves and how to use it when necessary.
However, Child Psychologist Dana Bočková points out that if a child does not like such a thing, it simply turns out to be his.
"Even very young children show great creativity when it comes to losing certain things intentionally if they don't want to be controlled."
"The phones should start up with the parents, but they can easily turn off like these new surveillance devices," says Mrs. Bočková.
Your opinion is also challenged whether such an institution actually helps in the event of an attack.
"For planned discharges, the kidnapper will practically always check whether the child has any electronics with which it could be arranged."
"Today it's the phone."
"If such surveillance devices were to be used more widely, they would also be looking for them as they would surely be accompanied by massive advertising."
"In these cases, the police criminals are always a step forward," the psychologists say.
However, it suggests that similar devices can be very helpful in an emergency attack by a pedophile.
Roberta Čech from the company RC Monitoring, where local services are available for both cars and persons, the existence of such a device can also help if it is destroyed immediately after the attack.
"The device can be set up in such a way as to indicate the exact position in certain intervals."
"Even if it is destroyed immediately, at least the last position of the person concerned is available."
"In the case of expensive devices, even a measuring instrument is integrated, i.e. if you fall and remain in motion, the device will immediately send a warning under the terms of the position," says Mr. Chech.
In his view, similar services may also carry out intelligent mobile phones with navigation, but only one special software needs to be played.
The problem of the current location devices is that it is either of devices in the size of a strip of wood, similar to the trailers or of smaller phones.
There's always the danger of losing it.
Mr. Pilin from the Macro Weil is therefore testing devices that look like normal digital watches.
"This has the advantage that any attacker must not at all recognize that it is a monitoring or location device.
"Or he notes it only after a certain time which the police have a time-limit," he adds.
Regardless of the direction in which the development is going - towards amendments or additions, the same technology is always used, as in vehicle orientation.
So about the combination of location function using the GPS system (as well as the navi in the car) and the function of a mobile phone that reports the current position.
The army has so many children that you can turn all over the Czech Republic but you can only hold two years.
The Czech army has bought 445 kilometres of snowflakes to be cured with spray bags.
In the previous year, the Ministry of Defence had already delivered 224 kilometres of snow to the Armeelager.
It is comforting to know that the fighting forces have been out of control for 225 years.
The problem is only the sustainability of infants - two but not more than four years old.
The army bought the STV Group's shareholdings for some 40 million dollars.
In his reasoning for the purchase of this huge number of children, the General Staff MF DNES replied that the soldiers would consume the 60 kilometers of children each year.
The research of Army pyrotechnics, which MF DNES is responsible for, is based on this statement that every year the entire army must complete an extremely intensive pyrotechnic training - from all generals and officers of the Army Command, to the secretaries and women.
Minister of Defence Alexandr Vondra and General Vlastimil Picek are not excluded.
Only this is how the significant annual consumption of 60 kilometres of snowflakes was justified.
This length corresponds to the other 25,000 detonations.
But this would also be enough for more than ten years.
However, if the old rule of experts still applies that every new professional soldier has a total of two meters of child training, the army has created itself through these new purchases - even in view of the growing need for pioneer and special units - a refreshing advantage for the 225 years already mentioned.
In doing so, soldiers of the fast-impact brigade recently complained to Minister of Defence Vondra that they had almost no patrols for weapons, so that the lack of funds had been severely restricted.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
"I don't even know why they buy so many babies from us."
But this is their final decision, they will know what they need."
"For us, the army is a good customer that we as dealers want to stand out," says the sales manager of the STV Group Jan Däcký.
Jan Pejšek, the speaker of the Ministry of Defence, is responsible for the purchase of hundreds of kilometers of children, so that the army had covered itself for at least ten years with this "munition".
However, Jan Děcký of the STV Group speaks only of a four-year period of use of the child and police and army- and-armee-pyrotechnicians only for two years.
"The four years mentioned may also be possible in perfect storage," says one of them, who wants to remain anonymous so as not to be treated as a soldier as a critic of the army.
After the end of the period of use, each ammunition must be thoroughly tested whether it is still reliable and does not endanger the lives of the soldiers.
However, these tests are not external, but costs more money.
Another argument of the Ministry of Defence is the quantity discount for the 445 kilometers.
"They cost us six percent less than the last year's delivery of 244 kilometres," the speaker Pejšek shares the position of the purchasers of the Ministry of Defence.
Only to compare: The annual consumption of pyrotechnics of police officers, the munitions of the Second World War or the Soviet Brothers' Army, has been more than 1,500 metres for some years.
And the police are still ordering only such amounts of this ammunition that they can still consume before the end of the period of use.
Since the safety of the pyrotechnics has already been ensured, the possibility of flexible purchases of more modern and therefore more reliable children's shoes is thus open.
The Ministry of Defence has faced huge problems with the liquidation of tens of thousands of tons of ammunition from the time of the Warsau Treaty, when the two hundred thousand-headed Czech-Low People's Army was preparing for the mine.
According to the Pyrotechnics, the MF DNES responds, the Czech fighting forces in a few years expect the same problem in the liquidation of hundreds of miles of old swine fever that they have bought today so "beneficial".
To this day I have the contacts I have won thanks to the competition
The victory location in the competition "The Small Entrepreneurs of the Year" has helped Lukáš Pytluun sell his hotel in Franchise.
Lukáš Pytluun from Liberec was the winner of the last year's competition "Little Entrepreneur of the Year".
The story of his success needs to be like a movie scenario.
Lukash Pytloun wants to travel.
Only in the country was he aware that there was a lack of reasonable prices for good nighttime options in Liberec.
From the savings of his vacation work abroad and with the help of a bank credit, he built a house with five apartments.
If you think he was a high school student at the sixth semester, this must have been a courageous reception.
"The immediate price-quality ratio made me proud and so I tried to do something against it," says Lukaš Pytloun.
He rented the first renovated apartment to foreign workers.
He immediately reinvested the entire gain into the house, which he then built for a step towards retirement with 54 beds.
Since then, in just seven years of business activity in Liberec, he has had four pensions, two restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of over 300 beds of all accommodation categories.
The most comfortable of these were the fourth hotel "Pytloun Design Hotel".
In this year another first-class hotel was added.
"We have signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrov u Tisé, which we have sold our French concept and other stakeholders have already reported on the Franchise of the Pytloun hotels," says the entrepreneur Number One of the last year.
"A large share of this licence sale for the operation of hotels had just been the victory in the "Agreement of the Year" competition, Mr. Pytlour added with recognition.
The victory has brought him greater popularity, yes popularity in Liberec and the environment.
"People recognized me on the street, often congratulated me even at night and I have to say that it was really good," he recalls.
I really recommend that all who want to create something participate in this competition.
You don't need to win the same thing. Any visualization is good.
He says that he has so far benefited from contacts and knowledge that it would not have come to him otherwise.
"With some people I've been through competition, I've kept regular business relations to this day."
The successful peace of mind still falls a little down on every one of its employees.
And then he's got seven.
"I note with them greater loyalty and pride that they are part of something that will be given general recognition."
I also see this not only as personal success, no, it is the result of the good work of all of us."
"My name is just something back in the background," said Lukaš Pytluun.
My followers wanted a quieter year when we had it on farm
The victory victory was quickly resolved by the consequences of the crisis.
Thanks to its target effort, Farmet has the worst backbone.
In the past year, Karel Ždárský, the owner of Farmet, rejected the price for the first stage of Vodafone’s competition.
The jury would then appreciate the efforts he had made from the small tool building in Česká Skalice to start a company from the ground, making hundreds of millions of operations.
"I can say that this award not only encourages me but also all my employees and has strengthened our self-consciousness in the fight against competition," says the winner of the previous year.
At the beginning of Farmet's business history, the effort was made to do something useful.
And when the state offered his father Karel Ždárský as a compensation for the property acquired by the Communists to the pact, he soon left his career in the company where he had been employed, and founded his father's own company with a few cameras.
A short time later they started focusing on plant oil pressure.
Within 18 years they have grown to the largest producer of automatic press in Central Europe.
But only through the success of the mentioned competition and its mediaization, it has also become aware of the non-publicity.
"Not only that our customers are making the brand Farmet more intense now, but also our foreign partners have begun to work together with a company that has achieved the greatest possible success in their country," says Karel Žărárský.
The last year, however, was not only in the sign of victory.
The assessment was based on the economic results of the company in 2008 and part of 2009.
And just 2009 was the most difficult year for the sale of tools.
The crisis, which was still less protected by the citizens, but above all by companies, reached its highest point - many companies were forced to implement their investment projects and to restrict the purchase of new facilities and technologies.
"Of course we couldn't get out of this situation."
"The sales went back by 40 percent, we had to limit production and even take off," Karel Ždáarský explains
A viable company must, however, take such unpopulated measures.
However, it was possible to get the situation in the grip and keep the company in the black numbers, even if with less profits than before the crisis.
In one case, the company was not willing to make cuts - in the case of investment in research and development.
"From the board we build a research and training centre, we strengthened our presentation at international fairs and bought key prices at domestic exhibitions," says Ždáarský.
It's all evidence that we've overcome the crisis.
The number of new employees is growing again and with them.
"The new winner I would like to be very happy at victory - but in a quieter atmosphere," says Karel Ždáarský.
A question of opinion which is covered by non-existence rules
The question of opinion on the "absoluteness of the year" is for the fourth time part of the entrepreneurial competition.
Some unreasonable rules have already made it possible to get out of the world.
To the doubted winner of the next year's opinion on "Aberity of the Year" the obligation was to create documents on authorities who are available online.
More than one third of non-four thousand voting firms have so decided.
The Social Insurance Administration therefore requested a paper extract from the trade register, even if it could be accessed by the official by two mouse clicks.
This is now changing thanks to the issue of opinion.
"The Czech Social Insurance Administration will no longer require any withdrawals from the trade register in the future when checks of social insurance charges are carried out," the speaker from ČSSZ Jana Buranóová told ČSSZ.
The purpose and purpose of the opinion question "Absoluteness of the year" is to take all the rules and regulations under the ceiling to meet the entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic and to raise the shortcomings.
This year this is the fourth part of an entrepreneurial competition that is organised by the Economic Journal (HN) and enjoyed growing popularity in the public.
If the three thousand people participated in the vote last year, it was already four thousand in this year.
No wonder, because there are still a lot of legal obligations that are the only and only to prevent business.
"For example, as regards the number of income tax forms, we take a step forward in the world," notes Karel Havlíček from the association of small and medium-sized enterprises and business operators in the Czech Republic.
The simplification of entrepreneurship has been the stated goal of all governments in recent years.
However, compared to the world, the situation in Chechnya has hardly improved.
According to the World Bank, the Czech Republic is taking into account the business conditions of 74. As compared to the previous year, there are about eight places that are worse.
The competition of the year was first launched in the year and each year played after the same scenario.
From April until the end of the competition, each person can report administrative and bureaucratic reasons.
To register, the web address www.ffaroku.cz. Then the competition organizers will search for seven candidates for the "Antiprise" and allow the public to vote on the website www.ffararoku.cz/absurdita and www.ihned.cz.
It is the absurdity that most voices get.
For this year's opinion, more than a hundred, exactly 105 meaningless regulations and regulations have been notified.
The tips are not only from entrepreneurs but also from trade unions and journalists.
For example, among the so-called "finalists" of the competition, there are also provisions that maintenance vehicles should have to be paid for roads and fast roads or that businesses with twenty employees, two offices and two toilets should be prepared every two years.
The list of this year's "seven" is published on the pages of the competition.
The withdrawal of competition at the Prague Wenzelsplatz in early November is part of an event, which is also a regular part of the personality of political and public life.
In this year, for example, Eva Svobodová, the director of the association of small or medium-sized enterprises and operators of the Czech Republic, as well as Petr Kužel, the President of the Chamber of Commerce of the Czech Republic, were at the point of competition with the party.
"Where the State draws business links between the legs, there can be no real economic upturn, so it is my goal to raise at least thirty paragraphs every year, which still make business difficult today," said Martin Kocourek, Minister for Industry and Trade.
The efforts to create unintended order from the world show an effect.
In 2007, people broke down the obligation imposed by most entrepreneurs to inform the business officer at his permanent business place three days in advance of the intention to travel with an exhibition station or Kirmes.
This obligation was lifted by a novelty of competition law.
The obligation to receive the second largest number of votes in 2007 - the obligation to notify the work force of employees of up to 30 days - was also abolished by the law on them. "Green Card".
And all the good things are three:
For the absurdity of the year 2009, the Regulation was chosen, which imposed physiotherapists to have a mirror, a refrigerator and two passenger cars in the speech room.
This Regulation has been amended by the Ministry of Health this year to some extent - the cooling obligation has failed.
A new category deserves socially responsible companies
Assessment criteria are humanitarian, environmental, education or sport projects
A novelty in this year's five-year competition of the Economic Journal (HN) is the category "Responsible Company of 2010".
The main reason for this competition is to encourage smart and fair businesses.
"We want to support such companies which are aware of the consequences of your business activity on the environment and support socially responsible initiatives," says Patrick Bartholdy, the regional manager of the Vodafon mobile company, the applicant and the guarantor of this competition, as well as the "Rebell of the Year" competition.
This year's first year of this special sub-categories of the main competition Vodafon company of the year notified companies that success is not the only long-term goal.
The history of each of them is extremely inspiring and fine enough for a self-contained article.
Although they differ in the subject matter of their activities, their efforts have still had a common denominator - support and feedback.
Here, for example, it is about people with disabilities, as it is about personal problems or the health of their own employees.
Among the fourteen finalists from all over the Czech Republic, for example, the Prague software company Et Netera, which promotes the creation of non-formal sports teams among its employees, which then participate in numerous tournaments in various types of sports.
Another example of a responsible company from the Pardubice region is Isolit-Bravo, which has been the main sponsor of a Foundation for Disabled Children for 17 years.
A paper factory from Podébrady is also exemplary for its disabled workers who are 70 per cent of their population, for which it was awarded the title "Responsively Aware Company of the Region's Central Böhmen"; Vodafone Company of the year was the third rank in the competition.
In the Olomouc region, the bookkeeping company MiRyz Soft won, i.e. a floating and also an average of 35 hours per week reduced working time and this was without a relatively low wage.
The jury also respected the fact that the company was mainly purchased by Czech producers, supported citizens' initiatives in their environment and worked on environmentally friendly principles.
"We are trying to recover as much as possible to keep the consequences of our entrepreneurship and environmental management as possible," her business director Milushhe Ryzarová explains.
The responsible IT company Enlogit from the Ústí nad Labem region is again placed in the health of its employees and has therefore acquired them on all notes ergonomic sexes and keyboards, as well as encourages them to use Cartering services offered by a protected home.
"In addition, we support the Foundation "People in Not", which provides concrete assistance to this Roman community," says Andrzej Suchý, the company's representative.
The activity of the Cleaning Company "Praní a čištêní" from the Karlsbader region, which contributes to their interest insurance, is not yet mentioned.
"We provide our employees with contributions to supply, for the way they work, for the increase of their qualifications and for the holiday," says Josef Strapáč from the construction company Czasch from Bruntal, the winner in the Märish-Schlesch region.
To the category of company responsible for the year, all the regional finalists of the Vodafon competition notified the company of the year which answered the questions of the questionnaire attached to the notification and sent it to the organizer no later than 15 August.
False or incomplete answers in the questionnaires were excluded from the evaluation by the organizer.
"If the representatives of the law-enforcement firms failed to answer the questions, they were excluded from the competition "Responsible Company of the Year" and were therefore not disqualified in the main competition Vodafone Company of the year."
"A separate registration only for this competition is not possible, as it is only a sub-category of the main competition company of the year," says Karel Goldman from the agency Bison & Rose.
Pilsner Ground Fund - Police arrests at a public hearing
In the building of the Ground Fund in Pilsen, the anti-corruption police carried out arrests in the last few days.
This was done by this media entrepreneur and real estate dealer Luboš G. by the detectives in hand shells.
This claimed to have tried to manipulate a direct public competition for the recovery of claims in order to meet the principles offered in the competition with a particular interest.
This is supposed to have paid half a million Luboš G. for it.
"At this point, I can only confirm that the police are pursuing a person because of the delinquency of corrupt companies in a public competition," said Antonie Zelená, the chief of the Pilsner State Administration of the newspaper "Právo", could not provide further details in view of the ongoing investigations.
24 hours later the 46-year-old entrepreneur was released from the police again.
In what way could he manipulate public competition, it is only possible to speculate in the light of the official information contained in this report.
The talk of the Land Fund Lubomír Černá brought to the attention of Právo, which the police had taken in addition to the Land Fund's pillar, and this during a public competition.
"It's about a client and not about one of our employees," she concreteized.
According to the public competition, Ms Černá had the correct name "Requirement for the submission of requests for the transfer of land products under the Land Act" and would be in cases where several applicants expressed their interest in the proposed land.
"These persons provide a higher value in the form of a claim for their claims to be accompanied by the transfer than the declared basic value."
"In line with the proposed claims, the number of potential buyers will be determined, and the bottom fund will then transfer the basis to the person with the highest bid," explains the speaker of the Fund.
Luboš G. was apparently provided with information on who had submitted to the request and who himself was entitled, since he had bought a number of refund claims, he argued that he was of fundamental interest to withdraw from the competition.
Apparently against a fat recovery.
This would also be an adequate explanation for why he had such a large amount of money at his arrest.
Luboš G. had very good contacts with Pilsner Sodenfunds in the past.
He also played a role in the case of the former Chief of the Václav Sankota Foundation, who was prosecuted as a result of the release of basic articles in replacements which had already been subject to local decisions on construction projects.
At that time, Luboš G. acquired from the bottom fund, for example, basics that were intended to build public roads, said more precisely at the location where the construction of the road masterle was planned for the Borské area.
Later he exchanged this very cheaply with the Masterate against a house directly in the historic center of the city, which far exceeded the value of the basics.
At that time, the Council had to put a heavy heart in place in order not to threaten the construction project by blocking the basics.
The living costs of households increase by a few hundred a month
Houses must be calculated not only at higher costs for all energy types from January but also at higher water and water taxes and also at higher temperatures and in some places also increase the rents.
As of January, families will have to get hundreds more from the Portemonnai every month than ever.
Power will be up to 4.6 percent expensive, gas by 2 percent and more, in some cities, up to 10 more water supplies will be required and in some places the power supply will also be destroyed.
Only the electricity storage costs the housing costs a few hundred more each year.
The electricity prices were raised by all the main suppliers, so it is important to promote electricity production from renewable sources, particularly photovoltaic installations.
Gas will only become moderater, however, just when people have to heat most and have the highest consumption.
So here's also a few hundred more kroner per year.
While electricity and gas are becoming more expensive throughout the Czech Republic, the prices for heating from city to city are different.
In particular, larger locations plan price increases.
For example, households in Pardubice and Hradec Králové have to pay more than $1,000 per year to families in Liberec from January to January.
The inhabitants of Prague once again pay 9 percent higher water and water taxes, and this is because the city increases its infrastructure.
If the rent doesn't change, it's only 6.8%.
However, the price in Prague is still the lowest in comparison with the whole of the Czech Republic.
In the North Bay, where the prices are now at the highest, water and water taxes are expected to rise by 7.4 per cent.
For example, huge rental prices are expected in 1400,000 rental apartments, where the rental is also lost since January.
For example, the apartment company CPI Byty, which owns 2500 apartments in Ústí nad Labem, is planning to increase the rents by 100 percent from January.
Those who are not in agreement with this increase of rent want to be interested in the company's legal interest.
The regulated rentals, which are still paid in approximately 300,000 apartments today, should increase by more than 10 per cent next year.
Czech children drink with remotenet and Rum Beer is out - it just seems too slow
Farnet, Rum and Woodka, except for a good whisky that stole the father from the house bar.
These are the drinks which are to be treated at least 15 of the most frequently consumed by Czech teenagers.
No exceptions are children who have to get their cat back into the hospital.
This is from the experience of doctors who are confronted with similar cases in the recording of paediatric patients.
"Bier or wine are completely out of fashion, because it's just too long before you drink."
"The current trend is clearly hotter alcohol," said Právo Luděk Pelikán, the head of the paediatric department in the central Bömische Clinic Horíovice.
"Whisky, if it is possible to use the father a bottle from the housebar, and if not, then at least remote or woodka.
"Wodka has the advantage that you can mix him with Juice, then he doesn't laugh so hard," explains the chief.
The talker at the faculty hospital Motol Eva Jurinová is right.
"Most often it's about remotenet or space."
"This is today's alcohol trend, in particular at primary schools."
"It was also about Slibowitz, who was taken from home," said Mrs. Jurinová.
Chefarzt Pelikán is therefore no longer an exception for 30- or fourteen-year-old alcoholics in the hospital.
Before the clinic in Horíovice, where he has worked since this year, he has worked for ten years in the Paediatric Division of the Hospital Motol, where rescue vehicles delivered to disabled students from near and far.
"A girl had to be hospitalized for four times."
"They started their career with 12 years when they were first given with 3.5 Promil alcohol in the blood and still in combination with "extase", the doctor described a particularly serious case.
"She was in the exhibition area in Holešovice at some dance party."
"The interesting thing was that it wasn't very rare for her mother that her daughter didn't come home for 48 hours," wondered the chief.
Just the lack of interest of parents or their incredible tolerance when dealing with their own children is considered one of the main causes for the growing alcoholicism of children.
For a true independence in the true sense of the word, experts do not follow in children.
"Alcoholism is a long-term chronic dependence on alcohol and all related phenomena, and this is not the case with these children."
In those who have repeatedly enjoyed alcohol, it is usually a negative family-social background characteristic," Chefarzt Pelikán explains.
The speaker of the hospital Motol, Ms. Jurinová, was placed in the present department for paediatric and adolescent medicine by mid November.
However, only cases of severe alcohol consumption that require hospital maintenance are included in statistics.
Injured children who are brought to home by the parents or, where appropriate, by the police are not registered after ambulance treatment.
In addition to the cases in which children have only one bottle of shoes in the school bank, there are three annual amplitudes of Mr. Pelikán, which is the percentage of leave: Walpurgis night, Silvester and the end of the school year.
"The last one for two reasons - either because of the bad witness or because of joy at the holidays."
"In the Walpurgis night I've also experienced seven drunk children at once," says Dr. Pelikán.
A drunk child who spends the night under medical supervision is paradoxicly better drag than a child who has to fight only with an uncomfortable cat the next day.
The headaches of the morning, which are caused by dehydration and glucose deficiency, can be eliminated in the hospital, i.e. by a fluid infusion with glucose and nutrients that lack the organ.
"They're clearly better dragons, because after the "lord" experience at night, they wake up with good wages without doing anything wet."
"They're just a bit confused about where they are," says Dr. Pelikán, who is working with patients at least by telling them the costs they will be able to pay for treatment.
Because transport with the rescue car and the night comes in an aquat bed and enjoys a few thousand kronen zig.
"He and again I have used it as an educational tool when I have directly told the children what their drinking has cost and that it can happen through all the holidays that they have to work on to earn money for such a single fat," added Dr. Pelikán.
However, according to his opinion, the hospital cases did not follow a regression procedure in order to require the costs necessary for the care of pregnant children by the parents.
Two training aircraft L-159 for the first time in foreign hands - in Spain
Two light combat vehicles L-159 of all five that have been exchanged by the Czech Ministry of Defence against Casa C-295M transport aircraft have been flew into the Spanish city of Sevilla on Tuesday, where the Spanish air carrier Casa - EADS is staying.
It is the first time that machines of this type are owned by a foreign army.
To date, they were only seen in Mannovarn or Flight Shows abroad.
This is about the flightable dual-service version L-159T1, which was operated by the Czech army.
The other three aircraft are L-159.
These are still preserved in Aero Vodochody, the operator of this business - Omnipol company - has taken over last week.
When it sends the aircraft physically from Vodochody, Jan Pejšek, the speaker of the Ministry of Defence is not yet known.
On the other hand, the L-159 single combat aircraft were excluded from long-term entrants aircraft, without further investments and investments from the Ministry's resort.
"The double-sided L-159T1 has been replaced in the current state and appearance," said Pejšek of the newspaper Právo.
He added that the army would not have to come out without twelve combat aircraft, since the Ministry of Defence signed a 200 million contract with Aero Vodochody in May 2009 on the reconstruction of four over-flight L-159 to the second version.
A new aircraft has taken over the army in July, and the second will take it by the end of this year.
Pejšek has subsequently undertaken EADS to implement the combat aircraft into the equipment of one of the NATO countries.
"The contract is clear and clear that EADS is the carrier of aircraft L-159 and that it should serve as pilots of NATO countries.
"It is therefore the matter of the recipient, how he realized the matter," Pejšek pointed out.
The Economic Journal (HN) has also reported that the Spanish Government has no interest in L-159.
The exchange of five L-159 against a Casa transport aircraft and the purchase of other aircraft for $3.5 billion was still approved by the Government of Mirek Topolánek last year.
At the time, the Ministry of Defence had not issued an invitation to tender, but EADS spoke directly.
The total defence argument was that this exchange will support the future exports of L-159 into foreign.
The Czech army bought Aero 72 machines, of which only 24 were used, and wanted to sell the rest.
The purchase of the Casa aircraft should also have a court case.
The European Commission accused the Czech Ministry of Defence of the European Court of Justice.
The army has already taken three Casa planes, which will be landing within fourteen days at Kbely Airport.
A longer finger than a ring finger means a lower risk of cancer
Men whose fingers are longer than the ring finger are obviously at a lower risk of developing prostate cancer.
This is the surprising result of a study published on Wednesday by the British Journal of Cancer.
This is to relate to the mirror of male hormone testosterone.
"Our results show that the relative length of fingers can serve as a simple test for the risk of prostate cancer, and this is especially true in men up to sixty," said the midaturator of the study, Ross Eeles, professor of cancer research at the University of Warwick.
The finger could help determine which men should undergo without conditions a prostatic cancer test, especially if there are genetic risks or other risk factors, such as family health problems, Mrs Eeles added.
During the period 1994-2009, she followed her colleagues in Britain with more than 1500 patients with prostate cancer, while also 3,000 healthy men.
In more than half of the participants in the study, the right hand finger was shorter than the ring finger.
For these men the same probability of prostate cancer, as for 19 percent of those men whose ring and finger teeth were the same length.
In men whose fingers were longer than the ring finger, however, this risk reduced by 33 per cent, in men up to sixty-eight per cent.
The ratio of the length of the two fingers mentioned, which are already in the prenatal age, clearly reflects the different mirrors of sex hormones that the child was exposed to in the womb.
Less testosterone corresponds to a longer finger.
Previous studies have found that just testosterone speeds up the growth of prostate cancer.
Václav Páčes, head of the Czech geneticists and former president of the Academy of Sciences, said ČTK, he was well-known in this study, but he did not consider the relationship between the finger length and the cancer risk to be "completely demonstrated".
Czechia in snow - D1 and D5 are closed
Just as most of Europe is also in the Czech Republic on Thursday morning under a snowcock.
On the streets and slopes are usually fixed snow, the winter servants were mostly all night on the axle.
The road D5 between 90 and 90 kilometers in the direction of Rozvadov is blocked by some accidents of Lkws and Pkws and also the D1 at Brno in the direction of Prague.
This was said by Novinky.CZ of the Central Automoto Club (UAMK).
At 91 km a LKW failed, at 93 km two LKWs fell together, when there were injuries.
A few pkws are also in the street graves.
There are also problems at km 185 of the road D1 in the direction of Prague.
There are also two lkws together.
The drivers should either drive behind Brno at 190 km or over Brno and drive at 182 km at Kývalka.
This is where they form a kilometre-long stop.
Also on the D11, an accident occurred and the same thing happened on the trip to Prague.
In Prague there are several centimetres thick snowy peaks and the thermometer shows less than seven degrees Celsius.
Autocolons are, for example, in the city of Prosek, also the street Štěrboholská is completely hidden.
The safest means of transport is in any case the Metro.
The roads run late, for example on the line between Karlsplatz and Peaceplace.
At eight o'clock in the morning, the Prague Christmas Eve will meet together.
There are also problems on the railway and on the airport.
The Czech State Railway had to cancel seven fast connections due to snow movements.
There are problems, for example, on the Prague - Kralupy line or even Prague - Beroun.
Travelers should inform themselves about the current situation.
The Ruzyné Airport is closed from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. in the morning.
Most streets in South America are only accessible with increased caution.
With Vyškov, three additional roads are completely unfavourable, the surroundings of Brno form rather snowy movements and the surroundings of Blansko are forced to use snowflakes on some of the higher roads.
One of the most affected areas is Výškov.
There are still three streets completely closed: Rousinov - Slavkov, Bohdalice - Kucherov and also Šaratice - Milešovice.
There is also a need to use snowflakes for snowing.
Once they are re-transmitted, they can't be estimated until now.
In the Hodonín region, care is taken in the area of the White Carpathies.
On the streets that can only be lined up with inert means of protection, there is up to five centimetre thick snowflake, led by ČTK.
In Czechia it falls from two to ten centimetres of Neuschnee, most of which fall in North Böhmen - set by up to 18 centimetres.
In the Märish-Schlesch region, up to 15 centimetres of Neuschnee fall.
In Czechia, however, it is slow to cut.
American soldiers have a new "intelligent weapon".
The US troops have used a new "intelligent" weapon in Afghanistan for the first time, known only under its code name XM-25.
The generals hope that these new automatic weapons will influence the existing conflict with the Taliban and move the relationship of force to their own interests.
The new weapon is something like a superheated cannon.
Your projectiles are achieved by laser with a few meters of contact safety.
The special shells of caliber 25 mm, which were developed for this threat and contain high-explosive explosives, work practically like small grenades.
The geschos can be programmed so that they can not only explode at the top of the target but at any point of their ballistic flight.
That is, you can use it against an enemy that hides behind an obstacle - a wall or in the graveyard.
From above, he is usually not protected, so the killer steel breaker line from above can easily put him out of the burden.
Richard Audett, who participated in the development of the XM-25, is the first childhood weapon to use "intelligent" technologies.
"The soldier goes on to take this step as follows: he sees the target and sends out a laser beam that determines the distance, then he gets a specific point of view after which he corrects the increase angle, then he just needs to press it.
"Let's say, you measured 543 meters."
"When you press down, the gun lifts up and shoots the shot at the distance 543 meters plus less than one, two or three meters away.
400 jobs are being reduced
The Fujitsu Group lowers its discount in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
In July the next year 400 employees will be placed at their place of work from the former office building at the Marienbader Place in Bad Homburg in Astro Park.
The Japanese Group Fujitsu lowers its discount in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
As reported on computer and their maintenance on Wednesday, 400 women and men will be placed in the Astro Park, a large office complex on the Lyoner Street in the city of Niederrad, in the city of Frankfurt.
A speaker from Fujitsu explained that, on average, there should be 100 more jobs of the Group, which have been distributed to the region so far.
The rental offer was extremely attractive, and the large offices in the Astro Park were better opposed to the working methods of the employees.
Also in Bad Homburg, Fujitsu was only a tenant.
Mr. Bernd Wagner said, "We have found a central location with excellent infrastructure with Frankfurt-Niederrad".
The excellent connection to the airport was just of great importance for a global company like Fujitsu.
The new transformation of an important company within the region brought joy to the winners and disappointment in the losses.
Frankfurter Economic Designer Markus Frank (CDU) said that it was once again a "Global Player".
That's a "great local recognition".
Fujitsu passes to the city, the settlement is an important push for down-road.
The Bad Homburger Mayor Michael Korvisi (The Greens) regretted the decision of Fujitsu.
The city was first informed by the business management of the purpose.
"We have of course offered our help to the company," Korvisi said.
However, friendly contacts had nothing to do with the difficulties of the computer manufacturer with the owner of the real estate at the Marienbader place.
Finally, economic reasons had given rise.
Now it's going to prevent a long learning in such a prominent place.
"I hope the owner and tenant of the building is cooperative."
The house used by Fujitsu so far at the railway station and the nearby "Little Verticale" belonged to the other buildings at the Marine Bader Square ten years ago to the most controversial construction projects in the city.
As a joint project of the city and a private project developer, a new city tree was created between the railway station and Rathaus, which resulted in the massive construction of the areas used in part as parking space and the height of the buildings for critical purposes.
In 2001 the investment consulting and rating company Feri, the software manufacturer for travel systems, the start of Amadeus, and the computer manufacturer Fujitsu, who was still connected with Siemens.
The buildings used by Fujitsu were acquired in 2006 by the Frankfurt German Real Estate Group with the Morgan Stanley Real Estate Fund and sold to the Spanish Falcon Real Estate Investments SA in Madrid a year later.
The Fujitsu conservators in Tokyo are known as the world's third largest IT provider.
He provides companies such as computers and servers and also provides the necessary service.
The Netherlands in the Rhine-Main region is one of the largest in Germany, however, Fujitsu is a large number of employees in Munich.
From Bad Homburg, the subsidiary Fujitsu Technology Solutions in Frankfurt-Niederrad, which is to be part of Fujitsu Services and a company on behalf of TDS, is to be further subsidiary companies.
For this purpose, the Astro Park 7000 square meters were rented in the office building.
In the twenty-year-old complex - the name plays on its star-shaped basis - has its seat, among other things, the central binding of the electronics and electronics industry.
Amazon stop Server - Drunks against Assange
Wikileaks are becoming more and more stressed.
The Amazon Internet Service Provider has connected the enthusiast platform of its servers.
This political pressure may result from the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomats.
Wikileaks-founder Assange is said to be in England.
The Wikileaks enthusiast platform is increasingly underway in the United States.
Internet activists lose access to their former U.S. server and are now looking for an Internet site in Europe.
The famous American Senator Joe Lieberman called in other countries and companies to the Boycott of Wikileaks.
And Wikileaks-founder Julian Assange, who is on Interpol's prison list, is to be held in Britain after a newspaper report.
"Wickleaxed by Amazon Server."
"Free talk in the country of freedom," the Enthylungs activists shared with them via short news service Twitter on Wednesday.
Shortly before, the Amazon Internet company had linked Wikileaks documents to its servers.
Internet activists had come back to the Amazon Web Service (AWS) when the secret diplomatic digs were published in order to manage the high access rates on the documents.
Wikileaks, on Twitter, further stated: "Prima - our dollars are now being issued to employ people in Europe."
If Amazon has such a problem with freedom of speech, "they should stop selling books".
Amazon has stopped using his server by Wikileaks after a staff member of Senator Joe Lieberman's research, the CNN television transmitter reported on the Liebermans office.
The President of the Senate Committee for Home Affairs had threatened Amazon with a boycott, reported the British Guardian.
"I wish that Amazon had taken this measure earlier in view of previous publications classified by Wikileaks," said the senator.
Lieberman therefore called on the platform to deny the use of servers in other countries as well.
"Wikileaks' illegal, unpleasant and unregardless events put our national security at stake and threatened around the globe's life," said the semi-sound senator.
"No responsible company - whether American or foreign - should help Wikileaks in his efforts to distribute stolen material."
Wikileaks-founder Assange, who is sought by the authorities in Sweden for rape suspicion, is on Interpol's prison list.
According to a report by the London newspaper The Independent, the 39-year-old Australian in Britain, who is well known for Scotland Yard, is in the United Kingdom.
The Internet activist has always referred to the investigation in Sweden as an intruder of his opponent.
Wikileaks-Speaker Kristinn Hraffsson said in London that it gave drugs.
"It even called after the murder of Julian Assange."
That's why Assange was just afraid of his safety, said the Princeson.
The Wikileaks founder will therefore remain hidden.
Hryvnson obviously responded to statements from North America.
In America, the former Republican Governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, had demanded that Vicileak's funerals be accused and prosecuted.
In Canada an adviser to Governor Stephen Harper - apparently ironically - said on television that Assange should be "killed" and Obama could "use a drone".
The White House and Assange were therefore replaced by an exchange of swords.
The American President Barack Obama, Robert Gibbs, called it "slow and absurd", that Assange had requested the return of Foreign Minister Hillary Clinton if she was responsible for recent claims of spying on diplomats.
"I'm not quite sure why we care about the opinion of a type with a website," said Gibbs.
"Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are far more important than its website."
The U.S. government is now putting the protection of its databases to the test.
As a special agent, the Deputy Director of the Centre for Anti-Terror Measures, Russell Travers, was appointed, shared the White House with him.
Travers is responsible for developing "needed structural reforms" which were necessary after the release of the message reports by Wikileaks.
The White House also wants to examine how the whole government exchanges and protects information.
The US government also announced that they should be at risk by the Wikileaks publication for the safety of dissidents and activists.
"We've taken everything in hand to contact them," said foreign speaker Philip Crowley.
"We are ready to protect them if necessary."
The University of Ice
At the "Gelato University" in Bologna, ice caps are prepared for better seasons.
The three-day basic course for future gelatiers has the largest tour and visitors from all over the world.
Where's the whole ice coming from?
From the gelatium and the gelatium.
The gelatier, in German something old-fashioned by the ice cap, sets the cream according to all the rules of Italian ice-cream art.
The Gelataio takes the ice cream out of the refrigerator with a spaghetti, throws it into the waffle and then sells it.
To know this, you don't have to travel to Anzola del'Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But whoever wants to know more about Eis, who does not come to the "Gelato-University" of the Italian company Carpigiani.
The ice Universität has set up the manufacturer of ice skating machines in 2003 so that ice cream from his machines will be justified throughout the high Italian ideals.
The three-day basic course for future gelatiers has the largest tour and visitors from all over the world.
However, there are also multiple-day special courses about chocolate and practice in domestic ice cream.
Some dream of a new career in the midlife crisis, others simply ride on the smooth ice of their cattle.
This time there are 40 participants from 19 countries from all continents - from Brazil over Hungary to Saudi Arabia.
Jacky, an artist from California, loves the slow food movement and wants to offer a European quality product in the country of industrial ice cream in the future.
Anke from Berlin is a business consultant and wants to work for years in an exciting job.
Two young Egyptians dream of opening an ice section in Cairo.
A man from Malta and one from Brazil wants to improve the quality of ice cream in their bars - and Canadian housewife Julia comes because her children love Italian ice cream.
Maestro Gelatier Luciano Ferrari first explains to participants the ideal properties of the perfect ice cream.
It is crucial not only good taste but also good taste and consistency.
Luciano also misses the national and even southern overgrowth of sand in his education: "Italian Gelato is simply the best - and then there is still a lot of Romantics in it."
The first step towards production seems quite simple.
Luciano runs the basics of milk, sand, milk powder, sugar and stabilisers into a large mixer that achieves 85 degrees with an electronic program and then immediately cools up to four degrees.
Then he turns up on the machine a hahn, and out comes a pasteurized white base cream, base for all milk varieties.
The doctor is immediately confused with questions: Can ice cream be produced only with natural substances without a stabiliser?
How can you let your own experiment loss go free?
Luciano warns against letting himself be led by the spirit of time into the Irere.
Those who speak of ice cream "only from natural ingredients" have, however, used stabilisers - mostly a natural product, about guarkernmeal from the guarbohne.
Of course, you can also make ice without a stabiliser, only then you have to sell it within one day, otherwise it falls together, and the customer falls on low ice cubes.
Certain variations to the basic mass are allowed.
It'll be more exciting with the aromas.
For the taste in ice, Maestro Luciano distinguishes between the ingredients bought in the fruit department or in the sweetness of the supermarket.
There are also powder and pasten.
"The suppliers will all try to attract thousands of aromatized additions."
"But you should just experiment."
Both with fruit sorbets with sugar and fresh fruit.
Or even when ice cream comes from the white basis mass that becomes with ice cream and with cocoa powder based on all possible chocolate performances.
Now, the coaches can use the ironing machines.
Luciano is able to produce four different kinds of vanille, chocolate, mokka and haselnus ice - with or without eggs in the basic mass, with more or less vanillearam or other natural additives.
The same experiment will also be avoided by fruit varieties.
More flavourings, more fruit-pure - tasteful is not necessarily better.
Hazelnus ice does not taste much more accurate when it contains more hazelnuts.
The most popular kiwi ice is the working group that uses more fruit, less water and less stabiliser.
Only a balanced mixture has the taste of a gelato right above it, says Luciano.
Emission is a computer task: When Pfriesich-Purie is used with a lot of sugar, the sugar share in the basic recipe must be reduced.
For lemonesis an extraplicity sugar is necessary.
Luciano draws a device with which he determines the sugar content of the fruit varieties (winzer measures the oechsle in the grape must).
Fortunately, tables facilitate computers.
We no longer need to make as many physical uses as we used to.
Not only helps the device to automatically produce the base mass.
There is also a device in which the finished ice mixture is also cremated and cooled at minimum temperatures.
Not all automation, however, remains small pans.
The Brazilian Gustavo climbs up and his coursemates from above to below with fruit purée when he is equipped by the overdimensional steel mixers outside of control.
"In any course," says Maestro Luciano, "it's just a matter of time until something like this happens."
Check colour in the selection
The European Food Authority Efsa is subject to the industry experimenting with gene plants.
This project is now formulated by the Biotech Expert Group, which is understood as an independent institution for the impact assessment of biotechnology.
"It sounds like a conspiracy theory, but we've documented it well," said Test Biotech Chief Christoph Then on Wednesday in Munich.
The head of the Efsa expert group for genetically modified plants, Harry Kuiper, and another Efsa expert have been also under contract for years at the lobbyist association Ilsi.
He is paid by companies such as Monsanto, Nestle or Bayer.
Cooper has been working closely with the Efsa regulations for breeding plants and is therefore in a clear conflict of interest, then criticised.
The Efsa regulations are rather similar to Ilsi's position papers and thus give rise to the industry's signature, which is actually to be controlled by the Italian Parma authorities.
It's already the second time that test biotech has lost an interest college.
So be a high-ranking Efsa manager young without boarding or passing time to the Swiss agricultural group Syngenta - and have changed the pages.
The Central German Roundfunk (MDR) had also recently included personal relations between the EU’s control authority and industry, which has made the EU’s Environment Agency as well as the EU Parliamentary.
The Efsa cannot recognise any conflict of interest.
This is an opinion which is taken back to all serious data, even in such a industry, as long as they are of high quality.
Experts working for Efsa did not require that they have no contacts with industry.
But they had to reveal it.
Kuiper is involved in his work for the International Life Sciences Institute (Ilsi) in the United States.
This is itself a neutral forum for experts from science, industry and politics - including risk assessment for biotechnology without lobbying.
In the case, independent experts such as Then criticise that genetically modified plants are currently allowed without any animal feeding test and the response of genetic plants to environmental impacts will not be tested.
"We want to know what, for example, technically modified corn does on the acker," says then.
At present practice is simply isolated proteins, but not the whole gene plant, which does not produce reliable results.
"If you don't look for the risks, how are you supposed to find them?" then he complains.
That's how Angelika helpsbeck looks.
The scientist has been researching genetic engineering since 1994 and is currently active at the Technical University of Zurich.
As in the United States, industry is now increasingly trying to influence or discredit critical scientists in Europe.
That's why there's hardly any researchers who haven't been involved with groups.
For companies critical studies would not normally be published.
"The industry controls security research," says Hilbeck.
The traces of the rocks
Uli Gsell has also cared for anything, totaling about 400 kilos.
On Monday evening he was in the shape of the Stuttgarter Train Station, the Tuba on the back.
It was Demo.
It's broken.
The story is known: In September the bagger was back and had begun to break up a large piece of the north wing.
The Stuttgarter World was no longer the same: Zigt thousand demonstrated against S21, the billions of deep downs of the railway station.
When it arrived at the end of the building, a large part of the flight was in Trümmern.
Breaking into 6000, 7,000 pieces.
Crailsheimer Muschelkalk, a soft grave stone, built between 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is a painter in Eastfieldern, 43 years old.
He's got a couple of brakes.
"These stones are relics."
"They can't disappear."
He laments: "A light and poor stone, easy and strong."
When he woke up, he smoked for cigarettes.
What he's gonna do with the brakes, he doesn't know yet.
Stones have time.
Uli Gsell too.
The trail of the Stuttgarter Stone leads to a forest at Tübingen to a former munitions deposit of the French army, where Manuel Rungen has built his stone kingdom.
The 44-year-old is dealing with old stones.
He bought all those who were affected by the April in Stuttgart.
"It would be a shame if they were shot or disappeared in the warehouse," he says in his office, a wooden hut that was once a shelter.
Deprived and threatened him, he tells us, when in September he was in the newspapers that he bought the rest of the northern flight from the consignee.
But he's been talking to the S-21 genius for a while.
And he explained to them that he could not even break up.
And if it happened once now, then it would be the most sensible thing if the stones continued to use.
About 200 S-21 geneners took part in one of the 80 kilos of heavy squares with a unit price of 650 to 14 euros.
As a reminder, some, but also in the hope of returning it when it is rebuilt.
500 tonnes had bought rounds, 25 large Lkw loads.
About half still stored in the forest, the rest is sold for a long time.
Garden owners, farmers, households.
They came from everywhere and had gone away from what they could carry a safe room and trailers.
The Stuttgarter stones of the antose have long been transformed into "Mowerle" or within the limits of crucifixes.
"In fact, this stone is nothing special," says Rongen.
"Don't be the political component."
He climbs up into his country car, makes a tour through his 20 acres [20 ha] great kingdom.
Jura studied and resigned, later biology, then became interested in computers and eventually became a stone dealer.
And stone lovers.
40,000 tons of stone stored there.
From all over Germany he's drawing his treasures together.
He says he's the biggest old stone dealer in the Republic.
It's the brake.
In the snow are artificially decorated sandstones.
"They belonged once to Dresdner Marienbrücke," he says.
Elbsandstone, yellow, hot, it warms.
"My Loveling Stone."
It's going up the road through the forest.
It shows up on a hill: red sandstone, former part of Karlsruger Railway Station.
And then again.
"Dear Travertin."
At first, the squares belonged to the tribe of the Stuttgart Neckar Stadium.
Over the snowy stone and stories, Cannstatter Travertin from the Stuttgart Police Presidium, red granite from the Dom Sankt Blasien, Tuff from the Heilbronner Hospital.
What work? What kind of work? What kind of work? What kind of sweat?
If Rongen thinks about how the stones were held by hand earlier and were moved with simple bottles and glasses, he will be quite frightened.
"It would be a scandal if you were to make such a mess."
Rich didn't become, even stone.
But 14 people are employed by the stone dealer today, in addition to the forest stonemetz, a painting house, a smied, a glass-blazer and a garden builder.
"We work hard, but it's satisfying," says the residual.
Next time he'll have to go to Colon.
There are stones there too.
High-potential scores match
It's king Andrang on the buffet.
16 The students were forced to break down their latrines, tomato juices, and sweets.
The Technical University of Braunschweig and the Autobuilder of Volkswagen have invited machine-building and design students to a workshop.
In a kind of idea competition, they should work with VW developers about the car of the future - and in addition to folk cars.
In the fight against the worst heads, however, many companies go into the fight and put, like VW, on cooperation with universities.
Your mission: The most qualified graduates are to recruit in the hearing rooms as soon as possible before they enter the labour market and are acquired by others.
And since universities do not issue any presentations on the services of their students, they try to relax the exceptional metals in practice projects and join themselves.
On the second day of the workshop at the TU Braunschweig, the car companies are talking about the talent.
A young lady from the staff department distributes dog bookers, rubber bags and folders with VW logo.
She tells the hope-bound young people of practical programs and student jobs and shows them how in the groups.
Nico Selle from the TU Braunschweig manages the project with VW.
He sees the benefits for both sides: "The students are in contact with industry and collect experience."
"VW can get to know students at the same time, attract interesting candidates, and question who is involved as employees."
Such co-operations, such as cells, are not unusual.
It's new to be so offensive about the students.
"As soon as the focus was more focused on the professional project," says Selle.
The fight against the fresh graduates will probably become even harder.
In many sectors, companies can no longer select their employees from a large number of applicants.
However, they must pay their own prices, and in particular they must pay for high-qualified labour force.
In particular, graduates from engineering disciplines are in an excellent negotiating position.
According to the German Engineering Association VDI, more than 40,000 engineers remained unemployed in October.
And the so-called engineering success is becoming even larger according to VDI projections.
For the KPMG audit and consulting company, Roman Dykta goes to the talentjagd.
He organises exciting recruitment events such as the KPMG-Race, a kind of modern cut-off time, where participants need to find their way through GPS coordinates.
Eight promising students want to send the company to the United States in the next year.
In addition, participants can look at KPMG branches and learn about the company.
Whoever has to decide in two selections in the field.
Only the Creme de la Creme of many applicants fly into the United States.
The protection of the University's high potentials and walls is becoming ever larger according to Dykta.
"We want to get out of the mass with the race."
"Just a simple sailor was too small for us."
For talent dykta, the calculation seems to go up.
"We have so far had contact with all participants in a similar action in the last year."
"Some will be standing shortly before their conclusion and will soon appeal to us," he says.
In addition to the direct noise at the campus, small and medium-sized enterprises also go to the market in a very classic way.
"We're trying to reach graduates on trade measurements."
"About the intersular", reports Sitha Stübe, personal leader at the solar technology manufacturer Solarworld.
The Bonner company employs about 1500 employees in Germany.
We know about the growth problem.
Currently 35 posts are posted on the company website.
"It's just very hard to have vacation positions."
"It takes a lot of time and money," she says.
Another way is by contacting the Uni-Professors.
Solarworld co-operates with various universities, such as the University of Freiberg.
"The professors indicate that you can practice with us or write your diplomat work."
Your ads are not included in solar specialists.
To this end, the company tries to buy other products for itself: personal atmospheres, flat hierarchy and easy communication.
"This can't often offer a large group," says the staff leader.
Money plays no longer the main role in the job search.
Flexible working hours, child care or good opportunities for growth are other important factors.
Solarworld founded the 55th place among the 100 best workers in Germany in a study of the Great Place to Work Institute.
The Institute creates an annual best list of German employers.
It asks employees how they are satisfied with their work and their field of employment and takes into account the framework conditions for employees.
The staff leader's staff also expects additional points from the location of the job seeker.
"I think that applicants look especially at external evaluations of a potential employer," she says.
Wolf Reiner Warrior from the German Employee Branding Academy tells companies that want to build a good reputation as a employer with a long-term strategy.
He told his customers to be more authentic.
And that means, according to warmen, particularly internal measures.
"The best way to make yourself attractive as a worker is to guide your own employees," he says.
In the sectoral jargon, the internal employee branding is the labour market training within its own population.
"Happy employees are the best messengers."
If you treat your people well and they identify themselves with the company, they would only be hired by friends and acquaintances for their employers.
"It's like a band game," says the warrior.
Obama stops new oil spills
Before the coast of the state of Florida in the Gulf of Mexico, there will be no new oil spills in the coming years.
A relevant ban has been lifted by the government in Washington, D.C., and has finally rejected its previous plans.
Even before the Atlantic coast, new drills remain said first.
This was shared by Interior Minister Ken Salazar on Wednesday.
Exemptor for the strict ban, which is to be applied for at least five years, is the explosion of the "Deepwater Horizon" drill platform in April.
Before the accident, which cost 11 workers their lives and led to the biggest environmental disaster in the United States, President Barack Obama had signaled his readiness to release new drills in the eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico.
As a result, the sponsors want to reduce the dependence of U.S. oil transfers from abroad.
Whoever carries the responsibility for the honorable olive oil in the golf course has not been fully clarified until today.
In the centre of criticism is the British Energy Group BP, which is faced with billions of demands.
A Commission of Inquiry on the Obamas Order will present its results during December.
In October, Interior Minister Ken Salazar raised the drill stop after the explosion.
In addition, various oil companies had also submitted applications for new drill projects.
With strict controls and stricter security regulations, Obama and Salazar want to eliminate a new disaster.
At present, the competent control authority which has been sued by numerous corruption cases will be largely reformed.
In parallel, Obama has announced to close Lucarative tax reliefs for oil and gas companies.
The industry is now publicly warning that the amount of aid in the Gulf would be significantly lower by a stricter regulation than before.
"The government's plans are the biggest brakes for the growth of oil and gas industry," says the result of a current sector survey by BDO consultants - even before the ban on butter from Wednesday.
The American Energy Alliance also complains about insecurity in the industry: "No one knows exactly what will change with regulation."
Investments in new support projects would continue to be sold - allow for growth.
Ogoniland is burned
The water in the rivers is olive groves, it smells like at the tank station: billions of litres of crude oil have destroyed nature in Nigerian Ogoniland.
People live by tobacco, corruption, and illegal alcohol.
Celestine Akpobari thinks it's good.
"Don't worry about it," says the eco-activist to the journalists, "you'll still get enough olives in front of the lens."
The 37-year-old Nigerians have pursued the attempt to take a young man to the bridge in the water with his surrounding shelves: In the rain-coloured glass, the scene is almost beautiful.
It is not to be seen that moving brown strawberries under the surface.
Previously, she had gathered some jarnels here, told Esther Badom at the bottom of the Bodo Jetty River.
In the meantime, the flow of water would be complete.
Five years ago they grew up from a frozen root line in the vast wetlands.
Fishermen from the nearby town of Bodo now have to work six hours to get into fishy waters: The Ogoniland in the heart of the Niger is considered one of the worst devastated regions of the world.
On the road through the mangrove pumps drawn by the flowways, the whole extent of the glazing is immediately taken.
Instead of bright water, the motorboat wants brown brows on those who wash their hands into water, pulls out an oily finger.
The roots of the mangrove trees are like black lactose stems from the ground, leaving their beads bound with delicately suitable palms.
Bird warm, as they are otherwise common in wetlands, one seeks forgiveness: As soon as the outsideboard is weakened, it spreads out in the former paradises that thrive like a tankhouse.
"What's going on here is ecological war leadership," says Celestine Akpobari window: "We live in a constant danger to health."
The war comparison has been made.
The settlement area of Ogoni has been a battle field for over 60 years: here, the first explorers from Europe entered here more than 60 years ago, and in the 1980s, with the late writer Ken Saro-Wiwa of the first resistance, the shell group had to set its production here in 1993 as it was at risk for its oil workers.
Today, the company is still refusing to return to Ogoniland: While the entire Delta region is three times the size of Switzerland with more than 5000 drills and 7000 kilometers of pipes pumped daily over two million phases of the black gold, the oil fields in Ogoniland are too unstable for the group.
Every couple of hundred meters are drawn stealthals such as strange sculptures from the water: "Christybows" are called the heads of the bohrlochers too expensive.
They're up to 50 years old, most of them corroding up to the mark.
Again and again, such a head breaks apart, meaning Akpobari, then runs a constant stream of crude oil into the water.
More than two billion litres have been flown into the Delta ecosystem for 50 years by expert estimates: annually, the amount of oil as it was at the hawser of the Supertanker "Exxon Valdez" 21 years ago in the sea before Alaska is one of the greatest environmental disasters in human history.
Those who are responsible for the continuing eco-GAU will be challenged.
While the shell group Sabatage and the organised olive oil steel are responsible for more than 90 percent of pollution, environmental protection workers see grass heads and soft peppers as the main cause.
Shell placed significantly lower safety standards in Nigeria than elsewhere in the world, U.S. scientist Richard Steiner pointed out to the Group 2008 that only the rate of defects in the guidelines is "of a multiphase higher than otherwise".
In a place that looks like an abandoned, oiled workshop under a free sky, swims from the mangroves designed on: they are split into pieces and up to the neck.
Among one of the many trappers that are partly connected with pipes, partly deliberately spread out on the ground, there is a fire: an illegal small refinery.
In the fascist the crude oil will be heated over the fire for several hours, Michael, the head of the group.
First, Benzin pushes through the root into the beginning, then climbs up at the end of the direction of Kerosin and finally out of Diesel.
So Michael and four employees produce up to four pieces a day Diesel à 300 litres: "This brings us 34,000 Naira" - around 22 dollars.
The Delta residents use the chronic driving button in the largest oil state in Black Africa.
Nigeria has only one refinery.
The low retail price can still be offered by illegal cooks with almost 40 cents per litre: because their raw material is received elsewhere.
It comes from "bunkerren", which the Pipelinenettz has been captured by Ogoniland: In this way experts say the country will lose at least 16 million litres of crude oil per day throughout Niger.
However, only a small part of the provisionally interconnected raw material is illegally distributed: the lion share is filled with organised criminal networks, which should also be made up of politicians and high-level military personnel, in tank ships and throw it into the world market.
The debate, whether the environmental disaster is due more to the people's conversion or to the slow production method, holds the Akpobari activist as a purely academic.
"If the oil companies were not considered finalists and had not destroyed the livelihoods of the fishermen so thoroughly, there would be neither Sabatoge nor diet and illegal refineries."
Among other things, the relationship between Ogoni and Shell was destroyed, but it was to the extent that only one withdrawal of the group came up: "Maybe other nationalities like the Chinese are coming out better."
Michael's getting nervous.
"Most time you disappear," said the Musculoskeletal Olyman.
"Every minute the soldiers can come."
If the illegal gold miners are discovered by the special unit of the fighting forces, they are not held in custody, but perhaps a painful mourning money.
The soldiers coming from the north of the country - like all the Nigerians - also want to benefit from the raw material.
"This damn witness has brought our country to the dog in any way," says Akpobari.
Immediate detection of hazardous construction errors in A380 driving works
The A380 is obviously a major security problem.
In the investigation of a landlocked machine, investigators have discovered a possible construction failure that could lead to a "dangerous workout".
The Qantas flight now wants to apologize to the engine manufacturer.
The passengers of the country's kantas-airbus in the beginning of November were apparently much more lucky than ever: the Australian Air Safety Authority has identified a major safety problem in the operation of some A380 machines - and now warns of a possible construction failure.
The potential defect had serious consequences: in the event of an oil spill connection, he could have caused an incentive risk and lecks, an opinion of the ATSB authority published on this Thursday.
This could have led to "a catastrophic waste of labor".
In case of roll-Royce-made driving machines in 20 aircraft of the A380 series.
This includes the Qantas Airbus, which had to be landed in Singapore on 4 November.
The Australian airline has now taken legal steps against the British turbine manufacturer.
It provides a basis for a complaint at an Australian federal court in Sydney which allows him to take further legal measures against the company.
Kantas-Chief Alan Joyce said his flight company will demand damages for the crash in early November.
At the fire of the engine, parts had been dissolved and the cargo areas damaged.
Rolls-Royce made an oil fire as a cause for damage.
After the crash, up to 40 pilots are now needed worldwide.
The Australian investigators announced that further safety tests would be carried out on the superjumbos equipped with the related pilots.
The safety recommendation was the result of cooperation with Rolls-Royce, ATSB speaker Martin Dolan said.
The security problem has been considered sufficiently important to inform all concerned.
After the announcement of the kantas machine, the airline had kept its A380 fleet on the ground for weeks.
Singapore Airlines left about three of its 11th A380 on the ground.
The airthansa changed its work as an A380 precautionary measure.
The double-wing pilot is the world's largest passenger aircraft.
Landside snowfall solves traffic noise
Germany completely white: On the night, almost all the land of Snow fell.
On many streets Chaos, trains and flights fall out.
At least three people were killed in car accidents.
Winter freezes Germany: At summer temperatures, almost all the Republic is cut by night on Thursday - which leads to traffic chaos in many places.
In the north and east part are some 15 centimetres thick snow decks.
On several roads and many roads, traffic is severely restricted.
At the A7 at Flensburg, the winter service was on a continuous basis, but it was not finished with the constantly rising snow.
In addition, wet beads hung over the shores of the east coast.
The Federal Bureau for Maritime Navigation and Hydrography (BSH) is waiting at the coastal coast Schleswig-Holsteins from the morning on storm flows with water stops of 1.2 metres above normal.
In Saxons, snow movements on the roads and federal roads led to serious problems.
According to the U.S. Central Media, the highest level of alert was reported in Switzerland.
Partly there fell 30 centimetres of snow, fresh and strong winds provided for movements.
There are several trucks and cars stuck in the night.
Also in Saxony, police authorities reported major disturbances on the streets.
On the A2 snow and wind led to stocking transport and noise.
The A4 and A9 were affected by snowfalls in Thuringen.
According to Deutscher Bahn, there are major disturbances in Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Thuringen and Northern Bayerns.
Snow on the forests, surrounded trees on the ridges or broken surfaces and wetlands are the main problems.
In Saxony, the distance from Leipzig to Nuremberg had to be fixed.
In the Thuring Saal field, an ICE had to stop its journey to Munich.
The 165 passengers were provided with firemen and rescue personnel with wool blankets, food and drink in the train.
Snowflakes covered the streets.
On large German airports, snowflakes lead to numerous flights.
In Munich, according to a speaker of the Aircraft Centre, some cancellations have already been reported.
According to a Fraport speaker in Frankfurt in Main, 40 flights have already been hit.
The winter service is in place.
Although there are only a few stranded passengers at the airport, they are still ready for nearly 400 field beds.
On many streets it's already happened on Wednesday night.
At night a Lkw driver came to live on a train crossing in Ostholstein.
The lead was easily damaged.
In the vicinity of Nürnberg, there was a similar accident because of snow - covered roads: too, a truck was found on a road crossing because the vehicle remained closed.
The driver came back to life.
Four passengers were injured in the train - the route from Bayreuth to Nuremberg was therefore blocked until morning.
In addition, a 30-year-old woman died after she had hit her car at Ashaffenburg on a smooth road.
However, the meteorologists have a good news: although the snow will still be soft and dusty and therefore wet with light waves.
But the wind will disappear.
Only the Baltic Sea is sought from fast and steep winds.
However, it remains very cold - otherwise up to less than 15 degrees.
Deutsche Bank is looking for a buyer for its twinling towers
The German Bank wants to separate itself from its trademark: According to a newspaper report, the money house is looking for buyers for the two offices at its Frankfurt headquarters.
Up to 500 million euros could contribute to the real estate.
The German Bank has just made its concert: the Zwilling Towers in Frankfurt Banking Square have been modernized; in the meantime the banks were forced back to their old workplace.
But now the financial companies want to re-examine the cost of renovation - and look for a buyer for the two high school houses, as the "Financial Times Germany" writes to a speaker.
The speaker did not mention reasons for the planned sale.
"We always check whether it makes sense to own or sell real estate and then return," he said.
As a result, Germany’s largest credit institution is already running its firm after a short time.
By mid-2007 the Bank had taken over the double thresholds for EUR 272 million by the owners of a home fund and subsequently rescinded.
The energy reconnaissance dropped the data by around EUR 200 million.
A sale would probably bring a lot of money from the bank.
Sector experts estimate the value of the newspaper's towers in Green Towers by around EUR 500 million.
Whether the building is resold to a fund owned by the bank or to an independent investor, the speaker said.
Thousands Trapped a Whole Couple
More than 10,000 people in New Zealand have thought of the destroyed mountain ranges that were declared after several explosions in a mine for death.
The bodies were still unable to be protected because the safety shield in the accident is still on the alert.
Just two weeks ago it was in the Pike River Mine near the city of Greymouth to a severe explosion.
29 Mountain workers between 17 and 62 years of age were slaughtered under days.
A sin had been thrown into the disaster, but no trace of survivors had been found.
Due to the high concentration of toxic gases and subsequent explosions, no rescue forces were able to rise from safety reasons.
After the second heavy detonation, the authorities and experts concluded that there was no longer a chance of survival for the couple.
The bodies were not kept until then.
Now members and friends with a memorial celebration of the dead are remembered.
Hundreds of thousands of people had gathered on the New Zealand southern island at a spectacular sunset in Greymouth.
Two minutes they're moving.
In honor of the scattered mountain ranges, 29 tables were set on which helmets, lamps and the names of the team were to be seen.
Also pictures and personal items, including clothing items and surfboards, found their place here.
In front of the country's government buildings, the flags were on half.
New Zealand hoped that the mountains "from the depths of the earth" would return to the surface," New Zealand Prime Minister John Key told the participants of the Memorial.
"But they've never come home."
He could not finish with the death of his son until he had seen his body, said Laurie Drew, whose son was buried in the grave.
In addition to the Prime Minister and his victims, several foreign diplomats participated in the Memorial celebration.
At the first explosion on 19 November, British and South African sources were also destroyed.
Rescue workers began to extinguish a fire inside the coal mine on the southern part of New Zealand.
As soon as the explosive gas is depleted, it will start to cool down the glowing temperatures inside the mine, said police president Gary Knowles to journalists.
Damn it, warrior!
Is Splatter suitable for art cinema?
Director Nicolas Winding Reffn re-extends with his fighter episode "Wahalla Rising" old generation boundaries.
What publication could Danish director Nicolas Winding Reff have been thinking of when he was driving "Wahalla Rising"?
An captured Viking warrior with only one eye (Mads Mikkelsen) frees himself from his painkillers and with almost superhuman forces specifically surrounds his enemies - sounds ideal for young men's observers looking for blood action, just because our hero wants to serve rabbinic methods of killing and his enemies have already escaped the heat from the living soul when he has bad wages.
On the other hand, it says that as he is actually called, the whole film is not over word, and also the other figures are allowed to enter at least one or two sets or a couple of random deaths.
Otherwise, it will be weakened and it will be devastated in the vast beautiful mountain landscape of Scotland, which has been offering the world of Vikings thousands of years ago.
Ideal for adults with interest in existentialism and very quiet camera trips.
It's nice if a film has several target groups, it's only bad if they're excluded from each other.
Director Winding Reff has been known as a kind of Danish version of Quentin Tarantino since his wild and styled drug dealer trilogy "Pusher", but he refuses to make his works more humor to the main stream or to make his works more accessible to the Arthouse.
Most of the art-kino friends should be able to break themselves from the spreading mass of brains and nerves.
The Action Fans will die at least before long, when, for free interpretation reasons, a group of violent Christian missionaries sail into Jerusalem and establish an eternity in the river and the Nebel before the mission appears in America and continues to sink there.
So no wonder that "Wallalla Rising" in Germany has not found any cinema rental and now it just appeared on DVD.
This is especially because of the great pictures, but also because behind the pretentious to bleeding fascist fascist fassade, a very exciting piece of cinema that deserves some attention.
In this film it is not about dialogue or a strict action, it is all atmosphere, a filming space.
And from it there is no escape for the observers.
Reffn almost gives him a moment of relaxation and slows him down with his vivid images and the window-like Transceived soundtrack, but especially with the inconsistency of hair that suits him from the heart of the figures.
Only a small blind young man who stands on the side trusts to keep himself so innocent that everyone else will be driven by iron.
Most of the most frequent hero whose motive is never explained, but once for enemies and temporary allies, he becomes a warrior out of the hell, possibly a messenger of the Devil himself.
It means ruin, but maybe it's just for the innocent.
"Wahalla Rising" is a racing film that you can hate and admire, to heal, raise and stop.
An experience.
Rhetorical work
The IAEA Atomic Energy Authority has new indications of a secret nuclear programme in Syria.
However, the country is still seeking to take a position - it is still able to control it.
On Wednesday night of September 5, 2007, at least four Israeli F-15 I fighters attacked a mysterious, well-favourable building in Syria.
It stands at the edge of the Euphrates; the next largest city, 30 kilometers away, is Dair as Saur.
Her name appears in documents of the International Atomic Energy Authority (IAEA) when it comes to the reactor, which is supposed to have built Syria with help from North Korea in the square, hiding in a valley that leaves the stream.
According to a letter from the US Foreign Secret Service CIA at the end of April 2008, it would also be appropriate to create plutonium - from which nuclear weapons are built, under the name of the nearby site el-Kibar.
For other purposes, however, the technology is hardly trained from the fifth century.
The CIA led a video presentation with unscathed satellite images.
By computer animation, she mixed up what components of the reactor should be before the destruction, which was a small copy of the North Korean model from the Yongbyon nuclear plant.
In addition, she provided photos showing the building from nearby areas or even the inner room.
The reactor was just before the start of the operation, but it was still not filled with fuel.
Today, more than three years after the bombing, it's almost more known than it was then, yes, the rats became bigger with time.
Former U.S. President George W. Bush recently realized in his memories that the CIA was quite sure before the attack that Syria had built an reactor in El-Kibar, but hardly any point of reference was seen that there was "an active nuclear weapon programme" in the country.
Some secret officials in Europe are more cautious and speak only of a "problem reactor", even if they hold the CIA's presentation for "pleasible".
You don't have any hard evidence, like the IAEA.
Asked how sure he was to have a reactor ahead of him, a high UN diplomat in the summer answered only lipid, which the IAEA has "sufficient material to ask questions".
The protection of the alleged "use of military buildings" created the Syrians to be holy and planned the land thoroughly.
However, in June 2008, an IAEA team was found under the former Chief Inspector Olli Heinonen in el-Kibar traces of Uran, which were manufactured by people.
In addition, the IAEA received satellite images from a Member State of commercial suppliers from time to time following the attack which should be more powerful than those presented by the CIA.
However, these revenues are not to be obtained on the market because the unknown contractor - perhaps Israel - bought them exclusively.
The IAEA cannot therefore verify its authenticity independently.
Syria has always meant never to operate a secret nuclear program or to have a reactor built.
The uranium comes from Israeli weapons, Damascus declared.
However, this was shown by the IAEA following analysis of the particles as unlikely.
Later, Damascus refuses to discuss it - just like the satellite images.
In addition, there is a second inspection in el-Kibar and access to the drummers of the bombed building.
But Israel also fails to exercise self - control.
"We will never comment on this," confirmed young Prime Minister Ehud Olmert at the time of the attack.
Thus, the investigation of the case has been under way since June 2008 and "increased to a serious problem of credibility for the Authority", as a high Western diplomat at the IEAA meeting in Vienna, has been facing a serious obstacle to the nuclear-weapon-free treaty in the room waiting for the IAEA.
As a key to progress in the disclosure, the IAEA is clearly seeing three other institutions that are "functionally connected" to the required reactor - and other than these.
The inspectors have not so far removed from what plants it is, what function it has or what it appears to be.
According to information from the South German newspaper, they are referred to as Marj as Sultan, Masyaf and Iskanariayah at the IAEA inland, and are again driven by nearby cities.
The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington (Isis) identified this place and established a building complex at Masyaf, where it is most likely to be one of the suspicious objects.
It may be located in or right next to a military support point - that is why Syria of the IAEA refuses access to the three places.
In Vienna, the Syrians feared a fishing expedition - that the IAEA would be sent by the United States to escape military facilities.
Because the nuclear field detectives were paying attention to the facilities by means of a tip of the US Secret Service.
The IAEA has noted, including satellite photos, that between the three locations and the square at the Euphrat material was transported and transported.
A high Western diplomat in Vienna said that at least one of the facilities could be "in relation to fuel production".
However, there is "no reference to sensitive activities", so uranium recovery or reconstruction; processes necessary for the construction of nuclear weapons.
Although the type of reactor is operated with uran that is not available.
However, where the uranium was to come from and where later the plutonium should be decommissioned for the bomb, there are, at least, plausible doubts about these central issues.
It is also unclear whether drummers that could raise valuable traces were stored in the three places.
If the hundreds of trucks had disappeared from the ground, no one would want to have any information about where the protection remained.
The only few kilometres of el-Kibar located on the other side of the Euphrates are Salzmine al-Tibni, which in 1998 examined the Syrians for their possession as a storage place for radioactive müll, the IAEA is unlikely to be considered.
Former IAA Inspector Robert Kelly had recently contacted the reactor in an analysis of satellite images for the famous magazine Jane's Intelligence Review.
However, comments from the Orbit show that Syria had taken over land and large containers after the IAEA had requested access to the three suspected sites.
This may be an accident, but it has almost helped to dispel the suspicion.
Furthermore, in diplomatic circles, the IAEA has been using several months to develop a plan for inspections there, which should allow Syria to establish any military secrets - the only evidence of the rise is how much the interest of the inspectors is.
On the other hand, Damascus also rejected this proposal.
If Western diplomats in Vienna had been pregnant a year ago, the reactor had been destroyed, so the matter had no high urgency, some US messenger Glyn Davies has been carrying out so-called special inspections for a few months, one of the strongest means the Vienna nuclear power has had to carry out control.
IAA Chief Yukiya Amano, who had to propose these inspections, has already spoken of "an option for which I am opening up in the future," but he is still late.
There is a high risk in this way: To do so requires a majority in the IAEA Governing Council, and some of the 35 countries represented there are all other than on a scale.
To others how to think about a diplomat: "What if they find nothing at the end?"
Love in Times of War
Ever since Angelina Jolie started working on her so-called government book in the summer, there is a nurse.
The scroll itself has written a love story between a woman from Bosnia and a Serbian man.
You don't know much more about this - but it's enough for rest.
The laugh, the woman, a Muslim, is deeply in love during the Yugoslavian war in her Serbian violence.
Bosnian women's associations have immediately protested, some of which were recently transferred to Hungary, where some of the three days planned in Sarajevo were planned.
In the meantime, the film has been filmed in Hungary and in post-production, but it is still protested in Bosnia.
Bakira Hasecic from the organization of women's war victims wrote about the UNHCR refugee relief work for Jolie and requested a meeting with the actor, a Bosnian newspaper has now reported - Jolie is itself a messenger of the UN refugee relief work.
She's not diplomaticly - she's already offered the women a meeting in Hungary a few weeks ago, but what they said was wrong.
The meeting must take place in Bosnia, so Hasecic.
Love stories in rape camps have not given it, and Jolie's attitude told the victims enough about the drive book.
Your organization has therefore recommended the UN refugee relief work to leave Jolie as a messenger, reports the Guardian.
What exactly did Jolie write about scenes?
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture, which was able to read her drivebook, has given a driving licence to Sarajevo - it is not quite clear why Jolie didn't come.
The young author himself, she did not pursue political views with her film, worked with a lot of people in the conflict in Yugoslavia, wanted to show the terrible consequences of the war and give a voice to all the parties involved.
However, when it is contained, it remains empty.
This is how a second synopsis on the film on the network, which then sounds quite different: The lovers could already be there before the war and meet again when they, a Bosnian Muslim, are thrown into a Serbian camp where he works as a guard.
What, though, sounds quite different than the variant "Affirmative Victims Become a Folter Service".
That Jolie's film actually starts before the war - it's so safe.
The pressure on them, like Jolie, is "unfailing and based on misinformation".
Now you may only be able to get the hackers from Hollywood Peace: By putting the drivebook as much as it used to be, it's illegal.
Nothing like out here.
This evening it finally runs right back around for the irons.
No trace of surgery.
For this reason, the team dominates its guests from Sweden, Finland and the United States too much.
The fans are cheering for joy with loud music, they starve with their feet.
The Bailey pub is located in the Southern Cork because players throw table tennis balls over a three-metre distance in Bierbecher.
"Bierpong" is called the strange spectacle to win, there is 500 Euro winning premium plus tickets to Las Vegas for the world's Bierpong Championships in January.
Cian Tanner is a quiet type; this ridiculous drinking game and the back computer that doesn't really fit together.
But the 26-year-old is trying to push himself away from the question of what the future will bring.
On his plan, he is not at play in Las Vegas, he will be conducting an application in New Zealand in January.
"I've got a lot of feeling about it," he says.
"It's so far away from home and I haven't got any work there."
Anyway: His friend is already waiting for him in Auckland - "she had fun, she got her job as an event manager, maybe a good sign," the young man says and laughs.
Because of bad prospects at home, two of Tanner's three sisters have already sought their happiness abroad.
His sister Yvonne, a social worker, is in Sydney, his brother Colin now serves as an IT consultant in London.
The boys go: As with the Tanners it looks like on the island in many families.
100 000 Ireland will probably leave the country in the near future, experts from the ESRI Institute of Economic and Social Research in Dublin say.
By 2015, they even counted 200,000 immigrants.
For the small country with only 4.5 million inhabitants a substantial loss.
Safeguarding the forecasts, it comes to an extraordinary wave compared to that seen in Ireland in the 1980s.
After a decade of recovery that brought great prosperity to the Irenians, there is now a great deal of sadness.
The economic crisis ensures, above all, the young, well-trained Irish people for whom it has been only a mountain.
Job loss and social decline seemed absurd in the years of the trees.
Everyone was needed, money was in excess.
But three out of ten women and men are out of work.
In the Irish Times there are currently a letter of readership for young immigrants who complain: "All goes down to the Bach in Ireland."
"There should be a rebellion against politicians and banks - but who can, go away and our country will lose a whole generation."
"The last one makes the light out."
Jura-Student Leanne Caulfield, President of the Irish Student Union, looks forward to a bright future because the government only operates blindfolds and offers young people no more prospects for the future.
"They reduce minimum wages, but they have no strategy to create new jobs," says the 20-year-old.
She observes how her fellows depend on an unpaid practice to the next.
Your greatest concern, she says, is to leave in four years.
"This thought is sad and depressing."
Men like Stephen McLarnon are trying to have the right subject.
McLarnon organises the "WorkingAbroadExpo", a fair that offers a round-up service for foreign work.
"Work abroad is a great opportunity for professionals to take the first step on the career leader," says the manager.
On its website are photos Surfer in Australia and Snowboarder in Canada.
The message is clear: There is no Gilead service in abroad, but it also brings freedom and fun.
How it feels to build something else, Seán O'Donovan has known for half a year.
Since there was nothing more to do for the 29-year-old engineer in Ireland, he now works with 15 Irish colleagues on construction in Germany.
In Gelsenkirchen they just drive up a fashion house.
In January it goes on to Hanover or Berlin, to the next project.
His home is only rare among O'Donovan because he makes extra stories so that he can pay the credit for his home.
"The situation is already a bit crazy," he says, when he sits for the first time over his house's well.
"I earned money in Germany for a house in Ireland, where I am as good as ever."
He laughs at something and goes through cool rooms.
The small house is located in a nice residential area with furnished windows, in the entrances park large, expensive cars.
Together with a sister O'Donovan has bought the house for €380,000 for four years - 100 per cent has financed credit.
"There were crazy times, there was simple money without many questions," he says.
He's afraid it could fly with the credit?
O'Donovan gives up a long time and says, "I don't have any children I have to feed and I'm young; even if everything goes on, I can start again."
The construction engineer is not allowed to hear what he is hearing at the moment.
"No one has to starve - our situation is not as dramatic as it was in the past on the island," he says.
"Working abroad for a long time isn't the worst thing that can happen - maybe we feel like iron."
He laughs and then tells about his father who has gone to England in the last major economic crisis.
"After seven years he was back there and life went on in Ireland, quite simple."
Cian Tanner likes this idea.
Let the future open up and just look at how it goes with life.
A few years of work in London has already been behind him, and why shouldn't it not work well for him and his friend in New Zealand?
One thing, however, is still to be said of him in these days: the celebration of his 27th birthday in Dublin.
He's afraid it could happen in a life party.
"Just don't get too many emotions," he says and drinks a great fortune from his beer.
"Even though it sounds overwhelming."
"We'd rather call it a street party, quite funny, with a few friends, a few drinks, a few games."
The Democratic Routine
The movement of democracy in Latin America is becoming stronger, as is the support of private companies.
Crime is a greater problem than unemployment.
In many parts of the region, the influence of Brazil is greater than that of the United States.
These results resulted in the Latinobarometer survey conducted in 18 countries and published exclusively in The Economist.
This question has been carried out on a regular basis since 1995 and thus shows the change of opinion in this region.
Two facts fall in this year's survey from September and October in particular.
First, the good mood in Latin America
and secondly the growing interest in democracy and its main institutions.
In many countries in the South American Pacific Coast, democratic movement has increased dramatically (see Table 1).
In Peru, for example, where the economy has grown by around 6% annually since 2002, the number of democratic speakers rose from 40% in 2005 to 61% in this year.
This trend is also recognised in Mexico where the economy has recovered since its strong entry into force in the last year.
However, only half of the respondents in Mexico and Brazil, the most populous countries in the region, are convinced Democrats, which lowers the regional average (see Figure 2).
About 44% of the respondents said they were satisfied with the democratic practice of their country. These are as many as in the last year, but 25% more than in 2001 (Table 3).
About 34% trust in the Congress of their country and 45% of their government. Both values correspond to those of the last year, but show a significant increase compared to 2003 (17% or 24%).
A decade ago, the economic crisis in Latin America was undermining efforts to increase democracy.
This is also true during the global economic crisis, perhaps because the countries of Latin America have experienced only a short resurgence phase and have recovered quickly.
In addition, the poor were caught by a stronger social network.
(As reported by the UN Economic Commission for Latin America this week, the rate of poverty in Latin America rose slightly in 2009 and dropped again by 32% this year.)
However, there are strong differences in voting from country to country (see Diagram 4).
Brazil's strong economy and the popularity of the different president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, are reflected in a broad range of progress.
In Mexico and Central America, where the recession was stronger and increased by violence, this is less the case.
For the second time since the start of the survey, many in Latin America have seen a greater problem in crime in their country than in unemployment (see Figure 5).
Some 31% say that they have either been victimized by themselves or by a family member in the last year. However, 38% in the last year have fallen and have thus reached the lowest status since 1995.
The growing economic performance is reflected in the stronger support of the private and market economy: about 71% of the respondents said that private economies were essential for development in 2007 were 56% (see Figure 6).
About 58% stated that only the market economy can make progress in its country compared to 47% in the last year.
Interestingly, 62% of the respondents in Venezuela have maintained this view (and 80% are for a private economy), although their left President, Hugo Chávez, has discovered many private companies.
According to Brazil, 19% of respondents (18% in the last year) have the highest weight in the region followed by the United States (9%, unchanged since last year) and Venezuela (9% compared to 11% in the last year).
In Mexico and most Central American countries, however, the most influential country in the United States sees this role in the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua in Venezuela.
A break in the selection
No one expected the elections to be perfect in Haiti on November 28.
But the facts go far beyond the fears of the electoral aid, which drove the affected country to help.
Overcrowded wafers, multiplely voiced voices, electives in the ringstone, damaged election sites and leaks were just part of the problem.
Selection locals opened with an hour's delay.
Many Haitians, many of whom had become homeless by the earthquake in January, worked around looking for a choice.
Some finally gave up.
A thousand presidential candidates, including some of the required top rankings, requested the suspension of electoral results due to a alleged fraud.
There have been some violent protests throughout the country.
However, Edmond Mulet, head of the UN mission in Haiti, called the election "as right in many interests".
According to a careful statement by observers of the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community, "these irregularities make them so serious that the process is not necessarily unfair".
In other words, the show goes on.
The election authority, which is obliged by the unaccompanied President René Préval and his candidate, Jude Célestin, will announce the provisional results on 7 December.
The expected selection is recommended for January.
There is still hope in the choice.
The two leading opposition candidates, rap musician Michel Martelly and former First Lady Miranda Manigat, have withdrawn their initial allegations of invalidity.
If Jude Célestin, who finds little or no consent in the election, is told by the electoral authority to win the election, this could lead to problems.
Because of the Cholera epidemic and the fact that more than 1 million of earth’s victims are still alive in cells, a low number of elections have been feared.
On the election day, many Haitians were prevented from voting by a lack of organization.
Shortly before the start of the selection, about 250,000 views needed for the selection were not yet distributed.
It's a lot on the game.
The farmers considered a legitimate, recognised government as an important step in rebuilding Haiti.
The Haitians themselves are of the same opinion.
Secret in the Middle
In the weeks following the sudden death of your husband, Argentina's President, Cristina Fernández, experienced a wave of sympathy that attracted her popularity rate by 20 points to more than 50% above. This is the highest value since her election in 2007.
However, whether you help this in the next year to make a choice again depends on whether the person who is apparently grieving Cristina Fernández is a compromiser as her deceased husband, her predecessor and political partner Néstor Kirchner.
The signs of this are not clear.
Néstor Kirchner, who, after his wife's election, had been involved in economic policy, often set out budget plans that did not take full account of tax revenues, economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the President-in-Office to issue extra income for their own benefit.
On paper, the Fernández government lost most of the Congress last year.
However, the opposition was divided and Kirchner's death after a heart attack on 27 October led to further eruptions.
Some regime critics from the ranks of ruling Peronists stood behind Cristina Fernández.
However, after chaos sittings (where a parliamentarian shot another in the face and the other concerned the government of employment) it was not possible for the Congress to adopt the budget for 2011.
"I will not discuss it," said the President.
The 2010 budget also applies for the next year, which allows the President to spend more money on his own good.
The economy is running hot: it is likely to grow to up to 9% this year.
For example, the official inflation rate is 11.1%, but many private estimates - and the company's wage requirements - move the value to almost 30%.
Kirchner, who took over the office in 2003 as a protection against economic crises, declared growth and poverty control to his main objectives, not the reduction of inflation.
He refused to cooperate with the IMF, exchanged the private sector, and assured the National Institute for Statistics and Populations INDIC, which included official inflation statistics.
Can Fernández now take a more moderate approach?
It has called on the private economy and the business leaders to speak.
And according to official statements, wage increases should be limited to 18% in the next year.
The high global market prices for Argentina's agricultural products have given the economy a strong boost.
However, inflation is undermining the growth ship by a major devaluation in 2002.
It may be that Cristina Fernández wants to financially join the rest of the world on this basis.
At the beginning of this year, the government entered into an agreement with securities holders who had refused the country's previous debt in 2001.
Now Fernández seems to force an agreement with the money providers from the Paris Club, which it owes about $6.7 billion.
The Churchners had always refused an inspection by the IMF, as otherwise usual.
However, last month, Minister of Economy Amado Boudou announced that the Fund will be provided with "technical support" in the creation of a new national consumer price index. It seems like this would be the first step towards cleaning the index.
It is not known whether Fernández will be politically active after the end of her term of office without the support of her husband.
If so, it needs to support the history of the Middle Ages, which has much of the Church's history.
If the Argentinans return in March from their summer vacation, the well of sympathy that you have been denied will be abandoned.
If she wants to win another choice, she has to decide whether she still holds her husband's many political decisions and insists on them.
Low appeal for China
Taiwan's voters are slowly approaching a closer connection to the party country.
How does Taiwan feel about his big brother on the other side of the sea?
On 27 November, more than 7.5 million voters, 70% of all electoral rights, were elected to elect mayors and mayors in the five urban districts. This will be considered as a broad assessment by President Ma Ying-jeou.
Through the construction of road-breaking business relations, including a partial free trade agreement, Ma is itself a symbol of the relationship to the country. Her policy has changed the relationship with the Chinese mother country for the first time since 1949.
Ma's got the test, but it's only a few.
Although its Kuomintang Party (KMT) has three of the five mayors, it has not received a majority.
Instead, the Democratic Progress Party (DPP), which is responsible for Taiwan's greater independence, received almost 50% of the votes that KMT received 45%.
In a presidential election, this would have meant a problem for Ma.
Since his election two years ago, the majority of his party has fallen by about 8%.
For the first time, the DPP even joined the KMT in the city hall.
During the election it came to the usual events in Taiwan, such as truck convois with Krawallmakers, flag-swisting massages and only spicy-dressed dancers.
There was even the mandatory, mysterious attempted murder.
Sean Lien, the son of Lien Chan and the honour president of the KMT held a talk on a KMT candidate on the election evening,
When a man from the crowd shot him in the face, Lien was healed and a former observer was killed.
However, it is not clear whether the guard wanted to kill lines or a dispute with the candidate.
Regardless of this, the attack according to Tsai Ing-wen, the DPP leader, influenced the election and turned the DPP into a bad light, which has protected KMT more votes.
Perhaps China was the biggest winner of the campaign.
In particular, relations with the country were not thematically.
Instead, the candidates discussed plans for social housing and job creation.
The Taiwanese love their real independence and deny China's military threat.
For this reason, the KMT does not like its relationship with the government in Beijing.
This time, however, the DPP also prevented the anti-Chinese feelings from being very reassured.
She responded to the new awareness that Taiwan's economy could not survive without China.
On the other hand, I would like to confirm that the majority of Taiwanese are afraid of their Chinese policy.
The Beijing government will continue to pursue its strategy to return Taiwan to the Community with economic incentives.
China immediately sent a trader to Taipeh to prepare a summit on investment security and medical cooperation.
Of course it also wants political integration, but first of all.
It is therefore expected to be followed by the 2012 presidential elections.
The DPP has discovered itself again.
Two years ago she was very weak: former party leader Chen Shui-bian because of corruption in prison.
During his presidency from 2000 to 2008, he made a major contribution to absolute independence.
However, under the Thai government, a new generation of right-wing politicians developed and the DPP was fighting for the voices of professionals and young people.
Tsai was a presidential candidate for the DPP, such as Su Tseng-chang under Chen.
Her party is now doing everything to show that she is also able to build strong relationships with Beijing.
Tsai is planning an idea as a point of contact between the DPP and China. This, however, requires free discussion.
Tsai publicly stated that her party offers a "trustful alternative" to mass rapid approach to China.
Chen seems very upset about this change.
From his cell he stated that the DPP candidates had done better to remain independent of Taiwan.
He even asked the pragmatist Su to reject the presidential candidate.
Even without Chen's interference, the DPP makes it difficult to select its potential candidates.
The KMT will have to undergo its own self-assessment.
But values are bad despite rapid economic growth; KMT candidates wanted to lead their election without it.
The main reasons for his infamousness seem to be unemployment and the ever-increasing gap between poverty and wealth.
According to a KMT speaker, he will be redesigned his cabinet as well as the local facilities.
The strong presence of the DPP can lead to the belief that Taiwan is only threatened with limited renegotiation.
At the same time, most Taiwanese see economic cooperation with China as inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a prominent colloquiumist, "there is no return anymore".
Grammy nominations: The jazz singer Esperanza Spalding was outstanding in the Newcomer category of the year
If you appear at a president's request, people will notice it.
President Obama himself asked Esperanza Spalding to attend the ceremony on account of the 2009 Nobel Prize Prize Awards. Now 26-year-old jazz bassist and singer were nominated in an outstanding way for this year's Grammy in the Newcomer category.
In view of the fact that Spalding has been a celebrated star since its album "Esperanza" in 2008 in the jazz scene, the nomination seems somewhat unusual. However, it is consistent with the rules of Grammy which an artist has been able to publish before the album was published, with which he has been known in the public.
Your famous album from 2010, "Chamber Music Society", is certainly a step forward. And with its strong voice and good breath for pop, funk and Latin Music, you can compare Spalding with Norah Jones 2003, whose great success in 2003 comes as a jazz interpreter in this category of the nominee Spaldings.
In addition, the album "Historicity" of Vijay Iyer Trios was named into the category of instrument albums. This love of critics led to a great success.
The competitor Iyers include "Moody 4B" of experienced saxophonist James Moody and "Positootly" of the keyboarder John Beasley.
Thrombone Shorty, a rather ugly new Orleans and more frequent guest in HBOs "Treme", was awarded in the category of contemporary jazz in the other albums of Stanley Clarke, John McLoughlin and Jeff Lorber.
The Secret Society of the Wild Steampunk Musicer Darcy James Argue was well worth the attention in the category Large Group. So he meets Billy Children's Emsemble with his room jazz and his adventureful Dave Holland and his octet, whose life-ablum "Pathways" is a good example for a bassist as a democratic band leader.
Grammy nominations: Michael Daugherty, Steve Mackey leads in the classic categories
The classic nominations for the 53rd Grammy Award include a great mix of musicians and composers from all over the world.
The list of Michael Daugherys "Deux Ex Machine" for pianos and orchestras with five voices, and Steve Mackeys "Dreamhouse", is an eclectical orchestra work with three voices.
Among the nominees with connections to South California is Estonian composer Arvo Pärt with his Symphony No. 4 "Los Angeles". This piece was commissioned by Los Angeles Philharmonics and was completed in 2009 at the Walt Disney Concert Hall.
The composer of Avner Dorman, who was in L.A., was also nominated for his Mandoline concert.
Classic nominations are divided into 13 categories, from orchestra, opera, choir to solo recordings.
In the category of classical producers, five artists were nominated this year - Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin and James Malinson.
Among the so-called classic albums, Bruckners Symphonies No. 3 and 4 of the Royal Concertebouw Orchestra; Daughertys "Deus Ex Machine" and "Metropolis Symphony" played by Nashville Symphony Orchestra; Steven Mackeys "Dreamhouse" by Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Synergy Vocals; "Sacrificium - the Art of the Castrati" were presented by various artists; and Verdi's "Requiem" by Chicago Symphony Orchestra and Chor.
The opera category included the "Lulu by the Orchestra of the Royal Opera House; Adolf Hasses "Marc Antonio e Cleopatra" by Ars Lyrica Houston; Kaija Saariahos "L'Amour de Loin" by the German Symphonie-Orchester Berlin; Rodion Shchedrins "The Enchanted Wanderer" by the Orchester and Chor of the Marinesky Theatres; and Arthur Sullivans "Ivanhoe" by the BBC National Orchestra of Wales.
As composers, part for Symphony No. 4, Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machine", Hans Werner Henze for "Appassionatomatto Plus", Magnus Lindberg for "graffiti" and Shchedrin for "The Enchanted Wanderer" for a grammy.
Parts Symphony No. 4 was performed and recorded in the Disney Hall by L.A. Philharmonics under the direction of Esa-Pecka Salonen.
The approximately 30-minute piece bears the title "Los Angeles" and is dedicated to former oil engineer Mikhail Chodorkowski, who is in prison in Russia.
Dorman's "Mondolinen concert" received a nomination in the category Instrumentalsolo with orchestra.
The composer from L.A. said that he had written the 15-minute piece especially for Mandoline artist Avi Avi Avital, who performed the concert with the New Yorker Metropolis Ensemble.
"I have used sounds from the Middle East and numerous North African tonnes and rhythms," Dorman said in a telephone interview.
Director Pierre Boulez, 85, received a nomination in the category Orchestra supply for the recording of Strawinski's works with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra under his direction.
As instrument soloists, the Pianists Nelson Freaire and Marc-André Hamelin were nominated by the organizer Paul Jacobs, the Geigerin Julia Fischer and the Harfinist Sarah Schuster Ericsson.
This year only women were nominated as vocalists, including Anne Sofia by Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucia Duchonová, Vivica Genaux and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the category Classic Crossover, Sopranist Jesse Norman was named "Roots - My Life, My Song".
Moschee in Temecula won the approval of the Planning Committee
The construction of a mosque in Temecula was followed by a five-hour public hearing, often accompanied by the only announcement of the local planning committee.
Critics urged the project to promote both terrorism and transport.
However, according to the Commission's statement on Wednesday evening, the new religious centre is in line with local provisions and becomes an atheistic view.
"The project is supported by many good people - by Christians, Jews, Bahais, and many others," said Hadi Nael, President of the Islamic Centre of Temecula Valley on Thursday morning.
"As an American, it makes me proud."
"It shows that justice prevails."
"There are only a few enemies," he added.
"They're just very loud."
"In this valley, wonderful people live."
The meeting began at 18:00 and the discussions for and against the construction of the centre lasted almost midnight, where the votes on both sides were fairly equal according to the Press Enterprise.
The debate was continued on the website of the newspaper.
"There's no America anymore," said one comment.
"It's another planet of apples, and the state of freedom is dead in sand."
"America is at the end."
Planed Islamic centres have also led to protests in other parts of the country, such as near Ground Zero, the scene of the terrorist attacks on New York City on 11 September 2001.
In Temecula Valley Imam Mahmoud Harmous called for violence.
Its communities with some 135 families have lived peacefully in Riverside County for years. However, they wanted a bigger and better place than the warehouse they rented with a producer for water filters.
The new, about 2,300 m2 large mosque in the Mediterranean style will have two minerals and will be about 13m high.
It is about 17,500 m2 on the site of Nicolas Road near the Chaparral High School.
Opposers can still challenge the project at the city court.
Arsen-resistant microbes could allow new forms of life on earth or otherwise
The discovery of a foreign type of bacteria that can live by insects opens up new possibilities for new forms of life on earth and elsewhere.
Although scientists have discovered this unusual bacteria here on earth, their view is a sign that life is also possible without the elements considered essential to life.
"This organism has two possibilities."
"It needs to grow either Phosphor or Arsen."
"This makes it very special, although it is almost a 'foreign' form of life," said Paul C.W. Davies of the Arizona State University and Co-author of the report that appeared on Thursday in the online release of Science magazine.
To date, six main components have been considered essential - carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphor and sulphur.
However, as scientists have discovered, the bacterium in the California Mono Lake continues to grow when it replaces Phosphor by arsenic.
"That's what else is possible," said Co-author of the report Ariel D. Anbar from Arizona State University.
Discovery is an important step in the search for foreign life, as scientists must recognize life and its forms, as they can.
The study consists of microbes found on earth.
The announcement of a press conference in which no details were announced on the discovery allowed too much public speculation on the Internet that the report could deal with foreign life.
This isn't the case.
The discovery "shows that in other planet systems organisms can put biochemical processes into place using other elements and that the 'standard elements' which we think are absolutely essential are not necessarily fixed," said Charles Cockell, Professor of Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute of the Open University of Milton Keynes in the United Kingdom.
Cockel wasn't part of the research team.
"This work is a novel because it shows that in basic biochemical processes and structures one can be replaced by another," added Cockell.
This discovery was not random.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon from NASA's Astrobiological Institute, which conducted the study, chose the Mono Lake because of its high arsenic content.
Since doctors and phosphor are chemically alike, they assumed that microbes that are both exposed may replace an element by the other.
"The toxicity of the arsenic is primarily based on the chemical nature of it being compared to phosphor."
"This makes it difficult for the organisms to distinguish one element from another."
"But the difference is so great that arsen works differently than phosphor. It gets into our biochemical system, where it almost collapses," explains Abar.
The researchers set out the bacteria GFAJ-1 at an increasing arsenic concentration. It adapted and increased.
Although the microbe is growing better in Phosphor, although it can also survive in arsenic, it shows that an arsen-based form of life can naturally occur either on earth or on another planet or moon, which occurs more often on the arsenic.
According to Jamie S. Foster, a professor of microbiology at the University of Florida, the idea that phosphor can be replaced by arsenic is not new. But until then there has been no working example.
Doctors came more often in the early years of Earth, she says, so science has concluded that early forms of life have used it.
"There is reason to believe that life could have evolved otherwise than in the early earthly age," said Forster, who was not a member of Wolfe-Simon's research team.
Research has been supported by NASA, the Ministry of Energy and the National Health Authorities.
Other stolen exhibition dogs found in Compton
The other two of the four exhibition dogs who were stolen before a Bellflower model were found on Thursday, according to a statement by the Los Angeles County Sheriff.
The four exhibition dogs - two Akitas and two Pembroke Welsh Corgis - disappeared on Tuesday, while unknown to the 2006 Chevrollet Express-Van, where the animals were buried before a Bellflower Motel 6 nights ago, said the authorities.
Two dogs were discovered on Wednesday afternoon, and the last two were revealed on Wednesday evening, Steve Whitmore, a speaker from the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department.
"The good news is, dogs are moving," said Whitemore.
"They're in good condition."
"They were returned to their rightful owners."
Whitemore did not make accurate data on the background of the dog or on the circumstances that led to its discovery.
"The findings are still running."
"We don't want to say that anymore," Whitemore explains.
"We're following some trails."
The dog owners, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, were not available on Thursday for accommodation.
They took their two dogs on Wednesday afternoon in a district area in Downey in reception.
The sheriff's representatives found the delivery cars and the two dogs at different locations in Compton.
The Akitas - Trace, a 3-year-old knight, and Didi, a 10-month-old dog - were reportedly unharmed.
However, Corgis Bunny and Peter, Rickard and Peek wanted to present their Japanese owners on the competition this week, remained missing until midnight.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, were present this weekend because of the AKC/Eukanuba National Championship in Long Beach in the city because Trace should participate in the competition.
As Peek of the Times reported on Wednesday, the other dogs should participate in the days before the AKC/Eukanuba show on other competitions.
South California is a stop on the almost monthly tour of the pair of dog views.
On Monday evening, Peek and Rickard checked into the motel.
They often spend nights in motels and park their delivery cars in front of their room window.
They took three other dogs - a boxer egg, a parson Russell Terrier and a Brittany - with her motel room.
The dense Akitas and Corgis remained in the delivery car because it was colder there.
They let the window open a wide column so the dogs had fresh air.
Peek and Rickard reported their cars stolen at 6:00 a.m. on Tuesday.
Peek promised everyone who could give a hint to the Corgis, a finding reward. The animals were implanted microchips for identification.
On Thursday it was not yet established whether a Finder's salary would be paid.
Once again, the Lübeck will re-examine the MGM restructuring
After 18 months of turbulence and insecurity, MGM finally received green light for a new start.
On Thursday a New Yorker contestant officially won the "prepared" faith plan to cover the debt of $5 billion and to build the 86-year-old maintenance company on the way to new films and television shows.
According to Thursday's statement, the plan meets the requirements of US competition law, so that the re-start of MGM under the direction of Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, the founder of Spyglas' entertainment, is no longer on the way.
The number of employees is reduced from over 400 to about 320.
For MGM, Chapter 11 actually comes into force only when JPMorgan Chase has completed a planned loan of $500 million to finance the new MGM products.
At the moment, a Consortium of the Investment Bank, which itself generates $75 million, is leading the company. The financing will take place until mid-December.
The restructuring of the studio began in May 2009 with the mandate of the Investment Bank Moelis & Co, the company management that fought interest payments of $300 million per year to help solve its financial problems.
In August, business leader Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former CEO at Enron and restructuring experts who were known for his work at Krispy Kreme Dughnuts.
Moelis & Cooper's efforts to solve MGMs' financial concerns and to pay more than 140 believers in the studio lasted longer than expected.
After monthly discussions, the parties decided to offer the company for purchase at the end of 2009.
However, the auction went into only a few bidders and no one wanted to pay the $2 billion required by the believers.
In the spring of this year everything began since the MGM team started with the restructuring plan, which was finally signed by the believers after months of debate and internal disputes at the end of October.
If MGM officially won the competition in the next few weeks, Moelis and Cooper will receive a bonus of several million dollars for their work.
The share for Moelis & Co., which has already received $1.2 million, is $9.5 million.
Cooper, who was paid monthly for the company's management of $375.000, receives a "success bonus" of $4 million.
Barber and Birnbaum plan to re-enter the production at MGM. In this year the studio produced only one film and created an annual plan with seven or eight films to come to the cinemas in early 2012.
They also plan two films after "The Little Hobbit" in co-production with Warner Bros.
The studio needs a separate loan between $265 million and $275 million for its financial contribution to these two films that are to be created under the rule of Peter Jackson.
Investor Carl Icahn, who financed about 18% of the MGM loan, tried to merge the studio with Lion's Gate Entertainment, whose biggest shareholder he is.
However, the final negotiations between the two companies did not lead to any results.
Tech Toys keeps your gift budget in balance
This year's favorite among the gifts is the iPad, possibly followed by a Microsoft Kinect video console. Both games can generate a significant gap in your gift budget.
An iPad costs as much as five BMX rows for $99, while the price for a kinect game corresponds to about 10 classic jumping lines or about 48 doses Play-Doh.
But you can already have your gift budget.
Recently, I visited three electronic games in three dollars of $80 from three national players - a Wall-Mart, a "R" Toys and a BJ's Wholesale Club.
I was immediately told that the law was in force. This year the technology instruments are more efficient and cost less than in the last year.
And although few new toys appear with their own website, there is a broader offer on the most famous of these types, Webkins and Club Penguins.
There are more and more button-operated toys on the market, and many contain rechargeable Akkus.
Here are some recommendations.
(If not otherwise specified, all prices from Toys "R" Us.)
Sing-a-ma-jigs (mattel, $13, for children from 3 years of age) are as large as sea turtles that sing a note when you press on their belly.
Pressing once corresponds to a note, by multiple clicks you can play a song.
Several Sing-a-ma-jigs songs in Harmony.
Caution: If you start with the pressure once, you can no longer stop.
For a combination of send and dance, the Dance Star Mickey (Fisher-Price $60, for children from 2) is the best choice.
Based on the Elmo Live technology developed in the last year, it offers animonical poppe exchange games like 'Simon' says, and thanks to the recent scarnier foot with radar blocking it controls the moon wave.
Children who test the device use Mickey as a dancer. However, your parents complain about the missing sound system.
If you are a child of the 80s, you must remember Alphie, one of the first computerized learning tools.
Now he's back there (Hasbro/Play School, $40, for children from 3), with a whole bunch of question cards that can be a car trip to an hour of instruction, with a better know-how with auto correction function as a teacher.
If you do not want to trust your child your smartphone, here are three independent options.
MobiGo from VTech ($60 for children from 3 to 8) is the cheapest and most user-friendly solution, equipped with a quartery keyboard. However, the games it contains are not as educational as those on the Leapster Explorer ($70, for children from 3 to 12), which is equipped with the first major processing of the Leapfrogs Leapster series with a new, bright screen.
None of the versions are compatible with older cassettes.
iXL by Fisher-Price ($90 for children from 3 to 7) uses a system similar to iTunes for games and eBooks, and thanks to the SD card drive, family photos can also be viewed.
There are still Scrabble Flash ($30 from Hasbro, for children from 8). The five blocks are not larger than a streamwood box and have a own LED screen.
The game is about to combine the blocks into words before the time runs out. It is great for an improvised written competition.
More and more toys have a kind of online connection.
When you go only after the offer in the playgrounds, Webkins and Club Penguins are the most important.
To give your child an online bird at the Club Penguin, for example, you can buy a Disney Club Penguin 2" Mix 'N Match Figuren Package ($5 for children from 6 to 12) containing a coin with a secret code.
If you enter the Code Online, your child will receive enough credit for two more parts in the Club Penguin Store.
It can be roll shoes or a puffle stuff.
The newest head cell-operated microbot, Hexbug Nano ($10 for children from 5) is not bigger than the head of your toothbrush.
The case moves fast to 12 vibrating silicone legs in any direction.
It's fun to send him through an iron gate.
And he looks like something.
We fell from the kitchen and even survived some time in our dog's stomach.
Police stations in China are becoming safer
As a training officer, Tang Shenbin walks through a city square, checks out his nerves, and gives him military authority and sound orders.
He wanted his female members of the Chengguan - China - to impress the viewers with the strong guards of the city order, afraid and ignored for their willing races and their commitment to violence.
"Stand up!"
"Look good!"
"Show them," he whispered to them, "how beautiful girls are!"
Four girls almost grew up in the teenage age, with white gloves and identical olive green Jacks and Hossen.
Four black pumps were in immediate range.
Four fine hides are placed perfectly on the hair held with blue-white strands.
"For me they look average," Mr. Tang notes with little appreciation.
"Models are beautiful."
Several governments have already tried to paint the image of city inspectors in China.
In one city all new applicants have to have a university degree degree degree.
The province of GuangDong was replaced by a bright blue uniform.
Wuhan in Central China replaced violence by low-starters: In 2009, reports from 50 officials reported that they were not properly placed and killed the operator until they packed up and left the place after half an hour.
Xindu, a city area in Chengdu with 660,000 inhabitants, wants to change the image fundamentally.
Since 2003, 13 women have strengthened the city police force. They have been selected especially because of their appearance, good figure and youth.
They should give the gross police a soft, feminine look.
But unfortunately, Scarlett Johansson would hardly be able to improve the bad image that the Chinese have of these city commands.
With the right, the critics.
Unlike the police, these officials can only apply the city laws by means of bail money or other administrative penalties.
However, the Chinese media show routinely another picture.
In January 2008, officials in the province of Hubei watched a death scene when they filmed with their phone how they had launched a protest against a müllhold.
In the last year a school manual of Beijing's officials was stolen and published on the Internet. It describes how criminals can be tortured without blood transfusions.
In this year, a Shanghai Water Melancholy Dealer takes place after a handload with five officers of brain damage.
A pre-violence video game that can be downloaded from the Internet shows officials trained in China when attacking street dealers.
"Chengguan makes the government afraid," complained China Daily last year, after further controversy over the tactics.
The newspaper called for "a really basic cleaning".
Skepticers find the current approach for clearly insufficient.
When the district in October per advert looked for eight female recruits, an editorial in the Beijing Evening News asked whether women should have real tasks or should only serve as an optical connection.
Probably both.
According to job ads, women aged 18 to 22 were searched with good figure and "harmonic facials".
They should be oversized - over 1.5m or 5 feet, 2 1/2 inch.
The employment ratio ends with the achievement of the 26th year of life.
According to the officials, the activity for women is too demanding for women over 25 physically.
"The most important thing is her image," said an anonymous district officer at the almost government website Rednet.com.
"If the candidates get the job, it depends first on their appearance, such as size, weight, face, etc."
Then come temperature and "our qualities".
"The female Chengguan are like flowers," he said, adding, "but they have other obligations."
Zheng Lihua, Vice-President of the City Administration of the District, does not want this description to be mandatory,
However, it was noted that in China, size standards in job ads for both sexes are not indispensable.
The same applies to equal faces.
If this is to be balanced with a good look, it is disputed in China.
But people with disabilities or physical disabilities do not need to apply.
"We can't use any blades or buckles here," said Mr. Zheng.
"Your image wouldn't be good."
Liu Yi, who patrols the Baoguang square near a monastery, is 22, has apple bags and a well-shaped mouth.
She didn't feel that she was being sexist, that such a high value would be placed on her face.
"Do you think I look at this uniform sexy?" she asks with ironic glance.
Her colleague, 21-year-old Xu Yang, commented, "We have the task of representing the city's image."
As a result, they do not regret the short-term approach because they had more ambitious career plans than simply throw traders through the gas to prevent them from doing business.
Each morning, the strip is made up of about twelve street dealers trying to sell as many food and shelters as possible before they are continued.
"Mr. Wang, please disappear here."
"We have already told you so often!" said Mr. Xu, a trader who had fled on foot and had temporarily left his nude kitchen attached to a bicycle car.
According to the officials, the activity is more monotonous than an effort.
"It's almost the same every day," explained Huang Jing, 20, who studied sales sales.
"Alle Routine."
One reason is that female officials cannot confiscate the goods of traders, like their male colleagues.
They can only ensure that the perpetrators are informed of their men's suggestions.
This should protect them from public abuses that are often exploited by officials in China.
In this year, hundreds of Kunming residents, the capital of Yunnan Province, had killed a dealer after the famine had ended.
More than a thousand police and Chenguan officers were injured during the nighttime incident, 14 government vehicles were turned around or buried in fire.
Xindu has since disappeared from such violence.
But there is no need for rest.
Only two blocks away from the quiet Baonguang square where female officials patrolled this morning, over 50 people gathered at a street corner.
Officials had confiscated a motorcycle which was repaired in a workshop rather than contrary to the rules on the citizens' ladder.
The owner wrote Zeter and Mordio.
After a 15-minute drive, the officers with a rough face walked along the road to their vehicles and continued driving with the motorcycle and its owner.
Li Xuedong, 40, a co-ordinator of the men's ranks, remained behind. To this end he turned his white name child into anonymity.
Like their colleagues, the coordinators - men over 40 - play a purely supportive role.
But they were not meant to present a clean image.
"Maybe we'll go ahead."
"Maybe but also physically," Mr. Li explained last night.

State attorney will not be accused of Senator Ensign
State attorneys of the Ministry of Justice have released Senator John Ensign from charges that, after his case with an ex-electorian and his attempt to get her husband to act as a lobbyist against him, the senator's attorneys made known on Wednesday.
This decision ends the most difficult bill against Senator Ensign, the Republican of Nevada. Until the scandal, which was carried out throughout the country for strike lines and placed a bomber in his career, he became a potential presidential candidate for the Republicans for 2012.
As Senator Ensigns's office announced, he was "high-fashioned" after the one-year investigation.
However, the Ethics Committee of the Senate could still impose yet another disciplinary penalty.
According to Ensigns lawyers, they were informed by the Ministry of Justice that the investigations against Senator Ensign were conducted and that there were no further complaints in this regard.
The Ministry of Justice did not want to be outside the case.
The trial was a surprise to many ethical lawyers outside the Ministry of Justice. Your opinion gave sufficient evidence that Ensign had violated the lobbying ban.
Interviews, e-mails and other documents that were first opened in the New York Times in October 2009 allowed the suspicion that Ensign Douglas Hampton, one of his electoral assistants, was reluctant to sell his files on a business deal with Hampton's wife Cynthia.
Cynthia Hampton was active during a campaign campaign of Ensigns as a treasure master.
Ensign contacted some political friends to get Hampton work. According to the details and hearings, he took over for them after Hamptons lobbying.
Since Hampton was recently in Ensign's election team, he had to take no lobbying work for his former employer or the whole Senate for a year.
According to ethical experts, the extraordinary agreement between Ensign and Hampton, who were close friends in front of the case, went against the so-called prohibition of Drehtür lobbyykratie.
According to the published Indices, "it seems to be all about a deal and about the defeat of the Drehtür states," said Stanley Brand, a Washington lawyer who specializes in the protection of customers who are in the government's visit.
While the Ministry of Justice was officially able to explain the reasons for the decision in the Ensign case, Mr. Brand and other ethical lawyers said that the Ministry seemed very cautious in taking political complaints after a number of minors followed by the media with great interest, including the decision last year to file charges against former Senator Ted Stevens for misconduct since the state court.
State lawyer "sid apparently schreckhaft", said Melanie Sloan, the president of the Association "Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington" (an organization whose aim is to combat corruption in the United States Parliament and Government circles), a group of lawyers who have brought various charges against Mr Ensign before the court.
"This basically means that senior government officials can now refrain from applying the laws for them," she added.
Paul Coggins, Chief Defender of Mr. Ensign, said in an interview that he had received a phone call from a state official on Monday and another day when he was informed that the ministry would not raise any complaints against his clients.
Mr. Ensigns Defender had cooperated with the state attorneys to convince them that the senator, as he repeated his office in a statement on Wednesday, "has acted in accordance with the law."
Mr. Coggins refused to clarify the legal arguments he had made against the state attorneys.
"I don't think I should go into the details of the discussion between the Ministry of Justice and me. Just so much has been said: we believe that we have made the right decision," he said.
In the past month, the Federal Electoral Commission has decided to set out the findings of a separate complaint by the ethnic group after a payment of $96 000 by Mr Ensigns's parents to the Hamptons against the Federal Electoral Law.
The electoral commission said that it had not given enough evidence that the money had been something other than a gift.
NV Energy, a large company in Nevada that had long supported the senator, was one of the companies in which Mr. Hampton found out thanks to Mr. Ensign lobbyist's work.
An e-mail from December 2008 suggests that after Mr. Hampton’s company has continued as a lobbyist, Mr. Ensings Stabschef, John Lopez, had an interview with Mr. Hampton, in which he informed him that he was at the Ministry of the Interior because of a "incline".
Mr. Ensign was also invited to agree with Mr. Hampton and another customer from Nevada, Allegiant Air, on Wednesday and asked the Minister for Transport to agree on a meeting on behalf of the airline after Mr. Hampton had arranged for Lobby's work.
As the last year, for the first time, information on this case was sent to the public, Mr Ensign apologized to his voters and raised his position in the Senate where he had been in the ranks of the Republicans.
After he had disappeared for several months, Mr Ensign told reporters two weeks ago that he wanted a third term in the Senate.
In the announcement that Mr Ensign was no longer the target of police research, Mr. Jennifer Cooper, the Senator, said that the Ethics Commission was following the example of the Ministry of Justice and setting out its findings.
" Senator Ensign is happy to continue his hard work in the service of people in Nevada," she said.
Cheshire's call makes a point on Twitter
Half a thousand of them took their place in the courts.
In the minute, they sent their reports on funny witnesses on Twitter.
At the end of this defense, there were more than 150,000 Twitter messages about the process of rape and bed-cooked children in a house that stood in flames.
On Thursday, the closely followed process by Steven J. Hayes, who was charged with killing three members of a family from Cheshire, Connecticut, will find an official end if the death sentence falls on the death sentence that the jury has pronounced.
However, Mr Hayes' attorneys have already applied to the Court for grounds for an appeal and the courts will be held for years.
One of the most procuring reasons is that through the intensive reporting of the process - including the extensive use of Twitter by media reporters - to a "circus atmosphere" and a wide-ranging, round-the-clock cross-examination of disturbing details, the jury has been unduly influenced by public equipment.
This claim could allow the Court of Appeal to deal with the question whether new rules are needed in the Court of Justice.
"As I have experienced during this process, I believe it is a real danger when the introduction of new technologies into the courthouse affects the right of every individual to a fair process," said Thomas J. Ullman, Mr. Hayes Chief Defender.
The President, Jon C. Blue of the Supreme Chamber Court, showed last week that the applications for a decision were brief and anonymous when he said that the new media would be "seriously controlled" and that there was no evidence that the jury of suffering had been executed.
But that was certainly not the last word in this case.
For decades, court rulings have established that the provision of reports on famous cases of doubt can arise in the fairness of a process.
In his historic decision of 1966, the Supreme Court of the United States ruled against Dr. Sam Sheppard, an osteopathian from Cleveland who was supposed to have killed his wife, and said in his decision that it had given a "carnivalsat atmosphere in the courtroom" because of the new media.
Some believe that the television series and the game film "On the flight" are based on this crime.
Some lawyers say that the court's ruling, which Mr Hayes later considered half a century later, could lead to the argument that new rules were needed to regulate the communication ways of the court that were still unprofessional in the time of Dr. Sheppard's case.
"There is good reason to be concerned about the impact of the new media on processes followed by a broad audience," said John J. Donohue III, professor at Stanford Law School, who has examined the death penalty in Connecticut.
Professor Donohue said that some appeals could be fascinated by the idea that restricting an ongoing communication from the Court of Justice could make the proceedings easier.
The Twitter issue is just one of many who present Mr Hayes' lawyers to discuss for years and therefore raise a condemnation.
The defenders also claimed, for example, that Mr. Hayes could have been prejudged as judge Blue had not allowed them to test the reactions of potential jury by showing them funny tattoo photos during the jury elections.
Some of the jury said, photos of the victim, Jennifer Hawke Petit, 48 years old, and her daughter, Hayley, 17 years old, and Michaela, 11 years old, had been filled with abortion.
The defenders said that they would also question the constitutionality of the death penalty Constitution and argue that the judge had falsely exchanged a jury that had been a critic of the state administration and that he had exercised an unauthorized pressure on the court when he had made the impossible decision to release the jury on the weekend.
The jury wasn't isolated.
However, their arguments about the impact of the detailed report on the process may be of the greatest interest.
In a trial trial they filed last month, they found that the case had dominated the news in Connecticut and during the election campaign for the governor's office and for the American Senate of the candidates.
They argued that the new media had constantly recognizable the flames of emotions over the case.
"This daily tension of media reporters, cameras and reporters outside the Court of Justice," writes the lawyers, "you have never experienced before in New Haven and perhaps even in the country."
Your focus on reporting through Twitter is controversial.
In interviews, some journalists said that the claim that these direct messages are more dangerous than reports that will be replaced is a technologically negative view that hinders reporting on future processes.
However, some lawyers said that appellate courts would often be opposed to the argument, and social and technical changes needed adaptation by the courts.
Mr. Hayers' lawyer reinforces this claim.
In its claim they referred to the decision of the Supreme Court of 1966, in which Dr. Sheppard's trial was raised on the basis of the report and made it clear that the new media require new rules.
"This case," they write, "Sheppard represents Maxwell of the 21st century."
Is it possible to connect frequency to the separation?
After a campaign onship words and negativity this week was a little frequent in Washington.
Is it the end of a real bilateral cooperation or a moment of illusion before you return to the war in the capital?
The meeting on Tuesday between President Obama and the summit of the Congress did not take place on the big issues with which you had to deal during the "lame duck session", the meeting at the end of a period of government, where no decisions were made.
After all what you hear, it was neither a general discussion between two different sides nor a consideration of their shared responsibility, but rather an empty episode of a partial assembly.
The public meeting of the President's deficit committee on Wednesday was also civilized, despite the political differences that still exist between the members.
It seems clear that close interaction over a period of months creates a mutual respect which divides the ideological club that continues to divide members.
It's almost enough to claim it's a new era of cooperation.
Both sides are now in a test phase - in which one of the other signs of cooperation and compromise is required, while you are trying to consider the limits of public opinion and the patience of the voters after a new party war.
Therefore, the meeting on Tuesday itself and its assessment by the participants were limited to a minimum of claims or charges.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too large and too deep to expect a rapid change in the atmosphere that could have prevailed over the past two years.
Whether it's about taxes, expenses, health or warnings, both sides are miles away from each other.
Finally, the November elections in Washington have at least been mild for a short time.
"No question has changed the tone," said Pete Wehner, an official representative of the Bush government who is now working for the Ethics and Public Policy Center.
"This is inevitable after elections.
Choices cause partial suffering that die again.
And that's good."
In some questions, especially those on the agenda of the 'lame duck session', Republicans and Democrats have almost one choice as to finding a solution."
Bush's tax cuts end at the end of the year, and no one dares.
Both sides want to find a way to get some or even all, whether it is temporary or permanent.
It is also a compromise with regard to the rising unemployment rates, even though only because the Republicans cannot afford it, that they believe that the preferential tax reductions for the regions are to be expected while they refuse to support unemployed workers.
After the meeting on Tuesday in the White House, optimism has increased that you can agree on these issues during the "lame duck session" and at the same time ratify the new START contract.
However, William Glasson of the Brookings Institute warns that successful cooperation in pressing issues of the Lame duck session" does not have to lead to permanent cooperation by the parties when the new 112 Congress is convened in January.
On the contrary, he says, a phase of non-posterativeism is more likely, perhaps even impossible.
"After the things that have to be done are done, this short-term psychology will be confronted," he said.
The reason is also sceptical - and this creation is shared by many - leads to true cooperation.
"I see a lot of what's going on from today to 2012, as a fight, or shadow boxes, for the main event of 2012," he said.
The reasons for this are very much to do with the opening up of the new Republican majority in the White House and with the Teeparty voters who served their education.
As the Republican leaders are concerned about the fact that they are too high poker, they know that they have to try to reduce government expenditure and force health reform on them.
These parties are already in the first reaction to the recommendations of the Deficit Commission, which include a tax reform and the addition of some taxes and the increase in the rate of interest rate and the reduction of state expenditure.
The Vice-Presidents Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have taken over one of the most difficult jobs in Washington and, according to their own assessment, have so much pressure to put the deficit issue on the public agenda that they can no longer be ignored.
But they need, within the Commission, 14 of the 18 votes to make their plan for the official recommendation and they fight very hard to get close to this number.
The greatest resistance is in the chosen representatives of the Gremium, since it is in financial matters, at least today, only a little playing room or little sympathy for compromise.
Galston foretold two phases in the fight between the White House and the Republicans at the Congress.
The first fight will take place next year in the form of party meetings when the Republican Obama challenge the state budget, taxes and the health system, followed by a phase of greater bilateral cooperation.
What will lead to this change?
The public opinion.
It is proved that, despite the participation of the current election, most Americans still want the two parties to work together.
If a confrontation leads to a sack gas, how it happened in 1995, both parties must pay attention to the public reaction.
Anyone who is always judged to lose will change the course and have to look for the compromise.
This may actually be an optimistic view.
Participation and polarization are larger today than in the mid-1990s, and they seem to be a bigger ideological club between Obama and Congressmen than in the time between President Bill Clinton and the Republicans.
At the same time, activists from both parties 2010 saw a clean example of a wide range of choices in 2012.
That's how many Americans like to see the frequency that this week is being watched.
On both sides, however, much more will be required to find a common denominator in the issues that divide them as before each other.
Secure US document portraitd Moscow as a port of corruption
The city's control is in the hands of "Kleptocratia" and it gives part of the crew money and the protection money it collects on the Kremlin. So in February the American message in Russia reported in a memo.
Both the police and the State Security Service require high protection money so that they can maintain their expensive standard of living in Moscow.
They collect money not only from legitimate businesses but also from organised criminal gangs.
Each desk of the bureaucracy - what Prime Minister Vladimir Putin referred to as "vertical of the Authority" - takes part in the money that the leader travels to the top.
The memo sent under the name of the messenger John Beyrle to Washington was published on WikiLeaks's website on Tuesday.
The memo is based on sources whose names have been edited.
It was written while Yuri Luzhkov was still a mayor of Moscow, and it accused him of corruption.
He was burned in October by President Dmitry Medvedev, but there is hardly any evidence that he would be raised in the meantime.
Luzhkov and his wife, Yelena Baturina, who owned a well-known construction company, have always repeated corruption claims over years, and he has won many accusations against such charges.
In September he declared a Russian television transmitter when he was asked for a documentation that suggests he was corrupt: "It's crazy, it's drunk, it's dirty."
> An incredible number of Russians believe that their society is corrupt. That has led to questions.
But it is unusual that, as in the messenger's report, individuals will be called, and it is unusual to hear that this is done by a diplomat from a foreign country.
"The direct link between the Government of Moscow to crime has led some to call it "distorted" and to the conclusion that the government is more like a cleektocrat than a government," says the memo.
"Criminal elements enjoy a "kryshna" (a term from the world of criminals / the Mafia, which literally means "dach" or "protection"), which extends to the police, state security (FSB), the service oversight authority (MVD) and the government office of the State Hall as well as to the entire Moscow government bureaucracy.
Experts have discovered a triangular structure within the criminal world of Moscow.
"Luzhkov is Captain Stella."
"FSB, MVD and the militia are at second level."
"Lastly, the ordinary criminals and the criminal inspectors follow the bottom level."
"This is an incompetence system that in some areas criminal groups closes a hole because the city does not offer any help."
The report further states that the FSB money is being spent by the largest companies and that the police arrest small business people.
A source, that is, "was stated that Moscow's business owners understand that it is best to get protection from MVD and FSB (not from organized crime), since they have not only weapons, resources and power than criminals, but also because they are protected by the law."
"For this reason, the protection by criminal gangs is no longer as requested as before."
The memo notes that while the collection of money is comprehensive, the protection itself is not very clear; even those who pay are sometimes arrested.
Those who do not pay find their business closed very quickly - because of some prejudice or prejudice.
Medvedev has repeatedly talked about combating corruption, but at the same time he has noted that he has made only a few progress.
The message's memo contains descriptions of men who went to the Kremlin with suitcases that were probably full of money.
"In his struggle against corruption Medvedev must leave the bureaucrats," said Georgi Satarov, director of Indem, a Moscow expert committee, recently in an interview.
"But he's part of this bureaucracy."
"It is not part of the political class because there is no political class in Russia anymore."
Without politicians, without an opposition, without a division of violence, he says, corruption is inevitable.
On the other hand, according to estimates, corruption in Russia costs more than $300 billion a year.
In place of 154, the country is conducting a new investigation into the global perception of corruption by the non-governmental organization Transparency International (the countries are "the least corrupt" to "the most corrupt").
The idea of the memo of the American message that happened after Moscow's late days will certainly solve errors within the Russian government, although Luzhkov may be accused of Moscow's error, it may also be an opportunity for the Kremlin to claim that it is possible to solve the problems.
In an interview with Larry King for CNN Putin claimed that the WikiLeaks documents could be a falsification and responded strongly to the idea that American diplomats named him Batman and Medvedev Robin.
"The truth is that it is about our interaction, which is an important factor of internal policy in this country," he said.
"But to be honest, we didn't expect it to happen with such arrogance, with such pressure and in such an unethical way, you know."
Khmer Rouge Veterans to face the past forced
In a low-lighted, bonfired classroom with dirty and revealing walls, the director of Anlong Veng High School recalls the man who built it at the later Khmer Rouge Guide Ta Mok.
"Everyone here loves Ta Mok."
"He was a good leader and he cared for his people," said Sreng Kor Ma, 42 years old.
Because of his brutality during the Khmer Rouge government known as "the fighter", the commander remains popular in this remote Khmer Rouge-Hochburg in North West Cambodia, where he has built hospitals and bridges, developed the infrastructure, and where thousands of former soldiers still live.
But this year, 12 years after the capitalization of the Khmer Rouge against the government, long-term supporters are required in Anlong Veng.
In April a local truth and reconciliation forum allowed the victims to face the public confrontation with people who only support the regime.
In June the government distributed a school book, which tells the history of the Khmer Rouge for the first time to children of former soldiers.
And in July a Community tribunal of UNO and Cambodia first condemned a former member of the Khmer Rouge when it was sentenced to 35 years in prison to the former head of the famous Tuol Sling Folkroom, Kaing Khek Iev.
With all these developments, fear grew under the Khmer Rouge Veterane Alllong Vengs, their efforts to reintegrate and reintegrate into Cambodia's society.
"There is still confusion and fear in the former Khmer Rouge, but they have no power to do anything," said Chhang Youk, director of the Cambodian Documentation Centre, an independent organization researching the regime.
"For her life under the Khmer Rouge was glorious, but the regime has become a symbol of evil."
"It's the family itself."
During the Khmer Rouge reign in Cambodia between 1975 and 1979, estimated 1.7 million people were executed or died from diseases, processing or hunger.
When the Vietnamese entered and the Pol Pot-Ied government was defeated in 1979, the rest of the regime and its military flew to the border of Cambodia to Thailand.
They spread here until December 1998, as the last movement capitalised, restlessness.
When Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sarry led the war of war from their base in the west of the mountains and the jungle of Cambodia, Ta Mok took the next generation to Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-1990s, when a UN-supported peace agreement 1993 led to the first democratic elections in the country, large groups of Khmer Rouge fighters began to pass on to the government, leading to the capitalizations of Ieng Sary 1996 and Nuan Chea and Khieu Samphan 1998.
Pol Pot died in 1998 of a natural death, and Ta Mok, who had not followed, was arrested by government forces at the Dangrek Mountains in 1999.
He died in the Phnom Penh prison in 2006, where he was waiting for his trial.
When their teeth no longer protected them, most of the former Khmer Rouge fighters fled into the perturbed poverty of the rural Cambodias and many kept the movement in nostalgic memory.
Even if some small elite officials of the Khmer Rouge kept their local government posts because they lowered their weapons, the simple soldiers remained poor, untrained farmers.
"These people have only benefited very little from the capitalisation," Sok Long said from the Centre for Justice and Compensation, which holds public forums throughout Cambodia, including in Anlong Veng
"They are trapped in the Utopian agrodeology of the regime."
"They grow up without any skills."
Sor Lim, 55 years old, who had joined in 1974 as a teenager of the Rhmer Rouge, fought in the jungle about Alang Veng before he landed in 1998 to lead a life as a poor traveler.
"Life under the Khmer Rouge was good," he said.
"To Mok has given everyone something to eat."
"But now life is hard because we have to take care of ourselves."
The current Khmer Rouge Tribunal has also raised concerns here.
At the beginning of next year, the court will try to set up Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife as well as Ieng Triith, another former Khmer Rouge Minister.
The order of the Court is to condemn the old leaders and those who are primarily responsible for the atrocities, but it is not said whether further action will be taken on these four cases.
This has helped little to calm the most in Anlong Veng.
Current media speculations have concentrated on the Chaem, 64 years old, during the Khmer Rouge reign in the late 1970s district chief of Manteay Meanchey Province.
In 2007, she told officials of the Kambodscha Documentation Centre, led by the construction of the Trapeang Thma Damms, a project that probably killed thousands of forced workers.
On a hot night, I returned from work on the fields to her wooden house on a dirt road outside of Anlong Veng.
When the sun had long shadows on the lost grass it was slowed down in the camp to discuss their past at the Khmer Rouge.
If she were to be brought before the court, she would refuse to go, she said.
"Cambodsha lives in peace and stability," she said.
"If there were no more persecution, there would be war here."
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who was fled by the Khmer Rouge in 1878, has also repeatedly warned that the situation would be uncertain, and the court would be more suspicious, although experts and historians would discuss this.
"Cambodsha must dig a hole and bury the past," he said.
But the confrontation with the past is what Cambodia has to do to move forward, said Chhang Youk from the Documentation Centre.
"Remuneration with the Khmer times means combining the broken pieces," he said.
"It is our duty to put these broken parts together so that they can understand everything."
The center created the first government-approved schoolbook on the Khmer Rouge, the 75-page "History of Democratic Cambodia".
It distributed the book in June in Anlong Veng as an annex to the history book for the High School of the Ministry of Education, which contains less than four pages about the Khmer Rouge.
As often as in Cambodia, the young people in Anlong Veng know little about the Khmer Rouge, despite the city's connections to the regime.
Touch Valeak, 19 years old, a student at the Anlong Veng High School, said that the new school book helps the students to understand an important part of their history.
But his parents reacted skeptically when he brought the book home to read it.
"My family takes away many parts of the book and the court," he said.
"They are suspicious because they are not sure how many people are judged by the court."
Such resistance makes the reconciliation process complex and complicated, said Sok Leang.
But the public forums, the school book and the court receive both after and after influence," he said.
The Khmer Rouge still has a powerful appeal here.
Up in the Dangrek Mountains, one of the rivers leads to a right of black rose, covered with a red glow.
Pol Pots Body was burned here after his death in 1998 at a railway station.
Num Sothea, 31 years old, a mobile salesman on the street, said she didn't know much about the man who was burned here.
"But he has a strong spirit and many people go here to pray to him," she said.
It was Nuom Sothea's birthday and later the day she wanted to go to Pol Pots last rest place where she will put a bust of bananas - in the hope that it will bring her happiness.
Belarus agrees to collect no more armed uranium
In an amazing victory for President Obamas Campaign on the global security of nuclear materials, the Government of Belarus announced on Wednesday that no more high-level uranium will be collected, which is a critical component of nuclear weapons.
The deal was announced in a joint state after a meeting of Foreign Minister Hillary Rodham Clinton with the Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov in an additional article of the security trap.
The U.S. government had tried to convince Belarus to collect no more high-performance uranium and apparently to have achieved a harvest last spring.
However, U.S. government officials told Washington Post that in the past two months two secret agreements with Belarus have been reached to remove 187 pounds of armed uranium from a white research agency.
This prepared the stage for the midweek convention to remove the rest of the material - according to an official staff member who remains anonymous due to the sensitivity of the subject.
The agreement seems to be one of the most important results of Obama 'Nuclearer Security Summit of the 47 Nations' since April', which had been excluded from the White Sea.
And it was obviously good enough to ensure that the former Soviet Republic was invited to the next summit in 2012.
"I was really excited about the fact that they wanted to sit in the nuclear security gate (from 2012)."
"This proves to me that it works," said Ken Lugo, President of the Global Security Partnership, a group to promote nuclear security.
Clinton called the agreement "a very important, important step" of Belarus.
Obama made a commitment in April 2009 in Prague to secure all nuclear material for four years.
Since then, the US government has helped six countries to release their highly enriched uranium.
Belarus will be the seventh.
A thousand countries did it under the government of George W. Bush.
At the time of Obama's nuclear security summit, White Russian President Alexander Lukashenko stated that the nation would never give up its uranium.
"How to keep highly enriched uranium - hundreds of Kilos, which is basically armed, and less enriched uranium," said Lukashenko at the time.
"That's our raw material... we won't make dirty bombs and we won't sell it to anyone."
"We use it only for research purposes, that's all."
However, a few months ago, Belarus approached the United States when it expressed interest in meeting an agreement.
The first move to remove the uranium from Belarus in October was particularly complicated because the material was easily exposed, says officials.
It was launched in a special train which has more than 1,300 miles to a Russian store and disposal factory for, says officials.
The second launch was decided on Monday and was conducted according to the official by aircraft.
The U.S. government pays $14 million for these coins, where a large part of the money flows into the Russian research with a weakly sufficient uranium that cannot be used for nuclear weapons.
"This was extremely carefully coordinated and agreed to build confidence," said Andrew Bieniawski, a representative of the Ministry of Energy working at global risk reduction.
The James Martin Centre for Non-Extending Studies estimates that in this year, Belarus had at least 88 pounds of armed uranium as well as hundreds of millions of pounds of high-income uranium.
In accordance with the common agreement, Belarus intends to resolve its stocks by 2012.
The relationship between Belarus and the United States has long been tense for years, firstly because of Lukachenko's serious human rights violations.
But the state of midnight suggests a possible approach.
"The progress of these global security issues is welcome, as the United States of America and Belarus announces that greater respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remains a central issue in improving bilateral relations and is essential for the progress of the country and its citizens," she explains.
No interference by the Spanish Government against CIA flights
The Spanish Government had no objection to the CIA flights with Taliban and al-Qaida refugees across the Spanish state area to Guantánamo, as did a telegram from the U.S.A. messenger in Madrid.
This reflects the documents of Wikileaks and the daily newspaper "El País" (by cable). It is added that former Deputy Head of Government María Teresa Fernández de la Vega requested that the Spanish government be informed "to demonstrate that foreign aircraft flying over Spain be properly monitored."
In June 2006, following the publication of a report by the Council of Europe, in which the aid for human rights practices in a thousand countries, including Spain, was accused, the former North American Ambassadors Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández de la Vega spoke.
The Deputy Head of Government said that the Council's report "has hit Zapatero" and confirmed that Spain had nothing to hide in this matter.
"De la Vega underlines that Spain has no objection to secret flights across the Spanish state area."
"They just want to be informed," says Aguirre per cable.
The former Foreign Minister, Miguel Ángel Moratinos, also pointed out to the messenger that the Spanish Government "does not want to pay much attention to this matter, although the government has little influence since it puts it in the hands of the judges."
On the other hand, in January 2007, the State attorney Vicente González explained that he would not block the legal initiative to request the declassification of the documents of the Spanish Secret Service Centre (CNI) and the Ministry of Defence on CIA flights.
"These reports do not contain any taxable or sensitive information," the messenger said after a discussion with the government official.
Nevertheless, the United States was more concerned about "probably coordination between the Spanish State and the German State Guard" than about the information declassified by the CNI and the Ministry of Defence.
"This coordination between independent researchers will complicate our efforts towards discrepancy between governments," Aguirre laments.
On a Wednesday in March 2007, when the US envoy and Spanish Interior Minister Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba participated, last of them commented that "even though the Spanish judges are genuinely concerned about their independence and do what they think is appropriate", he gave his staff instructions "to avoid rash rhetorical comments to reduce tension."
The Ambassador also expressed his concern about the way the PP is doing in this regard.
"Despite its general pro-American attitude, our experience teaches us that the PP will not doubt it, as evidenced by the Government of Zapatero's actions that could have been subjected to, tolerated or ignored as possible human rights violations, capital will be struck, even if these assumptions could have a negative impact on the Government of the United States," he said.

When the young woman went to the dancers to look at the labour market, the little partner stayed with her partner, who even accompanied her to Palma for a week.
But from the content of their messages, it is possible to conclude that their relationship of love has deteriorated and they have separated themselves.
In March 2008, she is alone on Menorca and she writes: "Alberto is very self-sufficient and clean because I have come to work."
"When I told him about it, he found it good, but now he realizes what it means to be alone with the boy all day long and not to be free, do and let him do what he wants."
Later she mentions a message she just received on the phone: "I want you to come back this month or let me get an address I can send to the boys."
She laments: "If he doesn't like me leaving the boys at my mother's house, I'll leave him when I get back."
In May she says of her return to her village: "I'm going there this week, but I'm only going to stay there until 19 because I have to introduce myself to a job on the 20th if I don't want to lose them."
She explains that she takes her first-born when everything's going well.
"He will be with whom he must be, that is with me. I will not leave him again in life with someone other than my mother," a questionable idea if you take into account their bad relationship.
There's another mail in July.
When she writes this, it is concluded that the young man who came to the island on the 1st of the month and was reportedly murdered on the 10th is dead.
"On the one hand, Caesar is satisfied, not on the other."
"On the one hand he likes me and the place, but on the other hand he has to go to school every day."
She's talking about a conversion to Mallorca.
"There he (the young man) will attend a summer course, so I have fewer expenses for the girl."
On 17.: Reminders and complaints.
"A smile from Caesar who asks me when you come."
"Alberto says he sent me some videos on e-mail. You see, if he wants to, he'll find me, so a mistake."
On the 30th, "The boy's going well. He's going to a summer course to learn Catalan."
From Victor, her current partner, there's one: "He's saving me money."
On the Internet, in animation and mangablogs, there are messages from you.
She even had her own blog in MySpace, which is now blocked, where she called herself "Muki, the prison camp".
"Terror to the galley (Subscript) ".
The last man who spent time with her explains that he felt guilty.
He can't understand that everything happened because she didn't tell him she was a single mother.
Mónica was transferred from the Centre for Prisoners of Menorca to Palma Province Prison yesterday.
The defendant, Carlos Maceda, said that she could not remember the course of the case, "and she didn't intend to add the small damage."
However, she had previously been able to drink César in the bathroom and to hide his body in a safe.
Defence and state administration called for a psychiatric attitude.
Partido Popular won 4 seats in Congress and lost PSC 9
With the results from 28 November, the PP could play a decisive role in the cities of Lérida, Tarragona and Barcelona.
After the significant increase in voting and voting in the last regional elections, the PP is already focusing its attention on Parliamentary elections - whether or not. Your expectations are more positive than those expected, because the number of votes that this party has achieved in these elections is usually double as high as those in the elections in Catalonia.
Thus, the Catalan People's Party received 610.473 votes in 2008 at Parliament's elections, while these figures were only 316.222 in 2006 at regional elections.
On the last Sunday, the PPC 384.091 voted.
If this growing trend - the result of the restructuring of the PSC vote and the binding of the PP elections - were to continue, the PP analysts predict that the PPC could rise from 8 to 12 Congresslors in the parliamentary elections, while CiU would also win four (she now has 10) and the PSC would lose at least 9 MEPs (from 25).
These calculations reflect the fundamental importance of Catalonia for PP and PSOE.
According to the analysis of the People's Party, the ERC would lose one of its members - now it has three - while ICV could hold or win one of its members.
However, if the electoral calendar is to be kept, the next term falls with the Community elections in May 2011. The People's Party (PP) can also be the voice on its way to prepare the socialist rule for an end, although in four provincial cities and with most of them in the city of Barcelona, one of the city's managements with the largest budget: EUR 661 million for 2011.
Both the Nationalists and the People's Party agree that the PSC will lose the cities of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Gerona, in which the Socialists cannot achieve a majority or return to their traditional allies (ERC and ICV).
According to the Republican debacle, it is not surprising that this party will lose its representation in the Barcelona Community Council, where it has to meet 5% of the votes.
However, the PP recorded an increase in its voting share in the four provincial capitals and could become a decisive force in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona.
Nationalists are convinced that they can play the main roles of Tarragonas around. There they had ruled before the current Mayor, Joseph Félix Ballesteros, together with the PP.
An Lérida is only 500 votes behind the PSC. The Mayor, Angel Ross, maintains good relations with Mariano Rajoy - during the last election campaign they met several times.
In other important places, such as Badalona, Castelldefels or Reus, the People's Party was able to record a significant increase.
At present, the PP is represented in 34 city administrations of Catalonia and seeks to establish lists in as many places as possible.
The Catalan cell worried Al Qaida thousands of passengers
In addition to the seven arrests in Barcelona there were three more in Thailand
The seven of the police officers of the Barcelonas police station, arrested by Pakistani and Nigerians, formed the Dshihadist cells controlled by Thailand, the different Al Qaida groups, including the "Move to Free Tamil Eelam" (LTTE) and "Laschkar e-Taiba" (Lett) - the last author of the bombing, which claimed 106 deaths in 2008.
The Spanish Interior Minister points out that these investigations are of such great importance that it goes so far as to ensure that with the "Operation Campaign" the falsification device Al Qaidas has become "weak" and "with their ability to act".
Researchers believe that in the two years in which the cell was active in Catalonia, thousands of pessimists were sent to Thailand, where they were lied and then to groups from which the criminal galaxy Al Qaida was composed, so that their "fighter" could cross the borders of European and other Western countries without penalty.
The discovered cell is not the only one of the dshihadist network that was active in Europe, so besides the Thai research agencies, other European police units have also been involved in research. It is not to be excluded that similar warnings will come in the EU's area in the coming days, such as those carried out in Barcelona last Tuesday.
In coordination with this operation (Pakistan Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammed Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arsad and the Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade) was another one in Thailand where Pakistaner Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan Ehsan Butt were arrested as well as the Thai Sirikanlaya Kijbumung.
They were led by Bangkok from the cells that were released in Spain and other European countries.
The Catalan network - part of which was launched in 2009 - steel, in particular tourists passe according to the standards of the so-called "International Islamic Front".
This means that the documents were issued on behalf of men from 25 to 45 years of age and had to be valid for several years; they were not allowed to display a sample.
In research circles, it is stressed that so far there have not been any links between those established in Catalonia and the alert in Bombay, although the author of this alert was "Laschkar e-Taiba", one of the group of recipients who were stolen from Spain and from Thailand.
Nevertheless, it should be recalled that a few days before the arrival of Catholics from a cash transfer company, several thousand dollars had been sent, which were "invested" in the purchase of prepaid mobile phone cards, which were later used by members of the "command", which were prepared for the life of 106 people.
The police have seized extensive documentation.
PP requires Mas to cancel the tax agreement
The President of the PPC, Alicia Sánchez-Camacho, took the opportunity yesterday to present their terms and conditions in person to support his office as President of the Generality. These are not different from those already presented during the election conflict and are able to combine with the priority of economic reunification and the absence of regionalist independence agreements, such as a financial equality agreement which the regionalist leader wishes to propose at the top of his mandate.
The President of the Catalan People's Party turned to Artur Mas, who granted her the 18 votes that she had won on the last Sunday - a figure that is more than enough to feel unprovoked. Because the candidate from the civil-regionalist party CiU is indicated that at least one of the opposition parties is included in the vote when voting.
The future alliances that the regionalists want to join in the upcoming parliamentary elections at the Congress are dependent on a possible agreement with the PP. However, the discussions that Mass is taking place with the rest of the parties are about Catholics.
As regards the PPC's president, he calls for the support of the Bureau's "all discussions concerning the sovereignty and independence of the Catholic Church" and an agreement on the financial balance between the state and the autonomous region - as in the Netherlands - and even the head of the CiU Party.
Both political leaders agree that they will make the built-in political equipment of regional administration easier and will want to eliminate inheritance and gift taxes.
With the details of the negotiations for the office of Mass, the PPC Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat deal with them.
Mas has already met Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - who has announced a strong opposition - and Joan Herrera (ICV). Today he will meet with Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Albert Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidaritat Catalana).
The old management company confirms that the deaths are not returned to 'missive measures'
The owners of the old house in Olot do not conclude that her nurse killed over 11 older people
yesterday, the officials of the La Caritat nursing home in Olot (Gerona) gave a press conference in which they revealed the damage to the criminal acts of Joan Vila Dilmés - the carer who had killed at least 11 old people for which he had been responsible - the institution.
Joan Sala, the director of the nursing home, joined his lawyer, Joan Cañada, before the court and announced, "La Caritat wants to accuse the responsible (for the deaths)", but "the right and our duty force us to accept the process and civil liability".
The institution must not only take a social loss of sight because it did not determine the criminal acts of the prosecutor at the time, but also now pay a high amount of damage that is calculated by the legal representatives of the victims' families.
Joan Vila Dilmé believed that the first crime was returned in August 2009 and that he had been murdered since then.
The judge ordered the exhumation of eight bodies - former patients of the nursing home - since he suspected that no doctor had personally investigated the dead, but the formalities were developed by telephone because of their age and disease.
The director of La Caritat destroyed this point and said that "resisting measures could never have been the reason for the events."
La Caritat's lawyer added that "there is no indication in the legal dispute of the conduct of another person other than the accused."
The former "deadfold" baptism was preceded by 11 murders and declared the first crime on 29 August 2009 and one and a half months later to have killed the second old lady.
In this case, he died with an overdose of insulin, in contrast to the first offence, in which he had used a mixture of various remedies.
The director of La Caritat explained that the staff's access to the medicines is only difficult to control.
The insulin syringes and oral cocktails were added by the nurse to six of the nine committed crimes in order to relieve the patients of their suffering.
But the results of laboratory tests will be revealed whether Vila lied and actually chose a less brutal death for his first victim, or whether he burned it from inside by spreading lies about them, as he had done in the case of three women who were murdered between 12 and 17 October.
In La Caritat there is no belief in the statements of the prosecutor, not even in relation to the number of murders that could be much more. This setting is justified by the fact that Vila had made very different statements before the court and that it does not make any sense to change its precedent after eight successful murders.
They say that they stood out on this basis and to clarify the scope of these cases of justice.
European Central Bank (ECB)
The investors reacted yesterday to the criticism of the President of the ECB Trichet, who warned that "markets should not underestimate our reaction potential."
The risk estimates of the euro Peripheral countries have increased dramatically and the European banks' shares have increased by more than 5%.
At the same time, we should not underestimate the possibility of the ECB being able to cover itself and the euro has almost turned to points of concern.
The events of yesterday are typical of an illegal market, which is in the extent to which it is recommitted, however, due to the conclusion of short and high speculative positions.
The institutional employer will not be able to lose his fear for a long time.
Today, a month ago, the European Central Bank called on us to reverse our liquidity measures, so the ECB needs to make a return on the next four times in two years and probably several times in the future.
The Bundesbank requested the closure of the plan for the purchase of State debt, as it was ineffective, and the abolition of all exceptionally timed liquidity measures. It should be maintained only one week’s timeless access.
After the Irish crisis, we expect the current liquidity measures to be extended "at least until March" and the four-year allocations with unlimited access to the quarterend to ensure liquidity until at least June.
We also expect the programme to continue to purchase obligations and to issue a strong signal.
If the expectations created are not met, the excellent reaction of the markets will be repeated yesterday, and if we are forced to take back our liquidity measures, only God can help us!
As at the ECB's May meeting, in which the Bank confirmed that it did not take into account the purchase of State debt securities and that the markets could be brought together, this story could be repeated tomorrow.
The ECB must be credible and necessary.
In May she showed the teeth, and on Wednesday she said that she had already bought a lot of money by causing a new collapse in the market.
Yesterday, the auction of one year's government titles in Portugal was quite weak.
The government had only 500 million to 5.28%, compared to 750 million to 4.81% in the previous auction.
However, the interest rates in Portugal fall at 30 basic points throughout the curve and reflect a marked change in the markets following the words Trichets.
In Ireland the accounts of Allied and Bank of Ireland were published.
The sum is estimated at around 10 000 million short-term and possibly 15 000 more. There is time until February to create private capital or these banks will be discovered.
Although Ireland has lost its credibility completely after it did not know the problem with the stress test in July, the numbers within the rescue plan are acceptable and help to reduce uncertainty.
However, on the next Tuesday, the Government must have Parliamentary consent to its new budget plan, since it still does not have sufficient support, Ireland is still a source of uncertainty.
Angela Merkel made her speech on the summit of the Heads of State and Government on 14 December. There a political unit was asked to show that we play the same party together.
The problem is that Germany wants to play Wagner and the other countries are the ninth Sinfonie Beethovens.
The Spanish President proposed yesterday the plan of action to be adopted by the Council of Ministers on Friday.
Retirement reform, transparency in autonomous regions such as financial institutions, building public deficits, liberalisation, privatisation and labour creation measures. Measures that sound in the ears of investors such as Vivaldis four years.
The double effect of Zapatero and Trichet explains why the Spanish beer has increased by 4.5 per cent, doubles as much as the rest of the European beer.
Compared to February, the reaction of the government and the Spanish central bank was fast and convincing, and we benefit from the surprise effect.
Today there is a substantial auction of a three-year government branch that will draw benefits from the Trichet effect. Therefore, we put on a strong demand that will eliminate all doubts about our debt capacity.
For Spain, applying for an aid plan would be a self-sustainment.
We would get liquidity that we don't need. The estimate has 40 billion euros available, three times as much as in March. The interest rates are too expensive and access to the markets would be closed without delay.
Nevertheless, our strategy should be consistent with the Motto César's wife: "Now it is not only the being but also the shadow."
Don't worry, we're gonna make it!
The President of Eulen closes the company meeting of Vega Sicily at the request of his child
The storm in the open conflict of the family Álvarez, owner of the companies Eulen and El Enebro, does not cease.
David Álvarez, founder of the company company, will be hosted by El Enebro's company assembly, which will be held at the request of five of his seven children at the age of 16, because he considers them "absolutely worthless". His children will try to get a majority to control the company's administrative bodies - owner of the Weinguts Bodegas Vega Sicily.
David Álvarez and his children, David and María José, prepare the legal measures for a new chapter of justice in their fight to control a part of the group.
The founder of the largest holding for business services does not appear to be ready in his legal struggle to monitor the control of El Enebro's organs.
He was expelled from the Board of Directors from five of his seven children, who were appointed to members of the Board of Directors at the shareholders' meeting on 18 January of this year, which is already in the Chamber of Commerce.
The company assembly of El Enebro, which was convened by the judge of the Chamber of Commerce No. 2 of Madrid for the 16th, has solved a new hit in the stock of the family Álvarez.
The call of the Director for the holding of the assembly is the only legal way to ensure the inclusion of the assembly.
The last strategy by Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilio, Marta y Elvira Álvarez Mezquiriz will be described by David Álvarez as a "disquieted means of the applicant - his five children - in order to be recognized by means of legal excellence, fraud and abuse of law by means of the undeclared assembly of 18 January," as official speakers explain.
This argument is the basis for the conclusion of the next meeting to explain it as "absolutely unnecessary".
The same protagonists who wander in discrete villages have already tried to bring about a meeting in June.
At El Enebro - property company and owner of Bodegas Vega Sicily, in addition to other assets - David Álvarez's seven children control 100 percent of the capital.
However, according to family protocols, the founder of the service group is demanding the right to use more than 51% of the capital.
This is the actual background of the case which the judge has to decide in the hearing on the proceedings for which no date has been established.
Red Bull wins in the F1 with a secret weapon of Siemens
Cars are improved with a software in real time.
Since the entry of Red Bull 2004 into the world of formula 1, her story has been recorded in this read universe of speed of surprises and successes.
At first no one gave the Newing Attention and despite its steadily rising momentum during the last season, everyone at the end of November on the victory of Ferraris by Fernando Alonso.
Without the ability of German pilots and world master Sebastian Vettel or the power of Renault's engine, the "secret weapon" that the many Siemens Red Bull put in their hands, and thus created a winning team, became a legend.
In fact, it is a powerful software for the simulation of processes for the 2007 German company that did not have to do with autorents.
This computer software called PLM was used to develop Montegatettes in factories around the world, energy works and high-quality instruments.
A reliable reproduction or simulation of a product or process is intended before it is actually built to avoid such errors and excessive costs.
PLM has facilitated the development of Canon cameras, Sukhoi planes and Nissan's most popular use vehicles.
Sigfried Russwurm, Head of Siemens' Industry Division, explains that with the use of this software in formula 1 - Factory Red Bull "in a few hours, almost in real time" the changes and improvements that can be determined on the races and at the tests can be designed and implemented.
Russwurm points out that in 1992 there were averages of 10 technicians who were able to introduce a maximum of three or four improvements in a season.
In the Red Bulls team today, 180 high-quality young people are employed. With powerful ETV facilities they conduct analysis and all possible changes in racing cars.
The Siemens Manager explained that the PLM software is capable of analysing and improving all components of Red Bull's racing cars, with the exception of the engine which is responsible for exclusively Renault.
The materials, the fuel, the aerodynamics and the safety elements are changed.
The changes can be transferred to reality by means of progressive production facilities and hightech autosaving within less than 24 hours from the virtual reality of the simulator.
The only limit set by this crazy technical perfectionism is the $40 million that can be issued by a Formula 1 team for its awards in one season.
Red Bull has built his high-tech factory for the development and production of his racing car in a 50 km away from London.
It is about two buildings in which visitors - especially journalists - are very limited.
All that's going on there is Top Secret.
The crew includes 580 persons, including the two pilots, the world master Vettel and Mark Webber.
But Red Bulls is real formula 1 - Held is undoubtedly the newest world master Sebastian Vetell.
Other protagonists are hiding behind the enormous technological resources that the energy-drink manufacturer puts into the service of its participation in the race, whose support is invaluable and their knowledge is zero.
The technical head of the work, Steve Nevey, stressed that five years ago it was possible to say that progress in the field of F&E for racing cars contributed by 50% to victory and the pilots were responsible for the rest.
Today, the share values have changed. Technology is 85 percent of success, while the pilot contribution is estimated at 15 percent.
Nevey acknowledges that Vettel and Webber can never be replaced by ETV because they are "not expected gladiators".
HP will open its own rooms in two years with local distributors
Hewlett Packard (HP) announced his first exclusive cargo in collaboration with his partner Ront Reyes last night in Barcelona.
It is the first of twenty business sales networks with 80 to 100 square metres each, which is intended to open the Multi in Spain in the next two years.
The company agrees with the existing 16 sales areas in the multi-market operation, such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte Inglés.
For example, the Vice-President of HP Spain, Helena Herrero, named the built-in cargo at the Gran Vía in Barcelona, owned by Pont Reyes, who has worked with HP for thirty years.
The North American company group intends to set up 200 sales stations in Europe by 2010, of which 20 discounts in Spain.
The first were admitted last week to Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia). Barcelona is the third business.
Mr Herrera did not want to mention the next openings, but did not conclude that Madrid could be the next target.
The Vice-President, who is also the leader of HP Staff Systems, ensured that the philosophy for opening up is always the same. They support a local salesman with experience and industry knowledge.
The North American company group offers this advice and takes over the exclusive loading equipment (with interactive products for handling) and looks like all the countries in Europe.
In addition, HP is responsible for training the loading staff.
Helena Herrero said it was not about a Franchising system and stressed that with the exclusive sales site, "the customer service and advice of small and medium-sized enterprises in the purchase and then even optimise the packaging."
The loading in Barcelona has a pioneer pilot program that solves the technical problems of the HP devices with guarantee.
An online service builds a connection to the technical centre in Maastricht (Holland).
"In this way we can solve problems in ten minutes which sometimes take up to two days."
"This system has been developed especially for small and small companies as well as private customers because large companies have already entered into their service contracts for technical customer service," said Helena Herro yesterday.
Sababall wants his rivals in three years a million customers 'clown'
The executive member of Banco Sabadell, Jaime Guardiola, is more optimistic than any other manager. He believes that 2001 will be a hard year for the banks, but at first it will challenge a new liquidity crisis and predict the end of the debt war.
However, it foresees an increase in interest rates to try to balance banks with increases in fees and prices for loans.
Sababall is expecting to capture in three years a million private customers - a new profession.
Sababall has found the way out for the next three years and thus survive in a very complicated economic environment.
The Bank will introduce a new three-year management plan in 2011.
The objective is not only to survive without public aid from the FROB in demand but also to increase the market share of one million private customers - 700 000 if you withdraw the customers that will lose the bank. This is the major challenge facing this bank, since it has so far given more attention to its customers than its private customers.
In this year it has access to 250 000 private customers and 50,000 companies.
Your market share in private customers is 3.5 per cent, while business customers are more than 10 per cent.
A further principle of the business plan 2011-2013 is the increase in productivity, achievability, cost reduction. The challenges facing the bank will be presented together with the annual report.
Only a few banks used to set and publish targets in these difficult times, as all the banks' plans are interconnected by the financial crisis.
Sababall will conclude its guide plan four years ago. This was originally issued for three years, but as a result of the market situation, it was extended to a business year.
The customers who leave the savings are the main target of the bank.
At a breakfast organized by the APIE Guardiola, 2011, a "hard" year would be "with great wealth".
The manager is leaving, Spain comes out only "long" from the crisis.
In addition, it would be "very difficult" in two or three years "to create work" - essential for the survival of banks.
Even if it appears that the war on Passiva - which will punish the interest margins - will be abolished, the risk charges that banks and savings will have to pay for their emissions for liquidity will have to be reimbursed as a result of rapid profits already at the price of credit.
"The issues of liquidity and financing are of a structural nature and they will exercise pressure on credit."
"We didn't drive the hahn, but the interest differentials are very high," said Guardiola.
Banesto had already issued the order on Thursday at her branch network to limit the grant of long-term loans and increase interest differences (see Cinco Días of 22 and 27 November).
The manager also agreed that the banks were currently pursuing the Statute to "increase the fees", but "under a competitive framework " .
Sababall's lead plan is based on organic growth, even if the group, as always, does not exclude corporate business.
He does not, however, ensure that "more companies are needed in Spain."
"The next year everything will change," he says.
He points out that the need for capital is currently "absolutely rising" and does not exclude some Spanish financial institutions from breaking up in red numbers.
He is of the opinion that FROB can replace the money market with capital savings.
After ensuring that Sababell can also survive a temporary closure of the markets, he reinforces the argument of a banker who has already predicted a new liquidity crisis.
He stressed that there could be nothing going on, but in contrast to the events in June, short-term financing on job could be achieved and the crisis could be eliminated.
CECA excludes a second fusion shell of the Sparks
The Director-General of the ECSC, José Antonio Olavarrieta, bought yesterday the possibility that it could come to a merger of the Sparks and stressed the speed with which the industry would be restructured.
When the concentration process of the Spanish Sparks began, several Sparks were not involved in the first phase. They were in front of the second round.
However, the Director-General of the Spanish Sparkassen Association (CECA), José Antonio Olavarrieta, assured that this second round would not take place.
"I believe that most of the mergers have been completed. The involvement of Cajasol in the Banca Cívica group cannot be considered as a second round, it was much more about adaptations."
"The main part is completed. It may be that we have, instead of seventeen or fourteen, all the important processes are already completed. They have been controlled by Banco de España, which has been strongly supported by all the processes."
At a breakfast organised by the business manager and manager of Aragonia (ADEA), Olavarrieta pointed out that the concentration process "was completed as soon as possible and that we must be satisfied with the time-limited run, which was not now established within the framework of the business plans with Banco de España", he stressed.
"The transition of 45 savings with an average of 28,000 million assets to 17 with 75 500 million is a historically uncomparable process. The number of financial institutions has been reduced by 62% and they are now much larger than we have reached the Basel Agreement," he said.
Olavarrieta stated that "there are a number of unexploded opinions about the length of the process, the seriousness and inconsistencies", because "Banco de España reminds us to close before the end of the year."
The Director-General of the ECSC, José Antonio Olavarrieta, assured yesterday that Spain had one of the most rigorous funding systems in Europe and "maybe" around the world and added that those who doubt this "without any further knowledge".
The manager noted that in the current economic communiqué, we must make "no concern" about the situation of financial institutions and savings that have passed through a "very significant" concentration process which will be completed "as soon as possible".
He also recalled that the Spanish banks had very good records of the stress tests carried out by the ECB in July.
Zapatero and the red line Germany
Berlin has decided to maintain the euro, but at the same time set conditions for the entire European Union.
The market tensions have solved a double response from the government.
On the other hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero has introduced new adaptation measures, beginning with tax assessments for small and small enterprises, regulation of temporary companies or suspension of EUR 426 aid for unemployed persons, which does not concern unemployment, until the privatization of 49 per cent of AENA, the administration of airports Barajas and El Prat and 30 per cent of State Lotteries.
On the other hand, the Deputy Head of Government, Elena Salgado, is supporting the criticism of Chancellor Angela Merkel as responsible for the current crisis.
How are these processes understood?
It was assumed that the position of Merkel is not a mistake in its public work.
On the contrary, it is a new round in the difficult process of redefining the euro.
In this regard, Germany is adopting a fundamental new perspective on the design of our future, which coincides with the maintenance of traditional traditions of a large part of its partner.
In view of the opposition in Europe, three possible ways of speculating from the crisis are being explored in Germany.
First: A stronger euro with Germany, Austria, the Netherlands and other countries had to leave the euro area in the south.
The second: The re-introduction of German Mark - although it is currently known as Science Fiction - is supported by a large part of the public opinion, about 50 percent of the population.
Thirdly, the euro is being redesigned according to German proposals. This means more macro-economic control; strict budget management; punishment of countries that are in breach of the standards; possible payment of certain countries and the extension of the costs of potential adaptation measures to the private sector.
The German position is clear and has been drawing off for a while. That is why there is no excuse now.
Firstly, both the IMF and the European Commission have created incentives for deficits and the German Government has launched a constitutional reform to prevent this from happening since 2016.
This was the first sign of austerity between what Germany considered necessary (strong tax plans and stable public finances) and the practices of its European partners, including France.
The second sign placed the Central European country as a mark on the decision to save Greece.
This was strongly criticized at the time, but the fact is that the political consensus in Germany, the public and the public opinion, was absolutely opposed to Greece's salvation.
Finally, in the last few days of October, Markel comes out to New with a clear position. It calls for a reform of the European Union's agreement to enable the rescue of a country and at the same time obliges private lenders to bear part of the costs.
This position was defined as an anti-European because it preceded the Irish crisis and all the following.
In the next few months, we will participate in the reform of the European Union, which will allow these measures to take place since 2013.
Germany has drawn a red line that does not think too much of it.
It says to all that - even if unfavourable measures are to be taken now - it will no longer be given the old way of operation of the euro.
2013 will be the year of the birth of a new currency space in which the opposing countries are severely punished to force them to declare themselves eligible for payment and in this case the private sector must take part in the cost.
Germany shows us that we need to cover a high growth rate, with high savings and investment rates, reducing consumption, improving productivity and competitiveness as well as positive external economic balances.
The other options based on debt and construction with huge gaps in the balance of payments, as they were introduced by Spain in tree times, will simply not be taken.
The offer is clear.
And we would do worse if we didn't understand it.
It is not only due to lowering the state deficit by three per cent by 2013.
The requirements are much harder.
And the worst thing we could do under these conditions is to betray ourselves.
I hope that the current turbulence will become more peaceful.
And that we will take advantage of the opportunities offered to us by the spring of 2013.
It seems that Zapatero has understood this as well, and his dual announcement (the promised reforms after discussion with major companies last Saturday and the announcement of new measures yesterday) indicates that despite the criticism of Merkel, he has created the hypothesis, order in his own house, prepared his way.
But the red line drawn from Germany is there, and it doesn't look like something would change.
In view of the possibilities we have to leave the euro area completely closed with a few serious countries.
In this case Germany could still tell us that it warned us.
Sports and regular recreation
Tricks such as those of Alonso and Ramos in the game against the Ajax show an inventive spirit, but not the will to take a penalty.
The release of two real Madrid players (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) in the game on 23 November against Ajax in the League's Championships led to the failure of many minds to do so whether or not it was a sport or not and whether both players should be penalized by the UEFA.
As is commonly known, the two players lost a few minutes before playing (their team had already won clearly) time and played several volumes so that the judge showed them the second yellow card.
In this way, and since the Real Madrid group would lead its group, the two players will meet the prescribed penalty at the next league game against the Auxerre and thus enter the next stage without cards.
Finally, the UEFA Disciplinary Committee punished the coach of the Club, José Mourinho, with two games and the players involved with different amounts of money.
The provocation of a yellow card under such or similar circumstances is not a new practice, it is more common in the world of football.
It is so widespread that it is part of the Ethos - the unwritten but in this form of sport -.
Part of the debate on the case presented is that a team of the football club Real Madrid (who in his Hymne Edelmut and Ehre and at other times punished his players for similar events) played the main role in this, and on the dramaization by Mourinho, which has added an episode to his long history as a theatre and professional technician.
In any case, the debate is about whether these behaviours are contrary to the principles of sport explicitly prohibited by the Statutes, namely whether these actions are a regular approach. In fact, these practices are related to the Statutes of the Sport, but they seem to have their meaning in mind.
In this regard, the damage caused by the sport spirit should be examined.
The sports spirit protects the physical integrity of the opponents, a aspect that was not threatened by these actions, because it was not an aggressive game.
Another aspect of a clean game is to avoid that counter-trading players derive an unfair advantage from the team. Nor did that happen.
The paradox of the behavior of real Madrid players is that they do not correspond to what we normally understand under false game or rule, because the environment of the rule was not secretly filled to avoid a penalty, but should be as casual as possible so that they are punished by the judge.
The players waited and gladly accepted the penalty.
Another question is what kind of advantage do the opposite traders draw from the concept of foul.
It should be noted here that neither the rival was brought into a more undesirable position nor benefits for the game played, because the apparent result of this action was that the team itself had to continue playing with fewer players.
There is also no useful strategy for the next game, because the club does not then have these players.
The advantage is clearly that players start the next game phase of the Champions League without cards that could threaten their participation in a future game.
But it is a long-term, up to a certain degree of uncertain advantage, since the team could sometimes also separate. In addition, players receive a penalty in this way and go through the second card cycle, where they are separated by a card with less than one card in the first cycle.
It is not so clear whether it is really a benefit.
Finally, such approaches are not directed at the sport spirit, which includes strategic decisions to derive the greatest benefit from the rules.
In this case, the players did not want to impose any sanctions (that would actually be a clear case of irregularity), they wanted to choose better if they were to do so.
They will make a strategic decision without any punishment or flight before them.
Although the gap between return and regularity is confused, I believe that this is a clear case of recovery.
I have the impression that the polemics have been created by two factors: because there have been two self-expressions and because of the type of regulatory transmission that has been carried out.
The damage added to the principles of sport by these actions is less ethical than much more aesthetic.
Offered for customer reception for groups of night stay in Barcelona
This year, the dictatorship of the calendar allows a fee of reservations to fall on 16 and 17 December.
The holidays paid by employees themselves are spread out. They do not want to spend more than 20 to 30 euros.
Like the Turón and the Christmas lotteries, there are also group evenings that lead to the Barcelona hospitality and leisure entertainment industry. However, due to the economic crisis, they issue a price-frequency solution to capture the customer segment that represents the large mass: almost everyone wants to spend between 20 and 30 euros for a lunch or dinner, confirming the companies concerned and the associations.
In order to make the booking even a little more complicated, the calendar (Silvester falls on a Friday) has made all orders fall on the week of December 13, with the result of a lawine of reservations of evenings on two top days (the 16th and 17) and almost no orders on the week before.
Since 2008, when the bad times began, many companies have set up the group budgets for budgetary reasons.
In order not to have to borrow on this tradition, many employees pay these from their own pockets.
As is always the case, low prices are required, confirmed by the president of the Barcelona hospitality agency, Gaietà Farrás.
The representative of the roof band is still not predicting how the holiday will be viewed in this month.
"People pass it 'tig time before they book it."
"They want to go out, but they pay attention to the prices," he says.
The business will go well with "the quality of good prices with a good service", it adds, and calls on us to remember that customers save in times of crisis, why prices are asked for EUR 25 at the highest.
In a survey in various central restaurants, it appears that the supplier leads to the collapsing on the evening of 17 December.
The Soteras Group says that the requests for this Friday would be issued with a view to spending less than 30 euros. The group has adapted its menus with full offers between 25 and 35 euros to the conjunctural setting.
In another leading group, Andilana, which holds 16 guests in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Funda and others), has conducted the proposed reservations to the calendar, even since the beginning of November.
"We have made it impossible to maintain the previous year's prices with menus for each taste from 1995 to 30 euros," he explains.
In AN group, which leads El Mussol, Attic, QuQu and 23 locals as a whole, you do not lose optimism after the second quarter of the year, and good if you are faced with focused views of the Christmas business for a few days.
The company's sources suggest that the 18th day will also be an interactive day with friends who celebrate Christmas.
A Christmas menu for 30 euros or more has been added to the six group menu. It has been shown that customers are ready to spend 10% more than in the previous year and want more details, for example, Cava.
In some companies you also see green talk about why employees are invited to call again. This means the impression that the groups are again in motion.
Vonseten des Dachverband Fecasarm (with combinations such as Barcelona's Kneeping, Restaurant and Free Time Association), the vice-president, Enric Gomá, trusts to see the end of the tunnel and notes that the bookings are generally "lived", although the customers "exposed a maximum".
However, the fun at the festival has not returned, no one pays.
Pakistan's nuclear programme brings great concern in the United States
Islamabad puts nuclear weapons "faster than any other country here".
References by Wikileaks confirm relations between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of the correspondence between the North American message in Pakistan and the U.S. State Department, including the Internet portal Wikileaks, confirms the enormous concerns the Pakistan nuclear programme Washington provides.
On the basis of the clear and concrete details that provide documents on the content of the talks and the reflections of accredited North American diplomats in Islamabad, this implies that cooperation between the two countries in matters of nuclear safety is not strengthened but rather "taken" and that the unstable Asian country produces more atomic weapons "to a faster rhythm than any other country".
In particular the owner of the Pakistan nuclear programme - that weapons are not combined but are stored in their individual parts in order to make their destruction difficult when possible - Washington is preparing sleepless nights.
The following risks are addressed by Ambassador Anne W. Patterson, in a report before the visit of former Head of the National Security Council, James Jones: "The proximity of some nuclear facilities to the region occupied by the Taliban, the likely proliferation of nuclear material and the occurrence of the transport of nuclear material".
The large number of people involved in the nuclear arsenals and rocket programmes will be seen not only by the United States but also by Russia as an outlaw and reason to be cautious.
"Pakistan has to place strict trust in the monitoring of nuclear installations; thanks to the low education and cultural levels, extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit people working on nuclear or rocket programmes," said expert Yuri Korolev from the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs in a discussion with his North American colleagues.
New to the documentation contained by Julian Assanges Internet portal is that cooperation between the United States and Pakistan is maintained in matters of nuclear proliferation and the rise in the period in which Pakistan produces nuclear weapons.
In May an office of the message that describes communication with Pakistan as "frustory" explains: "There is often no transparency; we do not receive any answers or they are rejected on the offer."
In another communication, Peter Lavoy, an official of the State Secret Service for South Asia, confirms that "in spite of the economic disaster in Pakistan, nuclear weapons are produced as quickly as no other country."
Ambassador Patterson invites Washington during a visit by the Chief Military Leader General Ashfaq Kayani, the responsible "to clarify" that "Pakistan's army has to have its silent support for terrorist groups."
On the hunt for Wikileak's Chief
Obama appoints a high responsibility for the fight against terrorism to prevent new complications.
Interpol has a red warning to follow and find assange.
Everything connected with Wikileaks and its founder, Julian Assange, is a complicated labyrinth, in which matters are only difficult to explain.
Yesterday, Interpol issued a "rot warning" for Assange's "refuge and persecution".
However, it is not a traditional order to be adopted.
Moreover, it is not new, it comes from 20 November.
It also has nothing to do with the last impression of more than four million diplomatic documents from the United States, but with the allegations of sexual abuse that Australians have to make in Sweden.
The lawyer of the founder of Wikileaks, Mark Stephens, also assures us "the police knew where and how they could contact Mr. Assange."
On the 20th, the international police authority, sitting in Lyon (France), requested Sweden to issue the order, but it was not announced until yesterday after the receipt of the power by the Swedish authorities.
That's how things are. The 188 Interpol countries are designated to identify and find Assange "to identify and deliver it in advance."
Although Interpol cannot arrange for the arrest of an individual affected by a red warning, many Member States consider the organisation's statement to be a red alert as a free letter for arrest - which must be carried out by the national police - particularly if they have a bilateral extradition agreement, as is the case with Sweden and England where Assange is likely to be held.
The case was brought up by Assange lawyers who published a letter informing them that the 39-year-old founder of Wikileaks is ready to answer the questions of the Swedish authorities at a video conference.
They also recall that Assange has requested the travel from Sweden and is compared with the state lawyer Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, chief of security of Stalin, who received the appropriate approval.
"It's like a hunt, not like a legal persecution," is accused in writing.
While the world is looking for him - and his mother from Australia for her son's innocence - Assange stands up in an unknown place, but does not weaken.
On Monday he gave the director of the magazine Time per Skype from an indefinite place out of an interview. During the interview, he called for the return of the U.S. Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton.
"If it can be proved that it was responsible for the order of North American diplomats to spy out the UN and thus violate international agreements signed by the United States, it would have to return," he said.
His opinion was condemned yesterday by White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs, who referred to the application for return as "silent and absurd".
"I am not sure why we should value the opinion of a type with a website," he explained to the sender CNN.
Obama himself has been charged with a high responsibility for the anti-terrorism fight against terrorism, Rusell Travers, with the prevention of new documents.
The attempt by President Barack Obama's speaker to give less attention to Assange is in contrast to the views expressed by conservative politicians and commentators in these days.
Congressman Peter King, who has been taking the Chair of the National Security Committee of the House of Deputies since January, has called on the State Department to investigate the possibility of placing Wikileaks on the list of terrorist organizations "to seize their money and to follow up on those who support it or make a contribution."
Tom Flanagan, adviser to Canadian President Stephen Harper, was still on the move, and he had to reject his statement that Assange must be "killed".
"Obama had to turn him into a target ship and use an unmanned aircraft or something."
He did not blame himself, was Mike Huckabee, a Baptist minister, former Governor of Arkansas and potential presidential candidate.
"He who has always been the one who has provided information in the government is responsible for the treaty and everything that is not directed is a very mild punishment," he explained to the Messenger Fox.
Puigcercós is seeking peace in the ERC
The head of the Republican Party shall allow a secret vote on his continued presence in the office.
Huguet proposes a pluralist government and the end of the whole assembly principle.
Joan Puigcercós seems to have found a recipe to get out of the way for the last time an internal disturbance in the ranks of the 11 votes cast after the loss of 11 votes and half of the voter votes.
The president is aware that his withdrawal threat is not enough for former party leader Joseph Lluís Cardo-Rovira. But he also knows that the influence of this sector today is as weak as her mentor himself and will not protect him from the same headaches as other earlier flows.
The leader of Esquerra is therefore trying to win the new critics with an eye-browsing, which would ensure his position until the next municipal elections.
For the first time, it was announced that over 200 regional members of the ERC could be secreted in the office.
With picklists, not with your hand.
If the cardists wanted the president a list of punishments, they could do this without fear of repression.
In fact, the chief wants to avoid both the impression of columning and the impression of undercrowding under his own person.
In several interviews he confirmed that he would feel a half of the votes plus one not confirmed, and he added without adding percentage values, a result "in Bulgarian style" would not be good either.
The close friends of Cardos are demanding more from the president than only the party's office. An inadequate gesture, since Puigcercós controls the supreme body of the Congress.
But since they do not have enough majority to force returns, they will agree with the Board to a preliminary plan from now on until May.
They expect to be able to contribute to the preparation of the document on strategic humouring, which will be presented to the Council on 18 May.
Your aim is to build for Puigcercós. On the contrary, it is to promise to present the Congress in autumn 2011 what the party will already hold for a fact.
The Chair of the ERC is of the view that "polyphony" damages stability and aims to make the organization able to wash its dirty washes behind closed doors.
In this sense, the article, which was signed by the famous counselor Joseph Huguet in his blog, is symptomatic.
In view of the fact that Puigcercós is an idealist, the owner of Innovací considered it to be supported by the party president "in exchange for different objectives".
He numbered five of them in front of him.
Firstly, the "restructuring" of the Board, so that at least 90 per cent of its members are represented by the inclusion of new faces from the Cardos field.
The second could be the big news.
Huguet suggests that the ERC should finally provide the full assembly principle as a function.
In this way, he will undertake a reform of the Statutes which will allow for the continuation of the Congress with selected delegates.
From the end of the full assembly model - an exception in the Spanish party system - Puigcercós' team is already fighting for the last two congresses.
In fact, at the 2008 Joint Assembly, the implementation of the review of the principle of full assembly was carried out at a convention to be held with the reform of the Statutes.
This term is still due to the fact that the internal rest of the last few years has not been a matter of consensus.
Now, without the critical sectors on the floor, it could be time to resume this matter and conclude it forever.

In addition to him, the police found a father with a message.
China maintains its targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions
The representative of China stated at COP16 that his country had made enormous efforts to reduce carbon traces and would maintain its offer until 2020 by 40 to 45 per cent of its greenhouse gas.
China maintains its offer to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45 per cent by 2020, Su Wei, the representative of this country at COP16.
At its first public event on the 16th World Climate Summit of the United Nations (COP16), Su Wei, his country had made enormous efforts to restore carbon traces and transform its industry.
He pointed out that his country has invested 245 million dollars in the last four years to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
However, he stated that China would not change its objectives but would work with the international community in this regard.
He explained that the Chinese strategy on climate change is divided into four aspects: dialogue, capacity-building, institution-building and support for pilot programmes.
In all aspects, progress has been made, including the adoption of a new energy law in the last year, which contains the objectives for the recovery of gas emissions.
On the other hand, he stressed that in China the authorities of the United States had collaborated with those of the Central State and the Community in order to achieve the objectives of energy saving, effective energy use and emission reduction.
In addition, he pointed out that some multi-year plans have already been under attack or have been completed, both those funded by the Chinese government and those received money from other countries.
For example, he focused on the programme for the effective use of energy introduced in the last five years and had received investment from the United Nations (UNO), the government and from private hands.
It also runs a project at provincial level to climate change, a further exchange of traditional glaciers through energy savings, and a further reduction and adaptation, he explained.
Martin Krol, a scientific government adviser to climate change in this country, confirmed that China's efforts would be much more widely accepted than in common.
He pointed out that the pro-capf emissions of greenhouse gases in China amounted to six tonnes per person while it was 100 tonnes in the United States. China is responsible for a nine-percent total contribution to environmental pollution.
It also makes unprecedented progress in energy use. Energy efficiency has increased by twenty-five percent in the last five years and is expected to take place by 2020, he said.
Legal exclusion Espinos: César Nava
The national leader of the PAN stated that the former Panist Party President had the right to appeal to the National Order Commission and to demand what the right was to him.
The national leader of the PAN, César Nava Vázquez, ensured that Manuel Espino Barrientos was right and that the former PAN's president had the right to appeal to the National Order Commission and to demand what the right was to him.
In an interview conducted before the complaint conducted by Gabino Cué Monteagudos as governor of the state, he stated that the exclusion of Espinos was a decision taken at local level.
"It is an independent Commission decision in Sonora."
"Mr Espino has the right to appeal to the Commission de Orden del Council National in order to reach a decision by a competent authority," he added.
On the other hand, he stated that it would not be possible to think at the time of 2012 and that an alliance on presidential candidates had never been established in the negotiating table.
Nava Vázquez was convinced that Action National was strengthened by the internal vote on 4 and 5 December, at which his successor was elected.
"This (an alliance in 2012) is a subject that has never been on the negotiating table, at least not yet. It was a proposal for a Community election, it was successful and fulfilled its purpose," he said.
The Panist leader stated that the PAN looked back on 71 years of dialogue, so "the internal competition does not bother us; rather, "we enjoy it and it strengthens us," he commented.
He said that the Council would undoubtedly need to choose the best president or president, Action National for the next three years, and therefore he would skip the staff "to those who would be appointed by the Council."
"I am very concerned and open there. I would be proud to transfer each of the five to the office of the President."
He predicted that the rise of the party at the last elections of 4 July would be reflected in the next elections, although "it's not time to think about 2012."
"Now it is going to support Governor Gabino Cué in his mission."
In this context, he stressed that the three governments that were created from alliances between Oaxaca, Puebla and Sinaloa would bear the flags and observe throughout the country. Therefore, "many hopes and prospects are set in them and I am sure that Gabino is at the height of the requirements."
When he was questioned about the criticism of the PRI at President Felipe Calderón for his four-year course of discussion, César Nava called on the sponsors of the PRI to think about the six-year period of former President Ernesto Zedillo and Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
"If the PRI believes that the governments of Zedillo and Salinas were better than those of Fox and Calderón, they should start defending them, they should finally come out of the castle," he confirmed.
He is of the opinion that the holder of the Federal Government expresses as he could make in his speech at the National Auditorio, because there was no oral ban in this country and even less tenderness.
Obama sets himself on Twitter for the law for undocumented students
"If you are in favour of the adoption of the Dream Act - law, call your senators and insist on the adoption of this Act," the president of the United States tweeted in the popular social network.
President Barack Obama today supported the country's mobilisation to support the Dream Act - Law on the Legalization of Undocumented Students with a message on his personal blog on social Twitter.
"If you are for the adoption of the Dream Act - law, call your senators and press on the adoption of this law," Obama tweeted.
Its short-term communication includes a cyber link to a broader document which requires the public to contact their senators immediately, as the law is directly prioritised.
"With your voice that we are waiting for, the time has come to listen to you," he emphasizes.
The message was spread, after the 42 Republican senators threatened to block all votes for each law, except for the extension of tax payments from Bush's time and the financing of the government.
Such a blockade, which was announced on a letter signed by 42 Republican senators, could affect the harmony of the Dream Act and other projects such as the ratification of the new START agreement with Russia against the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
On the blockade of the Republicans of the Law Dream Act and other projects, President Robert Gibbs said he was confident that if the tax issue was resolved once, a timetable could be set for the other projects.
"I think we still have a lot of time..."
"We all agree that the tax situation must have developed over the years..."
"I think we can reach an agreement at any time and then we can plan the rest," he said.
The president of the democratic majority at the Senate, Harry Reid, announced on Tuesday that "he would ask for the vote at the conclusion of the debate" so that the Dream Act - the law with which the initiative to legislate undocumented students from the next Thursday in the Senate would be more likely next week.
The version of the Dream Act or the Act of American Dream would legalize some 800 000 young people who migrated to the United States when they were not yet sixteen years old, living in that country for the last five years and enrolled in a higher education institution or in the army.
However, the legislators need to adopt the six-voice initiative, which is why they are devoted to the votes of a full Republican. In time, the organizations of the sponsors of this project will have an intensive influence on the adoption of the Act.
The Democrats, most of whom support the Dream Act, have 58 seats.
However, one of them, Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, said he would agree and only a Republican, Richard Lugar of Indiana, announced his support for the law.
Therefore, the defenders of the Dream Act must have several Republicans on their side if other Democrats should decide to withdraw the initiative.
Most of the citizens of the Republic are those from Maine, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, as well as Senator George Lemieux from Florida, who took over the mandate of Senator Mel Martínez.
Other Republicans who in the past supported the Dream Act are Orrin Hatch from Utah and Kay Bailey Hutchinson from Texas, but they stated that they would no longer support it on another occasion.
Another Republican who had spoken out for the law, John McCain, has not yet established his attitude.
Although the House of Representatives has another version, the analysts agree that the Dream Act is in the Senate before the greatest obstacles.
With literature put the finger in the wound
The second round of 'The Lust in the Language' was a walk by which participants made themselves strong for the story
"That with the sex in the language I understand, but... The finger in the wind? What is expected of me?" asked writer Luisa Valenzuela, who should open the second round of 'Los placeres de la langua', a cycle that celebrated Spanish literature and at this occasion used the subtitles of her question (at another event the round table was dedicated to the sex in the language, she explained).
The finger in the wind... "brings us into trouble," the Argentine writer said to the audience, which was mainly composed of young people gathered at the International Book Fair in Guadalajara (FIL) to attend this moderate round table at Valenzuela, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra Montero and Luis García Montero.
Luisa Valenzuela read a text she gave to Gonzalo Celorio and then marked the shot as a great story. Luisa tells in the first person and is the protagonist who is looking for what a "wound" is, and goes from a doctor who does not receive any answer, but notes for the guidance of her story.
The infectologist trusts her: "Love is not my strength, maybe it's my victory."
In conclusion, after a frustrating approach to the traumatologists, who stole the breath in the middle of the walk and who explained that the wind was not a scientific concept, psychoanalytics include the secret: "The wind is really open, the symbolic is the snake."
The main figure of the story makes it easy and concludes that "only the wind knows that it is really open and does not exist". But it is convinced that the fun of language and its cases are mixed.
Valenzuela, the writer, played with both.
The Nicaraguan Sergio Ramírez also presented a fascinating story that he called 'blow of discovery' and in which the finger in the wild is not mentioned, but discovered.
In response to the magical realism, he tells of a famous poet who brought the clouds back to his attention, brought back to the tallest men ever lost by a girl. The story made a turnaround and reported by America, the great Roman who did not have it from the beginning to his own chroniclers, and quoted Bernal Díaz del Castillo, who criticised the influence of the stories told by the Europeans.
"Cervantes, who invited all of us (the writers) to speak, mocked the confused witnesses who rose up in the stories that were presented as true, but otherwise the story of America would never be told - with an educational force that even brought shame upon it."
However, he said, "there are the crazy and lying people who imagine things the best," and there reality and lies approach each other, where one doesn't know where the story is on, where the fictional literature reaches the peak.
He actually called it 'Tradition Cervantes'.
"We have known from him what is to be told."
When Mayra Montero was on the line, the writer commented and praised the variety of interpretations that contributed to the invitation of the file to the round table 'The Finger in the Wonder'.
The Cubans and Puerto Ricans have devoted their contribution to the great evil of social violence, which their country commands - such as Latin America - as a result of the fight against drug trafficking.
"I believe that good literature, good poetry, good songs contain a silent, unplanned commitment," she said after she stressed that literature is communication and linkage that builds up between the author and the readers as in a "chemical reaction".
The evening was decided by the Spanish poet Luis García Montero, whose contribution was also "this finger of the writer engaged in the work of the writer".
He noted that in a fast-paced world, intellectual habits and control of consciousness are also passed on to dogmatism, and is forgotten that "that behind every confirmation there is a small noun and behind every denial there is a small yes."
"To be in possession of our thoughts and reality, we must quote: And nuances often mean to put the finger into the stomach and to punish those who feel much better when they think in the form of caricatures, black and white, in pre-formed ideas without nuances, and also the powers that prefer it to divide the world into black and white, he noticed and liked to repeat the meaning of the writing.
Romano fought for his first title
Rubén Omar Romano looks back on three scores in final games, he has experienced ups and downs in his career, but three times he played decisive games.
In the duel between Santos Laguna and Monterey at the end of the game, two different styles are faced by their respective trainers, and the opposite is reflected in the results.
Rubén Omar Romano looks back on three scores in final games, he has experienced ups and downs in his career, but three times he has had decisive games, and so far he has been well behaved, why this opportunity is of particular importance to him.
The Argentinian has raised himself with the medal to the second champion, he has been a step behind the winners and has miraculously played together with the same team.
The Santistic strategist achieved the first final game as a trainer at 'Torneo Apertura 2002', as del Morelia had the wheel in his hand, with which he experienced a great defeat against Toluca with 4-2; later, at the 'Clausura 2003' he achieved the decisive duel, which he lost with 3-1 against Rayados.
With Santos Laguna on the 'Torneo Bicentenario 2010' where they played against Los Diablos, Rubén had to hide again a backlash, since the game with 2-2 against Los Choriceros after 210 minutes of playing, but at the Elfmeter he came forward with 3-1 and reached two possibilities to record his title, but lastly three of his players ordered the eleven steps and the game turned to a 4-3.
Rubén had already lost two final games with the devil Rojos and one with Monterey, his great rival. Therefore, he does not want to be persecuted once again by the accident and free himself from the evil poet to celebrate a title for the first time, although he affirms that the game is the most important for him.
"I want to become a champion, I don't want to break any statistics, which is for a club, for my pleasure, which I dedicate to, and therefore the title will come to me, but what happens before is the most important thing," commented the taxman when he was asked about the lost games.
The last final game is still very strong in his mind, he's sure to have learned a lot from it: "The only lesson we can draw from is that until the judge doesn't finish the end, we can't celebrate, we're on the line, too, because the players were already ready to separate with two elephants, and I think that this is a lesson until the game is over, there's no reason to celebrate."
To know that this series could be decided by Elfmeter shots, does not reassure him, for he trusts his players: "You never want to get to the Elfmeter shooting, you want to finish in the regular game time, but sometimes there is no alternative and you have to be prepared for it, in the previous tournament we were prepared, but unfortunately the delivery room prepared us a bad game, sometimes due to nervousness or the strong desire to keep the title in our hands, which left us something for this game, and we hope this time it will not come to that."
It is in Romanso Power to be no longer just a second champion and to spend the first time on the rest that brings the title with it.
The United States changes the rules for receiving a visa
The persons must present themselves before their conversation at the Consulate at the service point for visa application; costs are thus reduced.
Since 10 January 2011, the procedures for applying for a visa in the United States message and in the Consulates shall be amended.
In the new procedure, most applicants must be represented before their conversation in the Consulate at the visa application service points (ASC, the original letters in English).
The staff of the ASC shall take into account the biometric data of the applicant which will be checked by the Consulate before the conversation.
The new procedure has certain advantages for the aspirants, including:
The total costs for the resolution of the visa are reduced because it is no longer necessary to pay separately the language of the deadline, the processing of the visa application and the transport service to which the document is delivered.
The applicant shall provide only one payment covering the three services.
The current price remains unchanged: the present value of 140 dollars for a tourist visa, 150 dollars for Visa with an application (including visa for journalists) and 390 dollars for hands and investors.
Those who just want to extend their visa do not have to speak in the Consulate, they only have to present themselves at the next ASC where they present their documents and their fingerprints are taken.
As biometric data are stored in the ASC, applicants who need a second term for the conversation in the Consulate remain there less time than before.
Those applying for visa in the Consulates of Ciudad Juárez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo must no longer pay the 26-dollar service fee.

NASA preaches the Fund for Foreign Life
The North American Space Agency introduced a press conference to propose tomorrow a fund that will have an impact on the search for living things in all.
The National Air and Space Authority (NASA) of the United States is present tomorrow, Thursday, with an astrobiological discovery that could confirm the theory of the existence of alien life.
The Fund will be presented at a press conference in NASA in Washington tomorrow at 1 p.m. by experts of astronomy. This is a science that examines the origin, development, distribution and future of life in the universe.
When the press conference was launched, NASA will present "an eye-browsing fund for the search for foreign life", which will solve speculations in experts from other countries.
The discovery could be based on the theory that it can exist in hostile environments that were so far considered impossible for human creatures. It was called the hypothesis that they could change into intelligent beings - such as humans - if their living conditions improved.
Apparently it is a microbe found on the ground of the Mono Lake in Yosemite National Park, California. It lives there in an environment that has been considered toxic for all memorable forms of life, since the sea is highly arsenic.
In some ways, the microbe uses the medicine as a resource for survival. Given this ability, the chances are increased that other planets that do not have our protective atmosphere could give a similar life.
If these organisms change their genes, it has been shown by astronomers that "there is actually another form of life, a second form of life that differs from what we know."
At the press conference on Thursday morning, the space agency will be aware of the actual wealth of its funds.
At the conference, geobiologist Pamela Conrad participated in studying the possibility of life on Mars, and biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists who studied Titan (the largest moon Saturns) under the question of whether its chemical composition resembles the earth.
Gesta PRD, PT, Convergencia and Patrón form an opposition block
With the reform of the Congress's rules of procedure, the double-party system will be introduced and they will regret it.
The 60th legislative period had just begun, and an opposition block was already installed by the PRD, PT, Convergencia and Jesús Manuel Patron Montalvo, who represented themselves as independent. The following four raised the question: the introduction of the 'Two-party system' into the room.
Before the introduction of the 60th legislative period, Felipe Manzanez Rodríguez of Convergencia, Ezequiel Reynsoso Esparza of the PT, Javier Corvera Quevedo of the PRD and Patrón Montalvo opposed the reform of the constitution, as they would thus be excluded.
With this reform, she repeated, it would introduce a 'bilateral system' because now there would be two persons, the same number as the parties that controlled the Congress.
These four MEPs, together with Gloria Margarita Santos Aguilar, coordinator of the PRD, were the only ones who voted against the presidency appointed by Pope Salvador López Brito and Luis Antonio Cárdenas Fonseca in its capacity as Vice-President.
Corvera Quevedo stated that the PRI and PAN parties had institutionally introduced their political approach with these reforms.
He pointed out that in the next few days they would speak with the representatives of PAN and PRI to change the scheme. They went out of their political will and, if they did not, they would be informed again by both parties, which would put an end to the opposition coalition.
"To this end I (the opposition coalition), which is what I see, because we will be excluded from all decisions which do not even take into account the opinion of the others."
Felipe Manzanez Rodríguez of Convergencia stated that there would be agreements with PRD, PT and Patron and that a pluralist group would therefore be formed.
It can't be allowed, he continued that after he was monopolistic, Congress should now be "duopolistic".
"It is not the spirit of the legislative reform that will rule an everlasting double-party system in Congress."
"For the first time, this group starts with five MEPs and they speak with other colleagues and colleagues in order to become more," said the Convergencia Member.
Ezequiel Reynsoso Esparza from the PT showed on PAN and PRI that the Congress has now turned into a 'butte' for two.
"In the past it was just a party, now they share this together to the second."
Mr Montalvo asked the honourable Members to respect and assign them their place in the negotiations.
"Five decisions must not be made on the basis of top-level decisions which are likely to be nine votes outside. The five which are currently seen as being divided into different groups have decided to unite in order to enter our place at the negotiating table, because because it is reform that has been carried out and expanded by the others, we remain outside and we are not in agreement with this reform."
200,000 peso more for "the supplier"
The city administration of Mazatlán pays another check on the contested owner of the company for electricity.
A further check of more than 200,000 peso in favour of Lorena Guadalupe Camacho Palazuelos was issued by the city administration.
The amount paid to the owner of the company for electricity in the second half of the year is 1,200 000 pesos.
According to the page for more transparency of the city administration, this check was issued on an amount of 200,144,56 peso with number 9258447 last November 16th with the use of the "Open Accounts Debt".
Dear Minister Luis Miguel López Moreno had already announced that more money would be available from the community to this supplier. She will be watched by the Auditoría Superior del Etado because she sells too high prices.
What has not been mentioned is the total sum that you still owe and hence the number of checks that are still being issued by Camacho Palazuelos.
"It wasn't bought with you, it's just paying the debts, just like the other suppliers," he said in an interview.
The last check "baptised" in the last quarter of the year "again" : 24 September, two of 15 October, 19 October, 29 October and this last of 16 November.
Although the supplier has not yet been published in the Official Journal, as required by law, if an ASE company is asked to prevent other administrations from applying for their services, the Registrar assured that their services would not be re-indicted.
After the Noroeste newspaper published the examination of the checks issued by the city administration to its suppliers on 25 July, it was announced that, before March 2008 to July 9, 2010, during the three-year term of office of Mayor Jorge Abel López Sánchez, the municipality had paid over 10 million pesos with 42 Czechs to Camacho Palazuelos.
There were also business with Jumapam where they took shocks at the value of over 3 million peso.
Tourist sites need to be improved
Tourist companies regret the loss of foreign tourists due to the bad situation of Gloriata Sánchez Taboad in Mazatlán.
Following the disturbance of a foreign tourist in the invasion of Gloriata Sánchez Taboada, the tourism industry of Mazatlán called for special attention to the authorities, the areas in which they are in a bad state and a bad image is being placed on the port city.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, President of the Trade Union of Zone Dorada, recalled that it was called for different opportunities to meet the travel goal and the bad conditions that tourists are facing to turn into new employment opportunities or routes.
He said that the bad state of the streets and villages had been adversely affected by the fact that tourists came to the front and saw the regulation, where they would use the nearby villages.
"The politicians don't know what it means to close a company one day and they don't think about how much money you've lost. Otherwise, they wouldn't carry out construction work this way slowly and without planning."
The hotel owner José Ramón Manguart Sánchez said that the tourist's noise had focused on the lack of prevention and maintenance of the city's side.
"The community must take its responsibility and avoid what happens once more. How should it do? Well, by means of preventive maintenance, it will improve everything in the neighborhood," he said.
"We look forward to having a clean city. Not only because it is an area of foreign transport, it must be maintained, but we also have a right to a clean living room. The city administration must change its strategy in order to get the city into a good condition."
"There are other places which are also neglected and not ready," he said, "for example, El Escudo y el Venadito of Mazatlán."
"Today we need more than advertising to attract tourists. A good product has to be offered, a city that keeps its beaches and streets clean, and tourists' attractions constantly in shock," he added.
"These preparations have not been given sufficient attention, and this kind of event only makes it clear to all: a maintenance is urgently needed."
Raúl Llera Martínez, Undersecretary of Promoção Turística, expressed the importance of saving the tourist places of Mazatlán because they would not be used properly and would create a bad image.
He mentioned a number of places that had to be brought together with the city to the front. The city should be a clean, orderly and attractive place for foreign transport.
" Luckily, Mazatlán offers many historical and cultural cities that had to be cleaned and cleaned for the first time in order to make them attractive for foreign transport and to carry them to the inventory we are building for this purpose.
IP required results from Congress
Mr Dávalos, President of the CCE, suggested that the rapporteurs should take the lead in setting up a model for a better signola, which is facing many challenges.
The company industry of Mazatlán demands a fair Parliament, free of talks, for the parties and the government, as Sinaloa is upsetting and facing major problems.
Last night, the 60th Parliament was elected. It is composed of seven political forces, 19 members of the PRI, 13 from PAN, three from Partido Nueva Alianza, two from PRD, one from PT, one from Convergencia and one from PVEM. This is a total of 40 people.
The new members of the State Congress are expected to do clean work, to feel obliged by society and the various social groups that are dedicated to responsible parliamentary work, and not to repeat the same patterns of participation and patriarchalism.
Eduardo Dávalos, President of the CCE Business Coordination Council, suggested that the new members should take the lead in setting up a model for a better signolaa, which is facing many challenges.
"We hope that the MEPs will actually exercise their right to deal freely with talks between the parties, because it is common for them to reach agreements with which they represent their own interests, by which they become partners in Carnival of the rulers and leaders of the parliamentary groups."
He said that they should show their commitment to building the necessary bridges to support the current government.
"We are concerned that they are carrying out a confidential work and they are mainly used for society and their groups, because it was the people of Sinaloa who spoke to them about their trust in the last elections."
José Ramón Manguart Sánchez, president of the Tres Islas hotel band, believes that one of the major challenges faced by the 40 peoples is the drive and joint work for the state's economic growth, as today's economy is the most complex.
"The most important thing is that they promote economic growth, create investment incentives and infrastructure measures, which will somehow promote job creation."
In the context of the foreign transport sector, he asked the new members to share the necessary position in the state budget in order to support the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
"I understand that it is the ministry with the second most important means, which is incompatible with an important economic activity which brings currency and investment into the country and is in direct competition with the agricultural industry."
Tourist projects must be allocated money, state security must be supported and the alcohol law which has not been re-established in previous legislative periods must be brought to the latest position.
The Holy King Is Searched
The children of the Coronado Valenzuela family wish to see their children.
For parents it will be difficult on the next three-day day to meet these wishes, because the budget is no longer made up of twelve people and a birch.
Nevertheless, Adelaida, Isabel, Jesús, José Alfredo, María Guadalupe, Isaias, José Juan and Miguel do not hope that Melchior, Caspar and Balthasar will give them the toys and clothes they so look forward to.
The family lives a certain house in the village of Salvador Allende. They live by hand in the mouth because the father has no fixed work.
"Sometimes hard times have been said because my husband has no job. But we sell mandarins and potatoes... I'll go with the kids on the street on the afternoon," said Cayeta Valenzuela Andrade, the mother of the little ones.
The four-year-old Adelaida would like a doll or a bike while her three-year-old sister Isabel wanted a Barbie doll.
Ten-year-old José Alfredo has long wanted to have a 'monster car' and for these eight months old brothers, Jesus proposes Cayeta clothing in size for one year.
"(José Alfredo) said to me, 'I'd like this monster', but I answered him, 'Let us wait, young' because it was very expensive," Cayeta recalled sadly.
For the older children who were in school, dress and shoes would be ideal.
The eleven-year-old María Guadalupe has the size 12; the ten-year-old Isaiah has the size 10, while the eight-year-old Miguel Size 8 has.
The 14-year-old José Juan misses tennis shoes. A couple in size 5 1/2 or 6 would be very helpful.
If you want to help realize the dreams of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family, you can participate in the campaign 'Holy King Will Be Searched' by spending a game or bar money in the reception hall of the newspaper Noroeste.
14 must-mutual drug dealers arrested
On Wednesday, about ten house surveys were carried out in the administrative region of Austria under the proposal for a Cannabis production and sales network.
Forty persons were arrested and various complaints were filed.
The household tests were performed in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, where they should have served mainly in the drug industry.
"About 750 cannabis plants, four Kilo Haschisch, bar money and equipment that have served production have been confiscated," said Louis-Philippe Ruel, speaker of the Quebec Security Police.
In total, 11 men and three women were arrested from Sherbrooke, two of whom were considered chief drug dealers.
The arrested persons should already appear hours after their arrest before the court building in Sherbrooke.
They may, inter alia, be accused of the production of Cannabis, whose possession for sale, the complication and the service of crimes.
These household surveys have led to a long-term investigation that took place over a year.
"The information received from the public has enabled us to carry out these arrests," said Mr. Ruel.
About 70 police officers from the regional intelligence unit Estonia of the Quebec security police, Sherbrooke police station and the MEMPHREmagog police authority had participated in this police operation.
The Secret Movement could be pursued without problems
The draft legislation of the Conservatives, which the Government says will address the problem of ships loaded with domestic migrants, will be adopted in advance after the three opposition parties announced on Wednesday that they cannot vote on the proposal.
"I'll bet on this chart."
"I hold with a party that has put you on foot," Michael Ignatieff, chief of the Liberals, said after the weekly Caucus meeting before the assembled members.
The Liberals claimed that the draft legislation, which allows every person identified as a ship of illegal immigrants to be detained for a year, would suffer as proposed by the Canadian Bill of Law and Freedom.
Gilles Duceppe, chief of the block Québecois, also pointed out that he could not support the draft legislation because he turned against the wrong target group.
"We are against it and it seems that all opposition parties are against it, so we will wait for what the government is taking," said Mr. Duceppe.
The criticism of Olivia Chow's immigration issue, NDP, has shown the critics by hand that their party claimed did not stand firm enough against the domestic migrants.
"The Neo-Democrats have agreed to take action against the blind passengers, and we are also trying to implement this by means of another draft legislation, the C-35," Chow said.
We did not question the constitutional draft of the Conservatives because he was looking for the debt of refugees and held children in custody for at least a year," Chow said.
Minister of Immigration Jason Kenney accused the opposition parties of playing with the policy and ignoring the will of the Canadians.
"The Canadians finally share with the MEPs that they do not tolerate this kind of domestic immigration, these criminal proceedings involving Canada and treat the country as a pedestrian."
"They expect Canada to take strong measures," said Minister Kenneys.
"The Government has not announced any confidential vote on its draft legislation which could have led the country to vote which had been rejected by the Government.
However, a conservative has challenged the QMI agency that the government would vote in order to declare itself immediately to its constituents.
The new unit does not find any consistency
Despite the announcement of the possible establishment of a new, standing unit to combat corruption and corruption since Jean Charest, many observers continue to call for the establishment of a public research committee on this subject.
Robert Dutil, Minister of Public Security, claims that this idea does not come from yesterday: Quebec had already consulted the New York Department of Investigation on this subject since January.
The Metropole has a standing unit against corruption since 1870.
However, the announcement of Wednesday has more than one surprise.
It must be said that this measure was not discussed in the last year, despite the presence of Robert Dutils, despite the meeting of the permanent committee of the Quebec Police Service on 29 October.
It was also not lacking that Stéphane Bergeron, critic and member of the party Québecois, qualified this announcement in point of public safety as a "out of the hat-cut canine" and "on a table-based solution".
Minister Dutil, on the other hand, had again turned to those who feared that political power had too much influence on the question, a future unit.
"They will see the result when we announce it," he was pleased to confirm.
"But this problem is known."
According to Réjean Parent, the president of the CSQ, nothing can replace the implementation of a public inquiry.
"The more Mr Charest wants to prevent the formation of this research committee, the more people like you and I think he has something to hide," he said.
"The only means to form an investigation committee is the return of Jean Charest," stated Yves Boisvert, a lecturer for ethics and policy systems at the ENA (statel. University of Higher Education for Higher Administration Officers).
In order to get out of this storage gas, he proposes that Québec introduce a special mandate for financial control so that it can set up research on corruption and secret talks.
"You should be able to extend the mandate of verification," he decided.
He also expressed the view that the Quebec inspection control could undermine the same power as Commissioners, which would also allow you to force people to say.
The formation of a standing unit is not the only project in the government's collapse of Charest.
Quebec is also required by Ottawa to amend the criminal law in order to better be subject to this type of crime.
This request is from the Supreme Court of the Operation Marteau, which has informed Justice Minister Jean-Marc Fournier that the court is not clear in this form of criminal proceedings.
Vic Toews, Minister of State for Public Security, confirmed by his colleague Justice Rob Nicholson, is currently dealing with certain innovations in this dossier.
During the operation of Printemps 2001, which affected groups of motorcyclists, 131 persons were arrested, although the criminal law was not renewed.
As a result, Ottawa passed the law against gangstertum.
Streams under strict surveillance
Several rivers continue to be under strict surveillance because of the high rainfall that has taken place in some regions of the province since Tuesday.
In Shawwigan, in the Mauritian administration region, it became an earthquake on Wednesday.
Two houses were evacuated in advance.
In the evening another earthquake occurred in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, in the Lanaudiere administrative region.
A street is falling together.
From Tuesday to Wednesday, heavy rains have increased from 40 to 70 millilitres of rainfall in several regions.
Between 20 and 40 more millimetres of fall were expected here, according to the regions until Thursday evening.
The areas north of the river and the number of the Outauais region were most affected.
There were up to 100 millimetres of rainscreens down here.
Since these lows are still considered to be snowflakes which have already gathered in certain parts, the overrepresentation of several waterways is feared.
On Wednesday evening, alerts were received from the Quebec Security Service about the high-warming Oureau River and Achigan in the Lanaudier region.
The river runs in the north, in Saint-Jérôme, in the Laurentinian mountains and in the Chechen in Lotbinière will continue to be subject to high-water surveillance and will continue to be monitored.
In the Lanaudière region, the harddowns have taken place over some lakes in Sainte-Julienne, Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare, as well as in Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte, an explosion was continued because of the heavy rains.
Ten residences had to be evacuated as preventive measures.
In Outauais, the transfer of certain lakes has resulted in the closure of several roads, in particular in the Mansfield-et-pontefract community.
The security service continues to remain in alertness and monitors the situation precisely, as security attorney Annik Bouchard said.
The Quebec Water Centre, on the other hand, issued a warning on the strong rise of several rivers, in particular from Maskinogé, Assomption, Oaueau, Achigan, Batiscan and Loup.
Specifies the point to be applied to the part
The Quebecer Rundfunk Moderator Stéphane Dupont has before the Canadian Board of Directors for Round Funk Standards (CCNR) because of his controversial warnings about social security and Haitians, as well as his casual talk about Funk.
The CCNR represents the opinion, Mr Dupont and his CHOI 98.1 FM team had the right to express their opinion, but had certain comments "unaccurate information on the social security and unwarranted negative representations of the Haitians as well as such unconstitutional arguments which are not appropriate for today's broadcasts."
The Board of Supervisors also concluded that a discussion on suicide, which included the spread of the names of two persons who committed suicide, destroyed the code of conduct.
The CCNR had received several complaints regarding comments made during the submissions issued during 2008 and 2010.
As a result of a complaint by the "Common Front of the Social Assistantés du Québec".
The activist organisation had claimed that the amounts mentioned in the consignment were not accurate.
The moderators should share more solid knowledge.
With regard to the subject of suicide, Moderator Stéphane Dupont had represented the idea that suicide was an expression of weakness.
The majority of the members of the Board of Supervisors had concluded that the message delivered was that suicide should not be considered a solution to life crises.
"The majority of the Board of Supervisors takes into account that the implications of the Dupont le Midi's mission had been linked to a sensitive topic in a right and appropriate way."
So he was placed with no tabel against his person.
The last point was the statements on the earthquake in Haiti.
In this regard, Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort had given themselves an interoperable argument that there was a lot of reactions.
The CHOI moderator had explained that it was not in favour of Haiti's aid that it was not safe to know whether the necessary would also receive the money.
The Board of Supervisors is of the opinion that these comments have not been misused, but that their cumulative effect presents an unwarranted negative representation of the Haitians.
"I have already paid my three-day suspension penalty in this case."
"My act has been unpleasant for a half years," said the moderator.
In all decisions, the Board of Supervisors shall prepare the dissemination of an unencumbered expression.
In all cases, the CHOI-FM roundman has been treated "on the other hand of his obligations".
The consequences of the round functions to be notified, inter alia, at the time of the main deadline within a period of three days, shall be limited.
A King of the King Fu in Montreal
Nacerddine Zemmal, Montreal Algerian origin, has entered a very special course.
The Athlet, which shines in "Sanda" (full contact with King-Fu), in the Kickboxes and in the Thai Boxes, is now looking for new challenges on the Tatami and the world's boxing.
"I started in Algeria 12 years ago with combat sports such as King-Fu and Kickboxes," Zemmel, who has been involved in the Metropolis since 2008 in order to continue under the profession.
I personally seek the fight everywhere, because for those who present it as the mixed battle art, there are few wars in North America."
Recently, his character as a security officer, as well as his rivals at the UPS company, had been sharing his bad news, in which he obtained two gold medals from the World Karate and the Kickboxing Association (WKA) from 23 to 30 October in Edinburgh, Scotland.
"I have achieved the victory in the categories of the complete touch of the Kickbox and the Thai box," he said.
"Now I prepare myself for the World Pocal in San Shou in China."
"It was those who were invited from each category who had placed themselves in the first four world championship."
"I was born in Toronto in 2009. "
"2005 I became back in Vietnam."
"2007 I ended my tournament in China at the fifth place, while I became a third in Toronto in 2009," he added.
"It is worth mentioning that I have made progress in each competition."
"With this rhythm I will be first this time or next year!"
"San Shou" or "Sanda" are native disciplines from China, where foot-and-mouth attacks and foot-and-mouth attacks are permitted as well as ground holes.
The two fights usually play on a platform, rather rarely in a boxing.
The most famous box fighter, which has emerged from this kind of fight sport, is the American Vietnamese origin, Cung Le, which is well known in the world of combat art.
If Nacer Zemmal had only one event back in his career, he would certainly call it King of Sanda's Super Bowl of the King-Fu.
"This competition is the highest and most popular in China," said the Sympathical Poundskerel.
"It's a little like the equivalent of the stadium Lumpinee (the largest stadium in Thailand)."
"That was a great experience."
Zemmel had won his first battle in the semifinal of his category (80kg) before he lost it in the final.
"The one who beat me was a real professional," he analyzed.
"There are four Mysteries per category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 95 kg)."
"The winners of the semi-finals meet each other at the end of their category."
"Then the winners of each category offer the stars to crown a single champion, the King of the King Fu."
450 million in contracts without express
Hydro-Québec has granted 450 million dollars for contracts for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-rupture in mutual agreement.
Among the more than 100 contracts there is a consortium consisting of companies BPR, Dessau, Group SM and Axor, which has received the most important share, namely the project management, to a sum of $295 million without exception.
This Consortium, called Energie Gerance, was formed in 2004 as a follow-up to the decision of Hydro-Québec, the private sector whose responsibility was to meet this important hydroelectric project of a sum of $5 billion.
In early 2005, the "Energie Garance" Consortium established the lucrative contract without giving a public statement.
For the Québecois Party, the withdrawal of company associations is a serious ethical problem which poses the risk of distortion of competition as well as a price increase.
"This is a new form and way of a carded game and strengthens competition."
"This means that instead of decarded games, you are acting in an open form in a secret way now," stated Sylvain Simard, PQ's deputy director at the press conference yesterday.
On the morning of the morning, Simard raised the question before the National Assembly, as it seems hard to understand how the public's interest can be served in this way and in this way.
Minister of Resources Nathalie Normandeau had responded on the afternoon by putting it in Abred that it was an abstract game in this contract.
"I remain faithful to my line," she replied by strengthening that the PQ has been "unjust" and it "falls at the heart."
She said it was "be the least," that the PQ apologized.
The model of the Consortium is a common practice in the world.
It is usually a time-consuming alliance that allows two or more companies to combine their expertise with an offer to express themselves for a complex project.
The Eastmain project shows a high level of complexity with regard to its level of work.
The construction process is under way and will be completed until 2012.
However, the contract was awarded without any competition; it had already been negotiated.
In addition, the model of the Consortium in Quebec itself is no longer an exception for relatively simple projects.
As the newspaper "Le Debor" noted last week, the model of the Consortium for government funding was used in the area of construction and consulting.
A short overview of the Quebec Business Register allows more than 200 consortiums, some of which appear to be permanent.
For example, Dessau works in partnership with most of its core competitors, to which CIMA+, Genivar, SNC-Lavalin or also Roche and Tecsult are listed.
Each connection, and there are several dozen of them, leading back to one and the same legal person, namely Dessau.
As for the Energie Gérance Consortium, Minister Normandeau stressed that "the territory of the Bay James is subject to a special labour dynamic and that Hydro-Québec should take into account this fact in a particular manner and manner since the 1970s".
Réal Laporte, the great employer of Société d' energie de la Baie James (SEBJ), has made a statement that the nose has called for the fact that the contract on project management was approved after agreement.
"If you make an exclamation and there are only a few applicants, your prices will be speeded up."
"So you have two options: either you take the people who are on this Tuesday and say to you: you will treat a satisfactory agreement at a good price."
"The idea is, however, that the price is not decisive, but the understanding of people," Laporte confirmed.
This contract granted to the Consortium "Energie Garance" is part of a long list of contracts received over 50,000 dollars from the party Québecois.
The contracts were either approved by the Hydro-Québec or the SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-rupert project.
After verification, the newspaper "Le Devoir" included more than 100 engineering and consulting contracts, companies or their branches, including resource laboratories, between 2002 and March 2010.
SNC-Lavalin had 22 contracts, Genivar had received 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, without their participation in "Energy Garance".
All these contracts have been negotiated.
They totalled $449,783,344, including the contract with "Energy Garance" over $295,131,564.
Sylvain Simard had suggested that the four companies forming the Consortium (BPR, Dessau, Group SM and Axor) of the "Part liberal du Québec is well known".
Minister Normandeau had called on the PQ to be equally linked to the companies they "financed" before it explained that it was much more about their leadership.
Barometer responsible consumer - The "green" label is not reliable
Green, but uncircumcised sceptic.
The Quebec consumer has little confidence in the main factors of sustainable growth, but also less in the marked brands or eco-signals to control its choice.
Unfortunately, although it is in a medium-sized universe where information is only in favour of a more responsible consumer: the barometer responsible consumer has a lack of credible information, an inconsistencies that make itself known as the brake of its commitments, as shown by the first reading that was held yesterday.
Although they have made use of the consumption of the so-called social contract products in 2010, Quebecers still seem to be trying to sell them with little credit.
Two thirds of Quebec's population have to give the company's environmental commitment as little faith as the green company's bid, according to the measuring instrument issued by the responsible consumer centre of Sherbrooke University.
Another finding: half of the consumers doubt the reliability of the official certificates that have been added to the relatively cheap products, but also the credibility of products and brands that claim to be environmentally aware, is the barometer.
According to the same model, the discussion of politicians on this subject is taken seriously by only 14.6% of the Quebec people.
The information on responsible consumption seems equally important to stimulate this segment of consumption, which is currently only a third of Quebec's consumers.
In fact, gaps and doubts about the nature of the information affected the Eifference of 46% of consumers.
This is according to the highest price of the products the second brake identified by the barometer.
In addition, a third of Quebecer's stated performance of the green products and services that are intended to be delivered to them is mistrustful.
According to another communication, over half of consumers in 2010 had already changed their habits and changed the brand of one or more products in order to express their conviction.
According to Barometer, they also preferred 61% of the purchases in their city district and benefited from the purchase of food produced in their region.
Green and more responsible - the environmental consumer index had reached 64 of the maximum value of 100 this year - the human consumption of Quebec likes to present itself as king of recycling, trying to reduce its traces left in the environment by caring for animal protection.
However, social and environmental awareness seems to be taking place before his car, so the barometer has just mentioned 28% of Quebecers, using public means of transport in 2010 or preferring the transport centre to demonstrate their ecological interest.
The approach and the bike route were also threatened by 39.1% of the participants in this comprehensive issue of behaviour that eats the clicks.
State loan for the acquisition of eXcentricis
The Quebec Government, which was invited by the Société Angus and the parallel company to participate financially in the acquisition of the cinema complexe eXcentris, agreed with cooperation, but only in the form of a competitive loan.
The developing company Angus and the company Paralläle, which had obtained a sum of seven million dollars from the Ministry of Culture for the acquisition of Daniel Langlois's eXcentris cinema complexes on the Boulevard Saint-Laurent in order to meet this once again of its actual Chinese function, did not clearly get what they wanted.
The Government has agreed to involve itself in this matter, but to its own terms.
Instead of the expected cost, the Quebec Government offers less loans than initially expected, which could call for a viable solution to life, at least in the opinion of the sources derived from the state smoking.
A first action plan, as well as a request for 12.8 million, has already been withdrawn by Quebec last morning, which has been corrected since the rescheduling.
A proposal was already sent together with an action plan by the President of the Société de développement des entres culturalles (SODEC), François Macerola, to Minister St-Pierre leading the eXcentris Act.
A few days ago he had given you a final report.
However, the Office's opposition proposal was forwarded to the SODEC on Wednesday.
Parallels and angus now have time until 31 December to respond to this.
In any case, the premiums of state funds seem to have been really forced on the side.
We call to mind that the Québecer property community of the cinemas and cinema complexes had committed itself to direct state investment in support of the acquisition of eXcentris by offering the argument that the Minister of Culture had no financial assistance for real estate projects there which he had not been able to reach any other cinemas.
However, several other market participants in the segment complained about substantial economic aid.
Kinochef Daniel Langlois had, after the self-financed construction of the cinema over ten years, presented the autorenkino in the rooms of its cinema complexes, which could justify the exclusion from the state case.
The lack of cinematographs showing independent films is more obvious in Montreal, and eXcentris knew to keep his client at the stake.
The Société Angus as well as the company Paralläle with Christian Yaccarini at the top, on the other hand, are in charge of a private-funded campaign, from which they expect a sum of $700,000 to charge the acquisition.
Since early 2009, only one lead wall continues to show films in eXcentris, namely Le Parallèle.
The goal of the future acquirer is to reopen three cinemas on 27 February next year with Xavier Beauvois's very successful film "Des hommes et des dieux".
Christian Yaccarini, however, has not quoted the newspaper "Le Devor" and you ignore what he and his group think of the proposals that you have made for them.
Secret of complex protected Canada
The new U.S. diplomats distributed by WikiLeaks shed light on what the United Nations considered to be the least-value complex of Canadians against the Americans; however, they opened up with the same advantage over Canada.
As a result, the American diplomats are surprised that the Canadian voters do not have Canadian-American relations in the election, and they believe that President Obama's visit would help the conservative government implement its 2009 budget!
The four new messages between the American message in Ottawa and Washington, which were published in public yesterday, offer even more spectacular details than the only substantial content to be attached to.
A data link from 22 September 2008, i.e. the period during which the federal election campaign was fully available, reports on which point the United Nations no longer participates in the implementations discussed by its political leaders.
To the great surprise of David Wilkins, an American messenger used in Ottawa.
Mr Wilkins offers various explanations of this situation.
"A Canadian almost resident minority complex may require the Canadian political leadership to talk much more about internal issues of everyday conflict than the United States would send the black Peter (such as 1988 in the free trade campaign) at this election," he explains.
The United Nations, he concludes, are therefore "the spoken Goliath of this election: superior but potentially too dangerous to speak of him".
The messenger understands this "reverent silence" so little, as both countries are deeply involved in political and economic relations.
"Logistically," he said, "it should be the ability of a candidate, a party and much more of a party leader to conduct such an essential relationship that the choicer has in mind at the beginning of the event as a key self-actor."
The other expression of this feeling of importance appears in the statement sent by President Barack Obama on his first visit to Ottawa on 22 January 2009 by Terry Breese, a businessman in Ottawa.
"Your trip will help to ensure that the government continues to have confidence in the federal budget at the beginning of February, when Canada's first deficit will be announced after more than a decade, which has been created by a savings programme of between 30 and 40 billion dollars," Breese explains.
Nothing had been said that the Government had to abstain from sitting before Christmas in order to prevent Parliament from being interrupted by the coalition and that the continued presence of opposition parties would affect the quality of the proposed conservation programme.
A further, dated January 2008 and signed by Ambassador Wilkins, Washington understands from the increasingly negative picture that the dramatic series of CBCs broadcast by the United States is spreading.
The messenger is relieved of shipments such as Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligent and H2O, in which you can observe little subtle performances at Maher Aar, which are "No-Fly List" or also performances for the purpose of the CIA's muscular performance.
Another communication tells us more about how Hillary Clinten asked her French colleague Bernard Kouchner at her first bilateral meeting whether Europe was ready to pick up certain prisoners from Guantanamo.
Mr Kouchner should have answered the question with yes, but on the basis of an individual 'case' decision.
At the end of the meeting, he described it as "the Secretary of State has issued a paper in Puncto Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Muslim of Canadian origin."
"The Secretary of State has said to review the act."
Finally, we note that the coins are generated on the WikiLeaks website.
Tom Flanagan, an old and Stephen Harper very close consultant, had explained about CBC that the responsible for this massive leck should be "responsible".
He was referring here to Mike Huckabee from the United States.
World Plan for the Renewal of Light
In Cancun yesterday, the UNO proposed a plan to update the lighting of households, trade and industry in 100 countries with a view to reducing greenhouse gas emissions (FCKW), which corresponds to almost one third of the additional reductions that must be realized in order to stabilize the earth's climate by 2020.
This ambitious plan introduces its position as part of the concrete major projects aimed at implementing the UN in Cancún in order to compensate for the absence of compulsory reduction obligations on industrial countries.
After the plan presented yesterday, the main problem would be avoided in the form of the 1.8 billion tonnes (Gt) of FCKW released on the ground because of the lighting provided by the FCKW if the whitebirds that still represent a 50 to 70% monopoly on the market would be replaced by fluorescent or even better by light diodes (LED).
The lighting is responsible for 8% of global emissions.
This corresponds to an equivalent of 70% of the greenhouse gas emissions in the world.
In Copenhagen last year, large greenhouse gases such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, had committed themselves to voluntary reduction plans to reduce global FCW emissions from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
However, 5 Gt of this balance had to be removed in order to stabilize the climate from now until 2020 to 2 degrees Celsius to prevent this out-of-control.
In the white flowers, 95% of the energy in the form of heat is measured, and the rest of the 5% produce light.
With compact light bulbs, energy consumption is reduced by 75%, and with the new LED bulbs this energy requirement is again reduced by twice.
The compact lamps hold between 6000 and 10,000 hours on average.
The new LED gloves, such as those that have been placed on the market this week by the manufacturer Philips - this company has participated in the UNO study - have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than a white-fashioned beer, which provides an increase in the savings of the exchange plan to be used in 100 countries.
In addition to the fact that its completely new flowering plants only emit very little heat, they can also function with a regular resistance.
And they don't contain any mercury.
Several specialists have shown that compact light-emitting reserves are shown as they contain mercury and that they must therefore be provided as special powder, which is not always possible in developing countries, except for the producers to provide a reception facility.
The main source of mercury emissions on the planet is, however, the report does not represent the compact light bulbs, but rather the coal power plants that release significantly more mercury to generate electricity lost by the white coal.
Only in the United States did these coal power plants consume 25,000 tons of mercury annually.
The report describes in detail the benefits that would be achieved by each country through this international programme.
For example, Indonesia would save a billion dollars a year for electricity and eight million tonnes of CO2, which means an equivalent of 3.5 coal power plants, which would cost Indonesia 2.5 billion.
Elfone costs are expected to increase the announcement of the election results
UNO Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has called for the "incessant" publication of the results of the presidential election of the elephant bees immediately after their expiry.
"The Secretary-General underlines the need of the Independent Electoral Commission to get its work done and to announce the preliminary results without further delay," said a press spokesman from the UN Head.
"He invites all parties and institutions of the elephant cost to demonstrate their responsibility and to include each initiative until the preliminary results are announced."
Despite the pressure exerted by certain foreign governments, the Selection Commission had allowed the death line, which was set at midnight on Wednesday, three days after the election on Sunday, without publication of the results.
About forty minutes before the deadline, the President of the CEI confirmed on television that the Commission would "go on working" to announce the results.
On Wednesday many calls from all over the world were made, but the CEI was finally able to call out the name of the winner of the second round of elections under the distinguished Laurent Gbagbo and its opponents, Alassane Ouattara.
However, the Gbagbo stock account for the cancellation of the "infrared" vote in the north by the Constitutional Council, which was reached by the former rebel camp of the Forces nouvelles (UN) during the failed polls in September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, head of the presidential campaign of the Elfenbeins, confirmed that the manoeuvres who had been trained by the United Nations to bribe the voters in the north of the country had refused to vote.
The whole choice could be cancelled if the complaints lodged by Gbagbo were taken into account by the Constitutional Council.
However, the Gbagbo opponents are now more concerned with the fact that the highest court in the country is not neutral because it is led by Paul Yao N'Dré, a political associate with Gbagbo.
Alasane Ouattara, the man of the north who is opposed to the ex-rebellious ex-rebellions, has considered the delay in announcing the election results as "unresponsible" and has asked Gbagbo to respect them, even if he has not gone so far to demand the victory.
His allies confirmed that Gbagbo blocked the publication of the results, as he knew he had lost; and that a complaint was filed before the Constitutional Court after the election committee had prevented it from publishing the results, being illegal.
The second round of the presidential elections on Sunday was held for the crowning of a country's integration and reconciliation process, which was split into two parts over years.
The United Nations had warned the policymakers of the elephant coastal costs on Wednesday that they could be held responsible for this in the event of any clarifications.
Laurent Gbagbo had the first election round on 31 October with 38% of the votes against the 32% for Alassane Ouattara, who welcomed the public support of former President Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round) as a top candidate.
Unemployment rate remained stable in France in the third quarter
The unemployment rate in France is 9.3% stable in the International Labour Office (IAA) in the Metropole (including the Overseas Department at 9.7%), thus showing the preliminary, seasonally adjusted data published on Thursday by the Statistical Office of Insee.
The unemployment rate in the metropolis is 2,631 million.
The figures for the second quarter were 9.3% of the eligible population in the metropolis and 9.7% of the overseas department.
Over the year the unemployment rate has increased by 0.1 percentage points.
On the other hand, 3.4 million French metropolis workers were not employed in the third quarter, but they wanted to find a job, whether they were able to work every two weeks or not or whether they were working or not.
The situation of young people in the labour market has continued to deteriorate by increasing the unemployment rate of 24.2% in the metropole (+0.9% points within three months, +0.5 percentage points over the year) and 25% among the overseas regions.
In the third quarter, 637,000 young people between 15 and 24 years of age were unemployed by IAA.
On the other hand, the elderly have a slight increase in unemployment rates of 6.4% in the metropolis (+0.2 percentage points over three months and over the year), i.e. 482,000 of the over 50-year-olds and 6.6% of the overseas departments.
Only 25-49 years could have benefited from the stability of unemployment in the third quarter; 8.3% in the metropole (-0.1 percent point over three months, +0.1 percent point over a year) and 8.8% in France as a whole.
Following an exchange of views on its accounting procedures, the Statistical Office of Insee has published no more monthly unemployment rates since 2006.
Eurostat, the statistical office of the European Union, continues to use this method and announced on Tuesday a quota of 9.8% in France for October (including the overseas departments) against 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guérini accused and arrested
Against Alexandre Guérini, 53, the head of a disposal company and a brother of the President of the Bouches-du-Rhône Region (PS), an investigation procedure was initiated and he was placed in prison in Luyne near Aix-en-Provence in the course of an investigation procedure.
Alexandre Guérini was accused of vandalizing companies, vandalizing generals, Heherieri, co-opterity in corruption, illegal occupation and possession of weapons, as his lawyer.
"Alexandre Guérini is ready to fight and has to ask himself all the questions asked him by the government, instead of spreading haircuts."
"It's easy to teach him a number of criminal charges, another thing is to prove them," said his lawyer Florence Raul of the AFP (Agence France Presse) before hearing his mandate.
Mr. Guérini, brother of Jean-Noël Guérini, the first man of the PS (part of the socialist) in the department, had put value on allowing the judge to come up with a memorandum before his hearing by his lawyer.
A member of Guérinis, Philippe Rapezzi, was also charged and arrested on Wednesday.
According to Lawyer Lucien Simon, her husband had never done anything other than his deposition to lead him to keep running.
He had never known the business field or the purpose of the related fund, Simon.
In this case, Daniel Pinna, former Director-General of the Public Service of the Aubagne Calling Room, was also charged with subordination and complication on Wednesday, but then, under the authority of the protagonists of these acts, was again set free.
"My man could deliver explanations to the facts that were claimed to him."
"The Head of State has taken into account that he is not deprived of his freedom, his lawyer Yann Arnoux said.
Four other persons were charged and released on Wednesday night of Tuesday at the port, two of them under legal supervision, as was the representative of the Supreme Court, Michel Raffin.
Michel Karabadjakian, the manager of the disposal company Marcelle Provence Métropole (MPM), is prosecuted for "unauthorized influence and passive harassment".
Two state officials from the Calling Room were also arrested, Michele Duval and Christophe Bingier, who were arrested on the basis of the title "Realisation and Dissemination of Public Service" by an official of the public service, the other due to "co-operation in public money laundering".
The life threatening of Alexandre Guérini, Jeannie Peretti, was also accused of "hellery and defeat of social assets".
For the persons who were transferred to Guérini, Stéphane Brunengo-Girard is recently arrested because of a similar case of fraud companies from public hands that had touched Corsica.
The guards suspected his company of contributing to the "high" crime circle of money.
In April 2009, the investigation against X for alleged fraud in the award of public contracts, in particular in the field of disposal, will be carried out through anonymous letters in the documents of several open investigation procedures.
It follows from close sources that the investigation focuses on the conditions of the contribution and the operation of a deposit in La Ciotat, as well as on waste from the Aubagne area, as well as from certain cities of the urban entrance area of Marseille (MPM).
Case Clotilde Reiss: the Elysée Palace exceeds its central function for Syria
Within more than six months from July 2009 to May 2010, Clotilde Reiss, a young French researcher who was detained in Iran for "spionage", replaced the French public in Atem, replaced the diplomacy in alertness and highlighted the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran.
This is all under the attention of the diplomats of the United States.
The American documents published by WikiLeaks and the "Le Monde" newspaper provide some basis for this crisis.
They describe how Elisée had explained his strategy to the Americans, who went as far as to give these recommendations to deal with their own crisis of "guises" in Iran (a small group of migrants).
They show how the French officials tried to convince Washington that the release of young French people did not have the release of Majid Kakavand, a prisoner in France who was arrested and was executed by the US justice for dealing with material in favour of the Iranian nuclear programme.
Finally, they set out the way in which the French Presidency has tried to manipulate the media for the purpose of making this idea believe that the Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad has played a central role in the release of Clotilde Reiss, in a grey light.
In fact, he had done nothing in this regard.
A diplomat telegram published in Paris on 12 August 2009 includes the title "Iran: French comments on the nature and manner of dealing with ghosts".
François Richier, Elysée consultant in strategic issues, was involved with Patricia Paoli, director of Quai d'Orsay for North Africa and the Middle East with the American diplomat Kathleen Allegron.
They explained the French method.
They urge the Americans to put all of this back on their own nationals who would be violently arrested in Iran.
"Mayt Lärm," they said, "articularly and clearly and without leave" the words "basic human rights", "Unfortunate release" in the media.
This is necessary in order to bring the Iranian regime into line, which is very sensitive to its image.
"This is so much more than asking the Iranians not to do it."
Because "Stillswegen doesn't solve anything", the discussion attempts are on an unprecedented way, the Iranians are "masters in the Overseas."
Mr Richier adds that the arrest of foreigners is a "liquidative, Iranian tactic": "take action for political repression".
He announces that the release of Clotilde Reiss from prison (which should take place on 16 August, on the day when she fled to France) "demands the payment of a large sum of money to the Iranians" (€230,000 bail).
And he's making it possible that Elisée's anticipating other brains, a phenomenon that's going to "strengthen itself".
The Iranians could "hold another of about 1,800 French citizens living in Iran in the near future," he said.
28 August 2009.
Clotilde Reiss was released 12 days ago from prison, but remains in Iran.
Information was received in circulation: Iran's Majid Kakavand, whose delivery is required by the United States because of illegal trade in sensitive electronic material to Iran, was released after a judge's decision in Paris.
The American message is, like many other observers, asking questions about this disturbing coincidence.
The release of Majid Khakavand is a bad news for Washington, which pursues the illegal Iranian networks of the acquisition of the material provided for the nuclear programme.
Has France bought a kitchen deal?
The release of Iran from those of France?
As a result of a renewed discussion with Kathleen Allegrone on September 4, François Richier ensures that this is not the case.
The Elysée, he says, was not only "fully surprised by the decision of the judge", but also tried to stand up against it.
"It has given a lot of exchange between the French Presidency and the French Justice Minister" (now Michele Alliot-Marie), but "the French Government cannot change the judicial decision," he explains.
Mr Richier would also like to point out that Majid Kakavand is still under "stronger" supervision of the French Secret Service.
The Elysée consultant selects a phone number, then puts it up again, informs the American diplomat, who is Iran's "currently in the buildings led by the Iranian message in Paris".
During the horror of Clotilde Reiss in Iran, Elysée has no longer made its efforts to believe through escapes and through the media organized "flight tests", which the Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad plays an "important" and "influential role".
The Americans do not observe this activity without irony and note that manipulation brings fruit, since several press articles reflect the official French version.
One of the telegrams dating from 25 August 2009 refers to "the media blizzard of the French authorities".
On which so many "thanks" are based against Mr Assad, the Parisian message asks.
"In spite of their statements full of praise, the French authorities conceal that they have only a vague knowledge of what the Syrians have really done."
The document thus covers the reasons why the Elysée has brought this fiction to fall.
The intensive communication efforts "have been aimed at confirming Sarkozy's policy of opening up against Syria," he analyzes.
A 2008 policy was launched, which was "contained by many critical voices in France and abroad as a source of frustration and unappreciativeness".
"The Syrian role-building" tried Paris "Syria to lead in front of the eyes which can be achieved by playing a constructive role in the region".
The aim is also to "be a bridge between Syria and Iran".
The American message knows this from a good source.
On 11 August François Richier assured her: "Of course we don't know whether the Syrians have always done what they have done."
"But we have thanked them for everything."
"This should at least silence the Iranians."
Clotilde Reiss returns to France on 16 May 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy received her in Elysée.
In a communique he thanks the Presidents of Brazil, Senegal and Syria for their "active role in the release of our citizens".
No online games for young Koreans by midnight
The South Korean government will adopt a law called "the Aschen Brodel", which will prohibit young people from playing after midnight online games by stopping them from accessing so-called government officials.
A draft law which requires online players to refuse access to these games by young people under 16 years of age after midnight shall be submitted to Parliament in December by representatives of the Ministry of Culture and Family.
"Many children play these games all night long and have such difficulties with learning in school and also to lead a normal life every day."
"We believe that this law is necessary to ensure their health and their right to sleep," said Jo Rin, acting under this draft law by the French Press Agency France Presse.
The online games will then be available again from 6 a.m.
The company had a long period of time to prepare for the application of the law, he said.
The Government also takes note of the request by the manufacturer to lower the time limit given for access to these games on a daily basis to those young people whose parents ask them to do so, the responsible added.
It will also provide free software for those who wish to limit the time spent on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the most "connected" countries, and newspapers regularly report on various events related to intensive Internet use.
The country is also an unauthorized champion in online games competitions worldwide.
In November, South Korea had committed against 58 other nations four gold medals in World Cyber Games.
World Championship 2018-2022: FIFA appoints the beneficiary country
The FIFA Executive Committee on Thursday, on the basis of corruption suspicions, appoints the countries of the World Championships 2018 and 2022 as the highest political choice to force the influence ranges and lobbying on the basis of technical criteria.
However, one thing is certain: the 2018 edition of the FIFA's King's Discipline will take place in Europe, its traditional Hochburg (the 4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain, Portugal, the Netherlands and Belgium).
The issue of 2022 will then become somewhat exotic; the International Football Association hopes to be able to win new territories (Katar, Australia) in 2010 after the prize in the African continent, or to continue its landing in the United States or in Fernot (Japan, South Korea).
The list of persons belonging to the delegation (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the Emir of Qatar, the Belgian and Dutch Head of Government, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff), provides the measure of economic and political use of a world empire.
So the make-up behind the bullets will take place until the last minute.
It was difficult to establish a hierarchy of candidates.
According to the FIFA evaluation report, the English, Spanish-Portuguese (18) and American (2022) acts offer better arguments than their competitors.
But these considerations will not be so important for the 22 members of the Executive Committee at the time of the election.
The Sunday Times, which led to the suspension of two members of the Executive Committee (Reynald Temarii and Amos Adamu) at the beginning of the polls, would also have been a good chance of ruining their own country, the flag of the football team, which only once forced the world championship, namely 1966.
The BBC had given the next round on Monday, by publishing a documentary report, which three influential members of the Committee, namely Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou, were seized.
There is enough reason to charge FIFA and bring in the English officials who, in the first line with David Cameron, had been operating an intensive lobbying in recent weeks.
The Head of Government is looking forward to a new surface of the shock suffered by his predecessor Tony Blair, who had achieved the organisation of the 2012 Olympic Games for London in 2005.
Would this intensive use be sufficient to reassess the image of England before the committee?
Nothing is safer because the Duo Spanish portugal is not lacking in drums with its already finished stadiums, its expertise (WM 82 in Spain, Olympic Games 92 in Barcelona, EM 2004 in Portugal) and its football culture.
However, the economic and financial consequences of the two countries could undermine their ambitions.
The possible repressions against the English as well as the doubts about the solvency of Spain and Portugal give rise to Russia's chances of becoming a major outsider despite its gaps in the file (stages, hotels, transport).
However, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has decided to call on the unbridled use of the English press to "a fair competition in the preparation of the vote" by the committee members.
"You argue with pressure, you try to compromise," said Putin.
For 2022 the United States, strengthened by the experience of 1994, seems to be the logical interests.
The first economic world power, the seat of the FIFA main sponsors, the country seems to show a long list of advantages against Japan and South Korea, which have separately set up a very beautiful project.
However, these new candidatures appear to be very expensive for two countries that had organized the competitions in 2002.
Another threat: the approval of the WM 2026 for China by FIFA, which allows Asian opportunities to be suspended by 2022.
With Australia and Qatar, which had won all the registers with the expectation of future stages, FIFA continues its expansion towards new areas, but these two countries are at a greater risk because of uncertainty.
Australia could also suffer from the lack of television rights acquired by the European countries (on the basis of time-consuming) by Japan and South Korea, which is the sensitive nerve of FIFA.
Second mandate: the Openness
The Gaulle had really been there.
In the meantime, he would have believed that he was slow.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac did not show the slightest interest.
And Nicolas Sarkozy is less than this one.
A mission in Elysée calls for the next one.
The current Head of State will then be a candidate in 2012.
But the public is the side of the mystery, which the presidency functions, is not in good sight.
So you have to do the same thing as if there were any doubts.
In one way or another.
In 2006, attachors Jacques Chiracs suggested that a third mandate should not be excluded without believing in it.
On 15 November, Nicolas Sarkozy made sure that his decision to "morrow in the autumn of 2011" was taken seriously.
As a result, he would have been able to raise the prospects of "two-mandate" on the service evening in Elisée before the UMP parliamentarians.
Was that the official announcement of his candidate?
There's been a big mistake.
The President simply reminded me that the amendment to the 2008 Constitution limited the number of five-year official periods to only two.
He made a statement, not an announcement.
It is not the first time he mentioned the presidential election because of such meetings in a humorous tone.
"You have been worse than seven or seven years with me or better," he told them in July 2009.
On a new May 2010: "I don't believe I don't think about the phase."
His words of predecessors do not make him more candidates than before; neither do they less.
If they want to repeat comments, then for a double reason.
Acceleration of the competition around the candidate with the PS on one side.
However, it is not the entry into force of the competition with Ségolène Royal, which Nicolas Sarkozy is trying to reveal.
On the contrary, it is its obvious candidate in 2012 that many members of the PS were more early than adopted for the fight against.
The bad questions on the other side.
For the first time, right-holders would prefer a candidate from François Fillon of Nicolas Sarkozy (46% against 44%, according to BVA-L'Express).
"We have a candidate, and there are no discussions about it with the UMP," the Prime Minister responded immediately and carefully.
"If he could find a landing as possible, he wouldn't have been invited," says Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
"It will always be believed to be able to win," says Alain Juppé, who has discovered himself with openness.
Euro: the ECB is forced to maintain its procurement of State paper
The last meeting of the Central Bank of the ECB last year should provide an opportunity to show how you are emerging from the crisis or at least to announce a large number of non-conventional monetary policy measures which should be concluded by the end of the year.
The crisis of European State debt requires that the Central Bank in Frankfurt will not be able to provide it with any doubt as well as the current situation on the European loan markets in order to prevent its deterioration.
The political costs would be too high.
The French finance minister Christine Lagarde had welcomed a press conference yesterday, which was adopted by the ECB to play an active role in the resolution of Europe's state-of-the-art debt.
It did not expect to say whether it was the opinion that the central bank could do more, for example by reopening its procurement programme for state loans.
"I hold my views on my European trading partners (...)".
Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the ECB in Brussels, on the basis of his hearing by the European Parliament's Economic and Monetary Committee on the subject of its work, did not show very much about it, but rather pleased to point out that the purchase programme of State paper would "continue" on the secondary market and that we would "see how decisions are made" at the meeting on Thursday.
Only certainty: The ECB will remain unchanged by 1%, the lowest historical level since May 2009.
In practice, the bond purchases from the Board of Auditors by the ECB were doubled to around EUR 1.35 billion last week.
And according to Indications of some dealers, they should have made new purchases in Irish and Portuguese state papers yesterday.
As a whole, the central banks of the Eurosystem have been operating at EUR 67 billion since May 2010.
There is no doubt about the anticipation of a continuation of the purchase course (see page 29).
People's values no longer expect significant price change.
If the loans are already out of the ECB's arsenal for more than three months, the latter will be granted free of charge at the unlimited reserves of funds, although for a period of one week to three months.
People's values are already aware that this measure will be extended for a few months.
"I cannot imagine that the ECB will substantially change its programme."
" Otherwise, they would be at risk of generating new tensions in a short term," says Michael Schubert, People's Fair of the Commercial Bank.
"One for the course of the first quarter of 2011, progressive increase seems to me to be more likely," warns Norbert Brams, Volkswirt at Sal.
Oppenheim.
In the area of their intervention on the public debt market, "the ECB should maintain such a volume of purchases under obligations which live on the market," adds Norbert Brams.
In view of the relevance of the position of the European banks exposed to the euro area debt markets, the central bank has no choice other than to maintain its presence on the market.
"They must enter into the market at any price to the players of the missing investors and act as a means of preventing the rapid pursuit of the earnings paid to the poorest countries," said an important debtor yesterday.
Because if interest rates were applied to high-flights, the States would not be able to reduce their debt or simply stabilize it.
This is the price to protect the euro.
The government of Berlusconi goes to Italy to cover
After a disturbing weekend for Italy, the situation has been slightly calmed by the decline of the eczcinns for 10 years.
A return to the Tragic style.
At the end of the meeting with the Minister for Economic Affairs, the President of the region, Giulia Tremonti, had qualified the situation as "unnumberable" and had heard it with a "unpredictable" week, however, which was immediately forgotten.
On Tuesday, however, the cheese with the German interest rates had reached its record of 210 basic points, and the price of the contracts covering the risk would be 263 points, which had led to some headlessness in Rome.
Silvio Berlusconi had pointed out at his Council of Ministers that the Spanish discrepancy is located at the German interest rates at 400 basic points.
However, his right hand, Gianni Letta, had been marked as "hardly worried" by the "market turbulence" and a possible risk of arrest from the direction of Ireland.
"The good news is that Italy, the third eurozone economy, is not like Greece or Ireland."
"The bad news is that Italy is like Portugal," explains Irwin Stelzer, a folklore at Hudson Institute.
In Ssuxxt, its problem is that the absence of economic growth and the accompanying rapid tax increases that threaten the State cannot cover its financing needs anymore.
The last Brussels forecast was a cold shower for the government.
In the future, an Italian increase of 1.1% will be expected in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012... although the budget available at the audit session is calculated by 1.3% relatively 2%.
Under these conditions, the EU Commission calculates that the budget deficit will still be 4.3% of GDP in the next year (against the 3.9% government forecast) and 3.5% in 2012 (i.e. 2.7%).
That is why the rise in a new budget collective could also be used after the holidays to a sum of 7 billion euros.
"If necessary, new savings must be taken," said Economic Officer Olli Rehn.
Italy will receive the support of international institutions for an hour.
"The basic strengths of the Italian economy are in order and its accounts are regulated, which we have been repeating for a long time," says Arrigo Sadun, Italian trustee of the International Monetary Fund entrusted to the IWF with Italy.
"There are no problems, either short-term or long-term, since Italy, despite its high debt (119.2% of GDP in 2011, A. d. R.), is required to make more stabilization progress than other countries," says Pierre Carlo Paduan, head of OECD.
The question remains after political instability.
On 14 December, Silvio Berlusconi will be facing a mystery request from the Chamber of Appeal, which may lead to the scheduled elections by the end of March.
There is therefore a rather favourable period for a decision on a serious crisis.
Europeans think about the development of anti-crisis measures
Christine Lagarde had made an express statement at a press conference in Paris yesterday: "I believe it has been proved by the Sunday afternoon and by the evening: the Europeans are clearly united, ready and committed to protecting their money and their currency."
Despite completely relatively recent withdrawals in the interest of European State bonds, water was at the expense of governments and the ECB.
However, from the start of normalisation, it cannot be the talk.
The rating agency had announced Standard & Poor's, it could raise the debt note of Portugal, which is probably the most effective target of the speculants today.
"As in May there is a real lack of clarity and political certainty, which is particularly responsible for banking systems," says the opinion of the people's values of the Exane BNP Paribas.
In particular, since "political time is much slower than those of the markets".
The European countries which are aware of both this crisis and the danger involved are intensifying their discussions to strengthen the existing anti-crisis measures.
The informal consultations between the most directly concerned finance ministers and their opponents of the G20 go well.
And this is also in view of the Eurogroup and Ecofin meetings the following week.
The ECB is meeting today.
The plan is to eliminate the unconventional measures to strengthen the countries of the euro area in the chain of markets (see below).
As far as the EU Stability Fund is concerned, its Executive Director, Klaus Regling, has already begun his Asian tour in Singapore on Tuesday to inform investors in Fernot about developments in the crisis in Europe.
If the purpose of his visits is not expressive funding, he will certainly prepare the ground for this.
The first issue of paper from the EU Stabilities Fund is planned for the next month.
Yesterday an official representative of the Reuters Agency was entrusted to the United States to support a possible increase in the additional, direct commitment of the IWF fund.
Portugal and Spain, the countries in the first line, are sending on their side structural reforms, particularly in the area of the labour market organisation.
Reforms which are coming up with savings, however, should show effects in the near future.
Lisbon and Madrid have chosen another way, as Greece and Ireland have done.
Both one and the other must avoid any price to offer international aid before they have set up their own budgetary corrections and decided on unfavourable structural reforms that will bring them back to life.
The European capitalists are again concerned with the options available to speed up the normalisation process of state loans.
Axel Weber, who was on the way to Paris on 24 November, had first introduced the idea that if the 750 billion euros mobilized by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not enough, the Union would not hesitate to take up its own task again.
The people's values of Barclays Capital, with respect to the European public debt market, in the face of an all-emergency actor, would be sufficient to extend about EUR 100 billion, "preferably" in the form of a direct liquidity gap.
This means that the European financial stabilisation mechanism currently accounts for EUR 60 billion.
A board which has all the opportunities to be carefully examined in the European capitals.
In particular, where market conditions are met.
Snow and ice cream: 24 Departments in Orange
The snow episodes are still leading to transport difficulties, particularly in the secondary transport networks of Britain, and tend to affect various economic activities.
Forty-eight departments are currently in alert level Orange because of the devastating snow and ice risk.
The regions of Eure, Eure-et-Loire, Deux-Sèvres and Vienna have already reached 20 departments in Orange, 18 from midnight and two, the Dordogne and the Gironde, thus later in the night.
According to Météo France, the intensive skiers reach the north of the Gironde and the Charentes, it cuts easily on the et Ile-de-France.
In the departments concerned, cuts are expected from 2 to 5 cm, also from 7 to 10 cm, as well as 1 to 3 cm, even up to 5 cm in the Paris region.
The regions are Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côtes d'Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, Poitou and the regions Basse-Normandie, Ile-de-France and Limousin.
The snowfalls are considerable enough to provoke traffic barriers and affect certain economic activities, Météo France predicts.
In the region of Côtes d'Armor, more than 7,5 tonnes of road traffic between Guangamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Ludéac have been blocked.
According to the traffic police, the situation of the secondary transport networks in Britain is very difficult, and the use of a few TER buses was all over the day.
In the Picardie, school transport was increased for Thursday.
No specific restrictive measures were provided for in the medium term.
The Prefecture "needs drivers to be more careful on the streets and to adjust their driving behaviour accordingly."
The Directorate-General for Civil Aviation (DGAC) asked the airlines on Thursday 25% of theirs from the Paris airport Roissy and 10% of Orly's early flights due to the expected high snowfalls.
The DGAB recommends that air passengers contact their airlines.
The Gatwick Airports in South London and Edinburgh Airport, Scotland, are closed until Thursday morning.
Metro Grand Paris: first financial skiing
Since the debate on the modernization of the transport economy on the Ile-de-France has been fully under way, it is worth billions.
At least in the discussions.
In particular, we call the 23 billion for the Metro Grand Paris, which is to be built by the Société du Grand Paris.
In order to lead the construction of the SGP into the process, the State has launched a capital donation of EUR 4 billion.
In the theoretical scheme, this is the sum that would allow the SGP to give on the markets part of the financial sum to its double.
Today it has finally come to first accounts.
The 2010 additional budget, which was adopted by the National Assembly's Finance Commission on Monday, contains the measures envisaged to cover the first part of these money.
There are two measures: the creation of a special tax to end and higher taxation of the offices on the Ile-de France.
Firstly, Article 15 of the draft legislation reads "in favour of the public-law institution Société du Grand Paris".
This means: "The product of this tax is worth 117 million euros per year".
Second, it is a new order of existing corporate taxation: "to modernise this to increase its product resulting from it and to respond to this increase in Société du Grand Paris".
How much would that cost?
A rat.
This summary is not marked for text.
From the 4 billion people are far away.
"It is estimated that the tax resources will be added to the 4 billion euro of the capital donation generated by the State and implemented by the Société du Grand Paris after and after the project," says the report.
The SGP does not even find this system objectionable.
"Since the moment you are denied revenue (the two taxes, i.e. R.), you can cover the design over three years and then create from the 4 billion," it is explained.
"This will be recorded in the budget and withdrawn after and after."
The SGP is committed to starting 2013 to noting the 4 billion for the 2014 budget.
These measures, of which 4 billion people can still be sought for long ago, are at risk of calling for a right-wing parliamentary debate.
The first public meeting will take place on 7 December.
Scattering hackers and self-adhesive spys
The WikiLeaks case has a double significance.
On the one hand, it has emerged as an obvious scandal, a scandal which is only a scandal in the sense of rail integrity, which governs relations between states, citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it proclaims profound changes at international level and offers a preview of the future dominated by regression.
But let's move on to the line.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is to confirm the fact that each act created by a secret service (one of the x-each nation) is composed exclusively of newspaper sections.
The "extraordinary" American ideas about the sexual habits of Berlusconis are nothing more than what you have been able to read about months as well as in every x-advanced journal (other than those owned by Berlusconi), and the exciting characterized profile Gaddafis bot Cabaret artists have been working for their sketches for a long time.
The rule that the hidden files should only be made up of news already known is essential for the dynamics of secret services, and this is not only in this century.
If you go into a library dedicated to esoteric publications, you will realize that any work (over the Grail, the mystery of Rennes-le-Chateau, the Temple or the Rose Kreutzler) repeats exactly what has already been written in previous works.
This is not only because the author of occult texts does not want to publish research (but because he did not know where news about non-existence would be found), but because those who are dedicated to occultism believe nothing but what they already know and confirm what they have already learned.
This is also the success mechanism of Dan Brown.
And the secret forces.
The informant is false, and false (or limited spirit) is also the head of the secret service (other than he could always be anything, for example an editor at liberation), who considers only what he recognizes.
The top secret information about Berlusconi, which the US message sent to the State Secretary in Rome, was the same as those that Newsweek had already published last week.
So why was such an argument about the contents of this folder made?
On one side, these people are aware of what each trained person already knows, and although the messages - at least since the end of World War II and since then also the heads of government have been able to call each other or take a plane to meet at evenings - have lost their diplomatic function and have, with the exception of some small representation tasks, turned into spy agencies.
Every viewer of discovery movies knows this very well, and it doesn't happen out of sincerity that you do so to ignore it.
Nevertheless, the fact that it is publicly repeated damages the task of cleanliness and serves to put American diplomacy in a bad light.
Second, the idea that an x-like hacker can capture the secrets of the most powerful country in the world is a major defeat against the prestige of the State.
In addition, the scandal reduces the victim's sacrifice as much as the "sharpener" imposes pressure.
But we devote ourselves to the profound nature of what is happening.
Previously, at Orwell's times, you were able to combine all power like a big brother who controlled every breath of his subjects.
Since prophecy could have been perfectly accurate where one can control any movement through the phone, any transaction carried out, the hotel visited, the chosen road and so on; the citizen would become a total victim of power.
However, if you see what is happening today that even the secrets of power can no longer escape the control of a hacker, then the control process will listen to being one-sided and will be circular.
The power controls every citizen, but every citizen, or at least the hacker - chosen as the treasure of the citizen - the secrets of the power can be experienced.
But how can a power that is no longer capable of fulfilling its own secrets?
It agrees that George Simmel has already said that a real secret is an empty secret (and an empty secret can never be understood); it is also true that any knowledge of the character Berlusconis or marks on the ground is a secret free of secret, since it is priced by the public sphere; but in the style of WikiLeaks, it is clear that the secrets of Hillary Clinton were empty secrets, meaning that they should be exercised by any power.
WikiLeaks did neither Sarkozy nor Merkel wrong, but against Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this disease that has been added to such a powerful force?
It is obvious that in the future, the States will no longer put any stored information online - which would be equivalent to an extension attached to the street corner.
But it's also obvious that it's done with the current technologies to hope to keep confidential reports on the phone secret.
Nothing is easier than to find out if and when a Head of State has moved into a plane and contacted a colleague.
How could relations be maintained in the future private and only for certain ears?
I know very well that my predictions at the moment are based on science fiction and romance, but I see it necessary to present to me the government's agents, moving in secret and in a manner that is uncontrollable on uncontrollable routes, their communications are nothing other than in the memory of itself, and in addition to the few written information they have received, hide in the covert.
The information would be stored in closed drawers only: the spy test of Watergate would have been less successful than WikiLeaks.
I had the opportunity to write that technology is now moving forward as a cancer, i.e. going back.
A century after the wireless telegraph had revolutionized communication, the Internet reconstructs a telegraph with (telephonic) wire.
The (analogous) video cassettes had enabled film researchers to discover a band band by being able to jump from behind and all the secrets of the mount, while today's (numerical) CDs do nothing but jump from chapter to chapter, so in macroports.
The high-speed train takes you within three hours from Rome to Milan, while this takes about three and a half hours per aircraft, including the transfer.
It is therefore not unusual for policy and communication technology to return to cars and horses.
A last observation.
In earlier times, the press tried to understand what had been done for secrets between the messengers.
At present it is the messages that require confidential information from the press.
Climate: how France looks at its financial commitments
A year after the Copenhagen Treaty, it is time to examine the compliance of the rapidly resolved financing commitments (also called "fast start" or early financing) which have been implemented by the developing countries.
And they've already discovered the grave French beauty.
With the Copenhagen Treaty, developing countries have committed themselves to providing $30 billion between 2010 and 2012.
The EU has promised EUR 7.2 billion over three years, France EUR 1.26 billion (i.e. 420 million per year).
On the basis of the opening of COP16, the EU has drawn up all registers to convince its partners of the fact of its commitment to the fixed-start funding: detailed progress report of its Member States, press conference, large events, distribution of brochures.
The operation transparency is noted and graded for its actual value: developing countries and civil society would like to see if all developed countries do the same at the same level of precision.
The EU announced its release in 2010 of EUR 2.2 billion, which will lead to the correct way of respecting its commitment to 7.2 billion in 2012.
But if you look into detail, things are a little more complicated.
This money should be "new and additional" according to the Copenhagen Treaty in order to ensure that an additional use has been made, without access to public development aid.
Unfortunately there is no consensus on what "new and additional" means.
While the EU Commission has proposed harmonisation, certain Member States, including France, have blocked the procedure.
Today everyone chooses the value that he considers best.
For example, the EU Commission has set itself out as a guide for those in 2009: international funding will be maintained and 150 million will be available for three years under the "Fast Start" funding.
Other countries have chosen similar guidelines, either for the year or for conditions at the level of public development aid.
In contrast, France was of the opinion that the funding "all new projects" in 2010 would be "new and additional".
In other words, there are no guidelines for the expenditure of the previous year or at the global level of public development aid.
In concrete terms, the total amount of French support for developing countries can remain stable (or even decrease) - France proposes to maintain its obligation with regard to "new and additional" funding.
Another crucial element is the closure of grants and loans.
There is still no rule about it, and everyone chooses his computer mode.
Some, such as France, have 1 loaned € as equivalent to 1 paid €.
Obviously, this is only difficult to represent: the measure is not comparable.
If the use of loans for certain interestable investments can be justified (often emission reduction-based projects based on the most effective technology) it is difficult to present the euro which is agreed upon as equivalent to a loan for a loan... It should also be considered only the cost of the loan for the capital master country as an undertaking (i.e. the equivalent of a interest rate).
But France has nothing other than the following: it 'respects' its commitment of 420 million euros by taking 91.5% loans (389.8 million euros) and spending 8.5%) - see also the EU document to convince itself.
France is the only country in the EU to use large-scale loans.
Germany requires 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia (including Slovakia) to comply with their obligations to 100% with expenses.
In other words, when the majority of the European Union spends 1 € on the fulfilment of its obligations, France has just 10 cents and has a comparable use.
Beautiful Hokuspokus!
In general, France operates in its fixed-start financing with a double speed: to one part with a further development of the action over time and to the other part with the reality of financial use.
France is able to believe that it has spent 420 million "new and additional" millions in line with its commitments and will divide by EUR 36.1 million.
The management of the Ministry of Finance (which seems to have been Bercy who has carried out the arbitration) could have a double negative effect on itself; once in the EU (why do other Member States continue to borrow if it is sufficient) and then in the negotiations, since developing countries do not allow them to be fully satisfied...
The chapter of frozen funding is only a small question for relatively short time compared to the whole of climate discussions.
But it could be too much in the immanent machinery of UNFCCC.
We hope this won't be the case.
As always, it is essential to learn his lesson from this first year's spring funding.
In the first line, France could announce a change in its consumption type for 2011 and 2012, while respecting its obligations and equal justice with the other countries of the European Union.
In particular, France could bring forward discussions on the nature of the long-term financing (a different, decisive and currently under discussion): it is not the question of the "recalibibility" or the nature of its borrowing.
France could change its position in order to be as progressive with regard to the issue of conflict as it is with other things.
The hope is therefore based on the new Minister for Environment Kosciusko Morizet, which will be held in Cancun next week.
An amazing announcement about the firm start of France and its vision of "reliability" as well as the use of loans would be based on nature from the international trust base, which is necessary for further discussions.
Alarm - from children’s own pesticides
A 10-year-old child takes over day 81 different chemical substances, so a study published this Wednesday by the Association of Generations Futures (formerly movement for the protection of rights and respect for future generations) was published.
The association, which stated that its results "in view of the low number of analyses, did not reflect any statistically significant value, but represented an illustration character of the problem being dealt with", had generally been bought between July and September from a child about ten years of age for food consumed at meals plus an intermediate time in the supermarkets in Oise and Paris.
These typical meal times - including the official recommendations of five fresh fruit and fruit components, three milk products and 1.5 litres of water per day - were also examined as well as by laboratories in the search for chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals and other harmful substances.
The teller balance is low: 81 chemical substances, of which 42 are classified as possibly or possibly cancer-resistant and five are classified as safe carcinogens, as well as 37 substances with endocrine disruptive factor, according to studies of several institutions such as the International Cancer Research Centre.
"Even if the legal limits for any chemical, individually appropriate substance are not exceeded in the vicinity of the case, however, it is very good to note that the reality in which the consumer may be exposed to cancer-related substances or substances with endocrine disruptive factors is concerned," notes the Association.
At breakfast alone, butter and tea with milk already contain more than ten of the potentially cancerous residues and three safely identified as carcinogens, as well as more than twenty residues that can affect the hormone system.
The apple imported from Brazil, as an intermediate time for the study, shows traces of six chemical substances, including a ban on fungicide in France.
The same applies to green beans from Kenya, which are included in the lunches where the study has established traces of a strictly prohibited insecticide in the EU.
In addition, the hackstick, the thunfish from the trunk, even the baguette and the caucagum of pesticides and other chemical substances were sprayed.
The analysis has brought into light the presence of nitrates and chlorforms.
During the evening, the lax stack with 34 detected chemical residues was the "richest" and even the plastic platers used to heat the meal in the microwave were not unloaded.
The ultimate risk of this "drug cocktail" for consumers is "probably underestimated", says the study.
The Alliance Europe Ecology-Les Verts (EE-LV) has proposed "in view of the urgency of the situation" to introduce a moratorium on the use of pesticides in order to stop the "intention of civilisation diseases".
In July a study by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) identified 365 different pesticides identified in fruit and vegetables, which are consumed in Europe, including 76 in cereals.
