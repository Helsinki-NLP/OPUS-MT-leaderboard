There was a 9-year-old boy at Tampere's.
The police have been looking for a 9-year-old boy because of his car accident in Tampere last night.
The report on a boy leaving from West Tampere with his friend has been published in the social media.
According to the police station, his son has been contacted, and he does not have a risk to his life and health.
The boy's father told the Night Sanomi that he had found the boy.
He's all right, and now we're starting to figure out what's going on.
The boy was found from the neighborhood of the house, Dad told me.
Ronaldo again soon - repi painting in the Messiah
Christian Ronaldo took five maps over Spain for a weekend and continued his work over the Masters.
Lionel Messin and Christian Ronaldo's view of the Masters' overcrowding turned at least for at least a moment into the last success.
Real Madrid Ronaldo moved alone to the top of all time's groundbreaking statistics when he shot a visitor on the Shahtar Donetsk network two pieces of punishment and one game situation.
Ronaldo won his 80th medal before he joined him in a match at Barcelona's Messil. He has 77 pieces.
Real won the prize 4-0.
Juventus is originally composed of Italian football in Series A, but in the Masters' D-class, it started with a 2-1-way force from Manchester City.
The winning board made a ten-minute round before the end of the Youth Alvaro Morata.
The city's attack was triggered by an infuriating Sergei Aguero.
Aguero, who died during the weekend's election, came to the field only in the last ten minutes.
Also, Manchester's second U.S. follower experienced severe PSV Endhoven in the Netherlands with 1-2 hit.
Luke Shaw, a 20-year-old deputy in Manu, will be visiting for only one hour.
The PSV's dangerous escape from Hector Moren came to the ground towards an attack on ManU package so badly that Shaw probably broke down the roof.
Shaw was born in Eindhoven, about ten minutes before the medical staff sent her to the hospital.
Memphis Depay took you to the 1-0-minute tour, but ManU's pleasure lasted only a few minutes.
Moreno had a fever before he had an extra time.
The PSV battle hall was built by Luciano Narsing on the other side.
Over the course of the painting, the A-group of the Masters started Paris Saint-Germain.
In this case, the Austrian Angel Di Maria was replaced by the PSG in addition to the Manchester Unit.
Di Maria walked right through the palace and ended up on the ground floor of Malmö, Johan Willand.
Edinson Cavani made another half for PSG 2-0.
PSG has been neglected in a group of successful people.
The assumption is not wrong, but Malmö, which is too small, is not the best possible comparison.
For the first time, PSG's Starfleet Zlatan Ibrahimovic first met his professional director at Malmö FF.
Ibrahimovic started his career in Malm in 1999.
Roman Eremenko played 90 minutes when his team Moskova TsSKA disappeared at the B-band in Germany to Wolfsburg 0-1.
The opposition party immediately asked for a divorce - Mr President, it was wrong.
The president of Zimbabwe, Robert Mugabe, spoke the same way he had been holding a month ago.
President of Zimbabwe, Robert Mugabe, has been holding the country's parliament once again in the same speech as he had at the end of last month.
Mugabe did not obviously feel the same way during his 25-minute speech.
The speech raised doubts as to whether the 91-year-old Mugabe is in full power.
The MDC’s lead party asked Mugabe to separate because this is too old to manage.
Mugaben's assistants rushed to say that the disturbance had only occurred in Mugaben's presence and that the President had done nothing wrong.
Mugaben spoke earlier and now China's impact on the country's economy.
Germany and Austria want an overarching summit on refugee crisis
Germany and Austria have introduced a summit of EU leaders for the first week because of the refugee crisis.
Mr Tusk, President-in-Office of the European Council for Summits, assessed the request.
According to the German Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel, the Heads of State should discuss cooperation with the countries of origin and how Europe can be more effectively registered.
The negotiations on quotas for asylum seekers are based on the table of Ministers of the Interior, according to Merkel.
A teacher will admit that his girlfriend was shot during an emergency call
I'm just saying a little bit of color college teacher Shannon Lamb tells the police during the emergency call that he shot his girlfriend and that the police should come to their house.
Lamb stressed that his "cult dog" is alive and is probably upset, and said that after her death the contact details of the woman’s neighbors are found on this phone.
Inside the hall, the police found Amy Prentiss' body and a message written on the page of hate: "I am so sorry I wish I could take this dear Amy and he is the only woman who has ever loved me," says the letter that experts have signed Lambin.
Nothing mentioned that Lamb, who taught two online courses at the University of Minnesota Cleveland Delta State, had already traveled nearly 500 kilometers to a school campus where the police believed in his shooting and killing history teacher, Ethan Schmidt, at the door of this working room.
The police officer of Delta State University told Lynn Buford about the shooting at the university staff at 10.18 p.m.
He said Lambin called his emergency call sometime after that.
By the end of the day, the number of dead had risen again: Lamb committed suicide by restricting himself to the police.
The authorities were still trying to figure out Lambin’s motif day after the students and the staff had completed school shooting behind closed doors.
On both sides of the state, researchers have published information that shows students and staff portrayed Lambia as a gift teacher, but where problems were likely.
The students told me they were waiting for her feelings.
I'm pressing the death camp, Gautier, the police say that the Lamb has not been a violent past or a criminal record.
Schmidt himself had included Lambin in his book, where he thanked "the wonderful people" with whom he spent his academic life.
Both taught at a social and historical institution with a total of 17 members, and many of the students took part in the courses of each man.
On the other hand, there were some signs of problems.
A student named Brandon Beavers called for Lambia, but he said that he also felt nervous and unscathed, "no one like anything would have been in the body."
Another student named Michael Sykes told Lambin that he had a lot of stress at the end of 2014-15.
Lamb had previously asked for a patient from Delta State University to say he had some health problems.
This year, he taught only two online courses.
The recent changes in university wage principles meant that although Lamb had worked very hard in front of his doctorate, it did not provide him with an automatic development and an assistant professor's office.
The director of the university, William LaForge, said that there was no conflict between Lambin and Schmidt to know, but that "the Lamb obviously had something in mind".
Lamb can no longer answer these questions.
After Lamb was thrown out of the camp, the police came after him when he moved back to Mississippi from the state of Arkansas.
Before he was arrested, Lamb shot himself at a .38-calyptic gun at one of the back of a house about half a mile south of his parents' house in the city of Mississippi Greenville, told the death investigator in Washington, D.C.
Lambin's car was still on the road.
It wasn't clear why Lamb went to this house right away, even though Johnson said he believed Lamb knew people there.
The lamb was caught in the area.
Lamb started his work at the University in 2009 and learned the landscape and growth report. He has 3500 students and is located in a city with about 12,000 inhabitants.
Lamb conducted a doctoral examination in the spring of growth.
One of Lambin's old friends described him as smart, charismatic and fun.
Carla Hairston told me she was 15 years old and Lamb was 20 when they met together with friends.
Her friend was in school, and Lamb was happy, the older friend who had been trying to teach her to play guitar for many years.
He was almost a vampire at those times.
All the girls were naked when she was in her place, told 40-year-old Hearston, who lives in Jackson's capital city in Brandon.
The Lamb and the Prentiss had apparently been tracking for some time.
In an emergency call, Lamb told his wife that he had killed her, but there is no evidence in their marriage.
They had a bright name for a dog who lived with them at the railway station in Gautier.
The police told me the dog was okay.
Prentisses, former husband Shawn O'Steen, told them that they were separated 15 years ago, but they were still friends. They now have a 19-year-old daughter.
"He's really upset," O'Stee described his daughter.
He was his mother's best friend.
O'Steen said he didn't meet Lambia, but he had heard his daughter from Abigail that Lamb was interested in music and called blues.
Lamb met Prentiss, when Lamb and Abigail were both on the Mediterranean market three years ago.
Later, they called together on some occasions.
O'Steen told me his daughter's doing and singing her own music.
The press was a nurse who worked for many different web companies.
The Julep Rome bar, which is located near Gautier, says that he saw Lambin and Prentiss last September 5th, when Lamb had ended his guitar and vocal show for a rare public.
Nothing had any effect on her being a coward.
"Only a happy couple," he said.
We played games and we threw hooks to each other.
So they were both pretty good-looking.
The dead teacher Schmidt conducted the first year's seminary program and had been dedicated to Indians and transfer time history, told school English teacher Don Allan Mitchell.
Schmidt was married, and he had three small children.
He studied at the University of Kansas Emporia State, as well as the president of his brotherhood and school management.
On Tuesday evening in Cleveland, Delta Staten campaign was held with a payroll involving about 900 people, including teaching and other persons, students and members of the community.
Schmidt's wife Liz and brother Jeff Schmidt also took part in the show, during which the University's fire sang songs to Bright Morning Star and Amazing Grace.
The teaching continues in the middle of the week.
"We're trying to get our students back," LaForge said.
The crisis is over.
Now's the time to meet.
Amy and Rogelio Solis reported from Mississippi Cleveland.
Written by Emily Wagster Pettus of Mississippi Greenville and Rebecca Santana New Orleans, Associated Press participated in the report.
This has been corrected by the fact that the police now say Lambin's emergency call after Schmidt was shot, and that although Lamb referred to his Prentissian wife during the call, there is no evidence that they were married.
Toys R Us is planning to hire less workers for the rest of the day
Toys R Us says that it does not pay as many workers as last year's holidays, but the resellers of toys and baby products say that present-day permanents and cookers are given the opportunity to do more.
According to the company, it is planning to hire 40,000 people to work in movements and distribution centres in different parts of the country when there were 45,000 employees in 2014.
Most of the work is part-time.
The company said that the applicant's challenges began this month, and the number of staff rose from October to December.
Although there are months of holiday time, Christmas shopping is approaching, and companies are preparing to hire temporary workers to assist in the promotion of sales and in the sale, delivery and delivery of products.
Michael J. Fox jokes about "his date" with Princess Diana
Back in the future, Michael J. Fox had a very important moment.
It was also valuable for personal reasons.
"We were sitting in the theater waiting for the king's arrival, and I realized that my sitting next to me was empty, and then I realized that Princess Diana's place was next to me," he said the next documentary back in Time trailer.
The film begins and I think I'm just celebrating that I'm only in touch with the fact that I'm in touch with Princess Wallace.
Back in Time is a document on the future of Foxa, Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as the leader of Robert Zemeckis and producer director Steven Spielberg.
Back in the future, he won his first victory 30 years ago.
Spielberg said, "I don't think it's the best time for me."
Back in Time is available on TV, on DVD and on some movies in October.
The UN leader says that Syria's situation is not to be resolved by armed forces
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon's answer to Russia's increasing military support for Syria is that this nearly five years of conflict "will not resolve by armed means" and more will only increase violence and the suffering of millions of people.
The Head of the United Nations again called on all parties, including the UN Security Council, to unite and support non-discriminatory negotiations to find a political solution.
Ban told the press on Wednesday that he was going to meet with five permanent Member States - the United States, Russia, China, Britain and France - in the context of the Ministerial Conference of the General Assembly later this month to discuss Syria.
He said that the share of the Council, the people of Syria and the regional authorities "has made it impossible to resolve the situation."
Ban invited five permanent Member States to show solidarity and unity in dealing with the Syrian crisis, which they demonstrated in their agreement with Iran's nuclear programme.
8 of the statement of support which shows that Donald Trump is real
Some have tried to stop him from thinking he's a windmill.
The others just like him.
Some are waiting for romance.
Although some Republicans have tried to slow Donald Trump out of the church of support, it has not (yet) succeeded.
In the last 11 national cases, Donald Trump has been responsible for two-digit chapters, and some have begun seriously to understand what this means with regard to the rights of the king of the province.
That's what's going on at the beginning.
These results do not yet mean that Trump is likely to be a candidate for the Republicans.
The commentators note that at this stage in 2011 Rick Perry was losing his lead to Herman Cain, whose partner was unable to return to any State in the nomination process.
There are also many reasons why he would have problems in general elections.
However, foreign groups such as Jeb Bushin Super PAC and the conservative economic organization Club for Growth have taken note of the importance of Trump and began to use its resources to cover him.
The following recent submissions indicate that there is only one final stage in the village kingdom:
The rights of the trumpeter have been fully regulated.
Just before Donald Trump announced his proposal in mid-June, Monmouth University's support questions showed that only two of the ten republics had a positive attitude toward the royal palace.
By mid-June, the figure was 40%.
At the beginning of August, the figure was 52 per cent.
At this point, there are six ten Republicans with Donald Trump.
About three out of ten says they're negative.
These chapters also take their place in the first priority states.
At the University of Quinnipiac in Iowa last week, 60 per cent of the Republicans said they were in favour of Trump.
Two thirds of their Republicans would be satisfied if the Trumps were to be proposed.
In CNN/ORC's question last week 67% of the Republicans said they would either be "intensified" or "satisfied" if Trump was a candidate.
Only two out of ten said they'd be "crazed" if he had to be a candidate.
Only Ben Carson gets at the highest level of enthusiasm at the same level as Trump (43% "innocent" vs. Trump 40%).
Next, the most exciting?
Marco Rubio's only 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47 per cent of the Republican citizens would be "unsatisfied" or "crazed" if they were to be proposed by the rulers.
The coming nature of Trump is not a problem for most Republicans.
Although Donald Trumpia has been widely criticised by his powerful speech and speech, on Monday, 52 per cent of the voters prized by the Republicans at the national level think that the Kingdom language is an appropriate quality for the President.
According to Quinnipiac last week's questionnaire, the number in the country in which the first half of the meeting was held is the same: 52% of Republicans think that Trumpil has a quality of nature for the leader.
However, according to the ABC/Post question, 44 per cent think that his nature does not apply to his presidential operation, and nearly six tenths of them agree that his nature is not part of the White House.
The people of the Republic are aware of the idea.
When the Republicans think like the commentators, they think that Trump is a real option.
According to the CNN/ORC questionnaire, the four ten were likely to be considered to be the most likely alternative to the question of who was most likely to be considered a candidate for the Republicans.
By the end of July, four out of ten had supported Jeb Bush.
Information publication: The Republican voter has not always been using a church-based crystal ball.
The last election of about four ten Republicans at this time was to consider Rick Perry to be a candidate, and only 28 per cent supported the final candidate, Mitt Romney.
In any case, this shows that most of the voters in the Republican party consider the Trump campaign to be credible.
Although the Republicans would be able to support another candidate, Trump would still win almost everyone.
Some commentators have noted that the Cypriot field is likely to have promoted the direction of the Trump because the opposition of the Trump has been divided between numerous other candidates.
However, at the beginning of September of Monmouth University, the question showed that in a hypothetical two-dimensional crisis between Trump and almost all other Republican candidates, Trump will receive majority support in almost all cases.
He leads Carly Fiorina on 13 points, Marco Rubiota on 14 points, Walker on 15 points, Jeb Bushia on 19 points, and Rand Paulia, John Kasichia and Chris Christie on every 33 points.
He's on the stairs with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate to win from Trump?
If they were set against them, Ben Carson would win the 18-point deal with the businessman from Trump.
That is exactly what most of the supporters of Donald Trump have been told by making a decision.
The new CBS/NYT question from the headlines shows that only a few more than half of the supporters of the trumpet have decided who will be voting for them.
Of course, the situation can change, and no one can be absolutely sure that he will never change his mind.
46% said they could possibly change the candidate.
In any case, the biggest competitors in Trump are currently another unlikely winner, neurosurgery Ben Carson, but the voters who said they made a decision are twice as likely as possible on the side of Trump.
Six out of ten Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
Since two months ago, when Donald Trump called Mexican immigrants in his campaign initiative speech "simply", the migration has been at the heart of the 2016 debate.
Some are concerned about the fact that the President of Trump is driving Latin voters away from the Republican side and harming the re-enterprises.
According to a new ABC/Post survey published on Monday, six out of ten Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
So it turns out that as long as migration is at the centre of matters, so is Donald Trump.
The collapse of the government has reached a new peak.
The support of Donald Trump and Ben Carson now covers about half of the Republicans, leading to a large part of their position outside politics.
Six out of ten Republicans said on Monday in the ABC/Post question that they prefer to choose a foreign political person as an experienced government.
They're also hostile to the federal government.
Two weeks back Des Moines Register/Bloomberg's questionnaire from Iowa showed that three fourths of the Republican Republican have destroyed the Republicans at the congress: 54% are "unsatisfied" and 21% "real enemies".
Jeremy Corby's presidency at the Prime Minister's hour of question
Corby's initialisation of the questionnaire has been eagerly expected since his election
The new Head of the Labour Party, Jeremy Corby, will meet David Cameron for the first time at the Prime Minister's interview.
Corbyn will rise to ask the first six questions after a few half days, and likely both the media and the representatives of the working party will take a close look at his performance.
Corbyn has called for this weekly show "lower theater and more facts".
He has also said that he could leave some of the opportunities for his colleagues to be treated.
This meeting is the first parliamentary trial for Corby's leadership after he was appointed to the Secret Service and he spoke at the annual meeting of the Central Organisation of the professions.
At the same time, the decision of the Head of the Labour Party of the Seventeenth National Assembly in the Memorial Service, which was held on the 75th day of the British Air Force, has raised appreciation for the role of the Conservative Party's representatives and has appeared in many priority cases.
Corby's decision to be a national song has highlighted
Corby's representative said his "dearly silent" and that he recognizes "the play of royal air forces in the Ison-British Air Force."
Corby's secretary, Owen Smith, told the BBC Town Newsnight programme that he would have invited the head of the national parliament to sing despite the fact that he thought the palace should be stopped.
Nearly a thousand foreign ministers have refused to be involved in the differences between the internal Corbyns in economic, defence and external matters.
BBC policy writer Robin Brant says that the position on the part of the liner in the European Union and the government's aid test have also been "used" within the part of the working party after Corby's appointment.
Corbyn said at a meeting of the Central Organization of the United Nations that the working party would present a change that would remove the entire gap.
A few hours later, Mr Smith, Secretary of the Ministry of Labour and Pension, said that the party was "very clear" in relation to the fact that they only opposed the government's plans to reduce the scope of 26 000 pounds to 230000.
Corbynis will be the fifth Head of the Labour Force, whom David Cameron has met during the last decade when he has been head of the Conservative Party.
The Labour Party leader has agreed to a new approach policy and now says that he has "grouped" ideas to the Prime Minister for issues and has received more than 30,000 proposals.
Mr Corbyn, rapporteur for the Islington North Region, has said that the nature of the Prime Minister's questionnaires is too contradictory and that he intends to hold on to both a short word and a ban on serious matters such as poverty, diversity and the challenges of young people.
Corbyn has said that the Economic Officer for Foreign Affairs Angela Eagle is acting in his place in those hours when Corby's not involved, for example when Cameron's out there.
Corbyn has also proposed that other colleagues may sometimes be allowed to use speakers, and he has said that he is close to the chairman of the conference room, John Bercowia, on the subject.
When Cameron got up in 2005, he said he wanted to move away from a political theater, which is often combined with the Prime Minister's opinions, but he later had to admit his failure.
From the time they were started on television in 1990, the Prime Minister's polling hour has been an important measure in assessing the ability of the director, his sub-room management, and his position among several other representatives of the peoples, even though the assessors have criticised the issue of having become a mere figurine which requires long-term reforms.
Photos in Joburg: Unaccompanied young people are trained as photographers
It's hard for Johannesburg to be homeless.
However, a group of former Catholic children have found a way to learn art and serve life.
'I was shot in Joburg' is an unintended study where young people are taught how to take pictures in their neighborhoods and to win it.
The BBC News met one of the first young people prepared for the project.

Red value rises as the rate of the Iso-British increase
The red value jumped up after the numbers showed rise in the UK wage growth, while FTSE 100 grew through SABMiller.
Between May and July, the United Kingdom's wages, including bonuses, rose by 2.9 per cent over the same period in the last year.
The growth rate was rapid after 2009, and it was considered to be an assessment of the adjustment of the rates.
The point rose over $1,5505 per cent and EUR 0.84 per cent against EUR 1,3730.
The FTSE 100 index closed at 1.49 per cent to read 6229.21.
SABMiller was the most fragmented part of the markets and increased by 20 per cent after the offer of AB InBev to competitors.
The agreement would bring together two major pressures from the world and other fuels such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry’s share increased by 0.9 per cent after the competitive escape product group from Richmont received encouraging news.
The newest sales prices in Richemont were expected better, and they also showed that sales in China - which is Burberry's opening market - had started to grow again.
Glencoren shares increased by 5 per cent after the grower said it had collected $2.5 billion by calculating shares as part of its debt management strategy.
The World's Packaging and Paper Group had the largest index of discounts 4.3 per cent after Goldman Sachs changed his recommendation to "sale" business.
JD Sports increased by 3.1 per cent after the company published its production for a half year prior to the tax year: 83 per cent increased by 46.6 million points.
According to the director of JD Sports, higher wages can damage enlargement
JD Sports, director of the company Peter Cowgill, says that if the minimum wage for workers is raised in the United Kingdom, it can mean "potential consumer purchasing power increases".
However, this purchasing power is not likely to exceed the higher labour costs incurred by the company, Cowgill realizes.
The costs could be focused on the company's expansion plans, which would include less jobs.
Metcash is beginning to campaign against Aldi's invasion of the Red Cross
Metcash is trying to protect his IGA son from Aldi's attack in South and West Australia.
Metcash has launched a food market campaign to defend the market share of IGA-competitions in South and West Australia before Aldin's assault of $700 million.
At the same time, Metcash and IGA supermarkets strengthen their relations with local food providers and build IGA brands through the marketing of both media and public transport and social media, as well as events such as the Adelaide show.
IGA's traders and buyers have agreed, and fires such as Dunsborough's icemaker Simmo's offer masters in IGA's trades, and trade owners sell low price lifts to the customers of the Australian football industry.
Metcash is expected to reveal further details of its defence strategy on 29 September when this food, alcohol and rail aid sales are organised on the annual day of the investor strategy.
There is much in the game, as South and West Australia totals nearly 30 per cent of the area of the Metcash IGA, and its production margins are higher than those of the Metcash Eastern IGA network.
Travellers in South and West Australia are well known for their brands, and IGA resellers have a much higher market share than in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland: more than 30 per cent in the south and 24 per cent in the west compared to 14 per cent in Western countries.
However, analysts like Morgan Stanley believe that Aldi will capture about 5% of these two countries' food markets by opening first movements within 12 months.
In his weekly report, Morgan Stanley’s analyst Tom Kierath estimated that IGA’s resellers could spend up to $360 million a year on sale and Metcash could spend $250 million by the end of 2016.
This forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will first open business in the south 25 and in the west 30 years, resulting in 500 and 600 million dollars of trade in these areas.
The loss of food and food sales and prices at the Metcash High Fixed Cost Support Point may pay Metcashi some $13 million for non-trafficking prior to the rise and taxes, Kierath said.
At the same time, Metcash loses market share in Western countries mainly to Aldi and Coles, although in a young study, Roy Morgan found that IGA's customers were the most reliable.
Morgan Stanley believes that Metcash's food and food sales will fall by 3.8 per cent in 2016; 4.1 per cent in 2017 and 2.1 per cent in 2018, so that its market share will fall from 14 per cent in 2015 to 10.3 per cent in 2020.
Last week, the managing director of the investment fund and the founder of the Magellan Financial Group Hamish Douglas said in Melbourne that Metcash could "lost as much as possible within ten years".
Metcash has refused to respond publicly to Douglas's comments.
However, it has been understood that a member of the Metcash Government would have been contacted by Douglas last week.
The IGA market share has decreased by 18 per cent since 2010 to 14 per cent, and products from Metcash's food and food business which ranges products to approximately 1200 IGA resellers have decreased by 43 per cent after 2012.
However, aid sales hold half and have invested more than 150 million dollars per year in reducing the prices of the products per week at the same level as Coles and Woolworths, helping IGA resellers to improve their sales prices by increasing faster production of food and by introducing better-elected products on the market.
President Ian Morrice of Metcash says that the reduction of prices and the adjustment of sales volumes have increased the veto power, and he hopes that aid sales will return to production growth in 2017 for the first time four years.
President of the Australian Tennis Union Steve Healthy supports Thanasi Kokkinakis
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves more honor than criticism of its use
Thanasi Kokkinakis has had to suffer as a minor in a recent massacre, which has raged around his friend Nick Kirkios. He deserves more honor than criticism of his own use, says President Steve Healy of the Australian Tennis Union.
A two-year-old member of Kokkinakis, called "Special Ks", was obliged to make a public case in Kyrgyzstan in which Stan Wawlinkaa competed in Montreal Masters.
Shortly after this, in the next court case in Cincinnati, the Chief Justice had to separate Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison from each other when Harrison announced: "Wawrinkana should have been looking for Kyrdios, and I should have opened that box."
Although Kokkinakis was last seen running his mail after the cramping of his potential victory from Richard Gasquet in the US Open, Healy has been an innocent defender of Kokkinakis.
Right now, the young man is in Glasgow in competition with Sam Grothin from another place in the two games with Bernard Tomic in the British semifinals Davis Cup.
"I'm pretty strong enough to think that Thanas has just been taken to his grave," Healy said.
He broke his mail to destroy his mail because of a crack in the US Open, but he's not the first player to break his mail when it's destroyed, and I know Thanas well enough for me to know that he's not proud of it.
But he's been doing very well, even in pretty provoscal situations with US Open Harrison and still, and I think he deserves bodies.
He has a great team around him, he has a great family around him, and I think he's been treated a little badly.
He is very capable at 19 years of age, he works hard, adapts to the group and so on, and has never had problems with other players. He is appreciated in the dressing room, he works hard, is well well, and is very peaceful and capable young man, and I think he should consider them according to his reasons.
Healy has also supported the decision to be taken by Kyrugi on Friday to begin important games in describing this "common decision" for all of your good solutions, but I still support Canberra's return to the group's insurance office.
"We want the group to be fully focused on games and not all around [Cyrgyos]," Healy said.
And Nick has been judged really fast, as Federer and Murray have noticed, and he's grown up in the public, and has made some terrible mistakes and deserves everything he gets. But we're trying to support him, we're trying to help him understand the consequences of his actions, and I believe that it's best for both the group and for him if he spends some time away from the public on the basis of these consequences.
European migration crisis: Hungary announces emergency, closes borders, arrests immigrants
Hungary announced an exception and closed the southern border of Serbia with those who were trying to come to the country illegally. The aim is to overthrow the country's foreign authority.
The border was followed by chaos when hundreds of migrants gathered to an unmanned area, and the Serbian authorities reacted by earthquake.
People who have taken away their home violence have now managed their premises and have been set up for an indefinite time between the two country inspection stations.
However, there was an increase in the number of accidents.
By keeping the police helicopter on top of them, the immigrants screamed "Open the border!" and shouted insults to the Hungarian police.
Some rejected food and water as a protest.
Serbia's Foreign Minister announced that it is an "immortal welcome" for the return of displaced persons from Hungary as they get more from Macedonia and Greece all the time.
"(Serbia) wants to be part of the solution, not harming civilians.
The discussion with other countries and Brussels should take place in the near future," Ivica Dacic said in Praha.
The border between Hungary and Serbia was established after the failure of the 28th National Group to establish a common immigration policy at a relevant meeting in Brussels.
The Ministers felt the same about the 40 000 asylum seekers who are now in charge of Italy and Greece, and the ministers spoke with anticipation about reaching a final agreement - firstly in a month or firstly by the end of the year - what EU countries are taking from 120,000 additional refugees, including part of Hungary.
Germany's Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria require a few weeks of EU summits to discuss the migration crisis in the country.
However, Hungary does not hope that its neighbours or Brussels will act in the near future.
In the two southern regions, however, the emergency gave the authorities greater powers to act in the crisis and enabled you to be closed and secured.
At the same time, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said that now that they are ready to help Serbia's border, the country is also going to be able to assist the local aid component against Romania in order to stop the border of immigrants coming through the country.
CBS News's writer Charlie D'Agata reported that even prisoners had been coloured to the last place between Hungary and Serbia.
In recent months, Hungary has become the largest bottleneck and access point for refugees in the European Union, many of whom are fighting in parts of Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East.
However, Prime Minister Viktor Orban has claimed that most of the beneficiaries are economic refugees seeking a better life, and not those who are entitled to protection - this view is strongly in conflict with other EU countries, including Germany.
New laws, which came into force in Hungary on Wednesday, now define the crime to exceed or damage the company from 4 metres (13 feet) to a local time limit built by the government against the southern border of Serbia, as well as contain longer prison sentences for convicted human beings.
"Because of the situation caused by mass migration, the Hungarian government announces an emergency," said newsman Zoltan Kovacs to journalists in the south of the city of Szeged.
In fact, we are very clear: Crossing the line is a crime.
Parliament still has to accept the military position expected for the first week, but the Associated Press suppliers at the border have seen the heavily armed military personnel on vehicles and dogs for days.
Orban's home security adviser, Gyorgy Bakondi, said that the authorities had arrested 45 people in their attempt to cross the border and 15 more long-lasting countries.
They got over their pain in helping, are now a police prisoner, and they are accused of crimes defined in new laws.
Officials are quick to fix help.
On Tuesday, the Hungarian authorities also shut down two of the seven outposts across the border against Serbia after they had sent one of these places to hide behind the border.
On the border near Unkar Roszkea was hidden in a cave when the Hungarians opened a small metal bag for the treatment of people and the force forces gathered inside the roof.
About 20 came in, but thousands remained outside.
A group of immigrants supported the main motorists between Serbia and Hungary saying they refused food and drink until they were allowed to come to Hungary.
2016 options: According to a national survey, Hillary Clinton's leadership in Bernie Sanders has retired
Former Foreign Minister Hillary Clinton continues in a double-numbered democracy, but Senator Bernie Sanders wrote to him.
Clinton now supports 47% of the voters (58% down), while Sandersia, on the other hand, supports 27% (17% new).
The Vice-President Joe Biden has not yet announced whether he will go to the presidential election, but he will support 15 per cent of the voters.
More than five months before the presidential beginning, most of the Democrats realize that it is too late to say that they would have decided who they were voting.
However, Clinton's supporters stand behind their own choice more than the supporters of other candidates.
Clinton's recommendation has been reduced by several population groups in the last few months following a CBS News Poll survey, and at the same time Sanders has raised some blood.
Clinton is a strong leader in women's and Maltese couples, but his lead has been delayed.
Her advice in a couple of men has been very low, and Sanders is only 5 percent behind.
Clinton's success is now at the level of 50-year-old Democrats, and he's at the level with Sanders.
However, Clinton clearly leads the couple of senior voters.
In the last month, Clinton led Sandersian with a tuplan numeral on the liberal couple, but now Sanders is leading this group by five percentage points.
About half of the country's democratic supporters say they are actively supporting Clinton if he becomes a candidate for the party.
Fourthly, he claims to support him in some way, and 15 percent would only support him because he is a candidate.
Six percent wouldn't support him at all.
It is not surprising that Clinton's current supporters are very likely to be very active in supporting him.
Opinions are more common than those who do not support Clinton right now - only the fourth would give him an insatiable support.
In which 48% of the voters say they are actively supporting Clinton, the Republican joint husband Donald Trump says the latter (35%).
When Clinton's supporters were asked in an open question why they wanted him to be a candidate, the recommended answer was that he had a suitable experience (16 per cent). Afterwards the most recommended answers were that there is now a right time for the President (13 per cent) and that he is the best candidate (10 per cent).
Clinton's supporters also mentioned his contact with Bill Clinton (9 per cent).
The same opinions and the possibility of making a complaint were also mentioned.
Since the Vice-President is acting on the proposal for a possible presidential election, 57% of the Democrats would like to see him in the event - even if there are different opinions for the third time.
In asking who of the democratic parties they chose for the second half, Biden is the preferred choice.
In the middle of Clinton's supporters, over half say they chose Biden, which is much more popular than Sanders.
If Biden decides to be an unintended democratic proposal, Hilary Clinton's leadership will grow from Sanders. If Biden says he's leaving, it's 20% units, but if he's leaving, it's 30.
55% of Democrats believe that Clinton has the best opportunity to win the presidential election, but this figure has fallen from 78% over the last month.
By this measure, Biden remains long, but the proportion of those who consider him to be the most vocalist has grown.
However, when asked what is most important in the proposal by the Democratic People's Republic of the Congo, they held opinions on the need to vote.
Nor has any democratic candidate or potential candidate been considered unable to propose to these voters in the last month.
Democratic candidates or potential candidates are very well equipped in certain openings in the middle of their seats.
Most of Clinton, Sanders and Bidenia are considered real, reliable and strong leaders.
Biden will succeed in three most honest ways, while Clinton's strength is the lead.
30 per cent of Democrats say they do not consider Clinton real and reliable, which is twice as much as Sanders (15 per cent), but 27 per cent say they do not have an opinion on Sanders.
Democrats also generally consider Clinton, Sanders and Biden to be idealistic.
When we look at all these obstacles, about a quarter of the Democrats say they have no idea of Sanders.
Although Hillary Clinton's personal e-mail address and the use of the service as a foreign minister still raises questions, most of the Democrats are satisfied with his explanation and say that it has not affected their public opinion.
However, it is different when it comes to America as a whole.
Half of the Americans are now dissatisfied with his explanation, and only about three thirds are satisfied.
The people’s opinions were divided in March shortly after the day came.
Most Americans say that the e-mail did not affect their overall message about Clinton, although 36% said that their opinion was wrong.
More than six ten Republicans say that their views of Clinton have become worse.
Although Clinton's own voters consider him true and reliable, this is still a problem among all registered voters. Only 32% consider him true and reliable, and this figure has been estimated 8 percent since the last month and 15 percent since May.
62% of registered voters say they do not consider Clinton to be real and reliable.
At the same time, 55 per cent of registered voters throughout the country do not consider Trump to be real and reliable either.
However, both Clinton and Trump are considered a good leader.
Six of the candidates involved in the study are considered to be more realistic.
Sanders is generally considered to be true, but many do not have his opinion, just like Carson's.
The error margin in the study involving 351 Democrats is 6 per cent.
Ben Carson is approaching Donald Trump on a national issue
Ben Carson comes to Donald Trump near the latest CBS News/New York Time issue
Two of the candidates gathered on the new question, half of them in all voices, leaving others to fight against the fraud.
Through the Republicans, the country is still strongly supporting the country, whose support has grown earlier, from 23 per cent of CBS's CBS issue in the last month to 27 per cent of the issue published.
At the same time, however, Carson grew from six per cent to 23 per cent.
The question also found that Carson is very different from the various groups of Demographics and is divided into the centre of the High-level Republican Representatives of the Trump.
The end of the field has been after, without exception, Carly Fiorinaa and Ohio Governor John Kasachia. Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker's support has been estimated at the highest: from 10 per cent in the last month to 2 per cent.
Former Governor of Florida Jeb Bush, former Governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee and Senator Marco Rubio are in third place at 6 per cent.
The error margin for this new issue in September is +/- 6 per cent for 376 Republican nationals.
The CNN/ORC issue last week showed Carson's rise in issues: he has 19% support for the Republicans, and Trump still has 32%.
Also, according to the latest ABC News/Washington Post question, Trump was significantly ahead of Carson.
At Carson's recommendation last week, Trump criticised staying in bed with neurosurgery, even though Carso apologized for calling on Trump's faith.
"We need energy," Trump said last Sunday in his campaign contest in Iowa.
Five members of the brotherhood are charged with the death of the first-year student of Baruch College.
Nearly two years after the student died in the concentration camp at the Pennsylvania Pocono Mountains area, five people were killed.
The members of the Baruch College, Pi Delta Psi, in New York City, publicly visited Chun "Michael" Deng during the campaign in September 2013, and then delayed taking him to his hospital, thus affecting his death, the police reported.
Officials say that Deng’s eyes were tied and his face was covered with more than 13 kilograms full of dirt, after which he was repeatedly dragged to the ground when he tried to walk through the wall of a mansion towards the ground.
Finally, Deng chose to have his head hurt, and then he lost his mind.
The members of the brotherhood didn't call the emergency number Deng, but according to the charges, they waited an hour before they brought him to the hospital, the police say.
However, they had time to change Deng's clothes, find out more about his symptoms online, and contact his national president, Andy Meng, about this advice, the police officer Chris Wagner told the press.
"At this point, the members began hiding their ritual equipment and, in practice, put the welfare of the brotherhood in front of Michael Deng," said the police officer Wagner.
It wasn't gonna work, and she died the next morning.
According to the book of the Dead Sea Scrolls, Deng was given a resuscitative appearance of dust in his head, guard and travel.
" Too many families have had to suffer from the breakup of the brotherhood every year when at least one student died as a result from it since 1970," said Doug Fierberg, a representative of the Deng family, in his opinion.
Brothers and their members must receive responsibility, and this is important in the way of the authorities.
The large majority of the population of the continent were responsible for the fact that the first five members received charges for the murder of a third-level individual.
32 other members of the brotherhood, including Meng, are also guilty of violent harassment and criminal harassment.
"We do not want to be held accountable only for individuals. If there is an organization behind the event that has either formally or informally accepted the situation, they must also be held accountable," Wagner pointed out in the press.
Baruch College rejected the association of the brotherhood and the national brotherhood in its contact with the local community.
This is what happens when the Central Bank of the United States rises its peak level
The rise in fear will come and the rising price markets will be lost, the production of group books will rise and the economy will have to grow.
We know this.
What we don't know is how long this whole thing goes or how long it lasts.
The past does not give any help in the relationship between the past and the economy.
The first rise has taken only 11 months, sometimes for as long as 86 months.
The United States Central Bank's aggressiveness in rising prices has often, although not always, been determined by how economic and financial resources react.
Therefore, the officials of the Central Bank of the United States have stressed that investors should not focus on the fact that pride is raised, but rather on the trend towards normalisation of the situation in the developing world.
There's actually a lot of change.
In the end, however, market parties may find that all lead-related noise has been excessive.
"The first increase following the global economic crisis is to be interpreted without delay in some areas for the end of the 'low money' period," said Global Economics chief financial expert Julian Jessop to customers.
Instead, we do not expect the United States to return to normal, even if it is still low, to a level that many feel frightening.
However, this does not mean that it would not have any effect.
There is a test on how some economic sectors will react on the basis of the previous development:
As the market has seen over the last about a month, waiting for a rise in the herd can make the situation very uncomfortable.
When it comes to growth, the effect is not so dramatic.
"It appears that the capital product has the ability to stop for 12-24 months after the first increase, which can be reflected in the monetary policy later on," Deutsche Bank analysts said in a recent study on what happens after the Bank's collapse.
In other words, the market is generally strong over the last 35 years, about 14 per cent increase when the increase is approached, 250 days after that the situation is fairly stable (average increase of 2.6 per cent), and normality has been achieved in the last six cycle of the average product by 14.4 per cent in the last six cycle, published by the Nuveen Asset Management Company in a young analysis by Bob Doll.
According to Deutsche Bank, the impact on shares is generally clearer at a later stage of the growth cycle when the products begin to decrease.
The farmers are part of the economy, but pride often promotes their income.
In the current situation, the Central Bank has before it certain challenges that have not been before and which can speed up its recovery.
In particular, this is a gross product which must be nearly all time-consuming level before the central bank's gravity.
According to Deutsche Bank, the nominal annual GDP of 118 rose after 1950 was only under 4.5 per cent.
Although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 per cent, it is rare to believe that when the third quarter has gone by 1.5 per cent, the Atlantic Federal Reserve Bank will tell you.
The rise of the mountains in such a bad economic situation can be risky and raise the question of "is this time different", the Deutsche Bank said.
The market parties have been committed to the expansion of the central bank throughout the year, and all are waiting for a meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week, which will end as a torrent.
Although many strategies and economic experts believe that the Committee can accept an increase in this meeting, it is expected that only 25% will be possible.
"Our study shows that since 1950 all the pressure cycles have emerged twice in the supercycles where BKT has stopped moving forward very quickly after life has begun," says the report.
On the contrary, it has now been an extraordinary delay in the recovery of the damage caused by the discovery.
In modern times, the Central Bank has been more than expected to finish its last loan: the forecast has been 35 months and is now in progress for 74 months.
Strong production has also been uncertain in the waiting of markets, and the model reminds some of the findings made from the capital of some kind.
The main point is that when the central bank changes its line, its effects are seen in debt books faster than in shares.
The direction of the products of debt books appears to change immediately as regards the first increase/excessment of the cycle.
At the end of the growth cycle, the production of debt books will immediately be calculated," Deutsche Bank said.
Charles Schwab's strategies believe that the rise of peaks will lead to the approach of longer-term and short-term debt-related products, thus reducing production turnover.
High-productive group bonds are often better produced in such a situation, although "we are still careful about the search for a product", according to the constant analysis of the Schwabi product, Kathy Jones in a particular analysis.
Surprisingly yes, Jones believes that the market has already adapted to the central bank's line-up proposals.
"In addition to the calculation of the dollar's strength and inflation expectations, there are many signs that markets have adapted to more stringent monetary policy views," he wrote.
Short-term increases are higher, production fluctuations are more stable, credit margins have increased and uncertainty has increased - all of which are specific to the market when the central bank has increased its line.
In general, companies whose business is mainly located in the United States will win when the rise and local products become more attractive.
Monique companies that have a lot of debt are doing worse when the rise in dollar value makes their products the most expensive on the world market and their future becomes more expensive than their financial resources.
"History shows that the 'quality' components are generally the most productive of the first generation in three months," Goldman Sachs analysts reported to customers in their report.
Companies with a strong trade change ended up in poor trade after the 1994, 1999 and 2004 pressures on average by five percentage points.
Companies with high capital production and low volatility shares were better achieved than low-cost enterprises. The first mentioned average was 4 (percent unit) and the last 3 (per cent unit).
The brother's gonna have a big problem.
The companies that have a lot of variable debt are losing most, Goldman said.
In addition, consumers are able to benefit from an increase in the value of the dollar.
Rescuers can also win through larger products, even though experts have different opinions about how fast the impact is.
BBC Radio is a copy of Classic FM, citizen Andrew Bingham says
Conservative representative Andrew Bingham accused the channel of "citizenization"
He claims that separating it from the commercial competitor will become even more difficult.
In addition, he took into account BBC Music Awards loans saying that they only visited British Awards awards.
Commissioner Damien Collins criticised The Voicea saying that nothing is original.
The BBC Radio 3 is "changing" for Classic FM, claiming that the leading producer pressure of the production company also proves that it does something that commercial companies do not do.
Conservative rapporteur Andrew Bingham also told BBC leaders that the public service radio show had an impact on its "nationalised" content and that it is increasingly difficult to distinguish from the commercial competitor.
"It seems that Radio 3 - I don't want to use the term "citizen" - is changing to Classic FM," he said.
He also took his place in the BBC Music Awards, which was launched last December.
"Last year's BBC Music Awards will only be affected by different names under the British Awards.
So if you're trying to do something different, here's two direct examples of when you actually copied something that's already on the market," Bingham said.
The head of BBC argued that BBC Radio 3 is much ahead of its commercial competitor to live music and to share information with citizens.
Radio 3 teaches things about classical music that I can't learn from anything else.
Its commitment to live music and music is actually of primary importance.
"In addition, I think it is really important that Radio 3 is committed to finding new music and setting up new works," he said.
Earlier this year, head of BBC Radio 3, Alan Davey, said that the channel had to do more work than before for the public because the British know less about classical music.
However, Radio 3 was not the only part of the BBC's offer that was criticised at the hearing of the Committee on Culture, Media and Sports.
Conservative representative of the Tory Party Damien Collins criticised The Voicea, a music competition that BBC bought from Dutch production company Talpa Mediat at 22 million points.
Do you understand why we are often discussing this programme because it is not original and it is not something of a sort?
Lordi Hall said that this BBC1 channel program, where Palma Faith and Boy George work as starboarders, has been produced "in the style of the BBC".
He added that he wanted the company to "find success within its own house" the next time it starts the entertainment sector.
However, he did not agree to stop the production of future The Voice cases or to determine that the funds of the taxpayers would be used in other forms of entertainment.
Networking rose again at least in August, Black Friday may be a cause
Networking increased by 7 per cent in 2015 in the first three months of 2015
Last month there was a rise after the beginning of low statistics in 2000
Three years ago, the network came to a standstill on the use of mobile devices for purchases
Experts believe that in November the Black Friday may delay spending
The number of government departments has increased significantly over a decade and has turned many of Britain's purchases into mining cities.
However, experts say that there are now signs of web-based warming in the air when the last chapters showed only 7 per cent increase for the first year of 2015.
At least since the beginning of the year 2000, total consumption in August has increased by only five per cent since the last year.
Experts say that there are signs in the air of netting when the last chapters showed only 7 per cent increase for the first year of 2015.
"If we look at the growth rates for the previous years and return to the year 2000, it was clear that the situation would be reasonable over time," Andy Mulcahy, JMRG sales index provider, told Guardian.
He explained that three years later the network came to a standstill when the buyers began using their mobile phone to make purchases.
It meant that more people made purchases online and that they could be made in different environments, such as in the summer.
But now it's leveling, and (growth) can be calculated.
The Black Friday, produced from America, has been regarded as one of the reasons for the delay in trade.
Experts believe that consumers are slowing down before the last spring of November.
In the last year, the average average value of five times more buyers for mobile computers is used to plug stores into many shopping sites.
Experts believe that Black Friday, who got the buyers enough to find out, can stop the purchases from making them.
In a study published by the British Retail Consortium, only about one point was used online.
For certain products, such as television and washing machines, more than a third of the purchases are now being made for online sales.
At the same time, more than four quarters of people buy clothes and shoes from the network instead of using purchased formwriters.
Muslims bury the deaths of the family of Bin Laden in a state of emergency
Muslims buried 29 bodies dead during the first funerals in Mexico
Saudi Arabia has partly accused the construction of the Saudi Binlad Group of Roma
The Ministry of Health said that there were also 394 people who were injured when the rise tower fell down
29 And when hundreds of Muslims were gathered together to bury them, the victims were put to death when the tower was broken up in the cave of Mekah.
The dead, mostly dressed in white, performed the journey to honor the first of the dead who made their last trip to Al-Moaise's grave country.
The hard drive ended up in a holy place, where just a few days later the rise tower fell through the mosque roof and fell down.
The bodies were released to be buried when the king of Saudi Arabia confirmed Bin Laden's family as a result of the disaster at the construction site, where 394 people were also killed.
The bodies of the 29 bodies of the bodies of the bodies killed by the cataclysms of the Maccabees were placed in a cage
The group of dead had four children from Qasim Akram from the Bolshester region of the region of Manchester, the first to be visited by the church when the church of St.
Akram had been in a major crisis with his parents before the start of the annual hagj prayer.
The Saudi authorities have already sworn that the hunt for Mecca will continue when thousands continue to reach the city.
Today, King Salman said that the Binlad Group should not have left for the rise when it was not in use.
In the Saudi Press Agency’s publication in the Arabic version of the decision, it was said that the Binladin Group is part of the reason for the collapse.
The English service did not mention this particular detail, but it said that the company's leaders had been prohibited from traveling abroad.
Earlier this week, Salman swore that he would find out what led to the burning of candles on the ground of a huge mass mine where hundreds of thousands of Muslims were gathered before the hagj holy holiday to be held later this month.
The Binladin Group has not published any reports on the collapse and its representatives have not received a comment.
The king's decision also led to a merger of non-use of protective equipment at the level of time and did not cooperate with the meteorological authorities.
Around the meka is a ten-year-old climber, which is part of the great building food run by the Binlad Group.
The Binladin family has been close to the Saudi-Arab government family for decades, leading large construction projects.
The former leader of Al-Qaida, Osama bin Laden, was the main son of a family born in the 1990s.
Romance took place only in a wind and sandy area for days before millions reach the Kingdom for holy freedom, which every able Muslim must do at least once in his life.
Officials say 158 people are still in the hospital.
The authorities determined a million rial (174,000 pounds) to pay for the own and permanent damages of the dead.
The other half of this amount is broken down.
B&Q pomo says that European workers working badly in Eastern Europe are recommended behind
The British use more of the services of the Ami people, Veronique Lauri says
The number of professionals coming from Eastern Europe is rising
As a result, more 200 more Screwfix matches are opened for professionals.
At the same time Kingfisher closes 60 B&Q shops around the country
Written by Rupert Steiner; 1995.
Brittany is said to be free from the leftovers and the landscapes and to hire Western European workers who are willing to make their home communities.
It looks like if you're stuck with the left or you're going to land on the wall, you're at least now.
The British see are still paying more and more people to care for street-se-ste-ste-ste in their homes, says the company's boss behind B&Q.
Veronique Lauri, new head of Kingfisher, who owns the Komorremont Package, said that the recommendation behind the recommendation is the number of skilled workers from Eastern Europe and that they offer their services at their cost.
This leads to Kingfisher's planning to open 200 new Screwfix shops and close the 60 B&Q store.
Laurie said she wanted to increase women's work in B&Q sales because of the eight ten-storey purchase decisions made to name the most beautiful sex practices.
Today most of the staff are men.
He said that the changes in the population must be taken into account: there are now more than one female economy in which more households are being made than before.
Laurie said, "Most of our sales are still men.
We have to get a better balance.
However, half of our customers are women, and 80 percent of the product purchase decisions are made by women.
Women play a major role in decision-making."
Lauri is one of only five women who are leading the most important companies of the British FTSE100 Index. She has restructured her steering group so that there are as many men and women as possible.
Kingfisher is almost the only company in which 50 per cent of women are in the group, including its head and financial director.
He said, "This was a conscious decision - the difference is important here.
There has been no difficulty finding good women in the leadership group."
Kingfisher announced the calculation in both the products of the year and the sale after the group took the costs of closing the retailer.
As a result of the trend, Kingfisher owned by Screawfix and B&Q sales is opening 200 new business
The three recent governments decided to secure the proposed legislation in order to save the economy of the country.
We've been able to see the effects quickly.
The head of the SAK and other pay agencies began to force the same way and, as a result, the country stands at home because of the wide range of workers.
A lot of people think there's a reason too.
Let's ask ourselves if we're wearing toys when it's going bad.
It's even based on counter-narcotics.
More than 50,000 people on the Internet have already been told that they are not going to participate in entertainment but are going to work.
This would have been impossible in an old age of good conscience.
Of course, there was nothing net where to protest, but openly declaring a crime would have been the political suicide of a small person.
Millions of professional organizations are protesting a few tens of thousands of people for less than a minute, but it gives the subject of thinking.
The position of the employment union is no longer as clear as it was decades ago.
Not all are aware of the objectives of the movement, values have changed
The solution of the government's interest in the operation of the Ay movement can also be seen as a real gift from heaven.
When things have appeared to be moving by their own weight, the latter will now be able to protect the rights of the worker, both clearly and properly.
The government may therefore wish to retain the role of the ay movement when membership in the professional union is seen to be more important in some areas.
Let's get rid of the activities of the organisations whatever they think, so it's time for us to get a little bit of interest to stop Finland.
Yes, Finland's been stopped for a while.
For example, industrial production has already been calculated 31 months later.
Gross product continues to decrease, and unemployment continues to rise.
You think these things force everyone's head.
A heavy savings period at the University of Lappeenrant: To achieve 8.5 million savings, staff is reduced by 130
The Technical University of Lappeenrana will start a savings month with a total cost of EUR 8.5 million.
As part of the university's savings, it will start telecommunications negotiations on the whole of its personnel, with an annual target of 6.5 million.
In practice, it means reducing about 130 workers.
In addition to two million other activities, there are efforts to save.
As a result of the YT negotiations, there is a budget for 2016 which foresees 8.5 million deficits.
This also affects the government's tariff restrictions.
In this respect, the university will produce about 2.6 million sub-funds.
The costs are rising slightly over the first year, but the funding received from the same ministry will fall by 2 million and the other by EUR 3.2 million.
The total budget of the university is about EUR 85 million, so the target is 10 per cent of the total budget.
It is very important for our university to be able to reduce the impact of cuts in massive teaching and research and to reduce the impact of business funding, says Rector Anneli Pauli of the University.
Before the end of the period, the effects of interruptions were even more milder, but now the reduction of additional funding appears in new dimensions.
Negotiations with trusted men shall be initiated first week in the week and shall continue for a fixed period of six weeks.
Top: Winnibus wants for Finnish railways
The owner of the railway company Onnibus, the British Sir Brian Souter tells the general that the company is also heading for rail transport in Finland.
I'm very interested in moving to Finland's railway.
Stagecoach's company is one of Britain's biggest railway companies, Souter tells me.
Railway traffic is intended to be open to competition as soon as possible.
The first is the transport of the capital city from 2017 to 2018.
After the transit, you've got a long journey.
Souter's gonna tell you about the department of transport he's already near.
The Ministry of Transport considers the plans of Onnibus to be welcome.
Other international companies have reported their interest in rail transport at least Transdev (formerly Velia), which is so old as bus transport in Finland and rail transport elsewhere in Europe.
The Central Bank of the United States must make decisions on the highest levels
Another world follows when the Central Bank of the United States meets for two days on Wednesday and Thursday to make a critical decision on whether to raise the high levels for the first time in almost ten years.
In Reuters, I asked 80 economic scientists a little more than half of those who believed in the rise in the central bank last week now believe that the situation is still not resolved and that the rates are still at current levels of 0-0.25 per cent.
This is a historic event, because when the central bank dropped its top charges at zero, it's seven years.
For the first time, we are in a close position where the central bank has an opportunity to get out of zero and start standardising high levels," said Angel Ubide, Peterson Institute for International Economics, senior public.
In the United States, the economy has worked relatively well, and retirement has brought billions of dollars to levels and has created little inflation.
However, the central bank cannot ignore less red global views.
It has warned markets that they must be ready to rise, but the signs also show that they believe that there is a likelihood of increase.
The decision shall be published on Thursday at 20 a.m. (CET).
Delta State University shooter left an apology message
After his girlfriend was shot on Monday morning in Mississippi, before she shot her colleague the same day, Shannon Lamb wrote a message saying she was "so sorry" about her first murder and hoped that "that it could end", the authorities told the cops.
The police of Mississippi Gautier told me that the teacher of the Delta State University of Science and Society Lamb called the emergency number about ten o'clock in the morning.
Monday and he told me he was shot and killed someone.
Lamb told the respondent that the police had to send constables to his home.
He said "his wife killed last night" and also mentioned that there is "a wild dog" in the house which "does not bother anyone" but is probably upset.
The police asked the phoner that name, but he didn't tell her.
Lamb didn't give an explanation for the shooting.
When the police arrived, there was a 41-year-old Amy Prentiss' body and a 45-year-old Lambin's letter that read: "I'm so sorry I could take it off.
I loved Amy and she was the only person who has ever loved me."
After writing a message to Lamb, he walked nearly 500 miles [500 km] from Delta State, where he killed historian Ethan Schmidt before he finally killed himself later this Monday when he was detained by the police.
The director of the university, William LaForge, said that there was no conflict between Lambin and Schmidt to know, but that "the Lamb obviously had something in mind".
The authorities said that despite the claims published on Monday that Lamb would have believed in Prentiss in relation to Schmidt, there was no "too much information or evidence" of any kind "three milligrams".
Shawn O'Steen told me he was married to Prentiss for about seven years and described him as "good for my people".
A couple of years ago, they separated, but they remained friends.
O'Steen told me he and Prentis had a 19-year-old girl who's "crazed".
O'Steen said Prentiss and his daughter were "the best friends in the world."
According to Linsday Knowles, Prentiss worked all over the network. Sun Herald says Knowles was a close friend of Prentiss.
Knowles said Prentiss, who had a dog named Lighting, had been dating Lambin for about three years.
"He always wanted to help other people," Knowles said.
The police told Lambin to call his family somewhere on Mondays to tell them "he's not going to jail".
When the police aimed at Lambin's government at 1:00 near Greenville later that same night, Lamb stopped his car on his way to the side, left it and went to the forest where he shot himself.
Lamb claimed growth data from Delta State in the summer of 2015, says the list of qualifications found on the university's website.
Stars that lost their power
The displayr (left), in a picture with her son Redmond (right), has been a banker in recent years.
In 2001, he became ill with leukemia, and in 2009, his long-term partner Farrah Fawcett died on his own.
According to the noises, he also had drug problems, and in 2008 he was arrested for drug management.
All of this really takes their taxes.
Manchester United Luke Shaw is outside for two months
Luke Shaw got two shots on his right foot at the destruction of Manchester United States PSV for Eindhoven at the capture of Masters.
Although the defendant remained in the scene and is outside for at least six months, Louis van Gaal hopes that Shaw will be able to play this game again.
Vamman caused Héctor Moren's arrest 15 minutes after Shaw had been infected with the PSV region by 20 years of age.
He was treated in the field for nine minutes and had to be given oxygen before he was taken out of the hospital.
Van Gaal said, "He's got a double fracture on his leg and he's in the hospital now."
We'll move her tomorrow or maybe the day after that, and then we'll move to Manchester.
This is terrible. A boy comes to Manchester United by the age of 18, suffers from difficulties and then plays beautifully, and now he's doing this.
When I was in the kitchen, he had an oxygen camera.
He cried.
I'm not a doctor, but I'm not a double-blind surgeon for at least half a year, and he's not playing at the stage.
I hope he gets to play through this.
Moreno was happy when he got a red card or a fine.
Judge Nicola Rizzoli didn't punish a Mexican player.
Van Gaal proposed that the Italian supplier be released.
You can judge yourself in a situation when I say it's a fine and a red card.
It was a really bad two-way drive.
Shaw tweeted: "Thanks to all of your messages, the words are not enough to tell me how disappointed I am, my action is beginning now, I'm coming back stronger."
Subject: Manchester United suffers from Luke Shaw's case and disappears to PSV
The English defence has an additional incentive to step up the European Championships in France in early June.
PSV's author Phillip Cocu said, "It's really bad luck."
If a player has to go out because of this shit, they're all very serious.
Our game is never meant to be an opponent.
Moreno's leg was broken when he played in the Mexican band against Van Gaalin Holland in 2014 MM.
"Moreno takes this seriously because it is not intended to hurt the opponent, and when he hears that the wound is really bad, it's a bad thing," Cocu said.
I didn't see it in that situation.
The only thing this was a ball that was going in different directions, so it looked like he [Moreno] had touched it, but I didn't see Luke's face.
Moreno told SBS6: "I know how it feels, I know how difficult this can be.
That's why I feel so bad. I'm so sorry."
The PSV Andrés Guardo was also placed in a hospital where Chris Smalling was challenged.
Does David Cameron know this better than Lorax?
Each parent will soon learn something: If your child loves something, it won’t last long before he learns it almost outdoors.
Unless you're David Cameron.
When the childcare service was asked by the Prime Minister in his letter of recommendation, he chose Dr. Seussin The Lorax, a environmental protection story published in 1971.
The choice was a challenge, Cameron writes on SuperCamps' website in a message and continues: "Heart, move, create and contain a strong message. I enjoy reading this book to my children because it always feels like a picture or message that we have never seen before."
All of this is true, but the next chapter, in which Cameron is likely to describe the age of the book, is a detailed version of the 2012 film version, which has almost recently added new paragraphs and details to the original text.
"In the city of Tarville, inside the walls, where all nature has disappeared and even the air is commercial, Ted's son hopes to win his dream on the side of his daughter's heart by fulfilling Audrey's wish to see the right tree," says the text and describes a love story that Dr. Seuss, who died in 1991, right named Theodor Seuss Geisel, did not write.
If this is not yet sufficient, Cameron's text sounds rather like it's taken from the Lorax's Web site, which begins as follows: "In the city of Tarville inside the walls, where everything is of the means and even the air is commercial, Ted hopes to win his dream on the side of Audrey's work."
Given that Cameron is a publicly active parent, it is unlikely that he would be so unbiased by the book. There a young man named a son hears how the local nature has destroyed the weak, woody and needy Kerskan, without referring to the story of a short, weekly existence of Lorax, who "talks for trees".
Such a relatively invisible PR has probably been issued to an assistant who has not apparently read a letter 20 times after reading it to the child.
The Prime Minister's informant said the text was coming from Cameron's election office.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was sent to Cameron's staff, but he did not comment on it anymore.
Adam Lyth was clearly in danger of staying away from the English team, but it was still a hard place
To play against Pakistan is a difficult task in the Arab state, but when you see what group England has chosen for the race, I don't think it is possible to repeat the last 3 to 0 series of losses.
I wouldn't shut down a visitor's house.
Alastair Cook may have been less experienced than a three-year team, but it has included good roundabouts and the group's thinking is strong: they don't have a harp since 2012, but a young positive one.
Moeen Ali is developing in his cycle and Adil Rashid is an attacker option, although there are unknown factors at this level.
Subject: Adam Lyth jumped out of England's cricket group, his condition is coming to Alex Halles
The decision to leave Adam Lyth's team is understandable to me to analyze the challenge because I'm his prime minister in Yorkshire.
His seven games have been good opponents in challenging situations, and the simple but expensive fact is that the cricket players are appreciated on the basis of their results.
For example, Joe Root's selection was no uncertainty before you knew it, because, as I said earlier, players are the best choice makers.
About a hundred points more, and Lythin could have continued in the team, but he himself was responsible for his own destiny.
Hopefully if he gets more running to Yorkshire, another chance will come up.
British Chief of Staff Trevor Bayliss exceeded Lyth's position even when he didn't do as well as he could, and it didn't surprise me. Lyth is first of all a team player.
It's difficult to answer the question of how long it's been going to take to leave the ruins.
Lyth was elected seven times into the community, like Sam Robson before him, when Nick Compton was elected nine times.
Only Compton got the opportunity to play at home and at home.
The only cause of the complaint is that England chose Jonathan Trottt first for the Caribbean when Lyth was in the summit, but it's now a missed opportunity.
Alex Hales will come along, and there are tears I appreciate.
He's been a cricket player for something we've seen in Yorkshire since he made 236 points against us in the Trent Bridge field.
He must be given at least the same opportunity as others before him, but this certainly depends on a group meeting in the United States of Arab States.
The idea of Moeen's adjoining visitors to Cooke, where there could be an extra number of fans in the field, but it could be kept four fast, and I'm not against this.
I don't understand why the bullets could break there, and this left-hand man has already shown himself to be a pretty cricket player.
Moe didn't have to do his job in Worcestershire, but he's got three of them, and there's no difference.
My old teammate Justin Langer played the first 38 games in the first drop before he moved to the opening in 2001.
He made three-thirds of the score right away, and he didn't remember the past.
Zafar Ansari is becoming a gang recruiter, and, as little as I have done with him, he feels very much like a young man.
People can view his unprejudiced statistics as mean 31, with ball 35 and think it's dangerous, but the offer doesn't have too many fans and voters choose young ones.
He learned a lot about this race.
There appears to be some serious additions to the preparation party outside the group in England.
The appointment of a Sri Lanka fighter Mahela Jayawarden to consult with the games can prove to be a nerve attack.
He's one of the most comfortable friends in the game, and he's got a great deal of experience because he's done everything against all circumstances and all kinds of attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes with the white ball games, and brings both energy and an inexhaustible explosion.
I've always thought that he was born with an international crisis, then it was playing or preparing, and he has the same benefit as Mahela.
At times, new voices in the kitchen may work out a team, even though their message would be the same as before.
Collyn's teammates from Durham, Ben Stokes, are agreed on one day, Roito was given the same step against Australia, and I have no problem with this at all.
Although not all agree, the manufacturers and voters do not make schedules.
And you have to remember that just like players, their work depends on the results.
Such decisions are never to be taken lightly.
Britain’s EU (Brexit) support can benefit if the economy is in difficulty in 2017
David Cameron's semi-vital renegotiation strategy to keep Britain in the EU is becoming increasingly difficult every day, although it would not even take into account the heart-made Jeremy "Is it true?" Corbyn will choose to lead the side of the job market or to become a member of the European Union.
Foreigners also have their own Corbin and Nigel Faragen.
The European diplomat recently explained that because the EU is so deeply involved in the various crises which are not all of which are the reasons why some Member States have failed to take part in the British's own agenda, which is full of grants which are due to differences and disturbing contractual changes which these countries do not want most.
At its annual meeting in Brighton, the Central Organization of the Professional Union decided that it would not want them to do anything if they were to rob social protection.
We could even call it Daven and George's selfish agenda.
The Prime Minister and the Minister of State will delay the summits or two international meetings held in foreign capitals, take the picture of themselves before the famous local monument, either with or without the local eye, and then come home to say that they will win support for the reforms.
It's all about me.
My European friend who wants to see the British inside the EU exhibition - "Don't leave us alone with France" from Berlin - suggests that the shortest ministers and officials in certain cities are now at such a point that they don't care about us then.
Germany's cautious and malicious ally Angela Merkel is a member of the League, but he has been in prison for 10 years and wants to leave his office before it goes to the same place as it went too far for those who were too late for Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
France François Holland is in favour of re-election or replacement in 2017.
He's got to lose his power, too.
On the other hand, there may be national law enforcement, left-wing in Spain.
It is difficult to see these countries sacrificing their lives for self-defence when their energy would be more likely to prevent them from coming from Scotland from the United Kingdom - they do not want it either because of their own separatist attitudes.
So, my friend suggests that some of these ministers may even plan to make some of the useless remarks to the Scotland National Party in the style of the Ison-British National Campaign 2017 to speed up the Brexit process.
"Renewal negotiations had been arranged" and "Renewal negotiations had nothing to do with Britain."
The Europeans have had a hard time trying to understand how the Fleet Street dictionary is part of and how the EU-Special Journalists alone are what they were not during the 1975 referendum of Tony Benn, when our membership started in 1973 was confirmed in relation to 2:1.
They can hardly remember Boris Johnson, the greatest Euro-porter who named himself "out of the EU's direct bananas" as a writer in Brussels at the beginning of the 90th century.
Ed Miliband may have been a liar, but at least he knew who his enemies were.
To them, a written group of tax collectors, telephone hackers, and people whose home is essentially different and who own most of our dictionary.
Tony Blair actually thought of them exactly the same, but he realized that if you're in a hurry with a horny gorilla, the bananas must be released because of the shock, not wanting to be on that gorilla's lunch list and later on at night.
In fact, Miliband was more ambitious than Blair himself, which is due to be opposed to Cameron's renegotiation.
The paper never forgave him.
But happy Jeremy Corbyn, who kindly beat me in the Westminster Parliament Hall this Monday (I told him that he no longer has time to fire me), seemed to be in danger of re-paying Neil Kinnock's 80th chapter to the Murdochia strategy, which was wrong both now and now.
Although it may take time, however, he has to develop a consistent strategy to keep in touch with the media. Not to me, but to me Andrew Marri, who was a BBC officer from Corby on Sunday.
Corby's official position in Europe is, as beautiful as it is, developed.
He says he would like us to remain in the renewed EU.
Well, most of the people of the United Kingdom, the United Kingdom's own self-esteem side of the U.S. military campaign and the most pro-conservative side of the country, can certainly stand in line with this opinion.
Hilary "Benn, but not Benn-fani" Benn said both on radio and on TV this week when his inside partner would have wanted to admit that Corby's choice to call Carske John McDonnell's Secretary of State's Treasury was a bad idea.
It reminded me of the '70s when his father insisted on trying to be suspicious of his colleagues at the workplace on TV without going so far as to lose his place of government.
Hilary's surfaces were more exciting.
But because of the fight to stay with "where it is good" - Benn's divorce was not what McDonnell said, and at the end of everything Corby told heads and representatives at a private meeting on Monday evening.
Whatever is the unexplained, emotional and personal image Corby wants to highlight (remember that he even has to do with me), the media is important at the time of an environmental TV, and especially in social media circles, which is a major starting point for the abuses and frauds.
As McDonnell has said, it is only right for Cameron to be left without a visa for Europe by allowing him to give support to the labour market in the national voting campaign itself.
Simon Jenkins at least thinks so.
However, McDonnell and Corbyn's basic approach to EU membership (and in line with their Benn-Agency Law and its anti-capitalistic past) is no longer difficult to discuss with couples of left-wing thinkers who have little differences in narcism as a central dog in their school narratives.
As for his bilateral relationship with Naton (Tom Watson is convinced that Corby's campaign is not to be postponed), foreign diplomats must only try to explain it to the president.
Why should Paris or Berlin support political capital (also those who have questionable voters) for grants to Britain when it can be completely empty?
The United States has already been disappointed by the weakened military performance of the British military in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even in terms of cost-effective conservation management, as I was reminded on Monday at the initiative of the British Influenza Security Forum.
Experts criticised public health England’s e-mail package
Researchers have said that the State-funded agency’s claim that the electricity packages are 95 % less dangerous than traditional has begun with the meeting of 12 persons involved in the tobacco industry.
Experts writing in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) joined Lancet’s public health England (PHE) with the use of evidence in their reports on the electronic package.
PHE would publish this "virtangylväs" report last month, describing it as "extended as a test of evidence".
However, many researchers have questioned the sustainability of data and have referred to contacts between some experts and tobacco industry.
The medical publication Lancet would have published a final one last month, which was attacked by the PHE’s main decision against "extraordinary north-eastal drought".
Two other researchers recorded in the BMJ have questioned whether the claims have been "built on stone or clay".
Professor of Public Health Martin McKee of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Professor of Liverpool's Clinical Epidemiology, Simon Capewell, say: "The main principle of public health is that they should be able to establish evidence of effectiveness."
They say that the public's expectation that the PHE's claim "in the best possible assessment of electricity packages are about 95% less dangerous than traditional cigarettes" is based on a detailed assessment and modelling of the substance.
In fact, it comes from a single meeting of 12 persons who developed a monograph analysis (MCDA) to synthesis their opinions on the dangers of combining different nicotine-containing products, and the results of this meeting were clarified for research.
McKee and Capewell say that one of the sponsors of the meeting was a company named EuroSwiss Health, which has been informed by the President of the former British American Tobacco company for independent research.
He also supported the bat's public health powers in the sustainability report, they say.
One of the 12 persons at the meeting reported that he had received funding from an electrician, but not from the money he was told by Philip Morris International.
The panel member's selection criteria are not stated, but the panel is composed of several well-known e-mail holders, some of whom also increase funding from their research.
Other places have not been known for their expertise in tobacco control.
The meeting was also attended by PHE's tobacco director.
The group's study "probably agree" that there is a lack of "distinct evidence" on problems in most products and in most of the criteria", writes McKee and Capewell.
However, none of these connections or restrictions are mentioned in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell say that PHE's claims that "there is no evidence that the electronic package works as a rail for children or non-injectors" are premature.
Professor Kevin Fenton, director of health and well-being of the PHE, says that the claims made in BMJ have been answered earlier.
He says, "Electrics are much less dangerous than burning."
Half of your life's fuel dies because of its dependence.
All the evidence indicates that the health risks caused by the power plant are relatively small, but we must continue to examine the long-term effects.
PHE has a clear duty to inform the public of what the evidence appears and what it does not show, especially when there is so much public ignorance about the relative risks associated with smoking.
Nearly 80,000 people die each year from smoking-related diseases and tobacco-related diseases pay up to 2 billion pounds per year to NHS.
By explaining the present evidence system - that is, even if electrical packages are not safe - their damage is only part of the damage of traditional smoking - we must fulfill our national responsibility.
BBC would like to leave EastEnders, says former Channel 4 leader.
Former Chancellor Luke Johnson has said that BBC should stop sending programs such as EastEnders or The Voice and that commercial competitors would "invent anything" from such latex as this one on Albert Square road.
Johnson said that commitments should only be used to make programmes that other operators of the British delegation are not doing.
He criticized BBC for setting up public-service programmes that probably have a lower public interest rate, contracts against the most competitive programmes considered by competitors and channels such as BBC4.
After President Tony Hall of the BBC said that the company wanted to cooperate more with other organisations, Johnson said he had hit Channel 4 at the time of six years to create a relationship with BBC, to ruin it.
"I don't understand the idea that BBC is producing and sending programmes that are clearly suitable for non-suspendable competitors," Johnson told the Committee on Communications in the upper room as part of its research on the future of BBC.
If the promise is kept - and I'm not sure it would be a good idea for this message or for a long time - it should at least limit its production to programs that others do not do and produce.
The Voice will be sent as soon as possible because it wants to collect as much support as possible for the future.
The idea that no one else would look like a program is a joke, it's ridiculous, it's obviously a trap.
Johnson said: "I don't understand why a retroactive tax should finance programmes that could also be financed without State aid.
The Voice is one such and EastEnders another, without a ban on the inside of the house.
In fact, some canals would give anything of it.
I don't understand how this is about sending public service.
I don't think it's going to break the BBC's law."
Channel 4 led in 2004-2010 by journalist Johnson said that BBC is responsible for the forest "because of the objectives of the people working there, and because they believe it is the best way to get long-term support."
He commented on the best series of BBC comments by former Skyn leader Tony Ballin. He used his 2003 MacTaggart in Edinburgh to propose that BBC should have a series like EastEnders.
Johnson said that BBC's smaller public service programmes "go to BBC4, where it is often not possible to measure the number of views, but BBC will thus fulfill its responsibilities and then, in defense of the 4 billion red terms of promise, it can tell the theoretically that 'of course, we do all these unknown programs that no one can see'".
They put them in a place where no one will ever see them.
In this respect, Johnson said to the Committee: "I ask you to look for a more aggressive system for who will most be able to resist it.
Of course, you all think, we all think that 150 pounds a year will be worth a lot of money, but I don't know if it's for people with 150 pounds a lot of money because they don't use BBC.
Former Skyn and Channel 5: Director David Elstein, who also proved to the committee as a teenager, said that BBC should reassess its role in Reith's time "to inform, train and refresh".
He said that only a small part of BBC production is now classified as education - he said that there is 1% of TV production and 0.1% of radio - and that it should take a model from Australian and Canada's public radio and change the role of "information, selection and entertainment".
As regards partnership issues, Elstein said that BBC should focus more on events such as Proms concerts, which he considers to be only some on television, and associated with commercial companies so that they are all seen on the network.
"Egenetics" enables brain control by means of voice controls
The video shows how the speakers change direction as soon as the sound pulse reaches them.
Researchers have developed muscles that have genetically modified brain systems so that they can be controlled by sound circuits.
The tiny particles change as soon as they form a sound pulse, which is too high for human hearing.
Impulsions operate by connecting genetically modified business hormones that react to ultrasound reactions.
Subject: Researchers are reading and writing in light
Researchers said that the stomachs show a new, genome-generic function of the method. It can also be used to activate certain brain, heart and body organs from outside the body.
A study by the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, told The Guardian that one day the method can be replaced by brain stimulation. It is an invasive measure that leads to the human brains' electrical impulses to treat Parkinson’s disease.
They don't normally react to ultrasounds, but Chalasan found that when they were surrounded by insects with small microscopic particles, the situation changed.
He noticed that the balls strengthened the ultrasounds that then walked into the holes.
Fixed ultrasounds affect TRP-4-ionic acids, structures located in some soil cells.
The speakers will be able to open and activate these ionized cells attached to them, as reported in the Nature Communications report.
In order to produce ultrasound-led sutures, Chalasan genetically formed the soils so that part of their commercial molluscs are TRP-4 ionica.
When Chalasan used ultrasound to form soils, the microphones strengthened the sound waves and directed them to the soils where they connect to converted business molluscs.
The procedure has some of the same boundaries as optogenetics in a research tool that allows scientists to connect brain cells to and remove light bulbs.
However, Chalasan says that the use of sonogenetics can be somewhat beneficial compared to optogenetics.
Unlike the light that must be sent from the optical to the long-distance inside the brains, the ultrasounds can walk through the neck without stopping, so they can be sent over the brain.
"We believe that the use of genetic therapy and therapeutic virus can make it possible for the human brains to react temporarily to a certain ultrasound in certain neurological treatments in the clinical environment," Chalasan said.
Other applications may focus on muscle and insulin-producing cells, which he added.

These 300 advertisements are made by artists who worked in Banksy Dismaland Museum of Cruel Designs (Museum of Art).
The collective name of the Special Patrol Group helped to distribute newspapers around London using the "Ad Space Hack Packs" packages. This includes a six-storey package of six-storeys, which, according to the collective, "will be available for the third part of the entire planet's bus stop list".
Transport for London has not been interested in this incredible "advertising".

According to the curator of Cruel Designs and the University of Essex journalist Gavin Grindon, artists are asking more and more questions and want to bring political work to the outside audiences of the gallery.
Many artists have started working with activists in response to the idea that they must go abroad if they want their art to affect society.
The opposite of the second arms trade is the health of workers in the metre.
The Amnesty video has been viewed over 100,000 times over the last 24 hours on Facebook. It created a free VCCP and also a graphic designer and back-up worker.
VCCP's creative director Matt Lever found that the situation was not mentioned by law - and also in the exCeLin calendar was then empty - and he thought, "Let's give them the campaign they're trying to avoid."
They were playing with the idea of a more realistic reputation of an anti-racial corporation, but "it was more permanent to stress it in church colours and animation".
"They've done a great job helping us to raise questions about the wireless equipment for sale at the fair," says Amnesty Tom Davies.
Now the government of the United Kingdom must take action and ensure that the bindery is not sold by our own home.
Perhaps it is related to all nature art positions that come from the inside of ExCeLin when exhibitors trade fantastically decorated products.
In its press release, the U.S. Army will appear to have received a statement on "ATA4CS RS" from the side.
This includes "the unique anti-dumping duty rate which focuses on different effects on the back of the belt".

Eight golden rules for living in the student's school
It's been 11 years since I changed my school assutionary at the age of 19, and then I still believed in barbaric and moral relativism, but only now I remember the violent smiles of people - and read, long complaints of others.
Most of my studies can be based on eight simple rules.
The change in the housing area can be anything that can be completely frightening to any pregnant woman.

Your room should be a place of rest, but many of the apartments are made up of a different culture of friendship, which is friendly, social and makes life friendly.
It can mean hell to someone who's trying to relax.
Nothing in this culture will allow you to say "I want to be your friend and I want to be your friend, but you have to leave now that I can collect the energy I spent talking to you."
Try to guess when the student's boyfriend's weakened socialization and maybe send it off in a textile way instead of touching the door.
It's about hanging out when the talk came up.
A kind of student in my apartment was thinking that if the door wasn't open, he would have been invited in.
He saw a lot of things.
Friendship by having fun.
Since you're starting a university on the top of the finish line, meeting people's doors with a chocolate salad and presenting yourself to some extent less strange, less "come to the neighborhood, I'll find something for you, now smile when I ask you personal questions" -50.
Offering self - made gifts is an excellent way to be friendly.
Your roommates are going to be obliged to talk, and it may be that they are continuing to join your growth to a surprise.
It's true that it depends on whether you're able to quit.
Badly mixed sugar resins are likely to only get people to sleep when you go to bed.
Storing food is a common crime in students' homes.
Understandably, taking someone's leg is stealing, but what if you just take some kind of milk?
Ask and check on the owner of the milk.
It's quite possible that they'll give you a promise, even if they're stuck inside.
If someone steals your story, it's embarrassing and you get my sympathies, but try to treat it older than my roommate, who's sucking your milk as a poison to punish those who steal it.
He's in jail now.
You don't have to be melancholy so people can't sleep or learn.
Not only are you a decent person, but you're like that piece of shit in the country.
The girl I was using asked her neighbors if they could call their drums and bass music later, because it was three in the morning and she had an attack in the morning.
The answer was to increase voting capacity.
When they were finally late at 5: 00 a.m., the girl kindly gave them her bed two hours before she allowed her music to rest, closed her door, and went to a three - hour camp.
Wouldn't it be romantic if your future partner had been affected by moving into the same apartment with you?
Or, on the other hand, would it not be amazing if you were to have roommates in your future neighborhood, get together, get separated, and then see him every day and possibly lose all your common friend to him.
Of course, my heart wants what I want, but if my roommate does not really have a future side of you, you can even try to speak on your own.
At a time when you notice that someone has left his or her open room uncluttered, there is more danger between competition and temptation than it does.
Good game is fun, but it's a good time.
You can give the safety of the safe and safe teaching of the brain by hiding something... but don't ever touch any of the rooms with toothbrush and shampoo.
Read their door and stick the openings into the water that you put into the trash, but don't be interested in their property on a blackboard roof than they are twice as high.
The house of foreign students was demolished in Salo - The house designed for the reception centre
In the morning, a racist meeting was held at the home of foreign explorers in Kitel North Karrilla.
As the police told me earlier, there are no housing statistics for former asylum seekers but more than ever the sleeping rooms of foreign residents in Finland, says Heidi Luukkainen, teacher of the National Church of China.
The doors and walls of the National Church's housing styles were torn apart by heavy marks, such as openings, and one of the doors of one apartment windows had been ripped off by a metal display, says the police of East Finland.
According to Luukkas, who works as a social teacher for young people of the National Church, the focus of the building was estimated at ten people during the harvest.
"It was a weekend and adult people were free to move, so part of it could be different," Luukian says.
The National Park has hosted people from 12 different nationalities.
They are already in Finland for some time former students and only minor asylum seekers.
All of the buildings in the building are a-state.
Part of the adult education school, part of the vocational education and part of the study in Finland", Loukain says.
The status A has been so stated as a continuing residence permit which can be granted for four years once in Finland for a time to be a foreigner.
The East-Suomen police were investigating the father as an accident and a home crime.
According to the class, the students were considered to have been informed on Monday, where they also had the necessary interpretations.
There's no panic here, and no one's ever wanted to leave.
We have had twelve years of foreign students, and this is the first time something like this happens," Luukian says.
According to the team, they've already been wiped out of the wall.
In fact, there were at least three men who were suspected of being trafficked in a car.
I think this is the main point of the youth weekend when this topic has now been on the surface.
There's nothing more serious about it," Loukain says.
There is also a hospital in Salo which is designed for reception center.
The incident happened last week.
The MTV told me about it on its website on Tuesday morning.
The hospital wall was limited to the opening room and written in English "You are not welcome".
The case has been reported to the police.
Amendment 15.9. at 16.02 Corrected policy assumptions regarding the age and status of people living in the building.
The government will stop Y-juna Karjaall - passengers in their dreams, "I think I'm an idiot"
The Y-jun of the Helsing Raasepor Karjaal will stop going in March.
The news highlighted the passengers rising to the beginning of the journey at Helsinki headquarters.
In particular, the basement runs down to the sandy beaches, says Torbjörn Bengtström, in the village.
Idiotization is precisely because the amount of housing is growing all the time and work requires rapid and smooth contact with Helsinki.
This can't be anything other than a political will or a lack of it.
Bengtström says in HSTV's challenge video he's coming even on a tractor to the capital.
Other changes also take place in New Zealand.
The H-and-R-Jones shall be combined into the new R line.
The location of the powder in Järven and Nuppulna Tuusula will be removed from use.
The Ministry of Transport and Communications and the VR have published in detail information on the means by which the Ministry will purchase railway transport under the following contract.
The contract box is changing over the year and the stopping lines are all over the country.
The new four-year agreement to be concluded at the end of the year shall be adopted by the Monetary Affairs Committee.
The Bengtström Senate considers the state's power plant to be short-lived.
The same mistakes have been made in the past and will be repeated in a very systematic way.
Then there'll be cover.
The Y-ray also uses other than Russian and Sintian because it is fast and ends many positions.
Anna Pöyry, who lives in Espoo, was troubled by the distance between the city area and the destination.
"It's a crime for those who have to plan their trip again," he said in the spring of Y-Y.
It's a little easier. It's a promise.
There will be a new link between the coastal region, which will replace the South Helsing region (HSL), which will extend to the Kirkkonum.
This will increase the costs of HSL, i.e., in practice for the customs and taxpayers of the region.
"We are now addressing different options and their impact on service and lipping prices," HSL supplier Suvi Rihnemi said.
It is still impossible to assess costs carefully.
The Board of Directors says that the HSL based on the number of passengers has paid out of the Y line for a million years, the Ministry has much more to do with this.
The next R line will be between two positions.
Instead, the number of seeds in Ainolas and Saunakallio doubles.
The entire country will end up with 28 small stations and numerous roads.
The Ministry no longer buys trucks from Joensuu-Nurmes, Tampere-Keurau and Jyväsky-Haapämäki-Seinäjöki.
The long line of Joensu is reduced to the short line of the long line of the long line.
The season is reduced by the coast of Rihimäki-Lahti, Hanko-Karjaa, Kouvola-Katka port and Kajaani-Oulu.
There are over half a million trips per year during which the total purchase of travel by the Ministry is about nine million.
The new agreement is intended to bring 12.3 million annual savings to the country.
The value of the contract is about EUR 27.5 million per year.
Sixteen Korkman wrote in his book The Time of the Chapter: "Marxian Supports Family"
The global economic crisis has been raised on the surface of Karl Marx (1818-1883) and in 1867-1894, published in 1894 by the Head of State, writes as former president of the SKP, Yrjö Hakanen in his book today published on the date of the capital of Marx.
"They are now taken more seriously than they have been for a long time," Hakan wrote in his president's office.
Marx's evaluation of capitalist economic development, internationalization and improvement in all areas of life, focusing on capital and the growing role of capital and imagined capital have proved to be a surprising challenge.
A book writer based on the main seminars is also found by Professor of Aalto University, respected economic operator Sixten Korkman.
In the book of Korkman writes that Marx is a contemporary "now and forever".
However, is not the former director of the Research Institute for Life and the delegation of Life is a Marxian?
I don't think so.
The High Commissioner will tell me on the phone that he does not consider Marx to be a temporary economic operator but rather an interesting social theory.
Social data are now unique and specialized, but Marx was a philosopher, historian, sociologist, economist, journalist, political agitator and writer.
"The common view is that the Atheism tells us of the wrong ideas of dead men," Korkman began.
It's true that Marx's predictions went very well.
Although Marx understood the nature and importance of the industrial government, he drew too much conclusions from the beginning of capitalism, the foundation of the Korkman.
However, Korkman sees the value of being placed in Marx radically.
"The most important thing in Marx is that she asked good questions," she says.
We are now again discussing Marxin's interests, such as the sharing of stock.
"Marx may give inspiration to those who want to understand a great picture, a world that is changing as a result of technical comfort," Corkman analyzed.
But what the government should decide tomorrow is not helpful for Marx.
In his view, capitalism was an unexpected case that should just end.
Still, Marx is supportive of Korkman's family.
"In the '70s Marxia couldn't read," Korkman says.
"The Maulians and Trotskys and other gods hated all capitalism, but more than anything else."
Today's debate is more diverse, and Marxia can also draw closer without the ideology and political pressure of the years.
"Every sociologist should get to know Marx's thinking world - like other classes," Korkman says.
UN requires military court in Sri Lanka
The United Nations requires the establishment of a special court to investigate military operations carried out in Sri Lanka, says AFP.
The United Nations report on the use of inland war in 1983-2009 appeared on the average after a long break.
The report charges the military forces of Sri Lanka, as well as the military commanders known as the Tamils.
The content of Sri Lanka is estimated to have killed at least 100,000 people.
There is no specific information about the number of victims.
In particular, in the last month of the war in 2009, the major armed forces should be carefully investigated, as required by the UN report.
The report of the Sri Lankan forces accused of torture, rape and systematic sexual violence, which was likely equal to that of men and women.
According to the report, the capitals have been accused of impeaching civilians and children.
Both parties have been accused of murder, according to the report.
Sri Lanka replied on Wednesday that it was going to conduct an investigation itself, but it is not going to allow the establishment of the United Nations Court of Justice because foreign judges.
In English yo-coke, social media has been scored
In the middle of the week, there was a long visitor to the English language of the empire.
Over 16,000 cococs were tested by English artists.
In the test, you may even write the material on social media.
On the basis of their own experience, we need to consider whether social media makes us lonely and unhappy.
Alternatively, a 150-250-English dictionary could be used to show the content of the Web site.
The search was Dear Agony Count.
Agony Aunt will respond from Finland to Leelan's pleasure.
He came to ask for advice on how parents should view matters for young people as well.
There were four of them to choose one of them.
"It was the hardest of these," considered the third issue of Porvoo's English-language reader Mia Lybeck.
On the third point, only the President of the European Commission, Jose Manuel Barrosol, was quoted.
The fourth theme was very nice for Lybeck.
It was supposed to write down why companies should hire young people to work.
"At least our school has been used to write books," Lybeck says and evaluates the whole experience "almost normal".
In an English or Swedish experience, for example, questions were answered about texts that dealt with adaptation to climate change and the treatment of large data files.
In the middle of the week, some of the blood was also written in Russian (168 students), German (124), French (52) and Spanish (27).
The registrations of the complaint continue as a family day, when there is a second home, or Swedish or Finnish examination.
In Luke the tests are normally arranged, i.e. the opinion of the employers is not affected.
The University of applied sciences invites students to seek suitable travel connections in time so that they will be able to cope with the trial.
Further time can be obtained if it can be shown that delay has not been caused by its own indifference.
Trade in arms was stolen in the valley
In Oulu, trade was stolen on Wednesday morning in the city center of Kello.
According to the police, thieves had been dressed in dark clothes and grown on the command line.
He's a normal guy, and he's about 30 years old.
According to the police, the man had threatened the staff with this and had received a small amount of money from the local government.
Let's look into the matter as a robbery.
Police will ensure that tens of thousands of stakeholders are reached in Helsinki - other support parties from Finland
The government's decision-making will be supported by the police during the spring of the Helsinki debate.
The site is home to tens of thousands of people.
The members of the SAK, Akavan and STTK associations will meet at 11.00 a.m. on the Railway Station.
The police are also believed to be involved in prejudice.
In addition to taking care of alerts and other police activities, it is also the responsibility of the police in the workplace to ensure that there is no shortage of asylum.
Roads leading to the railways are closed from motor vehicles for about 9.30 a.m. to 14 p.m.
Only vehicles are rescued in the area.
From the direction of the starting point, the movement will be cut off from the direction of the bow of the bow of the Emperor, from the west direction from the direction of the Mannerheims.
Is there enough people in Helsinki's police station, Colonel Seppo Kujala?
Second, at least it looks like it's enough.
I don't take a stand for the police.
According to Kujala, Helsinki has received support from other parties from Finland because of its strong interest.
The police don't tell us the exact number of parties.
"Some kind of error is coming, but we're essentially going to do our own thing," Kuvala says.
The police are calling for a private vehicle to be avoided in central Helsinki on Friday.
The picture estimates that the worst traffic surplus is rising from Hakan's level to the nuclear power plant.
Permanent transport is expected from the beginning of the morning.
On the other hand, there are a lot of discounts in Helsinki due to the interested parties from Finland.
They're not being rescued from the Railway.
The buses are going to be on time.
Then you'll have to go to the place of opinion," the picture tells you.
I would also like to stop the group traffic in Helsing.
From a police point of view, there's a positive side here.
The problem of traffic flexibility, which is normally addressed at these large gatherings, is now part of itself.
The media have told the police that there may be tens of thousands of opposition to the economic policy of the government in Helsinki.
The police are waiting for a peace of mind.
There are few ordinary people who are employed or unemployed.
The Finnishs are reasonable and peaceful people," the picture is true.
In different parts of Finland, local entertainment is also organised on Fridays.
As a matter of fact, in many ways it's extraordinary. Do you remember these laws and sentiments?
In many ways, it is interesting and extraordinary to organize a great deal of interest in the course of the trade unions.
For example, there is no very good comparison between Finnish political history, says the professor of sociology at the University of Jyväskyl.
There's no wonder the ay movement protested.
If it hadn't done so, it would have raised its hands in front of the government, Sisian says.
A very fair government has been committed to the traditional nuclear power of Finnish corporateism - as well as to points that have been important for the development of the Finnish welfare government.
There is no right to contract.
There are a lot of barriers here to the fact that ay-trafficking is really trying to get a gun.
At the same time, the ay movement has a place to look at the hidden.
For example, there is a need for shelters because the ay-transport does not necessarily have the support of all employers in terms of income.
Now there is a new set of ideas that will be given at the time of a group that would like to take part in an opinion.
On the other hand, the unemployed who met in Finland showed their opinion at the parliamentary hearing in November 1993.
If at the end of the day it was looking for a comparison, it could be a statement of resignation from the unemployed, Murrostorstai, which was organized in 1993.
In the middle of the deep lake, Murrostorta gathered 20,000 workers.
The government of Esko Ahon (meaning) co-operated from the labour market crisis to the other.
It was said that there had never been any worse between the Finnish Government and the employers' organisations than during the Aho Conservative Management.
Now, there may be even worse between the government and the ay movement than in the days of Murrostorsta.
In addition to this, there is now a very poor government in Finland, Sisijänen says.
The current government coalition is still interested in the way that it is so much more just than the basic Finnish language.
There were some elements of the old work force in the course of the earthquake.
The site is expected to be filled with thousands of fans every spring.
It also stops public transport and possibly closes day-to-days and schools.
Although interest may not be shared by employers, it can be seen as a great deal of years.
In Helsinki some 300 opinions have been held every year in recent years.
They're on deck.
Traditionally, the views of the Finnish ay movement have been very peaceful - although they have been active in recent years.
The Finnish opinion usually avoids conflict, being legalists.
Interested parties are trying to avoid damage or destruction of property, Sisijänen says.
However, the end of the 1990s brought new winds.
The culture of entertainment has changed.
EU membership encouraged farmers to throw out the cannons and the police managed to get on top of the net.
For three months, in 1998 the number of firemen was three months old.
Showable bats were also included by planes and pilots.
Do you remember these pictures and comments?
Metal and electricity from the 1970s
The most important laws of the 1970s were metal saws in 1971 and power and electricity in 1977.
There were 70,000 metals involved in metal casting.
The decision was interrupted by a presentation by the Conciliation Board for seven weeks.
The metallics got 16 percent payoffs.
In the summer of 1977, the electric current lasted for 49 days and caused electrical tests around the country.
Murrostorstai in 1993
On 4 November 1993, some 20,000 people, many of whom were unemployed, met to express their opinion on employment.
The Palomen took refuge in three months in 1998
The palace wall was one of the longest in the 1990s, unless I was a state wall.
Farmers opposed the EU from 1994 and 1999
The police had to fight against farmers' protests against the EU in 1994.
"Sieria teaches, the EU stops," one of the students said.
The farmers in Spain had a lot of tonne.
The 1999 Helsinki EU Summit also gave farmers the opportunity to protest and burn candles in front of the meeting place.
Lawyers were registered in 1983 and 1995
In 1995, hospital carers took about a month’s rent.
Last time they were in law in 1983.
In 1995, several deaths occurred during the strike.
Do your threat by law and by team carding of the caregivers in 2007.
The negotiations were finalised on the threat of group carding.
Doctors lactating 2001
"Doctors in law - tax," belonged to the School of Lawyers in 2001.
The number of medical clinics and hospital doctors continued for a five-month period and in time was discussed in detail how the doctors could endanger the safety of patients.
After the fall, the public sector paid doctors' salaries.
Students on the move in 2013
About 5,000 students were taught March by the Senate in Helsinki in 2013.
The Central Police will solve the refugees in full with the results of the Finnish police in Austria
The Austrian police have asked the central police to help find out the consequences of registered refugee violence in Finland.
On Sunday, the Austrian police stopped in Asterheim near the border of Germany with 42 refugees.
There's no idea if the river was on its way to Finland.
All those who were in the basement were all right.
We've had an exchange of information with the Austrian police.
Research and responsibility are at an event site in Eastern Austria, says the Chief of Central Policy, Colonel Tero Haapala.
At the end of August, it became more and more urgent for other passengers traveling by truck in Austria.
At that time, all 71 passengers on board died of apparent support.
According to the General Council, the river belongs to the Finnish private company.
The company operates, inter alia, the food industry and its supplier is an alien, about 40-year-old man.
Two Iraqis have been arrested for human trafficking in East Austria.
My long-distance captain, former drug dealer and senior businessman - the story of the five secret transporter
The king of the proud secretaries, the violent Russians, the tyly informant of the shipment, and the taxi to remain in good faith.
For example, such people practice human trafficking in the European Union.
Andrea Di Nicola, a criminal at the University of Trent, and the supplier Giampaolo Musumec, have met and challenged dozens of secretaries and these "clients" and, by writing their letter, the Death Travel Office will appear in Finland this week.
In the book they present the links of human transport, they present solutions and they present secretaries from various business portals.
HS will present five of them.
I'll get rid of them right away.
In the east coast of Tunisia, the villages are not attracting foreign tourists, but many Tunisian people are heading for the Middle East.
Because of its location, the islands are also particularly suitable for secret transport, since the trip to the Italian island of Lampedusa is only 120 miles [120 km].
Because of the comparison: the distance from Helsinki to Tallinn is about 85 kilometers.
There, El Attaya's uncle lives in Emir, my boss burned down and my six-year-old father.
The small-scale vessels are famous for their shellfish, but the fishermen are more productive than they can transport people.
It's been done by Emir in a blue, ten-foot tree hundreds of times.
If the ocean is full, it'll take 40 people.
On one trip, Emir will travel around EUR 8 000 after costs.
Emily's got five of her clients looking for her around Tunisia.
Customers reach many countries, but during the Arab era, a large number of Tunisian people wanted to leave their homes.
After that, the situation was calmed until the refugee crisis was over again.
Customers are getting from manter to Kerkenna-sara in small groups.
Emir will house them in empty houses for as long as he can see.
Food will be given so that customers will just stay alive.
The housing pays about EUR 75 per night, and if the customer ends up in the middle, it is their problem.
We're going to go to the water in the middle of the night.
The first night is taken away from the islands, then stopped, waiting for the day and going to Lampedus the next night.
Sometimes it's hard to sail, and in the mountains of 20 meters, passengers cry and cry.
As a matter of fact, the human race has been evacuated for half an hour and Emir is leaving for the airport.
Emir wants us to be afraid of him.
That's why he's slowing down his client and at least claiming to be a layman.
He says in the letter that when the police chased him once, he threw all his passengers overboard and ordered them to flee to the nearest island.
"I took customers individually from the basement and threw them overboard," says Emir in his book.
The most peaceful travelers will come from south of Sahara.
He's got to listen to this.
I'll get rid of them right away.
They need to show them who's here.
Very common cab
Goran is just a regular taxi in Bogovad in Serbia.
His taxi isn't very good - the start engine is finally running and, of course, it's seen the best day of its life.
However, the most important thing for Goran's customers is that the taxi is moving over and it's moving towards the border of Hungary.
Bogotá is located some 500 miles [60 km] from Belgrade on the beach.
Nearly there is a centre for asylum seekers where families are usually rescued.
In the middle of the forest, without family travel men are housed in buildings, ships and abandoned cars, which have now succeeded in finding or building.
Also in the forest are families who have not left their asylum application in Serbia for reasons or for other reasons.
Some also live in private homes, but it's a public secret.
A group of foresters Goran will find most of their customers.
These are often the last ones - through the Balkans the road requires a large number of crossings and weekly trips in difficult lands, often in mountain areas and in the dark.
When we finally reach the Bogovad region, where there is great human trafficking, people are dying.
The Gorans are mainly Syrians, Afghans, Pakistani, Iraqis and Kurds.
The best customers are Syrians. He's telling us in the book.
"They say their business once and it's enough," Goran says.
He says the Africans are trying hard.
Goran doesn't like it.
You're gonna have to keep your head on the whole trip.
For example, EUR 300 is agreed for the first time, then they will be reduced to EUR 200 and will finally offer 150.
Goran claims to be a nice and kind man.
I don't care about money.
I'm just doing my job and helping people," she says in her book.
Gora will tell her to work less than others and to count her requests to the border of Hungary for only EUR 50.
The trip is three hundred miles away, most of which is fine with motorcycling.
Members will ask for a hearing at a price of three or four.
It's worth about €50,000 a year.
It is not a large amount for the transporter, but in Serbia it is a very nice income.
Serbia has determined that the taxis cannot transport transferable persons 12 kilometers closer to the border of Hungary.
Goran doesn't care: he knows the roads and schools and takes his client's mile from the border.
Then he'll show the customers the right direction and get away.
On-the-job
For 35-year-old Congoleses, it's called a Messenger, and it's not just a nice name.
In fact, he has a Protestant church in the capital of Uganda in Kampala, where there are many believers in Congo, as well as a small centre where help is given to Congolese children.
In addition to preaching the message, the Ambassador is driving a bus that moves people from Congo to Europe.
He thinks he's doing a job of cheating.
It's important for the transmission channel to look good.
He will dress his clothes many times a day and be careful that the white shirts of his pants are made of silk satisfactorily over the bottom of his shirt.
The station is high on its new Mercedes, its agricultural car and its three engine circuits.
When the Ambassador does not preach, he arranges for people from Congo to Uganda and to Europe.
The client will start calling any of the five telephone numbers of the Messenger.
He suggests that the border be on track in the morning, hide the money in sight and cross the border with traveling merchants.
In order to obtain the asylum seeker's or refugee status, Ugandan authorities must be told that they are home for example in the war zones of the North Kivun and that they have had to leave their homes with violence.
Often it's true, but if it isn't, the Messenger will arrange for the client to have a new identity.
An old personal certificate will be destroyed and another will be acquired.
It's where I'm gonna get the contact from the embassy in Ugandan police.
After this, the client will be guided to the same place where the right asylum seekers are going: the asylum application procedure, the creation of civil organisations, at the end of the UNHCR.
The postman is aware of bureaucracy because he has become a refugee in Uganda.
He calculates each step separately: leaving an application to the Ugandan police will pay about a hundred euros, processing documents to the humanitarian organisation about 150 and changing the process, for example, EUR 4,500-7 000 in one European country.
Follies and ice cream
Tom's got to start a secret transporter. He's a former drug dealer.
A four-year-old Irish daily on the French coast of Calais, where his work is to bring people to the streets on the way to Britain.
He has an Afgianian, French taxi in London, as well as ten rockets that don't even know he's on a passenger bus.
At night Tom and his cab were touching his client, usually 2-3 people, something I'm talking about from Calais.
They're driving the engine A26 and they're trying to avoid the police.
If the police were to stop the car on a motor vehicle, Tom and the driver would have to arrange an illegal immigration.
Tom doesn't want it. He's been sitting there for seven years for drugs.
To stop the taxi, Tom runs over the customer's motorbike to the restroom where the kittens sleep before the canal boy goes to Brittany.
Tom's choosing the right team. It's gotta be sure it's on its way to England and not even to the Netherlands.
It's got to be quiet so that the cucumbers can wake up.
Sometimes someone's in the mood, but then the smell is the most expensive.
When the road is clear, Tom turns his client into an aluminium foil, the same as that in the kitchen it turns around a past or a novelty.
It should prevent the police from detecting any secretaries.
Some use the same payroll for the same purpose.
Tom leaves his client alone and leaves the hope that no one will stop the conquistadores until Britain.
King of the Salaculators
Muammer Küčik is one of the world's most famous human artists.
The Turkish people of Ukraine have been called the master of the market and the determined king of illegal exchanges in the Mediterranean, which manages maritime routes from Turkey to EU countries, mainly Greece and Italy.
Küček has been active since the 1990s and has continued to develop new methods of encryption.
He also has an uncompetitive attitude toward other businessmen: he demands money only on the basis of money.
One of the new methods is to rent Turkish ports for a few days in the United States or European families.
In fact, ships are loaded with precision by Syrians, Iraqis, Kurds and Afghans, which are transported against the payment of EUR 5 000-7 000 first to land and from there to Europe.
Customers are kept in human storage, for example in old industrial departments, until it is time for them to leave.

After that, he's obviously gone.

U.S. Olympics are told in their book about their disease and their launch as a prostitute
Three times in the Olympics, a 1,500 - foot - long [150 m] runner Suzy Favor Hamilton’s new book has highlighted in the United States.
Favor Hamilton says in his book Fast Girl about ending his career and thinking about being a prostitute.
The Sports Illustrated page would publish copies of the book as poetry.
Favor Hamilton decided his uranus to the Olympics of Sydney.
He came to the movies at the top of the school and ran into the casinos for the second best time.
At the end of the day, however, she had to panic.
He immediately began to climb up and to walk halfway through his country.
However, they lost their power 150 meters before the ground.
He broke down on the road, and other competitors ended him after him.
I knew myself as an idiot, and I thought I'd never run again.
But I forced myself over the painting line, Favor Hamilton tells me in his book.
Later it was discovered that Favor Hamilton suffered a two-month mental disorder.
His brother Dan had committed suicide a year before Sydney committed suicide, and he himself experienced great hardships.
Favor Hamilton was 43 when he ran into a prostitute in Las Vegas.
Paris had no economic problems, but she was reluctant to get money from having sex with other men.
She also spoke to her husband to accept his action.
Favor Hamilton's tax was EUR 450 per hour.
He's telling me he's using the money to escape.
One explanation of Favor Hamilton’s work as a prostitute was also that he had acquired similar adrenaline sites as he had received during his competition in the public ministry.
Later, Favor Hamilton found out that he had a two-month mental disorder.
The second issue of the previous issue appeared at the end of 2012 when Smoking Gun was published in his article.
Favor-Hamilton participated in the Olympics in Barcelona, Atlanta and Sydney.
In 2000, he was about 1,500 feet [3,57.40 m] away from the world’s statistics, but he remained at the end of Sydney’s Olympics.
The Master of the World was upset when he joined the Norwegian team of great-great-grandfathers.
In the opinion of his colleague, the Norwegian king Peter Northug has crossed the limits of his competence.
Northug and the Norwegian Federation have been guilty of the entire summer and summer of the last year of the sports contract.
Although the association has offered Northug a better deal than other athletes, it has not been awarded to many world leaders and Olympic winners.
As a result of the treaty, the Norwegian Federation decided to close the Northug World Cup for the next time.
The decision was thanked by two-fold world champion Astrid Jacobsen.
He said he was happy to join the great crowd.
"Thank you for showing me a sign," Jacobsen wrote on his Facebook profile.
"We cannot allow one of the active drivers to avoid working for the Union sponsors," he continued.
There's a matter of money between the Norwegian Great Union and Northug.
Northug would obviously want to be part of the rural group so that he could mention his own sponsorship.
Jacobsen said he was happy when he represented the association that also cares about future generations and did not give up on the shoulders of one athlete.
At the same time, he recalled that the association has granted Northug both economic and other special rights over many years.
I know it because I've been part of the system.
Jacobseb does not accept that one athlete has a very different set of rules than just because it's the best.
Northug would publish his own information, which assured him that he wanted to play in the colours of Norway first in the world and then in the MMs and the Olympics.
Astrid Jacobsen won all six MM medals, of which two gold.
He was with us last morning in Falun's post office in the winning team.
The date of competition for consumers is also taken out in the Nordic countries
On Tuesday 25.9, fires will be organized in various restaurants and malls for which the fight against the Pakistanis has been won.
The aim of the day is to highlight the high levels of Finnish food production and lower the level of departure of the restaurant and raise information about the importance of the bottle as a high quality.
At the same time, it is recalled that not all high-quality restaurants have been concentrated on the main city hall, but there are high-ranking inspection and classification stations around Finland.
The international attention to the event is an indication of the importance of the event as part of increasing awareness of competition facilities and organisations.
In the northern part of the country, a restaurant will be organized in Vaasa in the Fund and Canteral.
On the day of the contest, he participates in the restaurant of Old Town.
The event has also received significant international attention.
The event has also been decided to make one of the most important international events in the world during the same day.
Finland remains the parent country of the event.
Exploitation paper: Establishment of an emergency reception centre to legal tenderers
The Finnish Immigration Agency and the Red Cross (SPR) are currently owned by the LSK Business Park Oy, in cooperation with the former facilities of Kauhava.
According to the report, there is still a permanent crisis infrastructure in the region, which is a defence force and its partner, Finland’s Special Network of Oy.
The accident report states that the establishment of the reception centre in private would constitute a significant security risk which is not taken into account in the preparation of the case.
According to the complainant, the defence forces may have the interests associated with the area of the former Air Force School and the aircraft which have not been so affected by the preparation of the reception centre.
The case shows that negotiations have been conducted over the past two years in the Kauhava field on the organisation of flight training and on the outcome of any possible external operator's flight to the airport.
The issue has been discussed, inter alia, with Minister of Defence Jussi Niinistung (p.) and the Prime Minister of Defence, Mr Arto Räddin.
A private person shall ensure to the court that there is no question of the formal objection of the reception centre, but that the place planned in the former reserve area is wrong.
The city's city administration handled reception centres last Monday.
Tunisia: Syria's situation is deteriorating in Ukraine and the Baltic Sea region
The Government means that there are the necessary conditions for farmers and those in this area, the Ninst commented on the publishers of its statement after it has been used by all the presidents of the representatives of the public sector at the official residence in Mäntyni.
According to the President, he is concerned about the management of the refugee camp together with all the participants.
He considers it valuable that the Government and the opposition parties in Finland are able to discuss the fundamental issues confidently.
Especially at times when we have great challenges ahead of us
According to the Commission, both the situation in Syria and Russia and the United States can also be affected by the situation in Ukraine and by the situation in the Baltic Sea.
This is a hope for the development of dialogue.
If this situation develops in a positive direction, namely the United States and Russia, it has an impact on the situation in Ukraine and on the situation in the Baltic Sea.
According to the Commission, the Nato issue was also discussed.
In the labour market situation, the President did not take a position.

The opinion closes the doors of Helsinki's central debate
The opinion to be held on Friday will close the doors of the Helsinki conference.
The police tell the Railway Service to shut down the car at 9.30 a.m.-14 p.m.
Cars from the direction of manning operations will not be rescued from Kiovokata, Postikata and not from the railway station.
From the Union to the Hakanjem will be guided to the Union via the Kaisanjem movement force.
According to the police, the closure period depends on the amount of violence involved in the statement of opinion.
Only vehicles will be rescued in the area.
Metro- and rattic cases throughout the entire period in the country of thought
Metro and railway transporters participate at the end of the night at the beginning of the morning.
The association of the Railway and Metro personnel told the STT about it last night.
Most of the originals are closed for two hours, including items closed
In the past, my interest also caused problems with Post services.
Significant delays are expected, including daily mail distribution.
Most mail services are closed.
The blood circulation of the Finnish Red Cross is treated without charge.
Atriums and hospital dispatches and laboratory samples are also sought to be treated.
The status information for the services can be found on the Posts website.
Most of Finland's origins are closed on Friday for two hours.
The Pam Service Professional Union has directed its employees to stop work between 11:00 and 13:00.
Pam has also invited day-to-day trade workers to participate in the opinion of professional organisations.
The representatives of the SOK and Kesko will tell Helsinki Sanomi that the sellers are trying to keep open if necessary to the presidential power.
According to the Centre, there is still no information on the possible closure of private businesses.
Helsing's daily house was partially closed.
Helsing's daily homes do not work in full circulation on Friday, reports the Helsinki Early Ageing Office.
As a result of the opinion of professional organisations, daily care may be concentrated on certain dates and not on the organisation of day-to-day and play-to-day collection.
The environment is open to day-to-day communities as well as groups of more developed and diverse children.
In addition, the day-to-day activities of developing and austerity schools are normally organised.
The Office of Early Age will allow you to report further changes in the activity tomorrow.
Media researchers: Sip takes high risk
According to the media, there are a number of channels needed to communicate, and the Prime Minister's television and radio talks are one of the other channels.
The channel of this direct speech also needs to be continued.
This won't be the last time, Sipil told the suppliers in the delegation.
She did not want to consider how often the Prime Minister's television and radio talks are going to be repeated.
According to the poet, there is no need to keep talking on the Ylen channel.
If other channels become channel channels, then they'll be considered.
Let's use this channel tonight, Sipl said.
According to the report, the situation in Finland is so serious that it requires citizens to keep television and radio communication.
This fact, which we are talking about now, is a time of pluralism and requires a longer basis.
That's why we ended up on this channel, Siplé found out.
The phone will be sent at 21.05 a.m. and on TV1 and Radio in Finland.
It can also be seen in Yle Arena.
Sip takes a high risk
The media researcher hopes that Sipil's TV speaker will not tell us more about turning into the government.
Is it an attempt to take the right to define public debate more closely in its own hands and to reject public discussion issues? is it based on Professor Anu Koivunen of the University of Stockholm?
It is recalled that the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Timo) was late to say that he did not comply with the media's agenda and did not allow it to be defined by himself.
On behalf of the democratic debate and the public, I hope that these matters will not be linked to each other.
I understand that the commercial media has focused on Sipil's announcement.
It'd be weird if the media doctor didn't react.
The message types of political decision-makers are not reported in democracy.
The role of media representatives is definitely to try not to take up political agendas.
I think the TV conversation is a big risk for Siplël.
In his speech, the poet should bring up something new and special in order to meet the extraordinary high expectations set for the speaker.
Is there any more to offer today than we've ever heard?
Or is he able to speak differently, in different ways, or in different ways, or say something new?
Koivunen says that if the promise is just the same old one, it must be wondered why such a great debt was made and Yle gave it an exceptional time.
This risk is generally taken into account if there is no specific situation in this area but for other groups of routine speakers.
The danger is that the General will fail to deliver a message from politicians or representatives and governments, which is certainly not in line with the interests of the Supreme or the general line.
The water from the well
It is also important for the next speaker to stress what the Prime Minister will leave without saying.
In the evening, we have to look at what Sipil is missing and what he doesn't say, says the University of Jyväskyl’s research coordinator, Heikki Kuutti.
I've heard that TV talk is coming from Sipil, because this will get to bring his own view to light without a lot of noise.
This means that there is a large public without a journalist, other than in the media, where suppliers can ask critical questions.
Sip will end the media and speak directly to the people.
However, it is dangerous that the media interpret something wrong, since there are no specific questions to be asked.
I've been saying that it's very important how Sipl is shown on TV - the pain of the pain, the release of your hands.
He's like the Simplica, who now tells the people what to do.
If Sipl is able to make his point well, it can work.
The situation is different from when the government would know something about it, because this person is older than he speaks directly to another person.
These (U.S. President Barack) Obama and his partners are regularly celebrating.
A real exception.
Policy researcher Erkka Railo thinks the Prime Minister is really strange to his citizens.
According to him, it has not been like this for decades that the Prime Minister is speaking directly to the people.
It takes extraordinary time for extraordinary ways, Railo says.
The researcher believes that the Prime Minister would therefore like to get Finnish citizens to contribute to the infringements that lie ahead.
Entrepreneurship organisations shall organise on Fridays an opinion and a bill against the government's activities.
In Twitter, the President of the Left-wing Union, Paavo Arhimäki, says that Sipil could hold his speech on the status of his nation in his delegation as a statement by the Prime Minister, where he would also be able to discuss it.
The President of the SDP, Mr Rinne (Sd.), once again will report on his challenging Sipil's dialogue.
Now there's no time for monologists.
Almost half a year from the election.
I can't hide from them. Rinne's writing on Twitter.
A 9-year-old boy on the street has been found in Tampere
The boy was on his way to find him.
The boy was born on the Facebook page of the boy's father.
The Central-Suomen Police Agency will also confirm the matter for the Night.
The boy went out to play at four o'clock in the evening.
Later in the night, he'll be out of touch.
Dad appreciates all the people he's looking for.
Thank you for these ten connections and discoveries during these hours.
The update was divided nearly 15 000 times, which is an incredible balance in this short period
The Finnish UFC has been deceived into violent vandalism by young people: You get mad at me at the time
The Kurdish freeman Makwan Amirkhani would publish a video on Facebook, which is particularly encouraging to young immigrants.
Makwan Amirkhani was under pressure from young people's peers.
Amirkhani, born in Iran and with his family in Finland at five years of age, has won a second professional exchange in the most appreciated UFC series.
Amirkhani tells me that she received a message asking for an Instagram report.
The record contains videos where young people are killed with extreme violence.
Amirkhani tells me she's disappointed in the young people's vandalism.
At 26 years of age, Amrikhan has over 62,000 followers on Facebook.
The rest of the country gets shot, sits on the other side and steals without any of these consequences, which is what happens when you do these videos, the day of Amirkhani.
It's hard to defend.
Some of the young people seen in the videos are immigrants.
According to the Helsinki Police Commissioner Jarmo Heinosen, social media video has been downloaded by both immigrants and young immigrants.
It's called that you're killing your superiors on the road.
You make so many other immigrants' lives more difficult here in Finland, Turkish Amrikhan remembers.
Amirkhani recalls that there are parties in Finland who are looking for the crimes committed by immigrants.
These individual cases have become very dismal.
It's a little hard, boys. I'll defend you.
You should remember that you're still visiting the country and you'll be here for a long time.
That's a little different way to thank you for being here, Amirkhani says.
My Amirkha is inviting young people to remember their neighbors.
If they sometimes have to deal with someone's racism, then you can blame yourself.
Now think about it a couple of times before you go along with that, leave.
Amrikhan says that violent action will contribute to racism.
You're going to get angry in the dark when I don't like it myself.
You have a bad time, however, and you're not going to do anything better than it, Amirkhani will decide.
SAK puts its position on the savings package - Lyly: Monday's decisions
SAK's president, Lauri Lyly, tells on Twitter that the employer's position is based on an alternative inventory list presented by STTK on Monday.
Lauri Lyly commented on the proposal by STTK on Twitter.
The STTK Department of Action told its government in its previous mid-week proposal, which would require Prime Minister Juha Sipil (mean) to achieve a five-per cent production period.
President of Akava Sture Fjäder believes that the government will accept a proposal if SAK, STTK and Akava are all behind the proposal.
However, it called for the SAK to weaken its position earlier.
On behalf of SAK's President, Lauri Lyly commented on this in detail on Twitter.
Lyly writes that SAK's working committee is dealing with this matter Monday.
According to Lylyn, SAK is looking for solutions to "open the labour market" and that agreements between active parties are needed as regards the status of barriers.
Lyly recalls that the proposal by Prime Minister Sipil's Government for a social agreement did not apply to SAK.
In the past, negotiations on a social agreement would have been interrupted when SAK did not agree to commit itself to the objective of the five-percent productivity category.
Comment: A major indication of the danger of approaching - "I know it's a little tricky wood nut"
I feel like it's a little bit like a wooden ring if there's already a matching paper in the bag, writes Pekka Tinanen.
The tunnels vary from the deck of the payer.
Is it meant to call a government to a coma or then to deal with it?
On Monday, SAK's co-chairs cleaned up the holy anger against government.
All of Finland was threatened with arrest.
He also destroyed the levisi.
The OAJ’s professional organisation threatened to close schools and day-to-day homes.
Ten years ago, OAJ returned: no school or day school is closed.
On Wednesday, the STTK president, Mr Palola (sd), expressed his agreement.
He told his Government that he was in contact with the government and that he had appointed Prime Minister Juha Sipil (mean) as the five-percent producer category.
President of the Akkava, Mr Fjäder (kk) quickly announced that his agreement was ready.
SAK's office would never have been cleared.
President Lauri Lylyn (sd) is in a difficult position when the Vice-Presidents just asked him to stand on the ground on Monday.
In the end, however, Lyly announced that the SAK's working group will meet first on Monday to discuss the situation and that SAK is looking for solutions to "open the working market".
In order to create a common presentation of employers, SAK should therefore adopt a five-percent production cycle.
There is no wonder that Palola's STTK has a good relationship with the Sipil government.
Mr Jukka Ihanus, Head of Social Action of the STTK, acted as Prime Minister Matti Oldhasen and Mari Kivinimen, former prime minister of the Central Bank.
The fact is, of course, that the ay-share of the government has improved all the time.
Whether or not, but Palola's exit took a little clean away from the Finnish standbys, whose speech was echoed by AKT's Marko Borderen (sd).
I'll feel it's a little bit like a woodcut if there's a piece of paper in the bag.
Modified at 6 p.m.: More information on Lyny's comments.
Russia became a bad father to Finland: "This can't be repeated"
Russian Prime Minister Sergei Naryshkin criticized the Helsinki Etyj meeting.
In the opinion of the Russian Danish President Sergei Naryshkin, Mongolia is better than Etyj's master than Finland.
In the capital city of Mongolia, Ulan Bator has begun a hearing of the General Assembly of the Estonian Parliamentary Assembly, where Naryshki has given extensive comments on the welcoming Helsinki event.
At that time, Finland did not allow for the European Union's mandatory Russian policies, such as Naryshkin, to arrive at the meeting - a matter which the President shared with the suppliers.
We believe that this was contrary to the values of parliamentary democracy and the principles of the open dialogue.
This can't be repeated, Naryshkin stressed the press office in Interfax.
In addition to Finland and the EU, the crisis of Naryshkin was directed against the United States, where it was also banned.
Sanctions are a political suicide from the EU, Naryshkin published.
The Russian delegation of Mongolia came to an end, so Naryshki continued to live in Finland with the body and thanks to Mongolia for its "eremocratic organisation".
I am sure that the Parliamentary General Assembly is moving constructively and positively, unlike the meeting held in Helsinki in July.
The leadership of Mongolia understands that there is no obstacle to parliamentary dialogue.
Narysh has also met with Ilkka Kanerva (kok) at the Ulan Bator meeting, which, according to the Russian media, has already discussed with the Russian delegation.
Closes the real playoff child: "The ground in the wall"
Tappara and Luko will continue today at Hakamet when both will be on the second consecutive day.
Janne Lahti predicted that today at Hakamet there would be no alien land guides.
The killer went to Kuopios last night in a three-2-hour drive from KalPasa.
The resurrection was a man because last time the Hope Group was the worst of the two worlds.
Well, I guess it was more molluscs.
The Romanian island of the well-started Blues was surrounded by rounds of zero points, and the fatalities were 2-3 years old.
A hard game, paintings in the closet, if any play the same game as last year, enemy Janne Laht predicts a follow-up site.
By the way, it has been formed for the Romanians with a pretty playoff pressure.
So far, the latter has just quoted from the book of the finals of the book of Luke in the middle of the two preceding years.
In both cases, a solution has been required for seven decisive masses.
Last time Luke took a row to the square in the fourth game, but Tappara rose in the next three walls and ended.
There are no major changes, except in groups.
The fight against both of them last night will take place today.
On the ground of the battlefield, Mika Noronen is making room for Tom Karhus, and Rasmus Rinne is replaced by Ryan Zapolski.
View: During the course of the march, a severe display
The director of the concert, Toivola, wrote to the director-in-chief of the Rautakallio, writing from Santu Silvenoine Tampere.
It's classic.
In 1976 Sylvester Stallone signed a Rocky painting, where he himself showed up.
The vice-president deliberately set up camps for the world leaders of the heavy line to Apollo Creed.
Rocky got a big sympathy, even though he finally lost his title.
Thirty years after Rocky's first night, Mika Doivola signed a Pori-free destruction machine.
A name-and-fashioned pasta package for all surprises to the SM-finals in 2006.
The group was full of names like Rocky.
It was white Indian, Porin Mattia and Pele Pelt.
In the boxing games, players painted their heads red and cut off their iroquettes.
I hope you're blond.
The main television broadcaster JP Jalo called the manufacturer Neumannik.
You've got your voice on your winning hope.
The hope was one of the saints.
The author of this report, Mr Doivola, believes that this long-term innovation is working the same way as ten years ago.
A man who works as a sports director of a recent sport has built a store for bad guys.
Semir Ben-Amor and Josh Gratton have gone along like Rocky's beads on the terrace.
Masi Marjamäen, Mikko Viitasen, Juha Kiilholman and Matti Cuparisen are the causes of some other than professional playing.
The hope has been forgotten that at Rocky VI, the main part of the show is Pekka Routakallio.
Karri Kiv has been awarded the Red Sea to Sean Connery.
The railway station at Doivola is one of the top-ranking representatives of Rocky as Connery had been in his original shipyard in 1976.
There's nothing else on the railway than Rocky's name.
The play philosophy of the railway is not part of a circle and a small circle.
He appreciates a hard game, but it's different things to play harder than a cat.
In the last time, the Essian Garret Stafford was looking for Tapparan Jere Karjas.
She got 2+10 minutes from the trial, but Rutakallio put a man in the shower.
He didn't deserve a minute!
We only play those who deserve it.
I don't accept such a game, and it's not part of the old man's game, so when the Routkallio went to the people after the game.
During this time, the team has been wonderfully built.
There's cops, veterans, cops and rapists.
There are no open men in the best game.
It's not surprising that the Chief of Staff has chosen an artist.
How much have you been able to influence the players' careers, Pekka Routakallio?
The recent developments have affected procurement and unfortunately the situation on the market has been tense, and the response of Rautakallio has been diplomaticly.
I'll get down to the roof.
By the end of 1953, Rautakallio had evidently been interested in moving to Doivola’s place as a sports club.
Men's contracts end in the morning.
The balance of the axles during the three times is the same as many losses on the ground floor 1-6.
The wish would not have supported the continuing process.
Olga Temonen shows Sipe Santapuki's mother
Bega Temon revealed that if she had met her husband as a teenage boy, they would have had nothing to do with it.
Olga Temone shows her husband for the first time.
Yeah, I'll show my husband's mother in the movie.
It usually feels crazy, an actor and producer of Olga Temon's smile.
He has been married to Apulanna ex-bashist and leader Tuukka Temos since 2008.
The Paris Group has done a lot of work together before, but now Olga is the first time in Tuuka's leadership.
Oligan plays a role in the early years of Apulanna You made us beautiful in the picture has a rough Sipe Santapuki's mother, Sirka.
Circa smacks and supports her son, even though this father, Risto (shown by Lorenz Backmann), tries to be followed by the voice.
The more I know about my real ex-girlfriend, the easier it will be to present the role.
He's a great guy, and I'm grateful to Tuka for giving me a role.
Oliga had met Sirka before the film project, but after that, they've been a lot closer.
They've been around, they've been talking on the phone, they've been texting.
The circus has really helped a lot.
We've been through a lot of different worlds through their history.
It is also a good thing to understand that the drama is a drama and the truth may have to be colored a little.
Olga points out that Sirka was in Heinolas almost the only one who deliberately believed that Apulanna would become Finland’s largest band.
In the '90s there was a lion and a real problem.
There was a time when there was a small probability that someone was really successful, but Sirika had something intuition, and she was right.
Olga says she had heard a lot about this youth before the movie plans.
However, the stories of the parents have been slightly different.
Yeah, if you're 15 years old, as many parents really know what you're talking about.
It is evident that his youth was completely different from that of Heinola, known as the archaeologist.
Olga was a nice and nice girl who would have had nothing to do with the movie with Tuuka.
At least she could've kept her secret.
According to Oligan, for 10 years he has worked so much with Tuuka that a large joint project is not afraid.
Everything's always been super good.
Now the whole producer group is going to the pictures in Heinola for months.
The couple in the village are really going to spend the night at home because of their small children, since the difference is not too long.
We'll be able to rule the whole Heinola month.
They've taken us really hot against us, just asking what you're missing and when they're empty.
Iron Sky 2 rose as Finland's largest sample image
Timo Vuerensolan leader Iron Sky: The coming Race budget is EUR 17 million.
The pictures are starting in October in Belgium.
The leader Timo Vuorensola is starting to paint Iron Sky on October 2nd in Belgium.
Iron Sky's continued part, Iron Sky: The Coming Race, will raise Finland's largest sample for all time at a budget of EUR 17 million.
Previously, the title of the most famous film in Finland had been at the Big Game of Jalmar Helander.
The Angry Birds animation will also increase after the end of Iron Sky 2: because the film budget is over EUR 100 million.
The pictures of Timo Mountersola and Tero Kakoma produced by the film started in October near Antwerp in the AED Studios rooms and last eight weeks.
Director Timo Vuorensola is leaving for Belgium in the first week.
I'm not afraid of leaving the budget.
I've been sick for a while!
I've got so much interest in the file manual because I know exactly what leaves should come from.
Everyone in the working group feels like they're doing something unprecedented.
It's great to go to Belgium.
Although time is hard, there's no fear in the ass.
I'm more excited, and I don't have to wait for me to show this tape to the public, he'll tell me tonight.
At the beginning of the film your budget was planned for 8-10 million, but the budget also grew as the manual was developed.
It's a big budget, but it's a big deal.
However, the film should be worth 100 million because each picture and performance is so expensive.
Now it's all so tight that there's no one to find.
The film production company Iron Sky Universe launched a group management campaign and a group company on Wednesday, which pays 4-8 per cent of the annual rate.
The final height is determined by the demand and supply during the campaign.
In the last two years, the company will pay the loan back.
The action plan includes Udo Kier, Tom Green and Vladimir Burlakov.
Juntia or coolia?
The same logos return to places
The stress of the trendsetters has recently been corrected by the same logos.
Some time later, the well-formed dressers avoided clear and large logos such as Crocseys.
In any event, the mention of the name of the hopper or t-step was seen as a joint.
But time's changing.
Sports has become a real mega-style trend, as well as older, familiar sports models such as Adidas and Nike have risen to the college's alley.
And as often as before, noise and any trending limit are due: if something is already right, it starts to become ironic and cool.
First came the norm core trend, i.e. a typical form where the trenders were surprised by the best possible softer basics of age than by the way they separated from the mass.
Now, instead of three basic colleges, it is already located on the base of the cabin, where the manufacturer's logo is located.
The bigger and the more traditional, the better.
In addition to the logos, for example, Adida's railway networks, popular group games and New York Yankees have made it back to the roof.
At the beginning of the falcon's rehearsal, the early Calvin Klein logos are now cool details.
The trend appears to be moving from sports marks to luck brands.
For example, the strain of Versace’s tissue system makes it clear what is involved in the distinctive clothing.
Would you be willing to present logos in your dress?
The Russian policy would have published evidence: I haven't been in the tank class for hours!
According to the claim, a special event would have occurred in Nizhni Tagil, where Russia Arms Expo 2015 was considered to be the product of the Russian military industry.
In Russia's media, there have been a number of negative allegations that the Russian Ministry of Emergency had to break down large numbers of Kosovo tankers for five hours.
He's been doing everything he can to block out the information.
He would even publish on his own Facebook page a picture where he appears to be very good at the end of the pastry car and at the same time on the basis of their pictures, it is nothing about being Jewelry or powered.
It's full of garbage.
Let's start by saying that I didn't go into the war zone, but it was the BMP-3.
I've served in Ural. I've been serving in the former military.
I went in there, I looked around, and I came out in peace.
I wasn't going to sit there and I didn't really spend five hours there, he said.
On the Russian army television channel, Donovo explained his favorite new technique in the exhibition because he is himself an ex-employee.
That's why I liked our technology.
And I came out through the back door, he said.
I went to all the tanks.
And in the next show, I'm going to probably use all the tanks and all the bunnies, you promised.
Dhodovo also complained about the issue as a type-examination supplier.
One type wrote and everyone else returned.
There was nothing like that.
I went inside, and I came out.
I'm long and round, but none of the things I've ever been in a tank, didn't happen, he told Russka lullzhba to novostei radio.
Ebola’s statement supports that no photo of the alleged involvement has been published, even though the exhibition took some time of 50,000 people.
The story of the presence of Ebokov started with the movement at the Bloknot.ru site, where he was told about the opening of his tank at the end of his attempt and the threat of the shootings were all around him unless he got out of his face.
Later, the Bloknot website would continue to be published where the exhibition organizers told about their own experience.
Everyone's just used to get the soldiers up out of gunned vehicles fast.
But the representative of the people, Edoov, led by his father's appointment, just calmed down when he came out.
But he didn't sit there for five hours in no name, said the exhibition coordinator, Alexander Pisarevski, to the block.

The Canadian mining company Agnico Eagle Finland's Kittilän plan has been launched for a year.
The refined process of the golden age has been so called for from the bottom of the richness of the market.
According to the company, measures have been initiated to fix the year.
There is a need for a neutralised process of demand for richness and pure process fluid.
In general, water is pumped either to be used as a reproducible liquid or is driven by an environmental environment, according to a permit.
The year was estimated to be about 300 square miles per hour [300 sq km / hr] when it was discovered.
According to the company, the quality of annual water needs to be met by current promises.
There was no environmental damage to other substances.
The year was found on the spot on Monday.
No structural damages have been detected during the year prior to the pathogens.
The company shall inform its close cooperation with the authorities to monitor and remedy the situation.
The plan works about six to six fixed employees.
Dansken Kuoppamäki: IMF warns against getting too close
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) report published today in Finland is in line with the views of the Government and the Ministry of State Resources.
In order to deal with economic problems, the order has been put to work on structural reforms in Finland.
According to IMF, the reduction in overwork equipment and paydays would support Finland's competitiveness.
Amendments should be made to the whole contract system and to the safety of unemployment.
According to the Danske Bank's chief economist Pasi Kuoppamä, structural reforms are of the same opinion, but there are small differences.
The IMF's assessment contains a lot of information on government action, but on the other hand, there are also warnings about what should not be too much.
These are infrastructure investments, for example, Kuoppamäki tells the economy.
The IMF would also support growth projects in the shortest possible period in order to support weak economic growth.
In this year, the IMF expects Finland to grow by 0.4 per cent, which will first increase by 0.9 per cent in the year.
Danske predicted that in today's new approach, there would be growth in zeros this year.
The IMF is a little more optimistic than this year.
They may have had their last findings.
This morning the Statistics Centre told the total production was in the middle of a small growth, Kuoppamäki is real.
The confidence of the industry’s weakened or other softer measurements so said has to be refocused.
However, there are only a few percent of the decimal places.
Nintendo, who was about to die, named the new leader
In July, when Tatsumi Kimishima, who worked under the Iron Curtain of Satoru Iwata, started working on Wednesday, Nintendo told me on Monday.
Iwata led Nintendo from 2002 and she was recommended and charismatic growth in the game.
Consider, for example, your success in launching the Wii console.
The choice of Kimishman at the age of 65 is not surprising.
He was one of the names identified as possible followers of Iwata.
Kimishima is a safe choice for the Iwatan whales to follow, an Ace Research analyst assessed Hideki Yasuda Reuters.
The task of Kimishman is to see Nintendo drive powerfully into mobile games, but so that it does not eat the company’s taste for traditional toys.
Finland will only get more and more minor asylum seekers
In February 2015, the Swedish Immigration Agency recognised that even hundreds of children who have come to the country are missing every year.
In addition, SVT.se and Dagens Nyheter have reported on their website, according to the Swedish Immigration Agency, hundreds of minor applicants are missing in the country each year.
The Director of the Immigration Agency, Mr Kannelma, will tell you what the situation in Finland is and how it has changed.
Is there the same situation in Finland?
How many applicants lose "under" in the year?- In Finland a total of 156 applications for temporary asylum were made in 2013 alone.
You lost 9 of them.
In 2014, 196 applications were made and 11 of them were received by Kannelma.
As a result of the disappearance, it may be that in the course of the proceedings, the applicant has already been registered in another country in which the Dublin Regulation applies and may have been found there as a full-timer.
In such a case, the applicant may be more likely to lose than to continue the proceedings in Finland and return to the country responsible for the processing of the application.
Accordingly, part of the losses will also be found later when they are seeking shelter from another Member State.
In 2014, there were 3651 asylum seekers in Finland, of which 134 were granted asylum because the applicant was likely to have changed from Finland, so adult asylum seekers disappeared during the last 123 years, he says.
Is there a lot of growth?
Until 6.9 this year, we have received a total of 586 applications for temporary asylum.
The overall statistics of missing minor asylum seekers this year are not yet available, but the number of minor asylum seekers is then known and it has increased clearly, which is likely also to affect the number of missing persons.
How are those who receive a translation decision?
Do they also fall into "black labour market" as well?
This is difficult to assess from the Agency for Migration, as the implementation of translation decisions is in line with the police, which can be stressed by Kannelma.
Interior Minister Peter Orpo (kok) has been concerned about the growing number of unregistered farmers in the country.
He's been involved in this case.
At an EU ministerial meeting on asylum issues, Orpo told of practical actions on Monday to be managed by asylum seekers through Sweden.
Nina Mikkonen sells Timo T.A's studio online - see pictures of devices
Because of the disease situation, the cost of selling lost work in the media sector's vacuum cleaner Timo T.A. Mikkos's TV and radio production is now on sale.
Mikkos' side Nina Mikkonen sells equipment at Huuta.net, which at the time were among the most advanced tools of the professionals.
The first website on the website was called Nightmassin.
Today, most of the equipment has remained at the feet of technological development.
In the digital media world, television programs no longer depict Betacam ships.
Nevertheless, Nina Mikkonen is confident that interested ones will be found.
Of course, the equipment is no longer modern in that way, but it is needed as long as there is an old generation of material that must be digitized.
On the other hand, there are also many firemen - collectors and construction workers of their own study, Nina Mikkonen on the basis of the IS.
The reason for the sale is that Mikkos are trying to move away from the current home of Myrskylä.
We can't take anything with us.
I've begun to invent and see where the goods are created.
I'm starting with this, Nina Mikkone says.
There are no more TV or radio devices to use.
It is clear from the follow-up to the dental brains that a long-term urinary exercise has not been made by a man to return to work.
Nina Mikkone notes that only goods and equipment are now sold.
Timo T.A. Mikkos’s main life was in the archives at the time of the National Audiovisual Institute, where representatives visited the film and other material from Myrskylä.
Transport is threatened by the worst thought: Metro and railways can stop for their entire flight
Metron and railway transporters today decide whether they are going to expand their forces into the entertainment industry.
The original plan was to adjust your metro and rail traffic only for a time of entertainment scheduled for spring.
In the evening you decide whether to stop your traffic all day long.
Mr Pekka Hirvonen says the threat is great in the field.
The night and day interruptions are worse for drivers, so the government plans to cut off the licenses raise the challenge.
However, it is believed that stopping the traffic all day is a sort of dilemma.
If the metro and the railways stand on their way, public transport is on the main road in practice in almost all of the stops.
According to VR data, the trains do not travel between morning and evening on Friday.
They don't move around in the morning. They don't move around. They don't drive away.
The train leaving before morning is scheduled to arrive at the destination.
According to HSL, most of the buses will remain on the left.
The members of the AKT are away from work on Friday morning at 3 p.m.
It is likely that a small number of buses will be allowed to travel, they will be carried out by HSL's informant Spirkko Repo.
Repo says that HSL can't say exactly what bus routes are going through during spring.
Employer organisations organise a major event at the Helsinki Railway Station at 11-13 a.m.
Aftonbladets: The Hungarian police used exhaust gas against the Pakistani
The Hungarian police attacked hundreds of thousands of refugees in an explosion.
The event took place at the border between Hungary and Serbia, where many refugees are trying to reach Europe, says the news agency AP.
According to Sky News, the refugees have tried to break through the border.
Many refugees, many of whom were women and children, were forced to leave their homes.
According to local media, the Hungarian police would also have used watertights against people.
A Muslim boy was held in school in Texas - a teacher thought his own watch was a bomb
In the United States, 14 - year - old Ahmed Mohamed was arrested after the teacher held his own school as a bomb.
Mohamed told Dallas Morning News that he wanted to just present his e-mail message.
One of the teachers, however, had to be a real bomber.
The police were invited to the scene, and the situation ended when the boy was taken into custody in the custody of the youth.
Mohamed has not been found at any stage of claims other than that he had done at an hour.
Still, it is possible for a boy to be blamed for making a mistake.
According to Mohammed, the police have proved to be a real watch on the "fucking bomb".
The clock is in police custody, but it is certainly composed of a cross-border and digital show that has led.
The incident took place last month, and Mohamedia was sentenced to three days in prison to leave school.
His father has a case in his hands and the American Islamic Council of the country is based on whether there is another evidence of Islamophobia in the United States.
Brittany Kohizee - The Labour Director refused to sing a national song
The song asks God to protect the royal palace, but Corby is a monarch.
The assessment of the right-of-the-law paper has also brought together Corby's own Labour Party representatives.
This has created a nation, which is estimated by the laboratory representative of Kate Green in the BBC radio station.
Green thinks Corby should have joined the song.
The British Air Force Air Force War against Germany Luftwaffe in 1940 was respected in last night's memorial event.
The Working Party shall, in its official opinion, defend Corbynia and stress its respect for the air carriers by taking part in the opportunity.
We are all in great gratitude for the gratitude of the royal aircraft.
He (Corbyn) stood in a respectful position during the national prayer, which was highlighted in the opinion.
Corby's election as vice president has divided the lab's lines.
In particular, there are a group of people who are afraid of his masculinity in radical views.
Corby's support is for one-sided hostilities, for the end of savings and for the growth of public expenditure.
Corbyn is now the first time to appear in Parliament as Vice-President at the Prime Minister's hour of question.
Corbyn has asked the public what Prime Minister David Cameron should ask.
At the weekend, Cameron took the lead in Twitter in Corby's election as vice president.
The employment side threatens our national security, our economic security and our family security, the Prime Minister said on his own behalf.
I don't know why family murder is still unfair. The father of the family was waiting for justice.
The South Lake Minneton police have recently investigated the murder of a family member in Minnesota, Greenwood, a week ago.
A family of five was found at home on September 10, and a few days later the police confirmed that the gun was the father of the family Brian Scott Short, 45.
First of all, his wife was shot and three were killed by Brian Short in the car.
I've been dead for weeks.
The family was found after the school had been cared for by children.
On the basis of this report, the police went to the house to check on the house and found a large house for the Short's family when they died.
According to the StarTribunnen, it is possible that the victims had been dead for several hours.
Millionaire and a successful enterprise
A study of the case of Michael Sitar, a South Lake Minneton police officer, is still under way.
The cause of blood clots is still unclear.
Shooter Brian Short was a successful entrepreneur and he had created his properties on the social media site AllNurses.com.
In 2014, the StarTribinen survey told short that there are four million different visitors on the site each week.
I've had 50 purchases for the company over the last ten years.
I've missed them all.
But I still have a lot of ideas I want to make.
At some point, I'm selling a business, but I'm not yet.
The loss was seen, among other things, that the Short's family bought from Greenwood in 2011 with two million dollars.
The apartment is famous for its property in Zillowi, where there are not only 12 rooms in the house but also 8 cars in the car.
Right-of-occupancy
However, according to the StarTribunnen, his father was waiting for a lawyer.
Achiev Test Prep, which offers various cross-sectional courses, had challenged him because of comments on AllNurses.com.
According to the Achieve Test Prep, the Short website did not remove comments from the prep auctions and thus lost customers to competitors.
According to the StarTribunnen, however, it is very unclear whether the exercise of justice would have had a significant impact on the business of Short.
Water Loir offered me some coffee
In addition, the owner's family was rewarded with a month's salary by Finnish Cypriot horse-manipulants.
It's great, Loir's comment is welcome.
The festival, Fabrizio Duo, won Derby's first Saturday in September and won 100 000 euros.
The artist's lawyer Loire was still amazed at the success of Fabrice Duon in the great competition.
I still don't think it's happened.
According to Loir, the manufacturer of the Menestyshevos will be able to work with a full-time horse.
Pick up and decide which horse you're taking to compete.
And I'm holding my ass, Loir blew it.
A wonderful life from NHL - "To make a gift to the greatest performer of all time"
Montreal Canada's superintendent P. K. Subban has contributed ten million dollars (about EUR 6.7 million) to the hospital for children in Montreal.
According to the hospital's report, there is a unique gift of charity in Canada by the greatest athlete of all time.
In addition, the 26-year-old Subban has committed to helping the hospital during the next seven years.
Subban made an agreement with Canadiens eight years ago and 72 million dollars a year ago.
The sum of Subban's gifts is therefore significantly greater than his $9 million annual contribution.
In return for his gift, Subban will receive a hospital named after him.
Canadian players have previously helped significantly local hospitals.
A year ago, a long time ago, Captain Jean Beliveau collected millions of dollars, including the same childcare company, and Saku Koivu collected the money left for the city’s capital, where the hospital received a PET scanner needed for food research.
A Japanese coffee can make a wife's night... offering food just bikini and cheese on her head.
The theme coffee is a tough thing in Japan.
The market already has coffee, coffee, vampyry coffee, coffee and now wine.
It's going to be lonely, followed-up and hungry.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Of the Tokyola Ore no Yome (my wife) coffee may be allowed to stay with your wife or husband during the evening.
There's a supplier who makes himself part of the customer.
"Poliso" is selected from the list before the coffee table comes and it prepares and offers food.
The baby's in the opposite direction. It's just a seat and a bike on it. The husband's still in the closets.
The website provides all the information about the length and pressure of the wife’s absence to which she would like to sleep.
Nearly 150 million vehicles have been connected to the network: vehicle safety attacks were equipped
The Automotive Security Review Board (ASRB) will also support the technological development and innovation of the field, as well as the information published by Intel.
The High Commissioner is composed of top security experts from various parts of the world.
The ASRB researchers will be required to carry out continuous safety tests and inspections aimed at standardising best practices and planning recommendations for advanced cybersecurity solutions and products.
At the same time, Intel published the first version of the best practices for cyber safety.
The company will continue to update the report on the basis of ASRB's research results.
The International ICT Research and Consulting Company Gartner estimates that by 2020 some 150 million vehicles are connected to the network.
Few things are more personal than our safety on the road.
According to the same estimate, 60-75 % of these vehicles can be used, created and shared online data.
We can and we need to improve the cybersecurity of cars, Chief of Intel Security Chris Young says.
With ASRB, Intel can confirm best practices related to safety and support the view that cybersecurity is important in the design of each network-connected vehicle.
Few things are more personal than our own safety on the road, which makes the ASRB community a real idea at the right time.
Intel is one of the world's leading innovations in data processing.
Ford Focus RS pays about EUR 52,000 in Finland!
The Ford Focus RS model has been expected for years as a month to come.
In the evening, the car also begins to be on the coast of Finland.
Ford published RS's data now that the car's tests are at Frankfurt's auto show.
The new four-colour RS speeds up by 2,3 litres, 350-powered motors in 4.7 seconds at zero per cent and its peak speed is 266 kilometres per hour.
It is also of interest to Finland that the price initially amounts to EUR 52 000.
The car is now on its way, actually when the first cars arrive in Finland, Ford won't tell you when he's informed.
The brand Kia presented two news on Frankfurt's car show - these are new Sportage and Optima.
In Finland, two of the news is certainly more important than the new fourth generation Sportage, where Kia is going to catch up with the ever-increasing oil market.
In this form, a new European shape leader, Gregory Guillaume, created Sportage, has been created earlier.
The steel industry and the external commissions have been there since the second time and the car is getting more effective.
The engine choice is in its headwards, but it has been added to a 1.6-literal turbo that develops 177 horsepower.
More about Kia Sportage and its performance and consumption are said to be closer to the sale of revenue.
We still have to wait for it because we will get a new Sportage by summer 2016.
Just a year ago, our country was born with new Kia Optimati.
Maybe I see the news doesn't look changed, but there's a very new car.
Who wants to strengthen the hearts of the top middle class buyers by better driving properties, lower reading level and higher equipment.
Starting with 1,7 litres of turbodies and 2,0 litres of petrol engines, Optimos are available.
The first thing you want to do is to get to their wall with 2.0 litres of turbo engine equipped with Optima GT.
At the same time, with its arrival, the sale of Optima Farmer will begin.
Chisu returned to the ships - he exploded into a brave disaster
The singer Chisu is with the child at a concert with other domestic stars.
In electric welding, there's got to be an open door.
The apartment presents the beautiful siren of the singers.
The crown of the crown is a gold metal sheet and a red sheet.
Over the past three years, the singer who became a mother has received heavy loads of punishment by means of heavy traffic and by side.
Chisu's daughter's gonna be over a year.
The psalmist would publish his first poem from the new edition in August.
I returned to the ships and the rise in front of the large public after a long voyage is not really bothering me.
It's been a bad thing to do everything about music, the song tells me.
Chisu publishes a new and same fourth album called Polaris a couple of weeks later.
Your new way of life has inspired you to make new plans.
At this stage you're wondering if people find my new album, Chisu's thinking.
Kim Kardashian's mother-style will be surprised again - now it looks weird.
The real-TV beautiful Kim Kardashian gives talks after each other.
She presents her pregnancy and breast-feeding in sexy clothes, last night at a time in America when she and her sister, Kourtney Kardashian, left Kanye West in the middle of the night.
It's a black mother's suit. It's a crossword puzzle.
It reveals the idiosyncrasies below the surface of the sandy beaches.
The last time Kardashi wore an amazing motherhood when she visited her friend at night parties in New York just a few days ago.
The camp was forced into the black superpowers.
The third speciality of motherhood is both young and last week, when the presentation period was difficult.
Hard devices in the world: No home, you're lonely, competition is weird
The amazing Manon Leloup wanted to understand that the world would be a clean glamorous and funnel.
He made his own documentary Speaking Dolls, where Leloup and his colleague talk about the pure modeling.
The Harpeer's Bazaar paper of Leloupi's six hard truth behind the scenes.
Every season begins with empty.
Even if you had been posing in the premises of top designers over the past, the new era will begin again in Castinge.
And every year there will be new, young adults competing with their peers.
They rarely have a place they can call your home.
The work is continued travel and can take place every year so that it is a hotel room or apartment where the furniture houses its own model.
If he is too young and his mother cannot travel with him, loneliness can be an inevitable challenge.
New York and Paris want jobs, but they're all stressed out.
It's not just one kind of accident.
An agent in New York may ask for a pound, but in Paris it's said you're too fat.
Getting a job is a full-time venture.
The design models and designers are all together and work together as a support network.
When the formations are over, the difference is painful.
The models want this area because of the opportunities it offers, but they call them all thinking that the work is just a presentation of clothes.
They both want to be their own people.
The job is to let the models know that they're exhibitors who have a role to play.
But in the work of the model, you can also express yourself.
I'll take you to Tory Burchin's show last night.
In New York, the best form vehicles are being transported, where designers reveal their first year of painting.
His style changed Roope Salminen presents unknown Apulta music in the film
Roope Salminen presents Antti Lautalaa, founder of the band based on the Apulanta-United years.
On the basis of this report, in 1991 he and Tony Wirtasen were founded in April 1991 but separated from the same year in 1994.
This is a time of great challenge for me because I am a 26-year-old rap artist, and in this film I present a 16-year-old guitarist, Salminen's joke.
I didn't want to meet true Anti before the pictures, because I want to make my own interpretation of him.
Anta is clearly unknown to people from that message, so I think it's very good that I'm just learning her phone type from the video.
I don't want to make an imitation of a man.
The very empty Roope Salminen and Koirat are not going to play.
The Punkmanes will come by their nature.
The stars, the stars, probably many in the punk season of the program, have seen the emoluments, even if they have never been on our trails.
Our presence has never been a little bit short, but it always goes perfect.
In April 1993-2004 the base was called Tuukka Temos's leader.
To the general public in the band, young exhibitors who are not yet known to the big audience are presented to the general public.
Rumpali Sipe Santapucki presents Teppo Manner, singer Toni Wirtas Taku Sinsalo based Tuukka Temo Iiro Panula.
Roope Salminen gave a pledge from his future past last night, when he told Snapchat that he was secretly preparing his urine on the most important day.
Roope has already published a new look at the picture in Instagram yesterday, which he has had to do for the film.
In weeks and months, Roope, previously seen in the womb, has walked into its growth as a silopox, and colored her hair black.
Psychology advice: So tell children about refugees
Many parents have had to consider in recent days how to tell their child about the refugee situation in Europe.
Or is that what you're saying?
It doesn't have to be taken for granted, SPR crisis group member, psychologist Ferdinand Garoff's advice.
Smaller children are encouraged to protect themselves, for example, not to let them see the news on their own.
Little children are not always able to understand what they see, and it can be kept in mind and worried, he says.
However, if a child has broken his or her TV news image or has heard something else, it will encourage him to speak.
The discussion is good to take the child’s starting point and listen carefully to what he or she is asking for.
The children's fears may be surprising.
They're not necessarily the ones that the parents think they're afraid of.
The child will not stand in fear of destruction, even if he is worried and afraid.
The younger the child follows his parent’s example.
If parents themselves remain calm during the discussion, the child will also experience his or her security.
Grandparents are likely to disrupt the discussion of refugees in school, with friends or online.
Parents do well to take the matter to heart when it comes to their children’s thinking.
The fact is that not everyone in the world has a good thing.
Parents and children can think about how this is done in our family.
However, does the world think that it is a safe or safe place to end the end?
Parents may also have different aspects of growth - some may want to protect their children from the potential of anxiety.
On the other hand, if the family is also talking about difficult issues, the child will be given a model of how to deal with the challenges ahead in life.
This can be of benefit to him in the course of his life.
Social Psychology Janne Viljamaa: "Teach your child to help the weak"
Your own power?
Still, you can be a good parent to your child
Vermoon-dwelling Pallossalam hard hills
In the north, Apilan Palosalaman was attacked by the crowd at the center of the church.
It's just a bunch of winnings and doubles until the end of July, at Tampere's fairs, there's a romance.
Since the Ori was shot in the back of the family, the manufacturer suspected that something was wrong and took a long time to protect himself from animal doctors.
The explanation for the progress would be significant.
The horse had an accident.
The disease wasn't the best cure for it, but it's called for two medications.
Since Apilan Palosalama had to be on the move with ease, Northern tells you that she has been so impressed by the last flight of the horse.
It was a second SE in the preamble in Turkey after the Taruntuul.
Apilan Palosalama was very depressed when it was usually only a few weeks.
That the things of little attention at the end were to be understood, the North says.
The manufacturer assumes that the right competition has made it easier for the Ori.
The horse’s blood was certainly going forward, and hopefully it would have been even better.
Apilan Palosalama has been so said to have had a fluorescent fever.
When it's not interesting, it could've been thrown to the ground without any disease.
On a good day, the source of the message has been removed from such a list that opposers have been amazed.
At the end of the day, the competitions will not reach Palosalam, from which even the warmest beds will emerge.
There's a Vermos in the North Hope.
However, there are different things about how Apilan Palosalama agrees with this.
It's a long time on the way to the driveway, and it can even move through the driveway, and it's like that.
Hopefully the line would have been more peaceful than it was from the market.
Apila Palosalama can come from the lake as well, and we will go to it for a victory, the manufacturer's promise.
So you can't get away from the secret iPhone program.
Chief of Apple's delivery, Tim Cook.
At least part of the future programs with Apple iPhone phones can sometimes be removed in the future, but not all of them.
Apple is going to remove some of its own programs from his iPhone phone in the future, and tell the company's supplier, Tim Cook Buckfeed, in the challenge.
The Apple iPhone contains a number of programs that are rarely used: For example, Facebook calls, Latvians, Health, Pörssi, Podcasts and Vinkit will come to mind.
The last addition to these programs is Apple Watch, which became a mandatory update to iPhone phones, although it is only necessary for Apple's intelligent owners.
According to Cook, removing Apple's programs is more complicated than it seems.
Some applications have been connected to some other iPhone.
If they're removed, it can cause problems somewhere else on the phone, Cook's gonna make Buzzfeed.
Cook did not mention what Apple iPhone applications work closely with other programs.
There are other programs that don't work like this.
So with time, I think we can develop a way to get the user to remove them, beyond you, Cook.
According to Cooki, Apple then investigates the matter, because the company does not want to fire a memoir from users' iPhone phones.
The euro area inflation dropped by 0.1 per cent in August
In August, consumers in the euro area rose by only 0.1 per cent per annum, the EU statistical authority Eurostat said today.
The rise in prices was below the drop in energy.
Eurostat reviewed 0.2 per cent this time in a few weeks before it was assessed a little below.
In July the inflation rate was 0.2 per cent.
Thus, in August 0.9 per cent of the said North Inflation fell from 1.0 per cent in July.
Eurostat’s preliminary assessment for the North-Easter inflation was 1.0 per cent.
Energy in the euro area was 7.2 per cent worse last month than last year.
In all 28 EU countries, the average inflation was zero in August.
In July, the increase was 0.1 per cent.
Most of Europe's 1.4 per cent consumer prices rose in Malta in August.
Cyproxin inflation was at a lower price of 1.9 per cent.
In Finland inflation was 0.2 per cent of the minimum mark according to the EU Harmonised Price Index.
Inflation in the euro area is still very far from the European Central Bank (ECB) target, which is two per cent's price rise in the medium term.
The ECB will predict an average inflation of 0.1 per cent for the euro area this year.
In the first year, growth increased by 1.1 per cent, and the central bank was expected to publish its new inflation services early in September.
In the United States, Fed is trying to break the policy of money
The next rise in the United States starts at the rate of less than a year, but more likely within three years after the country’s central bank, Fed, is moving back to its peak for a long time.
And in the financial markets, the sub-markets will start on their behalf before the next landing.
Fed has been leading its initial efforts as soon as possible this week and until the end of the year.
Thus, the next move can be put on top of the speed at first and the financial market's course towards it.
Or at least so if the world's largest economy and the financial market work as they have done, and if they react to the collapse of Fed's funds as they have done before.
These conclusions have been concluded by the German Bank of Deutsche Bank in London in its extensive research into the long-term market and economic cycles of Jim Reid, Nick Burns and Seb Barker.
The Bank distributed over 60-page Long-Term Asset Return Study to international large customers last week.
The research and report strategies do not believe that they know exactly when Fed will start raising its height or what is happening in the economy and in the market after that.
Instead, they present the facts and calculations of the financial statistics using the facts and calculations of how the economy and the market have previously been used during and after the feds.
In addition to historical findings, they will examine what the key changes in the economy and the financial market are now at the same time or in another model than in the course of the current trends - and what this may lead to.
Of course, both the economy and the financial market are now in a much faster position to cope with the rise in peaks than ever since the 1950s.
I don't think I'm gonna start this year.
The leaders who decide on the monetary policy of Fed and its cost-effectiveness have long been in the process and are beginning to argue that time is beginning to rise rapidly.
The first seizure over nine years may already occur this week.
The matter shall be resolved within the middle of the week and in the case of a two-day meeting of the Open Market Committee so stated by the Board of Feds.
Last time Fed won the so-called Fed funds in June 2006.
At that time, two years of relatively regular but once again a series of 0.25 percentage points, with which Fed won its weight by 1.25 per cent to 5.25 per cent.
The financial market outbreak began in 2007 on the difficulties of the most risky housing financing in the United States, and later the year later the financial crisis became a global burden on the day of judgment.
Great earthquakes occurred in 2009.
In the last few years, serious abuses of the financial markets and the real economy have begun more slowly than they have done since the previous feds.
Accordingly, the tests were more difficult and more expensive than ever since the 1930 ’ s.
Deutsche's strategies have resulted in the rise and fall of the world's largest economies, as well as the transformation of the financial markets since 1950 and the beginning of the 1800s.
From the 1950 ’ s, they have been making clear about the economic and financial effects of the Feds.
At the beginning of the pregnancy, the first pregnancy took place at the rate of less than a year, usually less than three years and less than three and a half years.
The financial market's course has been completed within two years of the start of the federations.
Fed has been up on the mountain and down the mountain following the beginning of the 1950 ’ s, a different cycle of the Tian Sea.
Each time, some of them have disappeared from the other, and the reports are being examined in a relatively accurate way, so on their basis, there is no certainty of any of the following effects.
The strategies also remind us that many things are different this time.
And it's not just better.
Crossword Puzzles Too Long
The root cause of the financial crisis was not necessarily to be found quickly by research for even ten years.
But there are three causes of the crisis and its devastating effects on the reason why it has grown rapidly:
1) Fed, the euro area ECB and the world's largest central banks were too low in the 2000s.
They were following the technology plan, and they grew up next.
2) The financial and real economy's various shares have increased over the past decade and, above all, too much debt has increased over the impact of monetary policy on central banks.
The greatest debt in this economic history was born.
3) In particular, the most comprehensive financial sector-packed debt management was the largest interest rate for the most part in the financial market in the area of the economic history of the region in question on the part of the municipalities, the debt accounts and the benefits.
However, it is also very difficult to argue that the financial market was rarely in danger and uncertainty when Fed and other central banks were finally going up high.
The financial structures established in the reserve of debt trees were not able to bear the cost of valuation until after the savings had begun and the costs of debt management had risen.
Risks were committed as a financial crisis, and this resulted in a great defeat.
More money and more debt
The Deutsche strategies do not consider what is happening as follows, but give the subject of nuclear power, for example:
1) Fed and other large central banks have now considered their monetary policy authority to be much easier than before the financial crisis.
If the peaks were too low before the crisis, they have now been even more lower.
2) The debt has not been worse for a long time than ten years ago, but now the debt is worse in writing than in air.
Thus, the debt of the financial and real economy has not been eased, but now in different parts of the economy the debt burden is much more severe than before the financial crisis or at least half of it ever before.
3) In the past, more and less-favoured liquidity from the central banks has remained largely on the financial market and has been reduced to the most expensive securities and property types since the financial crisis.
The strategies of Latin society are not just a warning sign of the financial markets, but they also note that not even the United States economy has been able to cope with the financial crisis and the most difficult decades to come to its model than it has been before.
The economy of the euro area must have done something else.
In other words, the real economy is inalienablely weak but correspondingly higher than before the financial crisis, when Fed is going to cover its currency more closely.
Perhaps the picture of the future of the French Bank of the Society General's strategy Albert Edwards is not as strange as it can suddenly affect.
He has been preparing international investors in the bank for the following complete rules:
First, Fed will raise the mountains, then the financial plates will relax, and soon Fed will be able to link the financial institutions to more and more QE funds.
Hewlett-Packard (HP) is planning to reduce even 33000 jobs.
Some of the government's reductions are due to the HP's business service side, the company says.
HP is divided into a Hewlett Packard Enterprise and consumer-oriented HP Inc and profit-based HP Inc company in November.
HP's staff was the largest in 2011, with 350000 employees.
In October last year, the staff was suspended to 302000.
The company accounts for an annual cost of $2.7 billion (about EUR 2.4 billion).
Hewlett Packard Enterprise is reduced by 25000-30000 employees.
The decreases in the consumer side will remain at 3300 over a three-year period.
HP intends to transfer its activities to low costs so that 60% of its employees would be in low cost countries in 2018.
The company will tell its balance sheet business so that none of its customers no longer receive more than ten per cent of its profit or loss.
In the second year, its three most important customers brought 65 per cent of the business result.
iOS 9: how to get the new system after the iPhone Apple update release
The new system of use may be requested through the application of the Regulations by clicking "General" and then by selecting "Software Update".
If the update is ready, give me an alternative download and then install it.
Some have had problems after this installation when the "Programm update failed" announcement has been made.
To end this, it is recommended that users either wait for the worst wind storm to stop or try to update via the iTunes program.
I called to teach the user in the final process.
This may include the removal of applications in order to achieve the status, but Apple has reduced this opportunity by reducing the total update and also facilitating the process in the new tool, which proposes to remove applications and then re-install them in the preparation of the update.
Please make sure that your phone is loaded or close to the warehouse during the update, that the window does not end in the middle.
If the loading level is too low, Apple will not allow the update to take place, because if the switch ends in the middle, it can lead to the breaking of the update.

Top: Minister Berner has worked in the tax administration
Minister of Transport and Communications Anne Berner (meaning.) has acted as a member of the tax administration of the company.
In general, the company's activities are associated with so-called tax planning.
This is the case with the Luxembourg company Saltri II LuxCo, which was named after Berner as a member of the government in December 2012.
According to the Luxembourg trade register, Berner is still officially a member of the government.
Berner himself says he's left out of membership of the divorce notice in May of this year.
I've checked the matter and it's enough that I've left a divorce notice.
It is almost impossible to manage and control that registration products occur during the agreed period, says Berner in the Ylen challenge.
Membership after merger
The Swedish Kährs company is managed through the Luxembourg company.
He is a parking loter who joined the Finnish parking lot with Karelia-Upoflor in 2012.
Berner works in the government of Karelia-Upoflor in 2010-2013 and after the merger in the government of Khärs and in the Luxembourgian society.
According to the above, Khärsi's properties go to Luxembourg through the multi-port property structure.
Berner tells the General that he has taken a stand against government membership in the Luxembourg company of Khärs as the second largest owner's request.
This owner is Hartwall Capital.
I've been involved in the Karelia-Upoflor government of Hartwall Capital.
The company was invited to cooperate with the company that was found from Sweden.
This company is owned by the head of the company, which has a company in Luxembourg.
I did know that my job was to take care of the benefits of the Finnish family head.
It is important that we ensure that the products of our Finnish companies' capital are taxed in Finland and that they were secured in this connection, says Berner.
Berner tells the public that Hartwall Capital's properties in the company are not linked to tax planning.
According to Berner, the multiplicity of the taxable property structure is due to the fact that the largest owner of the capital fund in Khärs in Triton was already equipped with a Luxembourg holding company for property.
In Espoo, the company’s maintenance reception centre opens
In Espoo, the first company will open a reception centre for senior asylum seekers.
The reception centre is ready to take the first hundred seats from this evening.
The number of seats can be increased within the week for up to 300 to 400 people.
The Agency for Migration shall establish the reception centre at the establishment of the former Rescue Agreement.
The action will continue to be carried out by Luona Oy, which is in particular the production of health care and health services.
The City of Espoo, the Immigration Office and Luona Oy agree on the security arrangements of the Centre.
STTK produces an alternative working life registration package
The STTK is involved in preparing an alternative package for government work cuts.
The order also hopes that other employers' organisations will be able to do so.
According to President Antti Palola, at this point, there is a lot of concern.
Alternative means of reducing the price of work are then returned.
Everyone understands that life continues after dinner, Palola noted the organization’s management meeting with the suppliers.
Palola felt that the Central Union for Life (EC) was not prepared for discussions instead.
The economic operators of the STTK have estimated that the Government’s competitive capacity package would pay the employer EUR 30 million for a changeover of EUR 2,700 million on the other side of the package.
I don't know if the party has a great intention to engage in the discussion if it has one hundred relations.
Palola: The negotiating relationship had to be built
Prime Minister Juha Sipil (Central) has hoped that alternative proposals will be made by midweek, since then the Government will have to give its own package of communication to the delegation and start preparing the amendments.
Palola didn't take the position whether the schedule is realistic.
The discussion with the government is based on Palola, and it has been necessary to build it all the time.
The STTK's operating agency in the area of the STTK is particularly a rough place according to Palola.
The order requires that the government withdraws from the required legislation which would be implementing part of the infringements.
According to the STTK, Palola does not provide us with an alternative package to prepare the matter with the SDP.
The employers will meet on Friday in Helsinki to oppose the government's presentation of a working life registration package last week.
Part of the package, i.e. the first sick days' wages will be paid, overwork benefits will be paid, sun pay will be reduced to 75% and flowers will be reduced.
It is stressed from the STTK that the central organisations have called the employer into consideration and that the purpose of the scheme has not been legal.
Akavan Fjäder thanks
Mr Stru Fjäder, President of the Akkava, welcomes the notification by the STTK on the preparation of an alternative package.
According to Fjäder, the STTK will now come to the same lines with Akava, as Akava has more advanced options for the model for government presentations.
Fjäder hopes that SAK will also be provided with an alternative package because without SAK the package will not be enough.
Mr Fjäder, President-in-Office of the Akkava, hoped that Mr Lylyn would prepare the proposal for an alternative to interruptions, according to the future of the SAK.
Antti Palolan STTK told me last Wednesday that he was preparing new proposals.
We want change-safe and working time banks.
Akava announced on Wednesday that it has already prepared its own presentation for a long time and is ready to discuss the goal of the country's government of five per cent of the competitiveness capacity for the cuts option.
Akava has been ready for consultation all the time, and we have long written out alternatives to government presentations.
We are ready to consider the terms of service as part of the contract.
On the contrary, we want change-safe and working time banks, says President Sture Fjäder.
Fjäder hopes that SAK will also come to Akava lines, as the STTK has done in the past Wednesday.
Without SAK the package is not strong enough.
We are now preparing together a model that goes to the country's government and employers, Fjäder says.
The Akkava Committee shall meet on Thursday at 15 a.m. to take a decision on the possible content of the agreement.
"The same water, common ice, roofs" - play bingo in Sipil's talk at night
Green Left of Tampere University
Viva's Bingo Cup tonight at the University of Tampere.
The Prime Minister has previously held exceptional talks during the occupation of Ments and the wars.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä speaks very strangely to the public about the state of the economy of Finland at the Ylen Canal on Wednesday at 21.05 a.m.
In order to speak in advance of the Prime Minister, he has to go back to 1932, when Pehr Évind Svinhufvud was the Prime Minister at the time of the hearing radio speech, which meant the beginning of the end of the Cape Town.
After that, the President and the ministers held several radio calls during the winter and the follow-up.
In the 1990s, Esko Aho held President Mauno Koivisto instead of the new year, but it was more of a ceremony.
In 1976, President Urho Kekkonen ended up on television.
A single call from a monarchist mine
The silent speech has aroused criticism and criticism all day long.
The President of the Left-wing Society Paavo Archimäki stated on Twitter that "Sipil could hold his speech on the status of his nation in his delegation as a statement by the Prime Minister when he would also be able to discuss it".
According to the Green Ville Niinistun "the single call has already been seen.
The leadership includes dialogue, listening to people.
The SDP's Erkki Judges ruled on Facebook that "Monarchist mine: the Prime Minister will tell the people what is best for it".
SDP's president, Mr Rinne, challenged the Sipel's dialogue: "I've been in the election for half a year.
Not only did the Prime Minister appear with the media opposition.
It's been tried.
What's @juhashila afraid of?
Public service
According to the people of the State Council, the Sipil spoken ahead of time and lasted about 15 minutes.
According to SAK, this was expressed in a direct letter by SAK President Lauri Lyly and EC supplier Jyri Häkmies.
It is generally appreciated for the presentation of the Sipil speech.
We considered the matter and concluded that it is part of the public service task of promoting a wide range of publications throughout Finland, lined up by the director of Ylen's publications Ismo Silva Ylen in the news.
As We Were When We Stumbled
The speech has also raised doubts.
In the evening, you will enjoy the good night’s walk, the children will cry, and the best will be kissed.
The mother puts on a clean blanket, and the father adjusts the amount.
At nine o’clock they are late on television than before during the time of We Tammelos," writes blogger Saku Timonen.
"Does Prime Minister Sipil also tell me why the Government of Finland is sitting in the taxable capitals, which have made other tax havens, and at the same time say to the people that it is necessary to cut money when the government has finished?" asked Pia Lohikoski.
What Siplä says, one opinion is that of the University of Tampere's Green Left Viva.
It's a post on Facebook.
Do we hear about the same Russian, common wind, life and group life tonight?
The coupons and doors are ready, at 21.05 a.m. it starts and channels are TV1, Radio Finland and Yle Arena.
At Ahtisaari Guardia: Westerners fought against the exclusion of Russia's al-Assad proposal
The West fought more than three years ago against Russia's offer by Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to free the country, he told President Martti Ahtisaari Guardian.
According to the Ahtisara, Russia's UN envoy proposed a plan which, after some time, al-Assad would have been very disappointed by the threat of violence.
However, the Westerners did not object to the proposal because they believed that al-Assad had disappeared within a few weeks.
The Ahtisaari discussed the Syrian crisis in 2012 with five permanent members of the UN Security Council.
According to Ahtisaer, Russia's Ambassador Vitali Tshurki listed three points in the two-part debate: the opposition was unable to get weapons, opposition and al-Assad was forced to contact immediately and the release from al-Assad was due to be carried out gradually.
I know Tshurkin.
We do not have to agree on all the same things, but we can discuss them openly.
I told him what I did there and he said that sitting down with Alas, Martti, so I tell him what we have to do, Ahtisaari remembers Guardian's challenge.
Diplomats do not comment
Ahtisaari tells us his message to the United States, the United Kingdom and France, but nothing happened.
Tshurki has not confirmed the content of the debate on the paper, but according to Ahtisaer, there are no two words.
The UN diplomats also rejected Ahtisaer's comments, but said that al-Assad's groups had already made several groups and central opposition groups rejected all agreements in which he had left power.
The former President of the British Foreign Ministry Sir John Jenkins is referring to the House of Commons of Ahtisaer because, according to his experience, Russia was not at any stage ready to discuss the case of al-Assad.
Russia has officially supported al-Assadia throughout the war.
The worst point in Ahtisaer's claim is that Tshurkin spoke with Moscow's authority.
If he had told me about Shrurkin's speech, I would have answered that I would like to hear the same President Vladimir Putin, so that I can take it seriously.
According to Jenkins, he would also have doubted that Putin's attempt to hold power on some part of al-Assad's support would have been in this case.
Return to our own things
During the Ahtisaa negotiations, about 7,500 people died in the Syrian crisis.
According to the UN estimate, the number of deaths exceeded 220,000 at the beginning of the year.
More than 11 million people have had to leave their homes because of war.
We should have stopped this disaster.
The transfer of refugees to Europe is our own responsibility.
I don't see any other options than to take good care of these decent people.
Now we're paying the bill that we've caused ourselves, Ahtisaari tells the paper.
Tornion Centre for Security Seekers in Turkey
The planning of the administration in Northern Finland for asylum seekers is likely to be based on Toronto.
The centre would be based at the centre of the city on the construction of the Tower Community.
The Ministry of the Interior has sought a suitable place to improve the management of the refugee zone in Sweden.
Helsingin said it was clear that the Authority would have already decided to present a school building to your minister.
According to the Vice-President of the Town Authority of Turin, Saul Hyopis (V.) does not hold his place.
When the whole authority was not in school and part of the message wanted an official decision, we decided to invite the Bureau to decide on the matter for the first few months.
On the ground, 36 were authorized by 43.
In response to 13 orders from the Consortium.
On that basis, it may be expected that the decision is a positive, beautiful statement.
According to city leader Timo Nousais, the city received no contact on Monday, and it was reacted quickly.
The Community would evaluate 500 asylum seekers on a number of occasions.
The expert has taken the view that it could apply to such use.
The location is a couple of meters away from the border, so it would also be in the mind of it, The New Yorker says.
There is still hope for an option from the labour market for infringements
According to Prime Minister Juha Sipil (Central) the public's involvement in gambling would only cover part of the government's goal of calculating the price of work.
However, the government considers it to be against the alternative package if the labour market organisations succeed in making such an agreement.
Sipil told the suppliers in the delegation that he had not been in contact with labour market organisations.
He also did not know how seriously the organizations were looking for ways to pay back the government's tax on job abuses.
If such an agreement arises, we will take it without any further pleasure as part of the complete package.
Securing vacations would be effective in Sipil’s view, since it would target almost all employers other than, for example, the government’s plans to cut off Sundays.
The labour market organisations could be centrally agreed on the termination of pensions because they are written in the law rather than in employment contracts.
The Government shall inform the representative of the working life of the delegation of the first half of the week of its first appearance as a communication from the Council of State.
According to the Commissioner, the proposals of the organisations should be aware of this before.
There's no final backer.
The legislative work will then proceed to the movement, i.e. the chain is moving and it will become more difficult for the whole time.
Now's a good time.
I won't be long in these things if you want, Siplé.
In the last week of the administration's published list, there is, inter alia, a change in the final and hero's wages for the free working time of the year without a reduction in pay.
In addition, the first days of illness pay will be paid, overtime benefits will be paid, solar pay will be reduced by 75% and the ceiling will be reduced.
The amendments are carried out as a compulsory legislative end of professional associations which has aroused strong appreciation.
Employer organisations are organizing a major event on Friday, and many professional associations have also published political laws.
The authorities of the Republic of Turkey approved the extension of the assets of the Kingdom of Poland
The authorities of the Tohma lake agreed unanimously, but a small number of young Nordic Koivu Oy government, namely the extension of the Mahalalin estate.
The reason for this was that the project was much bigger and more expensive than the original one had been mentioned.
A fast schedule is also very rare.
However, it was little surprised that the state was not aware of this year when it was decided on the previous enlargement.
At this stage, the expansion of the stock was approved by 400 to 450 kilometres in the investment programme, but the funding is decided as a result of the contribution report.
The list further discussed the investment of EUR 150,000 to EUR 200 000, but at the meeting, technical director Erkki Iconen said that the price would be estimated at EUR 300 000.
The investment was supported by the fact that it brings work and income to the local community.
There is no risk because the company pays investment rent, Vesa Väistö (p.) was founded.
A place in the Karjal language in Joensusu
The city administration of Lithuania has previously moved its position to the centre of Joensuu in the Caribbean.
The new decision is important and right in mind to choose a career tradition throughout the country.
Joensuu was not declared the capital of Karjala because it has no historical grounds and the language of Karja is not a natural part of the identity of the region.
The language spoken in the village of Joensuu has become more and more of the Eastern Slavic dialects.
After the new decision, the centre of the city will not become a carnival catalist.
However, the city of Joensuu is also prepared for good consideration in the use of the Carthage language, for example in the information field and in the marketing of travel.
The same attitude is recommended by the city to all other actors.
Although Joensuu is officially a single citizen, as well as in the use of Karal language, it supports the attitude of the populace now when diversity lives and changes powerfully in the North Karillas.
The Karjalan language is still unique in the country, as well as a beautiful Joensusta throughout Finland as a forest town.
Both can make good use of them in a variety of markets in the country.
Disengagement of connections stops the animal health of the country
The cuts of connections are due to force the country to live with a strong hand.
Business relations directly affect the life and competitiveness of the country.
And it's going to affect whether we can stay here and do work, the city leader Karjalanin is surprised.
He is also referring to the air traffic which has continued to be reported on several occasions.
It is important for the whole country that our opportunities are not limited by State measures, as we are doing now.
The effects of these restrictions on employment should be seen, for example, by Karjalinen.
The deterioration of social relations causes an increase in the attractiveness of the University of Eastern Finland.
Of course, the better services there are here, such as traffic connections and housing, it is easier to get students and workers, the director of the University of Eastern Finland, Jukka Mönkönänen.
He notes that bad traffic relations also affect the research team, which is very moving and travel through much of the research.
The Recruitment Officer Marko Junkrikinen says that the marketing of the university in West Finland is already difficult because travel links are weak in the way of eviction.
About half of the students from the University of Eastern Finland will now come from outside Finland.
About 10-20 per cent of them are from New Zealand, which is explained in part by direct communication.
The revolution came one time for your army.
The view of the city administration of Joensuu on the earthly project of your army is apparently unique, but one of them is a group.
Mr Pentti Kesksakilo (c.e., picture) presented the government's Monday meeting with a discharge on the whole project, but his presentation was not backed up.
The Government adopted the Cari Karjali decision-making session, which will be reviewed at the beginning of October before the city administration meeting, which will give the project final opinion at the same time with all other citizens.
One spring from Kotka to Koulola in the first year
Your personal transportation from Kotka Koulola to the future will remain, even though one generation of Europe is rarer.
Changes in passenger transport between Kotka and Kouvola will take place in March first.
One Saturday's left, but five more days later, Kotka will arrive at Kowulola and on the contrary.
Suspension is due to State savings.
For the next four-year period, purchases of transport and communications services by the Ministry of Transport and Communications will be reduced by EUR 12.3 million.
The quietest streets will be completely destroyed.
VR creates new schedules by the end of the year.
They shall enter into force on 27.3.2016.
The boys jumped to the floor, one didn't get down, the guys moved out.
The rescue plant survived a massive catacomb at the age of 12, which was not even able to get under the catalyst of its own.
The situation was born in Toronto, Ketotalia, about six o'clock in the morning.
There's an old two-sided tree that doesn't have any leads on the floor.
It did not prevent a group of boys who decided to climb the roof of the house next to it for a long time.
Some of the boys went down the same road, but one didn't.
As a result, others moved from place to place and the shipyards warned the rescue plant to help the last cat to safely return to the ground.
FedEx's traffic target is critical, tax year 2016 is expected
FedEx reported massive results from its last quarter, and the delivery surplus stopped during the year of delivery, due to the lack of demand for railway services and the higher costs of its services.
The company also said it was going to hire about 55,000 seasonal workers for leisure.
This time last year, FedEx announced that it would be paying 50,000 seasonal workers for hours.
Its share was estimated at about 2.5 per cent in the open-air market 45 minutes before the opening-air hour.
FedEx Corp. says that it is expected first in May for the end of the tax year to be $10.40-10.90, which is 20 cents lower than the above forecast.
The analysts were expecting $10.84 to tell us about FactSet.
Smaller sights came despite an average rate of 4.9 per cent of price increases coming into force on 4 January and despite the higher charges that started in November in the case of heavy or large packages.
The company said that it is expecting a still growing traffic force in the previous year because they have fallen costs, trade has grown and network trade has grown.
President-in-Office Fred Smith said that the company "will take into account the expected weaker economic conditions in particular in production and world-wide trade."
Plans of pay were published for the rest of the day after the tenderer said it was going to pay 90-95,000 extra workers as much as it paid last year.
By the end of 31 August, the fourth quarter of FedEx was $692 million, which is 6 per cent more than last year.
The victory per part amounted to $2.42, which will be $2.44 on average. A 12-analytic question was carried out by Zacks Investment Research.
The trade rate rose by 5 percent to 12.3 billion dollars.
In Zacks' question, six analysts were waiting for $12.23 billion.
FedEx has suffered a reduction in international priority transport in recent years, which has stopped the development of its Express unit for trade.
However, the increase in network traffic has improved the results of FedEx Ground.
In the last quarter, the turnover of the unit increased by 29 per cent, but in principle the results of the activities were the same because of the costs and insurance of the most expensive packages.
The income of the Express unit was better due to higher basic fees, while the higher labour costs were lower in the freight industry.
In the open-air market about an hour before opening-up, FedEx shares would be $3.85 per cent, or $25 per cent, 150.15.
FedEx closed for a period of less than 11 per cent this year and less than 17 per cent below the forecast on 11 June.
In the United States, the Central Bank’s decision-makers will be sitting this week at the end of a long-term meeting of the mighty mahogany table, whether it is time to raise the lead rate for the first time in almost ten years.
On the other hand, the central bank is a cross-sectional, two-room meeting room in the United States.
The map is a reminder that the President of the Central Bank, Janet L. Yellen and his colleagues, must put the economic interests of the nation ahead of all others.
The Congress has taken a double responsibility for the central bank's debt: they must maximize the employment of the United States and keep prices stable.
However, after the Great Lake, the central bank’s leaders have accepted that there is also a third, unwritten mandate: economic stability.
That is why this third requirement can be a decisive factor in a decision published as a torrent which is so tight that it cannot even be predicted. The decision is whether the US economy is ready to be visited by a preliminary incentive which has been almost zero since 2008 .
Although most of the information shows a steady growth in the economy, the recent year in the global financial markets may have made the central bank's officials in advance more stable than ever to increase uncertainty.
"Developingly the labour market and inflation are the first and most important things to be followed," says Lindsey M. Piegza, a meklaric graduate of Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"I believe, however, that if they are looking for a right to leave a high-level loan, there has been an increase in uncertainty in the world market, there is still a valid basis for waiting," he says.
The decision of the Central Bank has not reached a consensus, which has already led to a lack of flexibility in the economy.
According to a young Blomberg study, about half of the economic experts predict a rise in inflation this week.
The financial market also expects the Central Bank to slow down growth because according to the central indicator, there is only about 30 per cent chance of growth.
This refers to the calculation of the securities market, if the central bank rises the level, then the decision makers would then succeed in reducing the debt by promising that the next rise would not take place in the near future.
As the Dow Jones industrial average index increased by 228.89 points, or 1.4 per cent, by 16 599.85 per cent.
According to the disappointment, it was expected that the Central Bank would hold a level before this week, says John Londonski, Moody's Capital Markets Research Group's chief economic expert.
"I'm surprised if the central bank will rise high right now," she says.
If decision-makers rise their pride, "they have to see a lot of difficulties in line to support the financial market so that they don't have to panic."
Other experts claim that the adjusted level would bring financial markets to peace because it would remove uncertainty as to when the central bank operates.
Only a few months later, it appeared that the Central Bank would be able to rise by 4 per cent this month, taking the first small step towards a slow down in the financial situation that would guarantee stability in the United States.
Yellen has seen from the morning and early days that she is expecting a rise in the level this year, despite the fact that liberals are demanding more economic development in her complaints.
Although the creation of new jobs was delayed in August, the growth in the labour market has been stable this year.
The unemployment rate has dropped by 5.1 per cent in the last month, which is below the level of seven years and is close to the level that the Central Bank considers to be the limit of full employment.
The growth of leaves has shown signs of hibernation.
Although inflation is still below the 2% annual goal of the central bank, the central bank’s decision-makers consider this to have a significant temporary impact on the price of oil falling.
The economy "is clear of the highest levels and also needs to take into account the harsh situation of the labour market", says Ian Shepherdson, Pantheon Macroeconomics.
However, the financial market around the world declined in the last week when China took its currency down.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average Index even estimated 16% of its current forecast when investors feared that China’s delayed economy would also slow down global growth.
This month's market has reached a certain level, and the Dow index is now nearly 10% below a powerful peak.
For the decision-makers of the Central Bank, the market mellery is an added factor in a multi-faceted unit which tells us that the high level has to be raised.
"I look forward to these financial markets events and the recent renewal of the Chinese economy in recent weeks, the decision-makers would distort the level at this meeting," says Stephen D. Oliner, UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate, as well as the former Central Bank official.
Now he predicts that decision makers are waiting for at least a month to get better understanding of the effects.
"The possible effects on the economy in the United States are still quite unclear, and they do not have any information about the consequences of China's events," Oliver says.
The improvement of the international economy is not a central bank’s main concern, so it should not, in principle, affect decision-making.
In practice, however, the central bank of the United States has become the world's currency authority.
In recent years the influence of the Central Bank has been unintended.
In 2013, then President Ben S. Bernanken, the guidance that the Central Bank can "catch" the increase in the amount of money, caused distortions on the markets around the world.
In a world where markets and economies are still becoming increasingly fragmented, central bank officials are expected not only to further develop, but also to consult other central banks and experts in order to get better understanding of the world economy.
The central bank's decision-making process is "more art than science", says Zachary Karabell, the property management company Investnet Inc., head of the global strategy.
The President of the Federal Reserve Bank of the state of Richmond, Virginia, noted this month that "the central bank has previously overridden its financial markets, which has affected the different economic infrastructures."
The Federal Open Market Committee for Decision-making has called for an increase in weight, and Lacker, a member of the Committee who is voting, for example, refers to the 1998-99 decisions.
In this respect, the economic crisis caused the Central Bank to break down its reference value by 0.75 per cent during the three meetings "in spite of its limited, identifiable effects on economic growth in the United States", says Lacker.
A year later, the Central Bank had all these cuts.
The Central Bank should establish economic stability for the first party only during the major crisis, as in 2008, the former member of the Central Bank of England, Adam S. Posen, said.
Lastly, myllery won't get close to its level, Posen's real.
"No one wants to be in a situation where the rise of pride is afraid that the market will deteriorate," says Posen, President of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act of the Federal State Law on Central Banks (Federal Act) is still considered to be a double requirement, and does not mention economic stability. As long as this is the case, they should not predict it.
Do you hate a great Thai trade?
Try LAX-C in Chinatown.
Yes, Chinatown.
This trade/stock was opened in 1997 and owned by LAX-C Inc.
LAX-C, often referred to in Thai-Costicona, is a retail trade that also sells to individuals.
Yeah, it's in Chinatown, not in Thai Town.
The trade/stock is one stop shop which offers the best choice of young people, packaged and dried benefits, the best Thai and Asian facilities, kitchen needs, bedrooms and religious and holiday resorts.
The goods are also included in the car department if you need motor oil.
It's a big deal, and it takes more than an hour to turn everybody around.
If the store makes you hungry, you can eat at LAX-C BBQ Express.
The food house (good, bad) located inside the shop is close to cash, and there are several alternatives for youth.
What's the deal? Do you need anything - anything - from the domestics?
LAX-C probably sells it.
The products are well evaluated and most of the products are sold in support packages.
There are Asian specialities and regional spices, spices and other products.

Where it is located: The trade is located in the manufacturing area of Los Angeles near Chinatown and I'm talking about the facilities - some maps at the entrance of Philippe The Original.
Location: LAX-C has its own parking area, which it shares with other shops and restaurants.
Although shopping can be fast, parking is usually easy.
Brazil’s Children’s Fund in Rio Grande mentions a healthy diet for farmers
The Brazilian Children's Association SPRS has found a way to try to get women to understand the importance of good nutrition during breast-feeding by publishing images of baby babies in strange neighborhoods that have been painted with pictures of unhealthy meat.
It consists of various proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need for the development of a strong immune system.
Women and new mothers who are pregnant need extra energy, so they are advised to increase their daily calorie levels by about 500 calories.
However, a new study shows that increasing the calorie rate is not the only food option that mothers should make.
A young research conducted by the Texas Baylor College of Medicine Professor Robert Waterland revealed that the healthy diet of pregnant women actually affects their babies’ genetics and protects babies from the development of plants.
Unfortunately, poor nutrition was found to have a negative impact on the child’s immune system.
The Seven-Kanavan Sunrise programme is popular for viewing, despite Nine-Kana’s companies to update the director’s statement in Today Show programme
Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson's round of Canberra's refurbishment of the post-liberal election failed to increase the visibility of Today.
The Nine-Canaan morning program was sent from the capital of the country after Malcolm Turnbull filed a complaint against Tony Abbott.
The competitive Sunrise program, which was sponsored by David Koch and Samantha Armyage, was in London as part of the weekly series of international missions covering also Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
The overwhelming majority of Australian TV viewers were not aware of this, since Sunrise had a peak of 397 000 in the five state capital cities when Today was 339 000.
The mean value of Toda was slightly higher than the moon (317 000) and the last of about 283,000, but it was still lower than the last tortoise (343 000).
Today's been arrested by Sunrise for the last few months.
In August, Toda's average was 318,000 and Sunrise 330,000.
At the beginning of the year, there was a difference between 40,000 and 50,000 spectators.
On the other hand, during September the average value of Sunrise is 349 000 spectators, while today’s figure is 314,000.
This is a very interesting event in the morning.
The winds are talking about this morning as well as in Parliament!
Karl and Lisa can do it. Thank you for asking.

The great news of the Seven Canal was the 800-word series, which presents the former Packed to the Rafters series star Erik Thomson, an amazing initiative.
A new drama series, which gathered an average of 1,219 million viewers, recently tells of the remaining father who decided to change the border of New Zealand with his two children.
Critics have wondered if Thomson's recommended line is the only force without the Ruffers from Rebecca Gibney.
Last night's results gave this real security.
Seven-year-old The X Factor was a strong favourite with a view of 1,136 million, making it easy to win The Block Series (838,000) and the TBL Families series (726,000).
Seven-canal was a two-day trial in The Chase Australia series on the second night.
Andrew O'Keefen's first half hour (17-17.30) of the new universal programme gathered an average of 446,000 spectators.
The second half hour (17.30-18) ended with 623 000 spectators - which was enough for a small win from Eddie McGuiren Hot Seat (613,000).
The first half hour of The Chase Australia's first half hour was 520,000 spectators, and the second half hour was 720,000.
Hot Seat's average was 620,000.
The Chase Australia's second night's average rating will bring the Nine Canal to trust that the Hot Seat will finally be the recommended program at 7:30 p.m.
The Chase Australia replaced the Million Dollar Minute programme, which did not succeed in reducing McGuire's target.

Do you think Sam Wood is a perfect guy, but who does he choose?
The secret is revealed? ...
Lana Jeavans-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Marcoski were in danger of discovering who wins The Bachelor series.
The woman's personality has been held in a very good secret that Sam Wood concludes with The Bachelor.
The three remaining girls really don't like who got the last move.
However, during our discussion with Sarah Mackay, Snezana Markoskin and Lana Jaavans-Fellows before the three came, however, they were reluctant to give guidance to the winner's personality.
Sam Wood's lips are sealed before the toaster's final.
All three women refused to be rude when they told how Wood is a perfect man who mentioned his smoking, his home, his family values, and his positiveness because of why they wanted to be his partner.
However, when they were asked, "If Wood's last meal isn't for you, who should go for it?" they could offer a revelation about who won the boy's heart.
Both Jeevons-Fellows and Marcoski quickly mentioned Mackay as the best option for Wood after their own.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood have been silent since the first day.
"From the moment I walked into the house, (Sarah) the energy and Sam's energies were very compatible, and that thought was in my mind for a whole series of years," said Yeavons-Fellows.
"Sarah is really beautiful, it's a pleasure to be," Markoski added.
I've seen them together and there's chemistry between them.
They feel comfortable and comfortable together.
Sarah Mackay believes that she and Sam Wood agreed very well.
Mackay said that last week's homework was getting him to realize that Wood could be "it's true".
"When I saw her with my friends and family I realized that this was not just a game - I am now with my whole heart here," she said.
When you asked who Woodin should choose if he didn't, Mackay was valuable.
"I don't know if I can say," she said.
I like the rest of the girls, so it's the balance between Snezan and Lana.
The Bachelor will be sent on Wednesday at 19.30 a.m. Ten-canal.
"Sarah is the best option for Sam Wood?"
Jarryd Hayen has many options to start her NFL career
Detroit and Seattle were both very interested in his modified United States, and many other groups have asked him about him after his opening date of practice last year.
Hayne, however, chose the San Francisco 49ers group as well as the manufacturer Jim Tomsula, and this has been a wise decision.
Some of the manufacturers would have left Hayin’s turn for the final game after the time of the defeat of this Australian warship's translator broke the ball on his first flight back to the team at Minnesota's turn to read from 20-3.
But Tomsula trusted her husband and allowed Hayen to return the next flight and took her to the race team after Reggie Bush was fired.
The real nature of Tomsula was also seen in the bedroom after the game.
Instead of putting his new results ahead of another group, he would encourage them.
Tomsula also publicly supported Hayne in the post-game press.
49er's Specialist Cam Inman reported that Haynea would also encourage Special Forces Coordinator Thomas McGaughey, who advised him to forget the fallen ball and worry about the next game.
Jarryd Hayne dropped the plane that Minnesota Vikings hit on the first playoff
This was not really the beginning of Hayne and her Australian fans were hoping for a man's NFL debyty.
Haynen was seen on his way from the countryside after the explosion, and later he told the Australian radio station Hamish & Andy on 2DayFM channel at 104.1 that he would not have been able to imagine a better start to the NFL.
"It was just one of these things now, you have to think about the next game and it's there," Hayne said.
Hayne compared her sugar intake to her original diet in 2007 when eating on her own land led to Queensland land.
All of this was still a great experience for this 27-year-old.
After the game, Hayne put her on the Instagram screen with the fans on the Australian flag.

4 died in a police attack against interested parties in Nepal
Four people, including four-year-old son, died in the police force in southern Nepal, which showed their interest in a new constitution proposal, the government told them on Wednesday.
It happened on Tuesday evening in the Rupande region about 175 miles west of the capital city of Katmandu.
The chief officer of the area, Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, said that there had been more than 1,000 spectators on the outside of the police station, and part of them threw stones and bombs.
Dhakal said that the police used gas and then fired air before he got into the mines.
Twenty police officers and five civilians were injured, he told me.
It was not immediately clear why the deaths known as killings, but which are traditionally used as less dangerous alternatives, appeared to have caused so many deaths.
In recent weeks, the report has been in several parts of Nepal's southern regions, which say that the new provinces based on the proposed new constitution undermine their political influence.
There have also been protests in western Nepal when the Tharus Group requires its own state.
After 10 August, at least 40 people died in violent encounters, 11 of whom were police officers.
At that time, four main parties signed a contract in which the country was divided into provinces - this is a major step towards a new constitution, but a very controversial matter in Nepal which has been centralised for centuries.
The new Constitution has been designed since 2008, but the legislators accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake killed thousands of people in April.
The legislators have voted this week on the draft Constitution in Katmandu, and the authorities have said that the new constitution was won by Sundays.

Google starts a donation campaign to collect 11 million dollars for refugees
Google Inc (GOOGL.O) would publish a donation campaign aimed at raising 11 million dollars to humanitarian organizations helping thousands of European refugees from war zones and poor countries.
Google had an exceptional personal view of its public donation campaign blogs.
Instead of making a statement, one of his own personal experiences, Google worker Rita Masoud wrote, who took seven years away from Kabul with his family.
"We spend a lot of dark rides and bus trips, as well as hunger, thirst, cold and darkness," he wrote.
I was lucky.
But when the refugee and immigration crisis in Europe has grown, people like my family are reluctant to help.
The solutions will be achieved by four non-target organisations that help refugees and immigrants: Doctors without borders, International Rescue Committee, Save the Children as well as UN refugees.
Google said that it corresponds to the same amount for each global google.com/refugeelief gift every year up to $5.5 million, so the total goal is $11 million.
Europe has been in the worst refugee crisis since the second world war, and that is why Syria's four-year-long internal conflict, which has taken over 4 million people this year, has been coded.
Many also refuse to go to war from Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

Diabetes can help mildly transportable diabetes
According to a new study, the benefits of type 2 diabetes mellitus may last for at least five years.
However, it is still too early to say whether these live mildly moving diabetics longer after the surgery than those treated in other ways than surgery.
"The acquisition of mortality data will last a long time," says Dr. Robin Blackstone. He is a biopsy expert who wrote a new study in JAMA Surgery's magazine.
Several methods are used to reduce the amount of the solution in barbaric surgery.
They reduce hunger and limit food intake.
Over the years, bariarthritis has been shown to be effective in the treatment of type 2 diabetes, but most of the subjects involved in the study have had diseased bodies and their weight index (BMI) has been 35 or more.
The weight ratio of BMI is considered normal when between 18.5 and 24.9.
If BMI is more than 25, it shows that someone is overweight, and if the person is more than 30 BMI, he is considered to be a trafficker.
You can calculate your own BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For this new study, researchers in the Taiwanese Min-Sheng General Hospital used the data collected since 2007 to compare the two types of bariarthritis, the closure of the pancreas, and the reduction of renal failure in the treatment of type 2 diabetes in people who were mildly hyperactive.
The study showed that the average number of disabled persons was falling from 31.5 by the end of the fifth year.
At the same time, those who were treated in other ways than surgery, BMI remained at the same maximum in 29 years.
In 36% of infected people, diabetes improved overall and 28% participated.
As a result of comparison, in the treatment group, diabetes improved by only 1% and by about 2%.
In addition, blood pressure, triglycerides and "bad" LDL collector "were generally taken in better surgery groups", the authors noted.
The researchers also followed levels of haemoglobin A1c in patients who reversing blood sugar levels over a long period of time.
Haemoglobin A1c should remain below 7%, the researchers are writing.
After surgery the haemoglobin A1c level fell by about 9 per cent to approximately 6 per cent.
However, in the medical treatment group, it remained steady by about 8%.
This better "glycemic control", described by improved haemoglobin A1c levels, however, has not reduced mortality over five years, says Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu colleague.
The study group also compared the average results between two different types of amputation.
In the fifth year when compared to the small-scale drop-out group, the drop-out group (18.7 and 14.2 kg), the higher weight index (7.4 and 5.1), the higher level of haemoglobin A1c (3.1% and 2.1%), and the more likely to achieve the full diabetes resuscitation (46.9% and 16.7%).
The University of Arizona College of Medicine-Phoenix Blackstone says that although the study does not show life expectancy or disability after five years, there are research results from Sweden, where abortion has led to a longer life of stress.
In a Swedish study, 29% of traffic fatalities in traffic accidents were found to be less likely to die within 15 years of being compared to a group that had experienced more traditional treatment techniques.
Although the new study does not show any improvement in the survival of disabled patients, Blackstone says that the results are encouraging to people with BMI below 35 who are interested in abortion.
"Research results are decisive just because they show that the withdrawal is safe to a group of low-pressure index," he says, not to mention the risk of death or kidney disease.
Blackstone adds that both patients and their doctors should take very seriously at the stage of BMI between 27 and 30.
"I think we'll wait too long before we take this seriously," she says.
I believe that when man has collected these genetic changes that are constantly preparing his body for mobility and diabetes, it is very difficult to undo the situation.
"They can't all come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT News
Dalai Lama has said that Europe cannot accept all refugees and that the real solution to the current refugee crisis is found in the Middle East.
The leader of Tibetan Buddhism has demanded the end of violence in refugee homes.
Dalai Lama addressed the refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten-day visit to Britain at the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford. The centre is dedicated to ethical research.
Dalai Lama said that in the current situation, the needs of all mankind should continue to be felt by individual nations or even countries.
He also stressed that while the response to the refugee crisis in Western Europe is welcome, it is also inadequate.
"They can't all come to Europe," he said in his speech.
Although Dalai Lama has overrun the activities of Germany and Austria in the crisis, he stressed that there is only a temporary solution.
"I look forward to taking care of many thousands of refugees, but between them there are long-term solutions: how these Muslims can bring true peace and real development, almost through education.
The first thing is to think about how we can reduce killing in their country.
We need to reduce the use of force.
The use of power has never solved these problems," he added.
As regards the issue of violence, Dalai Lama also commented on George Bush's action after 9/11 terrorist attacks and claimed that the violent response of the United States caused chain borders.
"In my letter after 9/11, I presented my statement to President Bush and told him that the solution to this problem is through non-violence.
I know his motives were good, but he used power and it created unexpected consequences," said Dalai Lama.
In the last four years, children’s use of handicraft has increased to fourfold.
In the case of children under 12 years of age after 2010, almost 400 per cent of the population reported a strong increase in the incidence of alcohol poisoning in the United States.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, the reported cases of desinfiotic events in children under 12 years of age in the 2010 case of 3266 rose from 16117 in 2014 to 16117.
"Children are more interested in these products and worse because a certain percentage of them are due to day care," Lopez told CNN.
He said that some children use disinfectants for the purpose, while others want to influence their friends or respond to a challenge in the social media.
There are videos on YouTube where teen-ages use disinfectants to get a bad rise rate.
According to the reports, the substance has been mixed into an alcoholic drink to obtain a stronger drink.
The recommended disinfectants may attract younger children.
"The kid doesn't think this is bad for him," Lopez said.
Many of the most interesting (handicrafts) are those to which the fruit has been added.
There are manicure, wine line and orange deinfiction substances that are very attractive to children.
The hand disinfectant may contain alcohol between 45 and 95 % alcohol.
In particular, young children need only a few injections for alcohol.
"It's a really specific alcohol," said Mr. Stephen Thornton, director of the hospital's nursing centre at Kansas City.
So you shouldn't leave whiskey on your desk, but the handicraft is left visible, and if the children are interested in it, it's a quick way to drink a lot of alcohol.
Nhaijah Russell is a six-year-old girl who, some time ago, had only four syringes of manicure in school, and was taken to be treated as a nurse.
Her blood alcohol level was .179, which is twice the limit of the adult rat contract, says Dr. Chris Ritchey, an Essenpolitan clinician who cared for a girl in the outlying Gwinnet Medical Center in the Atlantic.
Now, when he spoke to her, she couldn't walk when he got married.
The doctors followed him over at night in a separate hospital for possible brain damage, because alcohol got the girl to lose and hit her head, Richchey told me.
"It was really scary," his mother Ortoria Scott told CNN.
Your situation could have been to kill my baby.
Endez has recommended that parents and teachers use non-alcoholic products or disinfectants and transfer disinfectants from children to adults.
In addition to alcoholic beverages, some disinfectants have been combined into deaths.
In 2013, two indigenous women were killed by hand disinfectants, which contained toxic, unreported material.
Health authorities consider that the product contains methyl, a deadly substance and not ethyl alcohol, which has been reported to be an active substance.
In January, in the northern part of New York State, three fourths of their teachers were planning to shower their "high" teacher by spreading bacterium into the classroom, reports the police report.
The teacher is very allergic to the disinfectant and refused to classify it.
The police are supposed to prevent the plan from being "fashioned" and leave it to school.
Huhumylly: Celtic has no disputes
Griffiths reduces talking about Celtic contradictions, and Deila admits that Hopes is in a narrow place, but she can turn it
Hearts is fighting Scotland's football league against Neilson's crimes, and Warburton is alert to January's differences that can disrupt the unity of the group
Dons grew up leading Celtic to the point of reference
The first half of Adam Rooney's sentence took Aberdeen's defeat at the Pittodrien Stadium and gave the group the opportunity to raise the difference to the point of reference to Celtici.
Griffiths need to talk about disputes
Celtic's internal conflicts have been caused by chaos, but Griffiths ended them immediately. He says that he and his team members do not have any sense of working under the stricter eye while the team is preparing to meet the Dutch row leader.
I think we're not under pressure, I think that players are waiting for a date.
The lack of knowledge of Scots' masterhouses to satisfy Dutch - de Boer
Former Ranger's middle player and former Dutch football player Ronald de Boer have said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtici because there is no competition with Ranger's skill.
Ajaxi's current de Boer post said: "In the Netherlands there is no more show of the site of the Celtic game, and why?"
Because Rangers isn't involved.
People here don't just talk about Ranger's request.
They're talking about Old Firm groups.
They're talking about both groups together, and that's what they're interested in.
These groups have a lot of excitement, and other than Scots want to follow them.
Deila swears she's turning around.
Ronny Deila has admitted that Celtic is in trouble, but the Norwegian bomb is sworn to turn around.
The destruction of Malmöl and the result of the overcrowding of the Masters soon followed the destruction of ten men who are now at the top of the line, apart from five points.
But Deila said, "Celtic has had bad times before, and we'll get up again."
Now we just want to get rid of this situation as quickly as possible.
I know this is devastating and that many people are very, very angry or bitter about what is going on.
That's what we are, but we have to keep going.
We really need supporters because it improves the performance of players.
Now it's important to stay together.
Warburton equipment for January players' video
Although the Rangers-bomo Mark Warburton just a few weeks ago commented on possible events in January, he is careful to ensure that he does not want to interfere with the team's unity.
Previously on Brentford said, "The transfer window in January is very different than the one in the middle window."
For future players there is a time to adapt to the future, which will be seen in our group this time.
The team's doing really well.
Sometimes increasing the number of unnecessary players can make it more difficult.
Celtic’s interest in Michu leads to withdrawal
Swansea's opponent Michu, whose name has been associated with the transfer window in Celtici, has been disappointed that he can stay in bed after his agreement with Swans is over.
A 29-year-old player has had two years of kidney problems, and he didn't succeed in finding a new track outside Wales during the summer.
Hearts are ready to fight Scotland's football league because of Nelson's comments
Hearts led 2-1 when Paterson was removed from the field, and the group disappeared after this 3-2. The defendant's red card was dropped later, and this was the third Collum's judgment red card that was broken over the last eight months.
Nelson keeps back saying, "I didn't question the truth, I didn't comment on the performance."
Griffiths swears to avoid Tynecastle
A faithful Hibernian player had to be convinced that his song had been given a moving song from the former Hearts player Rudi Skace.
The event took place in the pub in Edinburgh Roseburn before Edinburgh Derdya at the Tynecastle Stadium in March 2014.
"There was a derby and it was a moment's mind leader," the attacker added, "It's safe to say, "I'm not going back to Tynecastle, but then I'm going to play Celtic."
Tannadic government believes in the leadership of Dundee United States - Donnelly
Simon Donnelly claims that the Dundee U.S. government still has the ability to turn the situation around, but admits that the decline of players must stop.
"I think Stephen Thompson trusts us.
We'll get the boys back in town," Donnelly says.
McInnes is a happy "winning win" at Hamilton's game
Derek McInnes admits that his team, Aberdeen, was reluctantly involved in the game against Hamilton Acesia, but he succeeded in achieving his seventh reconnaissance goal, which led them to the top of the table five points above Celticia.
McInnes says, "There's no group that's won anything, then it's a hell or too much that wouldn't have won games this way."
The unemployment of Scottishs remains the same in the growth of the whole of the British Iso.
WORK in Scotland remained 164,000 during the period between May and July, while unemployment in the whole of the United Kingdom rose by 10 000 in total to 1.82 million.
The unemployment rate in Scotland is 5.9 per cent higher than that in the United Kingdom, the national statistical centre (ONS) is 5.5 per cent higher.
At the same time unemployment in Scotland dropped by 12,000 over a period of three months, and the number of workers is now 2,612,000.
Scotland's employment rate fell to 74 per cent during the annual season, which is higher than the average of the United Kingdom.
Scotland's Secretary of State David Mundell commented on these last chapters: "The long-term plan of the Government is to build a foundation for a stronger economy."
Almost a year has passed since Scotland made its historic decision to remain part of Britain.
During these 12 months, Scotland’s labour market has improved, employment has increased and unemployment has declined.
Why I Witnessed in Oklahoma
If no legal intervention takes place, I'll see you later today when a man is executed.
If so, and I hope not, I'll sit in the audience paper at Oklahoma State Penitentiary at the prison when Richard Glossip is being executed in a bloodless syringe.
He's asked me to be one of the four official witnesses who died.
I answered my request in January through his best friend, and even though I was upset, I agreed.
I've been starting to sink this day as it's approaching.
So why did I agree?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell you the entire story of the death penalty.
It would offer a unique view.
It is possible for operators to monitor businesses in the United States, and since applications are often more than free places, participants are selected by default.
Oklahoma has reduced the media's storage sites from two years to two years' notice.
Whoever's chosen, then, looks at what happens at the wind.
I can't do it.
I'm going to sit next to Richard Glossip's closest friends, and I've also created my own contact with him through my phone calls during the months and one-and-a-half-hour visits.
I like a man.
We used to laugh when we talked.
The prison authorities say I can't be both a witness and a supplier, so I can't have a memoranda with me and I can't keep my eyes on it.
I just have to try to remember all the details.
A Ukrainian supplier accused on Twitter that I've been convinced of my standlessness.
Here's a lesson.
Tell the prisoner's story in the way he wants you to get involved.
I chose the supplier.
He admitted that "he could have put his word better," but he still thinks what I'm doing is wrong.
Richard Glossy's been different with some of my words and letters.
He doesn't tell me what I should write, and I wouldn't do it even if he said so.
I've told him that because he can take me away from his testimony.
But he wants the place to be an international supplier who writes about it.
If Glossy dies, he believes that the public will help the death penalty.
Huffington Post reporter Kim Bellware is next to me.
If you want to know more about this, you can listen to my podcast messages.
I'm not going through all the details again.
I can't be sure that Richard Glossip is guilty.
After Barry Van Treesen was murdered, they would have done anything to help him in any case.
But I believe there's a very strong chance that he hasn't been charged with murder.
I certainly believe that there was not enough evidence to justify the death penalty.
I think it's wrong to do his job.
And then this is the look I'm looking at her dying.
I can't claim I'm completely neutral.
There must be other suppliers who care about it.
I can tell you how you feel when the man I love is dying desperately.
A man was dragged out of the Canning River after a white police officer.
Canning Valen's conservatory remained dry when he pulled a man off the Canning River.
A man from Perth's home tried to force the police on his way back to the beach when he found himself on the floor, but only a few yards away from the police man who tried to "try him gently back to the beach".
The Canning Vale police were called on in the past because of the unauthorized arrest of Beckenham.
When they found a suspect, this was trying to get them off the Canning River.
But he didn't get too far.
"He stood in the water saying, 'Don't come out, come and look for me'," said the former superintendent Schhandl Castledine.
Constable Lachlan Perahac didn't want to touch his uniform, so he used a safer tactic: "The police consultation".
"Sometimes people do crazy things while trying to escape," said senior superintendent Castledine.
The master football player Ben Cousins is an excellent example.
In 2006, Cousins refused his car to avoid a call and tried to cross the Swan River.
He didn't succeed in his business, but he inspired locals to start a playful Ben Cousins Biathlon design.
Peter Moody claims that the suppliers tried to see him and threatened to stop the competition
Peter Moody has claimed that the sponsors of Racing Victoria have tried to lay down their confidence in him last year, and is threatening to stop the competition immediately.
He accuses the prosecutors and the Racing Victorian charity department of claiming that they have a personal campaign against him. On Wednesday, Lady Tatai's late refusal of treatment was the last result of the day-to-day treatment.
Moody told Fairfax Media that his goal was always to do what is best for competition and that he had to face the challenge after Lidari's unexplained positive combination.
She's kept her language in which she's been in charge for a year, and she didn't want it to look like a curse.
"I didn't mean to say anything about this, and I've been quiet about it for a long time, but sometimes it gets so fucked up so much that everything goes wrong once and for all," Moody said.
They knew your situation was going on.
Sometimes I just have to react and live with the consequences, and I have to live with what I said.
I'm going home today and sleep well.
I want to go to my head to be able and I want my owners to think I'm doing my best in front of them.
When they start thinking about each other, then I don't want to continue as a waitress anymore.
Then I should consider what I'm doing for my license.
Earlier Moody pointed out the bomb racing.com site challenge, where he said that the charity department had been trying to find out about his reputation.
"A year and a half ago Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart were sitting in the room with a man-- I'm asking him--and they offered him a job at my place of employment if he cares about what I'm doing there.
They're obviously looking at me as a hero.
If that's true, they'd really be able to separate their clients because they've failed to get me.
Robert Roulston, Racing Victorian former president, David Moodie, Racing Victoria's current president, and Bernard Saundry, and Racing Victoria's present delivery director, were all aware of that and are aware of it today.
Should I start thinking that this is coming from individuals?
Did Victoria Racing finally decide to be a man and maybe take responsibility for what's going on in this area?
Am I in trouble?
Am I in such a dangerous area?
Maybe people think so.
Maybe they have to take my license and hire me in private, and I don't doubt that now I can't possibly think about it.
But now I'm at the point of it, I don't care anymore, and it's killing me.
It really surprises me.
I'm going to force them to make a decision that is up to them.
I have my family's support, and I can turn my attention to this.
The destruction of the miller has increased through a long-term study of Lidar’s cobalt research, and later rejection led him to realize that he could "extend his license over the table".
Moody, who is best known for the preparation of a master Black Caviar, has called for the day-to-day treatment rule to be "addictable" after the hair or hair skin has been placed on horses' legs, which is contrary to the rules.
"It's against competition rules.
I have to take full responsibility for it," he said.
One of my employees was trying to break it.
It could have been a funeral last night.
It could have been yesterday, as it was.
It was Friday.
The form may be subject to a three-month invitation to tender due to day-to-day medical treatment initiated by the suppliers.
It's a joke.
People who make these rules don't know anything about horses.
"We all understand that rules are needed, but this has gone too far," Moody said.
In Cobram, the carrier responsible for the transport package is detained
The police have arrested a man who was guilty of a traffic accident to be beaten by his driver at Cobram for a week.
The driver was transported to the Royal Melbourne Hospital when he was hit by a car during the day by the government of Murray Valley.
The police told me the driver was gone and didn't stop helping the trucker.
On Monday, at 50 years of age, a man named Nathalia told the police in Shepparton himself.
He comes to be accused of leaving him permanently in the event of an accident, loss of assistance, and other business events.
The driver, a 40-year-old man from Cobramis, is still in the hospital and his condition is stable.
Melbourne Storm Group manufacturer Craig Bellamy attacks competitors against pressure media
Melbourne Stormer Craig Bellamy has criticised two of the claims of the NRL-rugbyli's mastermind that his team's crews would be part of the "line".
Sydney Roosters, director of Trent Robinson, said that the spaceship of the spacecraft was "low" on its own when it suddenly won a final battle in Sydney on Friday night.
Brisbane Broncos, founder of Wayne Bennett, was hardly able to hide his reference to Storm after it won North Queensland Cowboys on Sunday evening in the final career. Bennett called the game "as an example" and said that two of Queensland's teams were not "very excited" pressure.
Bellamy defended his team's orders and said they were just focusing on "Contact" orders.
Bellamy added that his confidence added two leading manufacturers to criticism about Stormy because it means they're afraid of losing their team.
"This is always going to be a conversation - I've never heard of the pressure of Trent Robinson when we lost them 24-2," Bellamy said on Wednesday.
I can assure you that we have not changed anything in our defence systems or in our technology all year round.
Trent has been in the group for three years, and he obviously has a great team to prepare, so he probably hasn't been accustomed to disappearing, and so this was a small shock to him.
I wonder how this will always be spoken of this year.
Bellamy challenged Bennet's idea of "fashioning Ruggy" by reminding his minister that Bennet's preparations for St. George Illawarra Dragons won the championship in 2010 by playing "donely".
Wayne's talking about exciting rugby.
He was supposed to compare the importance of playing our Friday night game and telling us how exciting their game was," Bellamy said.
I remember in 2010, how St. George was often criticized for being an empty group, and Wayne said it couldn't be less concerned.
But now he's got a group that can play with a bunch of rubies that we like to admire, especially when he has fast young friends.
You want to play such a game when you have its typical players.
She brought it up in 2010, now she wants everyone to play her favorite rugby-- not each group has friends like Anthony Milford or Ben Hunt so they can play like this.
I think they'll be more reliable when they say such things because they're a little worried about playing with us.
Six weeks ago they probably didn't think of us as the answer to important games.
Bellamy also noted that the game between Storm and Rooster was more narrow than between Broncos and Cowboys.
The Broncos game must have been a good game, I haven't seen it yet, but how did it end? 16-12?
Our game was 20-18, so we had two more paintings, but is it exciting?
Or will it cause an alarming breach of the defense line and leaving the ground unharmed?
I've got this thing about lines.
If they mention us, it means we can play someplace against them.
Storm has been released this weekend because they have already won the right home either North Queensland Cowboys or Chronulla Sharksey for the first time on Saturday evening at the AAMI Park.
Serbia's 200 000-dollar drug dealers
A man who threatens the possible survival of the 40 cocaine company in Queensland has been released from a $200,000 bribe.
At the age of 29, Marco Maximovic is one of five men who were arrested last month after the federal police followed 100 kilograms of drugs to the Solay leader who came to South America through the Old American and was arrested in August in Coomera.
Maximovic saw other convicted persons fishing all morning, and then he met them at the Coomera Roadhouse coffee shop, where the police found 40 pounds of poison from Toyota Echo's car.
Although Maximovica is threatening the possible life-threatening company for its management company, her lawyer claimed that there is no evidence that Maximovic tried to keep the total amount of its management and that he could have been in the coffee for a completely non-performing reason.
Judge Peter Flanagan of the Supreme Court was concerned that Maximovic was trying to escape.
"He has strong contacts with Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia," he told the court on Wednesday.
In the case of the Criminal Court, Maximovic lied to the police about where he lived.
Maximovic's mother and father had together offered $200,000 for his release.
"In my opinion, the preliminary evidence of both persons is clear that setting a fine of $200,000 is a real financial burden for them," Judge Flanagan said.
But it alone wasn't necessary to prevent him from being exposed to justice, he warned.
The maximum vehicle was granted visas on condition that he leaves Australia and Serbia's passport, informs the police daily and maintains his foreign entry permit between the evening and the morning.
Steven Hogg used the girl's phone to attract pedophiles to send pictures
Pedophil used a 11-year-old girl’s phone to ask for pictures of children’s approval.
Steven Hogg took a girl to bed on this phone and then wrote in on the Internet service, where Hogg received numerous uncanny images from children who were sent to him by another user.
The girl woke up later, found that my phone was missing and found her sleeping by Hoggin's hand.
The girl studied her phone and found fascinating messages, and then she immediately told her mother.
When the police came, they saw five pictures, studied local computers, and found "responsive" Web sites that had been used to search for images taken from children.
Hogg then said to the police that he had done this "fashioned pedophile" online before he "showed himself to be a cop to scare them".
The representative of the Fiscal Member, Mr Robertson, told the Dundeen Sheriff Court: "He said that there is an indication - that he is dependent on fear of humans.
He admitted that he had performed the funeral on the computer but said that they had been done just because he wanted to make himself a cop so he could keep the pedophiles.
He was interviewed by an unknown person who sent pictures to him, and when Hogg asked him to send more pictures.
Hogg said he only did this for food.
She said she had a drink to save her disease, and she wanted to look at pictures of injuries and murders.
Robertson added: "When the girl found the pictures on her phone, she called her mother, crying and crying.
My mother saw innocent images on the phone and found him guilty after that.
The girl was challenged, and she said that the accused had used the computer and Playstation to talk to the girls who showed her as a teenager.
The 23-year-old Hogg of Ward Road in Dundeaux admitted his guilt for the preparation or adoption of images of innocent children on 14 June last year. He broke up this year's meeting on 25 January and left no trial for this year's trial on 24 March.
Defender Gregor Sim asked that Hoggia should not be registered as a sexist because it could be said that his crime was not part of a "significant sexual element".
Serif Alistair Carmicheal issued a trial in October so that the social service has time to prepare back reports.
In this case Hoggi was granted a check, but in other cases he has been detained before treatment.
She was added to the register of sexual offenders before the day of trial.
Zimbabwen Robert Mugabe was wrong in speaking to Parliament.
Former African leader Mugabe died earlier this year at the front door of the talk hall.
He didn't get upset, but the video about the loss spread the virus into the social media.
You also wanted Parliament's open opposition to the claims of legislators that they had been sent with anonymous death threats warning them of beating Mugabel during his speech.
In the last month, they beat him up and stopped him from talking to Parliament about the situation of the country - which I am sure he did.
Innocent Gonese, a member of the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), said that he had received a number of letters from the seven opposition politicians, who warned them to stop speaking Mugaben.
"The number from which the message was sent does not correspond, but the message's title is 'dead'," Gonese told the supplier after Mugaben spoke.
The letter warned the relevant Members that the integrity would end in Parliament, and when they are outside, the integrity of Parliament is not in force.
The group's supervisors said that the party leading Morgan Tsvangira is a "careful" threat to its policies.
Hewlett-Packard reduces even 30,000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard has saved 25 000-30 000 jobs as part of its reorganisation and cost recovery efforts in business services.
Later this year, HP will share two forward-looking companies with its computer and profit and loss trading companies more rapidly.
The expected job losses amount to about $2.7 billion from the fourth quarter, according to HP's report.
"These restructuring measures will allow for a more competitive and sustainable cost-effective structure for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise," said Meg Whitman, HP's president and delivery director, who will lead the unit after division.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than today's HP, and we will have some kind of and serious choice of services that help companies move into a new business," Whiteman said.
As a separate company, our ability to respond to the needs of our customers around the world is better than ever.
The Hewlett Packard Enterprise's annual business exchange will be over $50 billion, and it's "focused on producing integrated technology solutions that are comparable" to companies, reports the company's information.
Whether you start a company that was built by Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard from Stanford University in the 1930s. It works on a car in Palo Alto, called "Pilaakso's Place of Birth".
HP has gone through a huge reorganisation to find out how to transfer traditional computers to mobile devices.
HP is the second largest computer manufacturer in the world and one of the largest technology companies in the United States, and its distribution is the last one based on the belief that certain limited companies are doing better.
Captain Michael Arteta of Arsenal says the team team members must support Jack Wilshere before the Dinamo Zagreb scale
Wenger has also stressed to Willshir that now is only September and that he's supposed to be moving in line with the plans, there's no reason why he wouldn't be playing again until December.
In this very best case, Wilshire will be between at least four of the next English games, and taking into account her background, it is uncertain whether she will participate first in the European Championships.
The biggest point in this recent problem is that the end of Wilshere’s last life was after a very strong individual drought, and he remembered his old encounter before the start of the period.
"The other waves don't threaten the bear," Wenger said.
It's a thought that didn't get better.
It's nothing like that.
That was just an accident.
It doesn't apply to her noses or more of her lips than she's ever had.
This may take its place from a medical point of view, but as Wenger acknowledged, when a player tries to return through the middle of the game, there is always more risk.
There is also a poor model in the design.
Research by Premier Injuries Ltd shows that Wilshere had 23 different injuries after he debed six years ago.
In addition, during the last five years, he has played 157 of Arsenal’s players in only 65 games.
In view of the wider population of Arsenal after 2007-08, in six months it has been the second of the Valioliiga groups that have lost most of the days due to the worst.
Wenger will give us a chance to do so, but Arsenal believes that their last improvement continues to be in the drug statistics.
"Sometimes when you get back from the bath can be quite long, when you have to strengthen your body and acquire competition," Wenger said.
Jack needs a young man to get over it.
I hope his body is stable, I'm sure it's going to happen, and he'll be able to make a bear like he deserves.
Weger is ready to rotate his team when Arsenal starts his Master's game on Wednesday against Dinamo Zagreb playing next Sunday against Chelsea and the first Wednesday against Tottenham Hotspura.
Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey have not traveled to Croatia, which means that Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta are probably at the start.
Wenger can also install Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroudin Nacho Montreal and Theo Walt.
"I'm trying to maintain balance and give inspiration to the players who want it," Wenger said.
Although Arsenal is a clear future for the F-class, the largest stadium in Zagreb is Europe's worst.
Dinamo has also not been destroyed in 41 arrests since they launched their "Infamous" campaign last year.
The stadium ended on Tuesday night, with a force of 3.2 Richter's asterisk.
It was ten in Zagreb this year.
Wenger believes that Arsenal has learned from the fact that over the last time the Masters were given over to Monaco, and he was still motivated by a long attempt to lead the group to its first European Cup.
"This motivation is great," Wenger said.
Arsenal never got it.
We were very close in 2006, but on the other hand, I can be realistic.
We're honored, but we're not victims.
FriendsFest: a comedian series that taught us serious things about friendships between men
It is obvious how no similar images are in the ranks, especially when it is taken into account that the need for men to open is more ineffective than ever, and the suicide rates for young men are higher than those for five years.
In 2013, suicide was the biggest death in 20-45-year-olds in Britain, and it is three times more common in men than in women.
The company's problem was reported by Campagn Against Living Miserrably (CALM) for the year 2015. The aim was to challenge a culture that prevented men from seeking help when needed.
Friendship is at the forefront of this challenge.
In a recent study, more than 2,000 high-level and high-school students were exposed to depression. According to the study, the possibility of a person acting double if a high percentage of his friends were "healthy".
Similarly, those who have not been discouraged have lost sight of the likelihood of developing possible mental health problems if they have had good friends.
But for friendship to work, it must be available first.
Through this social media communication, the style of content goes to the end and the immediateness of response is often more important than important contact.
Our digital life has had a twofold need to be affected by strong, happy and successful action, despite the fact that apartheid is really controlled.
This surface success is governed by the values that psychologists call external: money, image, social status. All of this happens at the cost of internal values - personal growth and friendship - which are more important to our mental health.
And as the billionaire video player explained against it, money really doesn't get more happiness.
Freddie's beauty was just that it turned into this focus.
No fraud was defined in their work but, above all, their personality, which was clearly distinguished as friends in the interaction.
Joy and Chandler's many wishes, moments in pleasant futures looking at the football, Ross in age Rachel-- these vampires came to know that yes, men can do the same, even though they often hesitate to study their feelings completely.
As the volunteer workers of the Samaritan organization explained to me: "When I hear people who are tired and selfish, I really understand how little interaction with a friend can improve the situation."
We're often approached by men who can't talk to their friends.
The old idea of "the night of escape" is strong, just as you know that if you open up a problem, it's a weakness.
The Franks are one of the horrors that come to mind when I try to offer longer-term relief machines.
That's where people's friendship grows for a few minutes.
Although in my second place of emergency, my external position helps people at an unexpected time, long-term support comes from a close, personal family and friends network.
And then if you participated in Comedy Central FriendsFestie this weekend, and all the paintings are redesigned to celebrate the festival, you have your friends' coffee in Central Perki.
Or what better if you see someone in Starbucks alone, smile and say hello.
You can never know how much your friendship can mean.
Friends will be sent to Comedy Central from the end, all 236 sections, participating in #FriendsFest
Di Maria makes a map and helps PSG approach the Malmö page
Angel Di Maria celebrates Blaise Matutid and Edinson Cavan against Malmo.
Angel Di Maria made a map of the Master's over-debt by helping PSG to complete the Swedish team in Malmö.
Below is your report and your reactions to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani were on the right line when Paris Saint-Germain finally started the Masters' game with a 2-0-winning battle against Malmøa against the Parc des Princes.
Di Maria made a four-minute drive to the French crossing, but lost several opportunities before they finally made their way to Cavan's old land in 61 minutes.
Paris, which is in the same A class with Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk, needed a strong battle against the Swedish Prime Minister, because the game was not only a follow-up place but also an improvement of their four finals in their last three rounds.
But even though the PSG took points, there was no classic ball, because Laurent Blanc's team Zlatan Ibrahimovic broke up in front of the floor and later moved from the field. Malmö is his old home town group and the group where he started to celebrate his wedding in 1999.
"It is not easy to win at home or in visitors, so 2-0 winning causes problems for the opponent and looks good in statistics, and it's a good start, even though there are things we have to do through this," Blanc said.
That's a good idea.
We wanted to win and win, even though we didn't succeed in making one or two more maps.
After his defeat, Ibrahimovic returned to the Parisian group with three changes made after the group stayed in the 2-2-level League 1 battle against Bordeaux at the end of the week, but he stayed for four minutes at Di Maria's hiding place.
When he moved from Manchester United in the last month, the Argentine flagship was named as a man who takes the PSG to a new level in Europe, and he proved why Marco Verratt's food stopped behind the Malmö defense line and then came to a beautiful last visit to the end of Johan Willand's network.
However, if someone expected the PSG to be easy and successful, he had to be disappointed.
Malmö was a supportive opponent. It won the Celtic solution to save this level, with nine international players and five men in the open field and two players in the middle.
But the team didn't offer any more than Nikola Djurdjic at 34 minutes' time, which went to the end of the nipple trap from Kevin Trappin's ground floor.
Instead, the PSG had to deal with the damage caused by food poisoning and the last injury, in particular by Ibrahimovicil, who failed all in the five companies only by the first half and then failed when Cavani put the ball inside of Ibrahimovic's contact immediately at the beginning of the second half.
However, he was much more effective in doing his work to fellow colleagues, and just from Ibrahimovic's food, Di Maria sent a roundabout route, known as the Wilderness Map about 52 minutes.
The second land was finally obtained after an hour’s game due to the famous Uruguayan Cavan, after Ibrahimovic had appeared on the left of Maxwell’s Christmas tree.
It ended Malmö's hopes of getting back into the game, and only the great fight by Willandin from direct bombing by David Luis was held under the final numbers before the change came to Ezekiel Lavez's ground was rejected right at the end of the game.
Malmö manufacturer Age Hareide later admitted that PSG was one level higher than his team. The Norwegian said, "The last time we played the game of Masters was last December."
After that, we've only been scared over Sweden, which is not the same level.
Carcinoma products are not enough.
I'm raising a threat to Paris.
This was a great game for them.

Matt Damon reduces the difference in the film industry
Matt Damon joined an African filmmaker with Effie Brown during their discussion on the differences that Damon doesn't need in the back of the classes.
In the HBO's Sunday evening Project Greenlight, an expert in this section stressed the need for a variety of aspects of the project to be addressed to the dark core of the project.
"When we talk about differences, it will be taken into account when selecting samplers in the film, not in the series," Damon said.
The following Brown reacted in an unexpected manner, comments "Oho! Wow. Okei", while the comments of The Martine's exhibitor were being interrupted.
Other producers Ben Affleck and Farrelly's brothers joined Damon and Brown in a discussion of the finals of the series.
"I want to invite people to think about any leader then how they deal with harmony's personal disability," Brown said at the beginning.
The only dark smell is the noise of his white partner.
The Dear White People producer asked the finals Leo Angelos and Kristen Branccio for guidance in the film; Damon replied with a smile that their direction "may end up giving us something we don't want".
When the debate was started, the social media expressed disappointment at Damon's comments.
The Twitter user MrPooni expressed his interest in the film industry by writing: "Matt Damon speaks only of a dark person in the room and explaining to him the difference is NOT that he's hurt."
After its publication, the tweet collected more than 5000 copies and 4000 copies.
Damon’s comments are part of a period when a thorough and thorough presentation in the media is in progress in the social debate.
After a white police officer killed young Michael Brown in 2014, The Black Lives Matter was widely distributed and invited legislators and authorities to end the various practices of different people.
In February, the psalmist Prince referred to the move by presenting the annual album as the winner of the Grammy Prize.
"Albums still matter," he said.
Like books and black animals, albums are still important.
The leader of the Black Lives Matter would recently issue an opinion to answer the question of whether the group should be a hate group.
"The Black Live Matter Network is a love group," the leaders said.
It was simply said that Damon is involved in a group of enthusiasts, producers and mediamologists who have been invited to the pope’s class for a visit to discuss the picture of the Catholic Church in the west.
It's not clear whether he's accepted an invitation or he's already met the pope.
First U.S. Master Ninja Warrior
The professional team leader and trader Isaac Caldiero became the first player on Monday who won the American Ninja Warrior competition and was awarded a million-dollar prize.
At its seventh stage, the competition programme has never been a competitor who would have clarified all the aspects of the programme's sterility.
In the last section of the series, two men, Caldiero and cameraman Geoff Britten, were able to find the last round.
The last task was to build about 23 meters of poverty in 30 seconds.
The British raced for the first time during the challenge, which led him to become the first player of all ages who discovered section 4 of American Ninja Warrior's refurbishment. However, Caldiero solved the challenge three seconds earlier, which made him the winner.
Caldiero gave the challenge to E!News after a challenging victory and was still shocked at winning a million-dollar prize.
"Then it's great to think about when I've never known or lived more than $10,000 a year," Isaac told E! after his retirement.
But at this point... I can't even imagine what the future will be like. The future is unknown.
The producer leader Kent Weed sat down to discuss with The Hollywood Reporter fine and why Britt gets more paychecks, even though he's the first competitor of all times, who has succeeded in crossing the line.
According to the rules, money goes to the fastest person.
"If more people pass, they get the money that has the fastest time," Weed said.
Although money has a great reward and a change in life, it can bring him great satisfaction.
I don't think she feels beautiful about it.
He's just so happy that he's got to do what he did.
His girlfriend's been over her.
He's got a great guy and a good family.
He's his children and his wife's saint.
Geoff told me, "If someone wanted to beat me, I'm happy it was Isaac."
And I believe that Isaac would have thought the same way if this had gone the other way.
American Ninja Warrior will return to the eightth stage, which begins in the summer of 2016.
Detroit Tiger's Hiding Minnesota Twins End
MINNEAPOLIS -- The second half of the world has not been very fun for Detroit Tigers.
Tigers was sometimes one of the best baseball groups, but he's now the last American League Central division.
Tigers showed his role as a pilot when it won Minnesota Twins 5-4 Target Field.
Twins lost the opportunity to get up at the top of Houston Astros in competition from the second American League villa card.
For Detroit the game was back for at least one night to the six-year-old H pair, which had been very difficult to reach during most of the last half year.
"All the winnings are fun, no matter how they may be won," said team leader Brad Ausmus.
The tiger hunter Alfredo Simon continued his early attack when Detroit ran three times in the first two days of the day, and then six times in the afternoon and nine times in the afternoon.
Simon (13-9) ate 6 1/3 daily and saved three runs.
This was just his third quality in the last nine games.
"I just want a strong end this year," said Simon.
It's hard for an exchanger to eat each game, and that's why I want to go to the deep game.
The Tigers' positions were three and possibly two races that were his first shots after mid-August.
This was Martinez's first three-night break after he got four against Seattle Mariner on 6 July.
"He rejected the painting very well," Ausmus said.
He looked good (in sound exercises), looked much better in sound exercises and continued the same model in the game.
Twins were after three races in the last half of Europe, and it was their best chance to get back to the game.
St. Byron Buxton started at the top of the mountain two steps out on the left side of the valley.
I really spread Aaron Hicks home on one of the pools, and Simon got burned right into the other pool player Brian Dozier before Simon was switched to the left corner of Blaine Hardy.
Hardy walked Maurea, the only opponent against the installation of the player, the leading locationkeeper Miguel Sãoa, who would cut two to the left of the right-hand Drew VerHagen.
With two runners in the field and two weighted runners, VerHagen got three-pound Trevor Plouffen to hit the ground leading to the tuppapelin.
There was a preview of the entrance line: the 27th time this time when Plouffe found a doll.
After Detroit had received a nine-year security run, Mauer would blow two shots at Tiger's locker Bruce Rondonia, and the situation was 5-4.
However, the real player burned the Son in three meals on the fifth of his salvation.
Detroit used Phil Hughes at the beginning to accept the offer.
Tigers got three races in the first two rounds against the right veteran player, who got out of the list of broken ones before the game was gone for over a month.
"I showed that I didn't want to start with this," said Hughes, "but in front of the game my life was better, and I felt that I was able to do some nice things in the third round of the day."
After Hughes hit the first floor on the first floor, he gave the second floor player Ian Kinsler the front of one.
I'm really spreading J.D. Martinez's behavior on two decks led to Victor Martinez, who took himself to the middle class and caused the first race of the game.
Victor Martinez would break off his 0-21-balls while running well.
The third player, Nick Castellanos, continued shooting at the right and causing another race, but the dangerous situation ended when Victor Martinez was rejected in his attempt to advance to the third.
Tigers continued on the second round and got one ball, two run by James McCann and two ball by the centre of Anthony Gosel, after which the situation was 3-0.
"It was an important loan," said the leader of the Twins team, Paul Molitor.
He didn't give up very well, but it ran right.
Hughes began to be in the firefight and ate a three-year-old runner, after which he became the rightful successor of A.J. Ahter.
For Hughes, three runs were calculated from six yards and four yards.
HUMANS: The real fireman Anibal Sanchez of Tigers had to be removed because of his rash.
He was studied by Dr. James Andrews, who died in Sanchez in 2007.
Sanchez has been on the list of broken limbs since mid-August due to an outbreak, but he had to return to midweek.
While outside Sanchez, the left-hand shooter Daniel Norris will come from the list of broken people to start against Twins.
The Norwegian statistics in Tigers are 1 to 4 at the beginning after the left-hand shooter David Price was transferred to him on 30 July.
Norris has been outside since 20 August due to the fact that the wine bottle has been frozen.
Tigers and Twins' three game series ends on Wednesday at Target Field.
Norris (2-2, 4.43 ERA) is against Ervin Santanaa (5-4, 4.73 ERA).
Xi calls for an open economy for a wider world
The economy needs to be helped more to promote growth in the outside world, President Xi Jinping told the group, which is responsible for directing reform.
"China should be committed to attracting foreign funding and expertise and developing transparency policy," he said at the 16th meeting of the Group on the Strengthening of the Communication.
The promotion of transparency at the same time as reforms are being made to increase new trade and vitality and create a new situation for economic growth, Xi said.
The group adopted a series of guidelines which included a restrictive list of access to the market, a negative list of cross-checking procedures, an invitation from State-owned companies to hold private capital, and a revision of the resident registration system.
According to the resolution, a negative list is created of sectors and companies which cannot be invested.
The system is gradually tested and improved by pilot programmes.
The change must be noted, as it gives market players a greater role in the focus of resources, ensures a legal-based business environment and makes markets more open, which is true.
The government will also find its administration to be the power it distributes to companies, ensuring that companies decide on how they manage their business.
The resolution also said that China should allow border areas to explore new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms for regional growth.
In order to open up the government's sectors, more areas are open to individual donors.
"The Government does not change foreign investment in line-up, and it will protect the legal interests of foreign financing companies and produce better services for them," the opinion said.
In addition, the "green card" search process for permanent foreign residence permits is facilitated by optimising requirements and facilitating the search process.
The meeting also discussed the protection of professional rights of lawmakers and the support of professional judges and prosecutors.
The meeting was also attended by Prime Minister Li Keqiang, as well as by senior leaders Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli, followed by an opinion published.
