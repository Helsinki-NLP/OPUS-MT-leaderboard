Food liability for European inflation
The main reason for the rise in inflation measured in the eurozone is the rising food prices.
In the 13 countries of the Eurozone, the injury was expected to be higher than in November - after 2.6 per cent in October an annual inflation rate of 3.1 per cent was recorded as reported by the EU Statistical Office in Luxembourg.
Official forecasts are only 3 percent out of Bloomberg reported.
In contrast to the US, British, and Canadian notes bank, the European Central Bank (ECB) has not reduced its profitability.
The ECB intends to keep inflation rates below two per cent or at least at least on the two per cent market.
According to one analyst, the ECB is in the mood: inflation must be "adjusted" to exclude future action needs.
With 3.3 percent, the inflation rate reached a 12-year record rate in Germany in November; in Spain, the rate rose from 3.6 to 4.1 percent.
The increased food and energy prices are responsible for increasing inflation in the euro area.
The MATIF score has risen by 88 per cent, and the course for Sojabohnen has also reached a record since 1973.
There was also a major injury in food oil and milk products in 2007.
The world market price for crude oil rose by 52 percent this year - last month, the price per phase of black gold reached nearly $100.
The ECB will then increase inflation from 2.1 to 2.5 per cent in 2008, but it will fall by 1.9 per cent in 2009.
For the next 3-4 months, analysts from a 3-percent inflation rate, the annual average rate is 2.1 per cent.
For 2008, experts estimate that the ECB will double its interest.
Gallup is a government crisis
After long stagnation, the number of Fidesz sympathisans has increased significantly until the beginning of December. The party has had the largest base camp since 2002, while the approval for the Socialists according to Gallup has reached an unprecedented depth of 13 per cent since 2002.
In the case of party voters, the difference is due to the high determination of opposition defenders: more than two thirds (71%) have a fifth (20%) agreement against MSZP.
MDF and SZDSZ are under parliamentary scrutiny: they come to the total population by two per cent.
The number of participants has increased by one percent in both stocks.
Compared to the last depth, the general economic mood has continued to worsen - and never before was the share of those who considered the country's economic situation "bad" to be "bad" so high (41 per cent), while another 46 per cent considered them "very bad".
According to more promising views in the spring and summer, families see the change in their financial situation again more pessimist.
For the next year, the majority of the population is counting on a further deterioration of the situation; only one tenth goes from improvement.
A Gallup survey conducted in December revealed that 71% of the respondents - a historical high - assessed the Prime Minister's work as "more bad than right".
Thirty per cent of the respondents have generally expressed great confidence or confidence in Ferenc Gyurcsány, while the proportion of respondents for Viktor Orbán increased by 38 per cent.
About 54% do not trust the head of government at all, compared with 27% suspects against the head of the Fidesz party.
One of the indicators of political vote is the number of those who, in my view, could get the dissatisfaction with the Prime Minister without any change in the government.
If 35% of the rest of the government and the head of government had spoken after the rest of the past October, this share is only 20% today, while the relative majority (33%) sees the solution only in new elections.
According to their interest in the referendum, 60 per cent responded that they would participate "with security" and another 20% would give their vote "probably".
By comparison: if Parliament elections were to take place on this Sunday, only 55 per cent would "with safety" go to the Urins, 15 per cent would keep their participation "probably". In view of these trends, the outcome of the referendum would be seen.
74% would be against study fees, 79% against practice fees, and 84% against hospital allowance.
In addition to the group of participants in the public opinion, the percentages of students, practice and hospital fees would be 81, 84, or 89 per cent.
Up to the top, Tesco increases by almost a fifth
The hypermarkets in the Budaörs trade area have also maintained the average price increase of 16% since last year, unlike that there was no increase in VAT this year.
Article from Napi Economy
The price of the traditional Christmas basket of "Napi" has also increased by 16 per cent this year in Budaörs' trade district, but more than 1,000 HUF prices have been recorded in all hypermarkets.
After the prices in the food markets were "exceeded" last December, the price has not been dramatically reduced by percentage compared to the unprecedented level of output.
However, it seems to the consumer that what they paid in the last year is still below 9,000 HUFs, this year is not even available for 10,000 HUFs.
The price of "Napi" goods basket exceeds the magic 10,000-HUF limits of at least 91 HUF in the markets under investigation.
The highest price was 10.573 HUF.
(In 6800 the price was at 6,800 HUF.)
The prices for unicum and live fish remain almost at the level of previous year, despite the prices for poutenbröstfilets, Nuss and mohn.
Prices for flour and bread meet the data of the Central Statistical Office of Hungary, however there were 1kg frying weeks for 139 Forint.
There was no competitive price control on the product at less than 200 Forint.
Also surprising was the price of two litres of Coca-Cola bottle of less than 200 Forint, so the drink included only 257 HUF.
However, this year cuts the price of the "Napi" product basket at the most expensive price, and Cora at the most cost.
Our calculations have shown that Cora has increased prices in "Napi" shopping carts at Christmas prices over the past year by 15, while Tesco and Auchan have increased by 18 percent each.
The difference between the cheapest shopping cart of the previous year and the cheapest of the present year was 12%, while the increase between the cheapest shopping cart of the previous year and the price price of the current year was 21%.
The average price increase was 1.480.00 HUF.
The average price increase was still at 1.206.00 Forint in the previous year, but the VAT increase was noted for last Christmas at the prices.
This is exactly what has led to trade: it seems that the owners of the goods could not decide which price voltage they should use in the individual articles, since the effects of price increases on consumer behaviour were invisible.
(If the trader is planning a product's reverse speed, it can fall significantly in the price range which is based on the traffic intensity.)
The value of the "Napi" basket fell radically in the past year, so that the most expensive Corb exceeded the value of 2006 by 1720 Forint, despite the price difference at the cheapest Corb only 844 Forint.
This year such extremes were not observed, as the most expensive Corb cost 1.630.00 Forint more than in the previous year, and even at the cheapest price there was a price increase of 1.284.00 Forint.
Compared to the last two Christmas season, there was a catastrophic price increase, which increased the price of daily consumer goods in the hypermarkets by less than 20 months to more than 30 percent.
(This does not necessarily confirm the data of the Central Statistical Office of Hungary: In some food sources, the Statistical Office established more than 30 per cent of the cost during 12 months.
This is also true in near honey.)
However, if you look at the "Napi" shopping cart, this seems almost impossible in the last few years, since the price level of the product has been increased by almost 10 percent even in the worst case in the previous year.
Apparently, the suppliers are in a stronger position than the suppliers - they were always able to reverse the drastic price increase on the majority.
In the golden market, the hypermarkets don't complain; it's been reported for years.
Our experience shows that most customers in the three shopping houses are no longer looking at the prices.
It will be purchased from all large quantities, sustainable food will go to pallets over the Ladenian.
On Wednesday morning, there were endless noises in all three shopping houses at the casino when the number of customers exploded suddenly.
However, a lower customer frequency is reported from the country, so that many people regret that they could not even achieve the planned trade, although not only with food, but also with sustainable consumer benefits.
Many places are separated by disinfectants
More than a thousand infections have been registered in hospitals that have been returned to an inappropriate treatment with antibiotics.
The hygienic conditions in hospitals, the overcrowding of beds, the overload of staff - all factors that are not directly available to cure infections are the leading doctors of the national epidemiology centre.
Many places are also separated by the means of disinfection.
In the traumatology department of János Hospital has recently diagnosed an MRSA infection.
The anti-antibiotic bacteria were found in a male patient who was admitted to the hospital after a severe accident.
The patient was isolated.
At the beginning of the year there was already a similar infection.
The damage of a serious car accident was released from the hospital, but shortly later the man had to return with an MRSA infection. Since then an important operation could have been performed because of the bacteria still present in the patient's body.
Up to 10 December this year, infections were reported from hospitals 1094 by several resistance rulers to the National Nosocomialis Surveillance System, thus leading doctors of the National Epidemiology Centre, Karolina Böröcz.
So many infections that have been solved by multiple governments have been registered in hospitals with safety, which must be higher than the number of dengues.
About two thirds of the infections (683 cases) were resolved by the MRSA, which is resistant to methicillin-Oxacillin.
The Staphylococcus aureus (SA) bacteria carry about a third of the people in their nose without causing a disease.
SA-conditioned infections (e.g. breast-feeding, mandating, skin dispersion or pain) are most likely to respond to antibiotics, they are well healthy.
However, if the resources are too high to be taken or are not used properly, antibiotic resistance is derived from the well-responsive bacteria that rapidly spread into hospitals under appropriate conditions.
In particular in patients with impaired or permanent poor functioning of the immune system, but also in older patients, or patients with low body weight, these bacteria may cause serious infections such as fungal infection or blood poisoning, so Sepsis.
According to the medical director of the János Hospital, the MRSA infection is nothing special, such events are part of the hospital's day.
You should not exchange the infection with the epidemic, Tibor Nyulasi - MRSA could not only be there where it is not sought.
Antibiotic resistance
"These patients are isolated, the care staff carries rubber and masks in the supply, and we have the antibiotics necessary for the treatment," says Tibor Nyulasi.
When they are given into the hospital, patients are tested at MRSA, but an infection cannot be prevented at all times.
Samples to be reported
Most of the infections solved by MRSA would be preventable in hospitals, but the prevailing conditions and circumstances are currently adverse for the reduction of the occurrence or expansion of the multi-resistant event, says Karolina Böröcz.
After this infection occurs mainly in hospitals and nursing homes, hospitalers should investigate the patients and immediately isolate MRSA infected patients.
In Hungarian hospitals, however, microbiological sampling is not practiced so often.
Not at all because there are no grants for this investigation on the part of the State Health Fund.
Therefore, most cases come to everyday light only if the patient has already had a significant MRSA infection, so the medical director of the epidemiology center.
There are strict recommendations for the proper use of antibiotics in human medicine in the EU, but there are also guidelines in Hungary for the treatment of certain infections and diseases.
Antibiotic therapy should be targeted, i.e. microbiological studies are necessary in order not to form resistance to the means, but this directive will not always be adopted by hospitals.
The microbiological findings are even more rare in the patients who are under primary care, as is the case with Karolina Böröcz.
Disinfective agents are distributed
Scientific evidence suggests that MRSA will be transferred from one patient to the other most frequently by the care staff.
That is why hand washing, or wearing gloves and masks is of great importance, but there are also significant deficiencies in hospitals in this area.
MRSA will be transmitted by foot-and-mouth disease or contact, but there is not always the possibility of isolate the infected patients.
The rooms are even often filled, the beds are almost different, although there should be a distance of at least 1.5 metres between them from epidemiological view.
As Karolina Böröcz further notes, unfortunately, in the less well-established hospitals even there is a difference in the risk of infection, there are few caregivers, many patients - all factors that directly benefit from the occurrence of infections.
Such infections are likely to be less frequent there, relatively likely to keep the further spread of the event where these protection measures are maintained, says Karolina Böröcz.
Government programme against MRSA
MRSA infections in the flu cause enormous costs for health insurance, which is why they are fought everywhere.
In England, for example, the prevention of MRSA, or its deterioration in the government programme, was established.
According to the first signs, the program is successful - as published data, the trend of MRSA infections in England is slow.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention (ECDC) has stated the prevention of the occurrence of multiple resistant strains (including MRSA), as well as the prevention of infections in hospitals.
Killer police officer wasn't drunk
In the case of the chief of police of XXII. A car accident caused by a fatal accident is now the official view.
Attila Morva, president of the Federal Government of Budapest on Friday, after the official opinion of the case was presented.
The opinion confirmed the results of the first investigation, according to which the chief of police had not consumed alcohol before he applied for tax.
The former police chief booked with his own Pkw in XXII. The district entered the Kossuth Alaios Street and passed through a 55-year-old man who crossed the street to an unmarked place.
(As far as STVO is concerned, this is not a pleasant situation - the linker has, even if pedestrians don't cross the street on the zebras, after.)
The pedestrian is injured after his delivery to the hospital.
According to police reports, the Linker carried out a shock, then put his functions back and tried to retire.
The State administration of Budapest has submitted its findings on the case.
Attila Morvai also mentioned that the former chief of police had initially cooperated with the investigators.
Other EUR 400 million for infrastructure
Minister of Finance János Veres and Marta Gajecka, Vice-President of the European Investment Bank (EIB), signed three credit agreements on Friday in Budapest at the total value of EUR 400 million.
In 2006, the European Investment Bank (EIB) approved a EUR 300 million framework for the financing of transport and environmental protection projects implemented by the Cohesion Fund.
The amount of EUR 150 million agreed in the loan agreement should also be allocated to the budgetary financing of education projects.
The EIB has generally granted EUR 300 million for this purpose for Hungary; the use of the remaining EUR 150 million will be decided later in the context of the extension of the credit contract.
In the area of innovation, the contracting partners have signed an agreement of over EUR 50 million, which will mainly be transferred to Debrecen University in research and development programmes.
At the meeting, the U-road line 4 also came into language.
It was agreed that as soon as Hungary has clarified the details of road financing with the EU, the original contract and any amendments will be discussed again.
According to János Veres, this would be possible in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has financed 113 projects totalling EUR 8.4 billion in Hungary.
Creditors are bound by EURIBOR, which will be provided free of charge by the EIB with an 8-year loan.
Bulgaria, EU real estate paradise
The development of the Bulgarian real estate market is a matter of concern to the Balkan country mentioned earlier.
What, where, and who still buys the most cheap market in the EU but is becoming more expensive?
An analysis of the Bulgarian Re/Max Division.
Bulgaria is now the most popular bottle for real estate purchases in Eastern Europe, with cheap shipping apartments and houses on the sea.
Between the mountains, the regions Bansko, Borovec, Pamproo and Vitosa are among the most popular, on the sea are Albena, the "gold Coast", the "Sun Coast", and the historical cities Sozopol and Nessebar are the runners, but property around Kavarna and Balcik are also asked more.
According to estimates by Re/Max analysts in Bulgaria, also attract the domestic investors earlier or later, such as Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, and Triavna, as well as the spoken cheap area of Russia, more buyers are listed.
The capital of Sofia also offers attractive offers - shopping and office areas offer the highest rates.
Bulgaria is the best way to become one of the most attractive European golf paradises and therefore to attract tourists in addition to the summer and winter season.
Therefore, forward investors are already buying in large style, for example around Bansko.
Analysts also seek to change their lifestyle.
Most buyers are English, but it also comes from France, Belgium, Spain, and more and more from Romania.
Investors from Malta and Cyprus are also present, while there are mostly Russian buyers in the Black Sea and in the ski areas.
There are three groups of foreign buyers, says Georgik Jankov, Regional Director of Re/Max Bulgaria.
Those who want to stay down buy either revitalised properties for 50-100,000 euros, or downside houses for 5-15 000 euros that they then renovate themselves.
Good connection and availability as well as communication opportunities are great, but also close to a large city, business and doctors are crucial for the buyer.
The second category includes those who are looking for a holiday home (Bulgaria was placed under the German top Ten holiday destinations in December).
The third group is composed of business people who invest towards a medium-to long-term increase in value.
Real estates in the capital are becoming more expensive, subject to growing demand.
In the EU, real estate prices are the lowest in Bulgaria, but in the last five years, there has been a 21% increase in prices.
The price at real estate prices is far above the value of the holder.
Fodor and the six Hungarian percentages
As Minister of Environment Gábor Fodor announced, the expert meetings on Tuesday are going to end, and the debate on the international climate regime after 2012 will be continued by the ministers on Wednesday after the official opening.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries are consulted on the Bali Road Plan, which sets out the emission reduction measures for the period after 2012, following the launch of the Kyoto Protocol.
At present there is a strong debate between industrial and development countries.
The United States has already signaled that they do not want to negotiate specific numbers, but they would be ready to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 25-40 per cent by 2020 compared to 1990.
The other major issue of the Conference is whether the industrial states are ready to support developing countries both financially and technologically, in addition to reducing emissions.
There was also an agreement on the support of developing countries.
The adaptation fund under the Kyoto Protocol is to be managed by a 16-capital Council, which is expected to be read in the UNO's Global Environment Facility (GEF), such as in the "Piac ê Benefit".
Six percent of Hungary
Environment Minister Gábor Fodor, on behalf of Hungary, supports the EU's efforts to maintain its prior role in global climate protection measures and to achieve a new international agreement by 2009.
The Minister said that the EU would reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 20% by 2020 (measured at the 1990s), whether or not the "Agreement after 2012" would be successful or not. The Union would even be ready to implement a 30% reduction if other major industrial countries of the world, or developing countries, were also willing to fulfil their commitments by force and responsibility.
Gábor Fodor stressed that the target of the countries which had joined the Kyoto Protocol in 1997 was only 5.2 per cent, although the EU had already committed itself to a reduction of 8 per cent with its 15 Member States at the time.
The standard for Hungary is a 6% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions compared to 1985-87 - a standard that will be fully met by the country as it is to be followed in the press release of the Ministry of the Environment.
The use is high on Bali - always the long-term international climate policy agreement must be completed within two years, otherwise it would be safe to enter into force only after 2012. In this case, the reduction projects set out in the Kyoto Protocol would not follow a renewed, international emission reduction system, which has also highlighted the IPCC, the international scientific climate change committee, which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in its recent report.
This would delay the emission reduction, and the increase in earth's average temperature by more than 2°C would be inevitable, which, according to scientists, would have extremely difficult and irreparable consequences.
British Army on YouTube
British Army units have published recordings of operations in Iraq and Afghanistan to increase popularity on the video portal.
First, the British Air Force (RAF) YouTube has discovered for itself: In Afghanistan, stationed special units have been loading videos about the operations carried out against the Taliban since March 2006, reports the BBC.
The recorded recordings of the camera mounted on helmets will be checked at Kandahar Air Station and then sent to London, where they will be placed on the Internet.
Political Message Unavoidable
Soldiers of the air weapons have already managed 139 such recordings, their "channel" has been seen more than 75,000 times.
The British Ministry of Defence was registered under "defencehead quarters" in spring 2007 to publish videos on Iraqi and Afghan operations, but also the British Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Commonwelth Office) and the international peace troops (MNFI) stationed in Iraq have their own YouTube channels.
Use in Afghanistan
The Air Force has originally published the videos with the aim of recruiting soldiers, and as the Ministry of Defence says, contributions also serve the purpose of informing the population about the real objectives of foreign institutions.
This kind of propaganda has been published almost free of charge in comparison with traditional television advertising, so defence expert Gordon Mackenzie to BBC, but these videos always bring a certain degree of political message to mind as they confirm the existence of the military measures decided by the government in their own way.
American Games with Game
But the army must also fight against amateur captures, which are carefully processed, censored captures also create in the network - such as those that show the death of soldiers: In the somewhat mysterious, "official" propaganda films are spoken of as being the highest of the losses, but the bloody sides of the war are not shown.
Many of the warships in Iraq and Afghanistan have already been loaded with dangerous videos on the platform, but the British have only recently discovered them.
The Americans are on the other side, i.e. with the free downloadable shooting game "Americans Army", in which the player can dive into the skin of the soldier in a more or less live simulation.
Christmas celebration with Tomola and Pogatche in the ministries
Minister of Labour Mónika Lamperth is not a cymphony: instead of a Christmas festival, she will hold a conference of work in which her employees can have coffee and pogasche served in 2007.
Some ministries celebrate live music, others celebrate Christmas with tomola or anthems in the hearts of officials.
Party, Christmas spirit, concerts and buffet - so celebrates power.
The Christmas fever has already caught up with the authorities.
The largest Christmas celebration of a ministry will be held in the defence resort, but the staff of the ministry will not be expected to do so.
At the "Wais' Night Festival" children are worried by missing soldiers, while at the "Mission Festival" family members are judged by the soldiers currently stationed abroad, but there is also a reception for the press.
The resort has about 25 million available for holidays.
Compared to other sources, the National Development Agency (NFY) and the Ministry of Economics and Transport have been fighting the beaches.
The 4.32 million Forint your Christmas celebration of the Ministry of Economics will be held in the house of the future, and about 350 of 600 employees will be expected.
The focus of the holidays is on Christmas, but it will also be given live acts and a tomola solution.
The National Development Agency (NFU) has held its 4.7 million Forint Christmas celebrations on Wednesday at the House of the Country Justice Council (OIT), with concerts and a party.
The hall was 1 million Forint, the rest was distributed to more than 400 people.
According to our information, a division of the NFU is also invited at another Christmas celebration organized by the Hungarian Economic Development Centre (MAG Zrt) from EU currencies.
For the festival the building of the play theatre ("Vigsínhaz") was rented.
The MAG Zrt has not confirmed this information because we have not reached the officials.
What's the point?
The OIT building was open not only to the NFU's guests but also to the Ministry of Justice and Police, which held the Lucia Ball instead of a Christmas party on 7 December.
You didn't have to pay any rent to the OIT for use of the rooms.
About 500 visitors came to the ball.
The holidays were opened with a speech by the Minister, after dinner there was live music to dance.
At the request of [origo] you shared with: There was no obligation to take up ball clothing or accessories on the ball.
The Ministry of Health, Work and Self-Management is preparing for a Puritan celebration each.
The Ministry of Health organises the celebration for employees in their own four walls for about 400,000 forints.
Minister of Labour Mónika Lamperth officially invites its employees not even to celebrate Christmas but to the conference for the year.
It is estimated that with about 180 guests, who - so the press department - will only be served with coffee and pogasche, the festival will end with 350,000 forints.
Mr Gordon Bajnai, Minister of Self-Management, will simply join his colleagues in the Aula of the Ministry.
The Ministry of Finance (PM) will hold a Christmas celebration at its own festival, which is expected to be attended by 436 employees.
The expenditure was measured by 2,500 forint per head - about this money there is a buffet receipt with subsequent discounts.
Since the beginning of the term of office of János Veres, the PM staff celebrate this way each year.
However, there will be no correct party vote - not only because of the Minister's official speech but also because the celebration was held for the afternoon.
The Ministry of Agriculture invites the 20th January to a new year's reception, which is this time the Ministry's Christmas celebration.
The one hundred guests are invited to the Vajdahunyad castle in the city park ("Városliget"); according to the source of the resource, the costs of 1,000 forint per guest are measured.
As the press department reports, it will be a very simple catchment, to which only accredited foreign diplomats are charged in Hungary.
The receptions that are held each year are traditionally started with a short speech by the Minister and sound with repeated noises.
As the relevant press posts report on a [origo] request, there will be no Christmas celebration at the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Education.
At the cost of the Christmas celebration, the Ministry of the Environment was unable to provide any information on the costs of the press department.
In any case, more than 400 guests were invited to the event held at the Art Museum.
More and more forces mobilized for rising strike
The League of Trade unions and the Hungarian Federation of Trade Unions shall form their coordination committee on Friday for a period of time beginning on Monday.
On Saturday a large protest meeting will be held, on Monday - on the day of the public vote on the health insurance law - the work will begin.
It will be calculated with strict and significant traffic barriers, as rail traffic is almost fully established and also the Budapest public transport companies (BKV) will run up to 1 p.m.
Details of the strike will be announced on Friday afternoon by the League of Trade unions and the Federation of Trade Unions.
It will also establish a LIGA-MOSZ strike committee responsible for coordinating the actions on Monday.
On Saturday a large protest assembly will be held, and from Monday all organizations that have joined the strike will be working down for an indefinite time unless agreement is reached with the government.
In other words, the end of the strike which began on the day of Parliament's decision on the Health Insurance Act was not defined.
If the National Council does not adopt the Health Insurance Act, the unions shall immediately withdraw the call for strike.
However, when the law is adopted, the Committees of the Regions will join in consultation on the further progress.
In view of the National Council's agenda on Monday, it is even possible that it is only in the late evenings, or even at midnight, to vote on the health insurance law.
The line starting on Monday will have to be calculated with significant obstacles to transport: railways are lowering their work for an unlimited period of time, on the morning is the majority of public transport and more than half of the Volán companies.
At the same time, there will be a direction in many places.
The call for the strike has been followed by numerous cooperatives and civil organisations - the list of participants is being updated on the Liga website.
Some organizations announced strike at an unprecedented time, others plan to reduce work time.
Until Thursday afternoon, there was no agreement between the Hungarian Railway MÁV and the free cooperation of the VDSZSZSZ railways, although there are more and more people on the road at Christmas Eve.
According to previous reports, the BKV from start-up to 1 p.m. will reach Budapest Airport between 7 and 9 p.m., which LIGA works for electricity and heat energy for four hours, and the teacher's work, e.g., the democratic teaching work, has been called into 2 or 2-8 hours.
The Hungarian Medical Association extends to different times throughout the country, the EDDSZ, the democratic cooperation of the health and social workers, a subsidiary organization of the SZEF, the Cooperation Forum of the Workers, holds a two-hour notice.
The most important four points required by the League are that the Government will take back the draft health insurance reform and extend a new concept for social discourse.
The second requirement concerns the gradual introduction of the new pension calculation model which will fall from next year.
The requirement number three indicates that the eligible professional groups will already be able to access the early retirement system by 2010.
The fourth point is that the VDSZZZ, which belongs to the League of Trade unions, has not accepted the additional supply lines and now calls for a new concept.
Political Capital: Hungarian Guard Increases State Risk
According to the Risk Analysis Division of Political Capital, the activities of the Hungarian Guard, which was established in August this year with the support of the "Moving for a Better Hungary", have increased the risk of Hungary and the region in several respects.
The Institute's "risk-warning Report" means, inter alia, that in relation to the activities of the Hungarian Guard, the highest political risk is "increasing the existing ethnic tensions between the Gypsies and the non-Technical population in Hungary which could lead even to violent ethnic exchanges".
The main reason for this is the Hungarian Guard's strategy, which is probably aimed at the provocation of such a substitution, says the Research Institute.
As reported, this is viewed as a disappointment by the political leaders: "People of public life have left the discussion of the Roma question to representatives of radical political groups who have now built their policy strategy on the Roma-Hungarian side."
It is believed that this would increase the problem, make the sensible dialogue impossible, favour extremes, and increase the likelihood of violent side effects.
In addition, the research institute believes that the activities of the Hungarian Guard have not recently been taken into account by the vast attention of the domestic and foreign media, "the image of Hungary in the country is seriously damaged, especially as regards confidence in stability and democratic regimes".
We remember: Since autumn 2006, the reorganization of radical and extreme rights groups in Hungary has been constantly under attack, so since summer 2007, more organizations called "national self-defence unity" have been established.
"These groups are meant to define themselves as a civil organization each time they are openly engaged in preparing their members - while armed - defence tasks (distance protection, defence of the country, security of order), calling for the independence of the police, the army, in relation to the state itself," he said.
And further: all of this has been done in accordance with the method that tries to distinguish between the political and party security of the population, which is based on political efforts as a civil initiative.
The emphasis on civility and uniformity is therefore not only on the environment of legal hearings that could rise in the course of the court's entry into force - it is also a political strategy.
As the analysis is to be taken, the activities of the Hungarian Guard are also a high risk factor for relations with neighbouring countries.
"In recent months the Hungarian Guard has been cited as a potential source of danger in several neighbouring countries, so some ultranationalist politicians of certain neighbouring countries see in the formation of the Hungarian Guard the confirmation of its own anti-Hungary policy.
All of this has an impact on the political stability of the region," he said.
From the point of view of the Research Institute, the establishment of the Hungarian Garden is not a single phenomenon in Central-East Europe, so the political risk for the entire region has grown.
As reported, the activities of the Hungarian Guard are comparable to those of the Bulgarian National Guard, whose foundation was announced in August 2007 by the Bulgarian National Union (BNU).
As a result of the formation of the Bulgarian Guard, the Roman mass excrements that took place in a quarter of Sofia (Krasna Poljana) were located.
The BNU has taken the same event into account for the establishment of the National Guard, with the argument that the aim of the organization of "national protection".
In the past 17 years, your opinion has been that a regular "teacher terror" in Bulgaria has been a constant threat to the state, but the state has remained open and indifferent - so Political Capital.
And further: The initiative had led to a heated debate in the Bulgarian public.
As it has been said, the increased risk for ethnic differences is also borne out by the fact that some Bulgarian Roma organizations have announced their own defense.
Since the activities of the Hungarian Guard have so far shown many similarities with those of the Bulgarian National Guard, it is not excluded that the Hungarian Rome also responds to threats by organizing its own protection.
Attila Juhász, Research Director at Political Capital, said at the request of the news agency: Risk analysis is one of the activities of the Research Institute.
Annual risk analysis reports would be published and risk-replaced trends should be visible, public opinion will be informed as in the case of the issue of the risk alert.
Holidays are not all holidays
In Hungary, holidays are legally regulated so that the practice of re-suspending the working days has gradually established the holidays, but the next year will protect us less such days.
There is something else in the EU and America under "Fourdays".
The Hungarian legal system distinguishes between public holidays and free working days.
Workdays are mostly church holidays, or are related to significant historical events.
For example, we also celebrate New Year: Both the last day of the old and the first day of the new year are free days - last time only to get rid of the silvervester enemies.
All year round we have fourteen holidays.
The State Day is the 15th March, reminiscent of the revolution of 1848, and the 23rd October, the day of the revolution of 1956.
On August 20th, the State foundation will celebrate the work on May 1st, and on November 1st and 2nd we will remember our dead.
In addition, there are two days for Easter, Pings, and Christmas.
Since our state, national or religious holidays rarely fall on a weekend, the practice of "Workday shifts" has been guaranteed in cases where we would only work one day before or after the holiday.
However, the price of the longer weekend is that we have to work very well on Saturdays or go to school.
When this date, which falls before or after the holiday, is to be finalised, it shall be laid down by the Minister of Labour in its own Regulation for many years.
The legislation applies to all employers and employers, public employees and public service officials alike.
Only companies and institutions in which the operation is continued without interruption, including on holidays.
From 24 December, since most of the days between Christmas and Silvester are equal to the holiday season, there is still something else in the working order: from 24 December, life is still in the country, since most of the days between Christmas and Silvervester are equal to the time period, or the holiday that is set up for it.
In the next year, more holidays fall into the middle of the week, i.e. at the end of the week, so that it will be made available on working days less than this year.
The calendar will first be around the day of work "set on the head", so that people can stay at home for the same four days.
Saturday, April 26, will be a workday so that Friday may be a rest day.
The second resurgence relates to the day of the festival on 23 October: On Saturday, 18 October, you will have to work before Friday, 24 October.
The end of the year, however, will stand forever on the mark of the holiday, after all since December 24th, even if Silvester falls on a Wednesday.
Six exciting young people to hire fellow workers
E-mails we forget to send, messages we never get - hormless lies that we don't even notice again: they bring "colour" every day at work.
The question is whether you are accustomed to these minor accidents, or you are better aware of the challenge and try to avoid these incomprehensible situations.
Tipps.
"Sorry, I forgot to tell you that someone called from the marketing department," says one colleague.
That you missed a meeting?
If you're sorry about it and try to calm it down again, perhaps you're calling at the marketing department, and you've forgotten to fix the message (that's the least common method).
Often the matter is dismissed with an apology.
Before you get into a stressful situation, you should consider how you can prepare your colleagues for a truly unpleasant moment and try to avoid these situations.
Paying off something that doesn't belong to one himself?
There's hardly anything more nervous than if you pick up a document, office, or phone, but it's not there.
Yesterday was still on the desk - this morning it's gone?
Or is the lost doll writer discovered on a colleague's desk?
Without asking questions, you should not borrow anything from your colleagues because they will be charged with law if they find that something has gone away.
So, no envelopes or post-it from the office are put in the pockets, because it could happen to itself: nothing more if you need it urgently.
Do you care about the private life of your colleagues?
There is no effective means to stop a tratsch that has already been put into the world.
Who did it with whom?
Where and why?
You should not bind the information (or confusion) about the privacy of your colleagues to the nose if possible!
And if someone opens himself and tells us his inner secret, we should not waste this trust!
The best thing to do is to try to fix the situation rather than the one present, even if others are aware of the problems of the colleague.
No reason reported?
If you call in the office to report yourself to chronic headaches, because you just feel uncomfortable or simply want to relax, you should be aware of something in the clear: your own job, unshipable achievements, projects with fixed terms should now be done by your colleagues rather than by yourself.
So don't mess with your colleagues!
If you already know that you will not be created in the office on the next day or that something can happen to you, why you should stay home, you should report it on time so that neither your colleagues nor the chief is expected to face the absence.
Total, kitchen, telephone
You're just deeply involved in your work, but are you suddenly disturbed by the sound of your colleagues?
I don't want to hear a phone call that you shouldn't have heard.
You should not be nervous about talking to your colleagues with summaries, singing, talking (which leads you over your head), trampling, lasting shingles or nursings.
This can be very disturbing, even if they are not just deeply involved in a task ( writing, planning, organizing).
Are the others always guilty?
If a project is not completed within a time limit, you have forgotten to send an important letter or important news, you should not look for the fault of your own indifference in others!
As far as possible, you should not talk to the chaos in the office or to the deaf colleagues!
The best thing to do is admit his mistakes and apologize if others were involved too!
The question of how to correct the mistake again, or how to correct the sale, is just too much!
In the office - a feeling like home?
Trainingshouse and sleep: Easy for home, but nothing has been lost in the office!
Not even then you should dress so low if it really allows the job!
Not only will it be too late - you should both respect your colleagues as well as yourself, that you dress appropriately in the office - if you like, also beautiful and elegant!
It wants everyone to be right - or how you become uninterested for others
Stop and go traffic, the car is in the middle of the morning.
From the radio comes a rare melody: The sound of a poem, paired with electronic effects.
I'll turn the volume higher.
The time changes to the previous sounds comes from the bass, and as a true sound jewel, a female choir.
It's the song "Wings of Love" by Zagar, which explains to mr2.
The home music scene hasn't just enriched us for a long time with a quality electropop.
But now you can even see the station differently if you hear the new album from Zagar.
The appearance of Yonderboi, so sometimes new and exciting production from the hemisphere digital underground stage gradually contributes to a change in the overall picture, and even if the Garage Rock with its guitar quitte is "in", the chemical electropop shows: there are new under the sun.
Balázs Zzóser started in Pécs, even performed in the Yonderboi band, before he - perhaps because a farm does not present two fires - began to describe his own path.
The break with his project (Zagar) and his music, which freezes elements from jazz, electronics, and pop, but only when he was asked to compose the soundtrack into a film (e.g.
"Sezon" by Ferenc Török).
The formation originally appeared in smaller clubs was first known to the wider audience when the magazine "wan2" selected its first album from 2002 under the top 50 domestic albums and Zagar, together with Yonderboi, to be almost single, even in the Western marketable trend set.
Despite the doubt, Zagar and his band were "treddy", but no one was interested if they liked to wear these brands too.
The band has responded as it should: With a new, even better album.
The new album now appeared with the title "Cannot Walk Fly Instead" could open up new ways for them, but the title has already expressed the desire for continuity with the pécser for years.
The expression comes from the time when Baláz Zzózer was still on his way with another band.
The airy, flying performance would be fine, but besides the essential character of the music, the – the time spirit and the trend – are lower guitars, the influence of the Rock'n'Roll.
With these songs, the singer György Ligeti, who lives in England and works with the band "The Puzzle", presented himself at the prize in millenáris.
A song from the album has even made it to the radio player - from the novel from early to late pop music mr2 Petófi has taken the audience with the number "Wings of Love", which was taken under the influence of six domestic singers ("Underground Divas").
Everything's fine, then.
The hvg.hu asked for information at Baláz Zzózer.
hvg.hu: This new hit raises the question: How far is your music to keep a certain layer?
Balázs Zzzörer: The term "Schichtmuk" doesn't mean much to me.
I think there are two boxes in pop music, and although not mainstream and underground, or alternative and pop, but commercial and honest.
Even the so-called alternative or underground music can be boring and unsatisfied, but it can also be produced only for the sale which makes it commercial music.
A good pop number can also come from an honest motive.
The recording of the audience also works independently of this principle, of languages and national boundaries.
hvg.hu: Do you see a difference in the openness of your music in Hungary and abroad?
B. For example: In abroad, especially in the western part of us, pop music has a larger tradition.
There are not only teenagers or Twins going to concerts but also the older audience.
They follow the trends in pop music that are taking place around them much more noticeable because they also hold them as part of contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What role does the public play in your work?
Is it important, who, where, how many of your music do you hear?
For example: Of course it's a good feeling to see that there's always more to our concerts.
But we never made up for the market.
We do not create music to serve a purpose, but for a certain reason.
The role of the public is most disturbing at the concerts where there is already an anti-interchange effect, but it is only in the incomprehensible changes of the moment.
However, I have one thing to say: If you want to make it all right, you are no longer interested.
hvg.hu: How far do you want to follow the example of Yonderboi?
He is on his way as a soloist and has built his career in the West.
B. For example: We are not really going his way, since it is quite clear that we are constantly trying to interpret this into our music.
We see ourselves more than the Templars who trust in the musical presence of the other and let them out.
At first, of course, our work was inextricably compared with that of Yonderboi, since several of us came from his band and hit another way.
hvg.hu: In the Charts of Mr2 Petófi "Wings of Love" is the first place.
Many have only heard the name Zagar in connection with this number.
Was the opening with a somewhat more popular style introduced to a wider audience?
For example: We had no plans to write a hit that should then be held as a trainer for the album.
There's more to this song.
It was thought to be the final of the album that we wanted to solve the sounds and some more difficult subjects.
hvg.hu: How have you chosen the six singers?
Why did she just say what the guiding principle was?
B. For example: The reason was to make a gospel-like choir.
Then came the idea of bringing together the choir from dedicated soloists of the world's music scene.
So the sixth head of the choir was created - so Sena, Edina Kutzora, Judy Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enikő Hodosi [Neo], Juci Németh - which we have then baptized "Underground Divas".
hvg.hu: Do you want to have the song exactly like that or did you design the girls?
For example: The number was already in the instrument version, but when the material for the album was finished, we thought that this number was still "need something".
The agreement was formally requested after a vote.
I've joined Melody in the same night, and later they've taught the girls.
It's all practically on hand, and it's excitingly spontaneous.
I can remember that I was quite electric at the time, but it's also called for the Divas.
With my voice alone, the sound would never have been so strong.
hvg.hu: Both on the plate and at the concert, however, you had the impression that the girls were in the background.
There is no solo part (except for the short solo by Judy Jay), they have no own role, sing together perfectly and are not more loud than the music, so their song is not only accompanied by music.
They were also on the stage.
Is it purpose?
For example: Because they were behind, it was because of purely technical problems.
However, we did not want to let them access any solo roles.
In the number, it is also about forgetting his ego a little bit, forgetting who came and where he's going, let's just let us carry on these particular flights of love.
I'd like others to smell this epphoric condition that we've been inspired by when the sound has occurred.
hvg.hu: What was the loudest song?
B. For example: In fact, there is nothing more difficult to do with musical creation.
For example, "Dorian Gray's dilemma", where I played on a concert piano, or "Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls", where Groove no longer wanted to work, but after and after he added everything together like a puzzle.
hvg.hu: What is your favorite number from the new album?
For example: This is changing with the concerts and also now where I've "let go" the album.
Now it's "prophet Is A Fool", "Escape From The Earth" and the number "Never The Same".
False Maclers Risked for Less Valued Billions
Non-recoverable dusters
This is the name of his former employees Jerome Kerviel of the French bankeries Société Generale, owner of the house Komerční banka.
It was about EUR 5 billion on its way.
It seems, however, that Kerviel was just a big player who wanted to do the same for his colleagues, and he was certainly not able to do so.
In contrast to all large banks, he recognized the crisis in the American mortgage market.
"He's physically weaker," was heard from the mouth of his predecessors who showed him to the police.
But how did the French media, such as the newspaper Le Monde, out of Kerviels' statement, publish it, he was a man who had achieved 1.6 billion euros at the end of the last year with his business gains.
Crisis Not Only in America
"All I wanted was to earn money for my bank," he claimed in his statement.
In the summer it was possible for him to earn half a billion euros in the US crisis.
The opportunity to do so had already been given to him at the beginning of the year.
In February there was first news that so-called sub-prime mortgages, such as low-income customers or those who had previously had problems with payment, would be given in difficulties.
But this crisis should not have an impact on the whole economy.
Cornel didn't believe that and kept the right.
Over the years, he had earned up to 1.6 billion euros.
"As long as I had earned the first half billionaire, I didn't know how I should explain it," says Kerveel and continues that he definitely didn't have anything for himself.
During the entire hearing, he must have lied to the details so that he would not be harmed.
He was even able to lead his bosses behind the light, even though the Eurex drills were generally interested in his business.
Risk-benefit
Was he afraid to fly?
I don't think so.
"I thought she was satisfied with the bad fact that I earned 1.6 billion for the bank."
Where did he take the courage to risk so much?
He had to develop his position gradually.
He entered the Société Generale in 2000, immediately after completing his studies at Lyon University.
His annual income was about $55,000.
After two years he was already an assistant to a maker, and in 2005 he became a self-employed maker with a annual salary of $90,000.
However, he knew that he would never earn as much as others.
"I should have known at my first conversation in 2005 that I was watched.
Because of my training and also because of my professional and personal development," Kerviel told the research officers.
But soon after his entry, the first great success came.
With the shares of the Allianz he earned a lot by putting half a billion euros at the London bombings on the loss of this title.
And that was the trigger - now he wanted more.
As long as you win, we'll let you go
"That's like a snowball," he said to the police.
But the bosses knew of everything, they knew it relatively well.
"As long as I earn money, you close your eyes."
But then, at the beginning of this year, the great tribulation came.
In one day he lost a billion euros.
On a weekend in mid-January he wanted to figure it out.
When he came to work on Monday, he was no longer a bank employee.
And a few days later, the bank announced that it had lost five billion euros due to it.
And how did they get him into trouble?
He was suspicious of a vacation.
"I only took four days from last year.
A mackerel who doesn't take any vacation is one who doesn't want to be seen in the cards," Kerveel concluded.
The Czech Republic has the chance to reach 365 billion
The Czech Ministers and Representatives of the European Commission signed nine development programmes yesterday, which will allow the Czech Republic to reach EUR 14 billion in the coming years (about EUR 365 billion).
This is about half of the amount that the Czech Republic can receive from Brussels in 2007 to 2013.
Some 125 billion dollars come from seven regional development programmes.
Czech companies can receive some 100 billion dollars from the "Company and Innovation" programme.
Most of the money, about 150 billion, will flow into the transport industry.
The transport programme is the largest development programme and includes up to 22 per cent of the funds that can be obtained from the Fund.
This money will increase according to the budget of the State Transport Infrastructure Fund, which will be available over 90.8 billion next year.
The "Company and Innovation" programme is intended for entrepreneurs and companies to earn money for innovative enterprises.
As a result, companies should earn funding for the introduction of new technologies, for corporate research, but also for the introduction of more efficient organisational methods.
In the case of the so-called EU funds, the Czech Republic is at least successful in the new accession countries.
Nicaraguan Court of Justice confirms twenty-year term of office for the Presidents
On Thursday, a court of profession in Nicaragua confirmed the twenty-year term of imprisonment for former President Arnold Alemán, which he was sentenced to $100 million in 2003 for financial fraud.
Later, however, he was released from prison and lived under house arrest on his Hazienda at the Nicaraguan Metropolis.
If the former state capital (1997 to 2002) of this Central American state is coming back behind the gate, it is now unclear according to the news agency AP.
The President of the Court of Justice, Ileana Pérez, will then be dependent on the authorities to decide whether he is allowed to leave his sentence at home or whether he has to go to prison.
A court ruled four years ago that Alemán had regularly transferred government money to foreign companies' accounts in Panama.
These companies were fictional and the accounts actually belonged to its relatives and closeest customers.
Finally, some of this money was put into a fund that Germany had set up to finance its election fight in 2001.
The budget is by
Yeah, it's busy.
The state budget is valid.
What is special about this budget?
It is the first budget proposed by this government and the opposition was adopted without the support of the coalition majority.
This year, with the support of the ČSSD (Social Democrats), was still valid because Minister Sobotka (from this party) had introduced it and the ČSSD could not allow it to reject it.
In contrast to the lively debate before the vote on the mystery issue against the government, nothing was dramatic this time.
The House of Commons took little note of this traditional, yet the most important law in all peace.
This is a certain paradox.
All government begins and ends with the individual chapters and posts of the budget, whether or not one falls into it.
The budget is an essential component of policy, but is covered by the power struggle of the government and opposition.
This is an appreciative topic for the media, and therefore they pay more attention to him.
A conflict among politicians is much more interesting for the public than for new numbers.
The state spending in the past social democratic governments are below three weaknesses which cannot be eliminated by the budget for 2008 at all times:
The first is the high proportion of expenditure required by law, which is not only about the interest rates but also about social expenditure which has been decided in the last year by the "silent" coalition of ČSSD and KSCHM (communist) before the elections.
The second is the fiscal policy as a result of the first weakness.
The third restriction is in the deficits of public finances, i.e. the budget deficits of the Communities.
However, the greatest risk is not the state budget deficit.
This budget is public and subject to control.
A real time bomb, however, is the budget deficit of the communities.
Many mayors have given rise to other sources of investment in addition to taxes, charges and bank loans, often inexhaustible debt transactions by which they owed their shareholders over the years.
In recent years they have been able to pay these debts through massive sales of energy and other supply networks that they had received in the course of their privatization from the State.
Now this source is already in circulation.
As far as we are concerned only with official and verifiable facts, we note that:
Our economy has been going through a growth phase, like the rest of the world, where the ČSSD is enjoying without leave.
This was a unique opportunity for their governments to organize public finances.
Instead, these governments owed the State more and more.
Other countries, apart from a few exceptions such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, have far more reasonable economies than our Republic.
This is a huge challenge that must be addressed mainly to the former governments.
We belong to the countries that are at least threatened by poverty at the global level.
Therefore, there is no need for massive social programmes that have, unfortunately, been overflew in the last few years.
Even if it has been accomplished to achieve part of the unintended populist expenditure that has been approved this year before the elections, it is clear that if it does not come to a disbursement of the interest rate and to a pension reform in the future, then virtually every policy in this country will end, and, at the same time as it is in power, it will not remain a clean administration.
It is only easy to get over when it is said that it will then become a dominant political officer who mechanically share most of the tax revenue on interest and social expenditure.
Therefore, this year's budget may not be a revolution, but it can only cover the destruction of normal expenditure by compulsory expenditure.
The deficit of 70 billion dollars for 2008 would be excessive if previous governments had not issued in the last ten years, what had just happened.
If we do not really want the government to be a clean administrative officer from the ruling politicians, we must be patient and not too strong a coalition government, which is aware that the State can only issue as much as it can about taxes and taxes as it would like to be able to make peace in the preparation of further reform laws.
Only these will allow for a gradual implementation of a balanced state budget.

Banks want to deal with a crisis
The United States Federal Reserves, the European Central Bank and the Central Banks of Great Britain, Switzerland and Canada have decided to fight the financial markets together.
Thus more than $100 billion will be obtained through auctions on the currency markets.
At these auctions, banks increase interest rates to which they are willing to lend money to each other.
For example, the U.S. fed sends $40 billion to auction, and it makes 24 more lockers for the European and Swiss Central Bank.
It is the first time that the central banks of the individual states, following the attacks of 11 September, agree on a coordinated procedure to reverse the effects of a financial crisis.
"This step will eliminate the biggest difficulties of the economy, so the growing lack of free capital that banks can afford," wrote Bernard Baumohl from the Advisory Company Economic Outlook Group in a report for his customers.
"The coordinated action of the central banks has reduced the likelihood of a recession in the United States from 65% to about 50%," said Baumohl in his report.
Banks have already lost $60 billion due to non-serviced loans, especially in the United States.
Analysts expect further billions of losses.
"The central banks must have been really afraid of what might happen when they decided on this occasion," said the chief economist of ABN Amro, Kieran Davies.
"It looks so bad," he continued.
The central banks are afraid that if the banks themselves have difficulty lending access, they will also be more expensive for their customers.
This would reduce consumption and drive the US economy into a recession, possibly with an impact on economic growth worldwide.
The central banks have decided to do so after they have not been able to do so, so does the LIBOR, the London Interbank Interbank rate used for the loan between banks.
This means that banks were constantly afraid to lend money to each other, although the central banks of the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom had reduced their interest rates several times during the autumn.
"This will have the same effect as a further downturn of interest rates," said Greg Salvaggio from Tempus Consulting of the Reuters Agency.
Some analysts believe that this step of the central banks contributes to the resumption of the crisis because it does not solve the fundamental problem, and although the case of the real estate market in the United States is concerned.
Class: Economies' debates are unbelievable
Global climate change is said to damage developing countries most of the time.
President Václav Klaus once again addressed the problem of global warming.
The criticism is now at the UN International Conference on Climate Change on Bali, which will be held at the end.
In Vienna, where he presented his book "A Blue, Not a Green Planet", he pointed out that the discussions of the ecologists were untrustworthy.
Klaus thus is not only the structure of the conference which represents a rare mix of government representatives and such non-governmental organizations, but also the fundamental difference between the rhetoric they accompany and the reality.
"The debate is unstructured there, it is a dictionary that is only a substitute for a real solution to current problems," said Klaus.
The Czech President stressed in the presentation of his book that it was very important for him and that he would therefore be so committed to it.
He also expressed his satisfaction at the fact that his book appeared in German translation because "I often get on my karikatures."
Interested parties could now read their settings unambiguously.
Klaus recalled that he was not a climateist, but he felt that he had sufficient conditions to write such a book.
Finally, he was academic, capable of understanding and evaluating trades, having experience with statistics and being economical as well.
As the main source of the book, he mentioned the fact that the climate is constantly changing and that its changes are so normal that there is no consistent opinion among scientists that the consequences of the current changes are not too large and serious and therefore are not a threat, and that efforts to influence the development of the climate are excessive, ineffective and unacceptable.
In addition, he considered that as a person who has experience with totalitarian systems, for unfavourable and other unconfirmed views, he sees it as a dangerous restriction on freedom.
On questions from the audience, he reiterated that he was not against "a reasonable environmental protection, but against militarized eco-activists who do not take a look at the relationship between recovery and recovery."
Klaus had already spoken on the same subject in Vienna two months ago at the Hayek Institute.
600 000 people couldn't change their leadership
600,000 car drivers spent the period to exchange their old leader, whose validity ran at the end of the year.
Today is the last day you can apply for the exchange so that the authorities can create it until the end of the year.
However, the Ministry is not afraid that after a new year hundreds of thousands of drivers are on the streets without valid driving rights.
As a result, the authorities have largely failed to exchange their leadership, which do not want to drive any more.
As small places report a strong decline in interest in the field exchange, the mayors of the capital are overwhelmed with applications, and the interest in the exchange continues to increase this week.
The city administration spends about 2000 customers every day.
You have to stand for about half an hour.
In Prague some 140000 car drivers have not yet exchanged their driver's license.
The exhibition takes 20 days for a new leader.
But it is possible to apply for the exhibition with a shorter period of five days.
In this case, however, the driver must pay 500 kroner.
Automobiles who do not create the required exchange until the end of the year and leave without a valid driver's license shall pay a fine from January.
The father-in-law pays a maximum of 2000 krones.
However, the police can also use it with a warrant.
In the case of an infringement, the penalty may rise to 2500 kroner.
According to previous information, those in the Community may also receive a penalty which does not at all go on.
He could, so it was worth a fine of nearly $30,000.
The Ministry has already called on the authorities to leave Milde waltz and to impose a maximum of 1000 crowns.
The spokesman of the Ministry of Transport, Karel Hanzelka, followed, but no one suffered a thousand-kron punishment.
The driver is a document where anyone can decide whether or not to own it.
It's not a personal way of dealing with everyone, and even though it's valid.
People who don't want to drive anymore should give up their leadership.
It's enough to bring him to the competent community office or send him there by letter.
During the year, leaders who were exposed to violence between 1964 and 1993 will be dishonest.
However, drivers generally need to exchange other types of drivers.
People with leaders from the years 1994 to 2000 have more than three years to change.
The validity of the driving licences issued between 2001 and 2004 shall expire in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, there are about 2.6 million more leaders.
Justice lower penalties for detectives connected with Berdych
The former police officers Josef Opava and Petr Konerírík, who are accused of having made a joint case with the band of David Berdych, received 13 relatively 10 years.
In a legal case, the Prague Supreme Court ruled that it would reduce its punishment by a two-year relationship.
Initially, the detectives of the "Operation Office against Organized Crime" took 14 relatively 12 years.
There is no possibility of prosecution against today's court, only revision of the Supreme Court is possible.
Berdych himself is accused of this too, but he is at first the first case.
In other processes, however, he had already suffered a total of 16 years.
He can't be tried anymore.
On January 19 a district court spoke mainly about the involvement of victims of robbery, which the Supreme Court had negotiated today the appeal of 16 of them.
Most of the defendants initially argue on the charge with the reason, it is a constructive case.
According to the Central Bohamian District Court, police officers, inter alia with Berdich criminals, provided information from police sources, covered various robbery incidents and half of the gang members to avoid prosecution.
The band survived Opava and Konerík 30 percent of the beet.
In the case of the complaint, there are penalties for the gang from 1999 to 2001.
Especially in cases of robbery, whose victims often experience serious injuries, but also in the use and possession of unauthorized weapons.
In domestic investigations, the police discovered illegal guns, ammunition with steel cores, laser beams and machine guns.
The band has been charged with many millions of dollars as a result of its robbery.
In addition to almost 20 men in this procedure, Justice Berdych and a number of others were found guilty of extra robbery.
Other men from Berdych's circle must be responsible for another process, and other cases have not yet been brought before the court.
Tomáš Póta and Maroš Šulej, who are in Irish port and are waiting for the final decision on their release for prosecution in the Czech Republic.
Children Exchange - Account: 12 million
For the exchange of children in an outpatient clinic, the lawyer of the injured parents, Igor Veleba, wants to request compensation from the hospital in Trébíč 12 million Kronen plus court costs.
For each mother every three million, for the father every two million and for the children every million.
The hospital offers a maximum of 200000 for each parent couple.
The legal representative of the hospital, Ondřij Dostál, therefore, did not agree with the Velebas proposal.
"We reject such a proposal to be too high for a multiphase," Dostal said after today's negotiations.
"To form an opinion on this proposal, however, we need the views which made the opposite.
We'll find out if it's ever gone.
But we are in the view that this should be for everyone in the hundreds of thousands of sub-areas," Dostal stressed.
The amount should then move between 100000 and 200000 kroner for each of the four parents.
At first, the family from Jablonov wanted one million kroner for each month, which she had not raised her biological daughter.
For Veleba, it served as a basis for damage negotiations, an attitude that the university hospital had developed for him in Prague Motol.
The parents of children experience psychological damage and stress symptoms in different strengths and depth.
Men believe the stress situation better, even if they saw prejudices against them, they could have prevented the movement of newborns.
The women come back with the effects of the trauma of the past, as well as what is just going on, Veleba decided the content together.
Veronika and Nikola translated last December 9th, the hospital nurse in Třebić.
Last week the children returned to their biological parents - Nikola to the Čermáks in Pribyslavie, and Veronika to Libor Brož and Jaroslava Trojanová to Jablonov.
The district head of Vysočina (Böhmische-Americane height) gave each family 100000 kroner at the end of October as a substitute for expenses incurred by the hospital in Třébić, which supports the area.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic are protected by law because of their obligations.
In the event of doubt, they must take to a reserve fund, only in exceptional ways can they seek assistance from the carrier.
The courts have reached similar low levels of injury, which have been determined by tables and have moved in the area of hundreds of thousands, with the exception of millions.
Polívka came to his kingdom of Balachei
Bolek Polívka lost the fight against the brand "Kingdom of Balachei".
The Richterin of the District Court in Ostrava has used the term "Walachischer King" as the first time, but the project had built a team for Tomáš Harabiš in collaboration with the actor in a long work.
Polívka did not participate in the negotiations today.
As a result of his lawyer, however, the matter is not likely to end and his mandate is likely to be appealed.
"The conflict is that Mr Harabiš and his team want to participate in the Bolek Polívkas populace," said the Polívkas Anwalt after the negotiations.
All were present with the words "Walachic Kingdom" just these actors and comedians.
The same opinion is also Arabic.
"We have almost ten years of work behind us.
Money creation and concepts of activities," he said.
As a result, he's got a fight for money.
"After years they have found that the project is successful and that they may have something of it.
They want to win parasites at our work," he continued.
Lukrative business
Polivka then used the name "Walachish King" for the first time in one of his television broadcasts.
In 1993 he was crowned by the actor Radoslav Brzobothý.
However, this did not take place with the intention of establishing a more effective kingdom.
A few years later, Harabish came up with the idea of giving Christmas.
From an original fun action, a business and business activity emerged, and Harabish then agreed to the establishment of the company "Walachic Kingdom".
In 1997, Polívka agreed to use his name and signature in the passports and even invited its owners to attend his farm and theatre presentations.
Who's gonna sit on the throne?
The Richterin also pointed out today that Harabish used only the idea that Polívka had published in the "Manage" consignment for his business purposes.
"Popularity Polívkas has certainly helped the project of the Balkan Kingdom," said the Richterin.
However, she added that the souls of the project Harabish and his team had dedicated themselves to him.
The cooperation of today's warring parties lasted until 2000, when Harabish for Polívka in Vsetín organized the official crown.
Since then, however, there have been conflicts between Polívka and Harabiš which have been raised in the clause "King of Boleslavs I. chosen until the day of Saint-Numereleins".
The leadership role then took place at the initiative of Harabishs Jarmila Šuláková as the Queen's mother.
Then, in 2002, Polívka filed a complaint against Harabish and his company, which the court ruled today.
Clearness in the conflict could bring about the war prepared by Harabish about the throne and a half princess.
This should lead to a new king.
He didn't want to talk about details and a term.
"We don't want to overdo anything.
It should be something like the king's funeral in the Balachei.
The king should be selected for a certain time.
Mr. Polívka can also register quietly," adds Harabiš.
Test Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi: Advantages
To tell the truth, I was never a special fan of Peugeot 206.
Its properties were not very valuable, the quality of driving, the linkage and even processing could be described as more moderate.
But now his successor, Peugeot 207, is on the market, and he's much better.
The combination with the name SW is still another piece, and I'm just going to review my opinion.
When I had tested the classic hatchback of 207, I had to complain, for example, about the very low freedom of head on the back seats.
These complaints are no longer available now, because the cartserie of the Komi is designed so that even two-foot men will not suffer.
Faster
I'm just going through the interior to keep me from being too busy.
It's a really successful design where I have only because of the concern of the middle tunnel.
There I would like to have a little more designer design, where the car would otherwise have such an elegant impression.
The seats are comfortable, and there are times when we may complain about too short seats or headaches.
The page content has also improved significantly against 206.
As far as the range offer is concerned, you can also see here the increased dimensions of the cartserie.
In Kombbi, the lack of freedom of thought has also been eliminated.
Box in the box
But the main thing about this car is the laundry room.
I have to call it (also because of the adjustable back window) very well-advisable and space-saving.
The wooden rooms are equipped with stables that represent an ideal compromise.
They do not disturb, let each other withdraw, and also hold heavy objects.
But we're holding on to the load volume.
It is based on the table in the basic supply 428 litres, which is a higher average value compared to competition.
However, not compared to the vehicle most sold in the Czech Republic of this class, the Čkoda Fabia Combi.
When we compare the 207 SW with the new generation of the product from Mladá Boleslav, we note that the peugeot remains about 52 litres that are clearly swirling.
This value is already critical for a trip abroad or when inviting a child car.
But in order to promote the positive, I still need to mention the very flimsy charge area or the very low chargeant.
120 PS in four rows
Our test car was equipped with a fourrzylinder petrol engine with a hubraum 1.6 litre and a performance of 88 kWp.
And honestly, it should look like a 1600-Kubik engine that drives a family hackback.
He's lazy, he's got a little consumption and he's driving away well.
If I compare him to his face with Scotland, which sometimes works as if his explosives were hidden with a pencil, then I can only be impressed by him.
The price list speaks bands
The price of this car is not just popular.
But we must remember that we have tested a well-equipped car with a spacious interior and a very good engine.
The basic price of the car with the 1400 petrol engine at the height of 329,00 kroner.
With our engine it costs up to 410900 kroner, which is already quite much.
The premium equipment of the test vehicle is added to book with 80,000 kroner.
However, we had headlights, automatic air conditioning, automatic disc exchange resolution, electrical window holder back and...
This is how the car costs 531900 kroner.
That's a lot, but once you count the additional equipment of a Fabia and you will arrive at a similar sum.
So only the decision which brand you want to choose remains.
Integration of Slovak schools in British schools failed
In British schools, the number of children from Eastern European countries is increasing, leading to further development of local school.
The integration of Eastern Europe is up to date based on a number of obstacles.
British schools even identify cases where conflicts between immigrants and the children of the original inhabitants become violent.
The problem with the integration of children from Eastern Europe into British schools is illustrated by the case of North Kent, where there is a general increase in the differences between local and Slovak immigrants.
Streets, skis and coaches among students have been transferred to the relationship between parents.
The situation has already developed so far that the police in Chatham arrested a Slovak woman who had hit a ten-year-old boy with a iron rod.
The accused defended themselves because the young man had abused them with racist occupations.
The police also had to attack two minor girls on a Slovak migrant.
The girls had evidently made racist remarks against the man and cast him with stones.
"When we went home, a boy climbed on a bus and jumped on us.
When I told him that he was going to stop, he stole us with apples and bees and then blew his ass off," a mother of Slovak students in the newspaper The Times described another unpleasant incident.
Complaints come from both sides.
One of the locals even referred to the conflict with migrants from Eastern Europe as a struggle for survival.
The cases cited relate to the growing tension between locals and immigrants in British schools.
In Britain 70,000 Slovaks who came here looking for work have been notified.
Some 30,000 Slovak students are visiting British schools.
Cuba - the most beautiful Caribbean island
For visitors it is really an island of freedom.
What you always expect from your holiday will be fulfilled if you choose only the right one.
Gold and white beaches, high waves or a sea, which is quiet like a pond.
Palms and All inclusive with kellners that offer on the beach Pizza, ice and toxic cocktails.
Kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
On the islands of the Caribbean you will find it to a greater extent.
Only on one island can you find much more, and this island is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful of the great continents.
By the time of the Spanish, Cuba was their base for the conquest of America.
Columbus called it the most beautiful place he's ever seen.
Havanna was first transferred to a warehouse or transit camp of treasures that the Spaniards had built in America and then transported to Europe.
And then the American era came.
The National Hotel was created at the end of the 20th century.
It was one of the heads of the American Mafia, Lucky Luciano, because everything that was considered a crime in the United States (especially during the ban) was seen and supported on Cuba - drugs, gambling, prostitution.
Among his guests were:
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In Havanna, high-rise houses, over the wide boulevards, drove cars that were counted on the cult symbols of the past 50 years.
Ernest Hemingway bought an estate in San Francisco de Paula, near Havana, and he had his hunting in Cojjmar.
On the walls of the Bodeguita del Medio, stars of the show business and politicians from across America left their signatures.
And today?
On the walls of the bodyguita of Havana you can also leave your autograph.
At the bar at the National Mixt hotel you can use cocktails for you as much as you want.
And the five-year-old cultutos are still on their way to Havana today because the first imported sigulis and fiats in the salty and wet air have long been extinct.
Mag Havanna, in particular his oldest part, has been badly down, nowhere you can find as many wonderful colonial sights as right here.
Other places are just listed, for example Trinidad.
In view of the fact that tourism brings urgently needed money, there was green light for this development.
In the last 15 years, new hotels have been established not only in Havana but also in Varadero, on the coast of the province of Holguín and also on islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba offers yet another maroutte that is unique in the world and is particularly popular on the railways.
The sugar rush from distant plants led to steam and oil-producing smelting pathways to the sugar factories.
Her fur park has not been renovated over decades, and there you see beautiful and fully functional motifs, whose old friends are far away in the museum.
Expiration targets
The most important places do not leave most of Cuba's visitors.
You don't have to write in detail about Varadero or Havanna anymore.
It is only to be mentioned that in Hemingway's already mentioned presence there is a museum whose visit should not be allowed by those who may be allowed to leave.
The Viñales Valley in the west of the island is one of the most picturesque corners of Cuba.
The fungus vegetation grows on calklands.
Mogotas, Calcügels and Rocks, swung off from the floor, gathered productive soils in their wooden rooms, also covered by thick vegetation.
This valley is where the best Cuban tobacco can be built.
In its final form, you can meet him when you visit one of the cigarettes factories in Havana.
It may also seem interesting that the Chilean consequences of the "Major Zeman" television series have been pushed there.
Trinidad
An ancient city was founded shortly after the Spanish colonization of the island.
Peace and prosperity brought you trade with slaves and sugar.
The rich lived in the beautiful beauty of the little town.
The Spanish colonial architecture, influenced by the later French settlers, has almost changed for four centuries.
Trinidad, situated between the sea and the Escambray Mountains, is such a remote place that there has not been a road in the last fifty years that had been connected with the rest of the country.
This isolation meant that it remained unattended.
Nothing was built there, but that's why nothing was thrown away, everyone was glad that he had a roof over his head.
If you have more than one afternoon for Trinidad, it is worth looking at interesting places in the environment, such as the beach Playa Ancón or the "number of sugar factories".
In the evening you should go to Casa de la Música, which lives after the darkness, and where music doesn't move until the morning.
Baracoa
This town is known as the most beautiful island in eastern Cuba.
I'm sure this view will also be influenced by the way there.
Both roads leading from Guantánamo there must overcome high and circular mountains and pass through a landscape that is almost affected by human interference.
This eastern preposter Cuba took over the UNESCO thanks to its undisputed nature in its World Heritage List.
There is the best chocolate made in the church, showing the cross of Columbus (in fact it was born about a hundred years after the journey of Columbus), and from the hill where the former castle, the current Hotel El Castillo, is located, is seen several table mountains, of which El Yunque is the most famous.
About the coffee, the rum, the cigarettes, the Sierra Maestre Mountains, the Swine Boutt and the Isla de Pinos Island, about the Tropical Cabaret, the sacredness of the Cuban Patronin Caridad del Cobre, about the Santeria, an African religion known as the descendants of slaves, many pages could be written about.
But as you say, it's better to look with your own eyes.
Associated in Afghanistan are passive, alleged Americans.
Few soldiers and lack of necessary equipment influence the United States following the mission in Afghanistan.
The NATO should design a concrete plan for the next few years, in accordance with the words of Defence Minister Robert Gates.
The mission in Afghanistan did not follow its assumptions, as the representatives of the countries in the Scottish Edinburgh agreed that the units in the south of the country had been stationed.
In addition to the growing opposition from the Taliban, the eight participating countries are also discussing further coordination plans among the allies.
While the United States, through its defence minister Robert Gates, has called on NATO units to become more active, Britain sees the priority in strengthening the authority of the Afghan government and in intensifying development aid.
"In Afghanistan, a forward-looking development is inevitable, but military power can only be part of the solution.
Another part of it is to enable residents to begin their own development of the economy and security," says British Defence Minister Des Browne of the BBC.
Ninety percent
The activity of the Afghan rebels has reached the highest level since five years after the U.S. Army's statement.
The number of acts of violence has increased by 27 per cent over the previous year, in the southern province of Helmand even by sixteen per cent.
The NATO countries have stationed some 40,000 soldiers in Afghanistan, about a quarter of which are located in the southern territory.
As a result, the United States is bound to an absolute limit as regards the organisation and equipment of the units.
In particular, they call for further helicopters, soldiers and experts to train Afghan units.
"We will have to think seriously about the specific goals for the next time and how we can achieve them," said Gates.
Similarly today, NATO Secretary-General Jaap de Hope appeared.
"I am not pleased with what we have in Afghanistan to land and air.
We have about nine percent of the soldiers and equipment we need, and that is too little," De Hope of the Reuters Agency said to close three-day talks with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Who is passive
In recent months, among the countries involved, there is also a dispute as to whether all the allies in Afghanistan give their best.
For example, Germany has been criticised for passiveity.
"The Germans are relatively numerous in Afghanistan.
But they are stationed in areas where there is only a minimum amount of violence and the fighting requirements for them are not as high as for us in the south and east parts of the country," said Gates.
The British boulevard "Sun" referred to the German soldiers as Faulpelze this week.
"Afghan Non-Stuary: The Germans are playing games while our boys are fighting," wrote the "Sun" in a post that was supplemented by photos of German soldiers playing the table.
The German photo newspaper went on to attack and printed an image of a British unit during a Rugby-Wett battle in southern Afghanistan.
State debt will increase to a billion in 2009
On each check a state debt of 44,000 kroner.
The total debt rose to 842.7 billion dollars by the end of September.
The government had planned to charge 159.2 billion women this year.
At the beginning of December, however, the Ministry reduced its budget to 152.8 billion.
The debt of the Czech Republic rose to EUR 842.7 billion by the end of September.
Within the first nine months of this year, they rise to 40.2 billion.
Since June, however, they have fallen to 13.4 billion.
As a result, the Ministry of Finance confirmed its statements on State debt at the beginning of October.
On each check there is a debt of 84000 kroner.
Over the last year, the state owed more than 111 billion dollars.
"To date it seems that we are going to exceed the limit of a Billion Krone in 2009 due to the lower deficit for the next year.
The next year the debt should move between 900 billion and a billion krone," said David Marek, analyst of Patria Finance, to the iHNed.cz server.
Similarly, Vladimir Pikora, analyst of the Next Finance, says: "To get over a billion we could come in the course of 2009.
If so, it depends on the next budget we don't know yet.
If it should be shown that the situation at the political level changes and politicians should be more willing to save, this could last until 2010.
But I am not leaving from such a change," he said.
Grown debt
The debt of the government is attributable to the debt of the government and is, above all, due to the rise of deficits in the state budget.
The public debt shall be financed by payments, government debt transfers, direct loans or, for example, by loans from the European Investment Bank.
This year's domestic debt rose to 719.4 billion dollars.
The foreign debt of the state is now about 1.7 billion dollars to 123.3 billion.
The so-called marketable state debt reached the end of September 803.3 billion dollars and fell by 13.7 billion since June.
The average incidence of state debt rose to 6.5 years.
"The total debt rose over the year from the first to the third quarter by 13 percent, which is really much in view of how good the economy is.
It is interesting that the increase is to be recorded, especially in debt transactions, where the increase is 20 per cent.
It is bad that debt increases, but on the other hand this shows that you can do something before the pension reform comes," Pikora commented on the data.
Better Than Expected
The funding strategy and the treatment of government debt for 2007 suggest that the government had planned to raise $159.2 billion for this year.
At the beginning of December, however, the Ministry reduced its budget to EUR 152.8 billion by the better development of the State budget policy.
This amounts mainly from the government budget deficit, which is expected to reach $76 billion this year instead of the estimated 91.3 billion.
It is also a maximum planned funding for the consolidation agency of SEK 13.3 billion, a ten-billion reserve for the payment of interest, the financing of State debt transactions for 43 billion and for loans to the European Investment Bank of 1.8 billion.
Because she gave a name to a Teddy bear, she was brought before a court in Khartum today.
According to her lawyer, the British teacher who was charged with Islam in the Sudan was sentenced on Thursday evening by a court in Khartum to 15 days' imprisonment and subsequent resignation.
The British was charged with allowing six-to seven-year-old students to give a Teddy bear the name Mahomet, although every representation of the Islamic prophet is prohibited.
She deserved to be cured.
After the parents of students repeatedly complained at the Sudanese Ministry of Culture, the 54-year-old primary school teacher who was working at the Unity High School of Khartum was arrested on Sunday at home and charged under Article 125 of the Sudanese Penal Code for the abuse of Islam.
In fact, this issue takes its beginning in September when the teacher urges her six-to seven-year-old students to choose a name for the classenddy.
The children proposed eight names, including Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed , told school leader Robert Boules.
Finally, when the class agrees, 20 of 23 children choose Mohammed as favorite names.
Of course, Mohammed is the name of the Islamic Prophet, but above all a very common name in Sudan.
Next the children have created a book for the class, with the photo of the bear on it and the photograph My name is Mohammed .
The bear itself did not bear this name, but the problem is quite simple that the representation of the Islamic prophet is considered to be a violation of Islam.
One of the Muslim colleagues of Gillian Gibbons, who taught at the same school in Sudan, explained that he knew her well, and she had never done anything to bring her into contact with a religious belief, I only regret that she had prayed to the children to vote for a name, which she thought was just an innocent mistake.
An opinion that is shared by many students of the teacher who describe them as very careful with their students and as a person who never speaks about religion in class.
It was thought that the first name Mohammed is also the second most frequently given name in Britain for the 14 different letters in English.
This name, often chosen by Muslim families, is used as a kind of honor offering to the prophets (it is often given to the first-born of a family).
But how do the rules apply to the use of this name?
For example, can you give him a play car?
This is of course a question of interpretation.
On Wednesday at the last negotiating session in Vienna, there was no agreement on the future status of the province.
At the end of the failure
The Serbs and Albanians from Kosovo have ended their sixth and last discussion session on Wednesday morning in Baden, Austria without being able to overcome their controversy over the future status of the separatist province.
It is regrettable that the parties could not agree on the status , said European Ombudsman Wolfgang Ischinger at a press conference in Vienna.
Stressing that peace in the region is at stake, his American counterpart, Frank Wilsner Belgrade and Pristina, called for the fulfilment of their obligations for peace and continued discussions about the end of the negotiations.
No violence will be expected in the immediate future, but we are at the beginning of a very difficult time , he added and indicated that there are significant tensions.
End of the communication on 10 December
The representatives of Troika, which join the European Union, the United States and Russia, will meet for the last time on Monday in Serbia and Kosovo.
The future of the Province of Albanian-speaking 90% could be clarified if Ishinger, Wilsner and Russian mediaman Alexander Botsane-Khartchenko submitted their report to the UN Security Council by 10 December.
The talks of Baden, near Vienna, formed the sixth and last negotiating session since the last August of the UNO's Troika, had been commissioned to be a new medium.
Americans and Europeans shall count on the end of their mediation mission on 10 December.
The Russians who have already blocked the ratification of Kosovo's independence to the Security Council are in addition to continuing negotiations on this date.
Russia was and remains the speaker of a negotiated solution, an acceptable solution, said Botsane-Khartchenko.
A unilateral declaration of independence?
After Kosovo has been under UN administration for eight years, the Western countries maintain independence under the supervision of the EU for the only solution to the future.
Pristina is ready to make this announcement on the one hand if the Security Council should not decide on their own interests.
Belgrade stands on stronger autonomy
Unfortunately no agreement could be reached , the president of the autonomous authority of Kosovo, Fatmir Sejdiu, informed the hotel in Baden where these negotiations have been conducted since Monday.
Hashim Thaci, former leader of the Kosovo rebels and future Prime Minister of the province, shared his experience.
However, he added that the proposed plan for the autonomy of a past that led to murders and deportations by Belgrade .
Left-Effect
Serbian President Boris Tradic was of the opinion that a compromise should always be sought, and the Albanian majority from Kosovo warned of the consequences of a unilateral declaration of independence of the province.
Belgrade believes that there is a particularly "domini effect" in a region that is still so weak by the wars of the 90s.
For Serbia, this does not mean that a compromise would be impossible, he said.
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation stated that each decision would be made by one and only in the Security Council, where their Russian allies had a veto right.
The Parliament of Kosovo will have the last word
Only a decision from the Security Council ranks is acceptable for Serbia , Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica said.
These negotiations have lasted two years.
They must end up as they began: in the Security Council.
The journalist Fatmir Sejdiu replied that the Parliament of Kosovo will have the last word on the status , adding that each unilateral declaration of independence from the Albanian-speaking population will be issued in accordance with the Western countries.
Bush draws an agreement between Israel and Palestinians
At the opening of the International Peace Conference held on Tuesday under its leadership in Annapolis, Maryland, President Bush announced that Israel and Palestinians had finally joined a joint declaration.
He further stated that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas had agreed to start negotiations immediately to find a final settlement of the 60 years of old conflicts between their two peoples.
In connection with the two men Bush promised that he would do everything to help them conclude a peace treaty before the end of 2008.
Meanwhile, the Palestinians must destroy the terrorist infrastructure and Israel must set up its colonization work, Bush stated that he reminded the two parties of their obligations in relation to the road plan for the peace they agreed on in 2003.
The head of the White House stressed that the negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian occupation under Abbes would aim for a peace treaty that would clarify all open issues without exception, including central issues .
This name includes the three serious problems that mainly affect the conflicts between Israel and the Palestinians: the future borders of Palestine, the state of Jerusalem and the fate of the Arab refugees who were expelled from their home in the conflict of 1948, which is in the state of Israel today.
After the American Presidents took the floor, Abbas said that the future negotiations would be comprehensive and thorough and would provide a solution for all points, including Jerusalem, the refugees, the borders, the colonies, water and security.
As Olmert accepted the word on his side, he committed himself to conducting the coming arms standstill negotiations directly and without interruption and that he would try to end them before the end of 2008.
Bush has set the deadline for the implementation of his vision of two states , a Palestinian and an Israeli who are next to each other for the end of 2008.
Saudi Arabia has stated that Bush has received a guarantee in this sense from Bush before it decided to participate in the conference.
Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis was a great success for Washington, led by a plan taken by all Arab countries, which Israel offers peace, in exchange for its return from all Arab territories occupied during the 1967 war, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis represents a path in the history of the Middle East, especially since it attacks the roots of the conflict and its central points of view, the Saudi-Arab prince in his interview with the Saudi-Montenegro-financed Arabic daily newspaper.
According to the state attorneys, the police are not responsible
What exactly happened on Sunday?
As always in this type of local news, official versions and reports are against.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the first results of the findings of the National Police Disciplinary Authority (IGPN), on Sunday, shortly after 17 hours, a police car was on the Rue Louise-Michel direction of Villaries-le-Bel.
He had no use, but he was on strike, and walked 40-50 km/h, without blue light, explained a speaker of the police.
A green bike of the Kawasaki brand, without permission, so not released for public traffic (see below), came, driven by two young people without helmets, with a very high speed.
It turned the left side of the police car, after its procedure had been wrong by the right, a police officer further stated.
The alcohol control carried out on vehicle passengers is very negative.
The condition of the vehicle (failed cot flight, broken windscreens, abandoned stoppers) is evidence of the intensity of the spring.
Very soon, early this morning, the state lawyer of the Republic of Pontoise, Marie-Thérèse de Givry, announced that she had entrusted the IGPN with an investigation into "the facts of the involuntary killing of persons and the lack of assistance to persons at risk", in accordance with Val-d`Oise's lead for public security.
On the afternoon, due to a press conference, the state attorney stated that it excluded the disclosure of IGPN at this stage of police responsibility.
According to the Magistrate, three witnesses of the accident that were heard on Sunday evening confirmed the police version, namely that this small force wheel has reached their left side relatively quickly.
Yesterday there was a sort of rolling, certainly caused by the rolling of the stairs on the ground that the two vehicles were left standing together until the police created it.
Vehicles have been seized and will be subject to technical observation.
The name of the two victims was given yesterday.
What happened next?
Yesterday, in Villaries-le-Bel, a hunger ran high, so the police had left the accident very quickly, and that without the help of the two young people.
Although the IGPN remains quite cautious, it would also exclude any serious errors.
As a result of a police source, this is a difficult aspect of the findings which are necessary for further investigations and which must be carried out very carefully.
Liberation has hit an eye mark of these few moments shortly after the accident.
From one of his windows he had a direct look at the scene.
We're going out to try to live her again with my cousin, the nurse in the hospital, tells this witness.
There was nothing to do.
Then he saw a totally destroyed police officer who was lying.
Two more tried to live one of the young people again , the fourth phoned .
In view of the tension that quickly shaped the incident and it seems to be because of the uncertainty that the present people had about the unexpected situation of the young people, the police officers of colleagues who had been in the accident were taken into the car.
Still following this testimony, the rescue forces arrived about twenty minutes after the police left.
They have also used heart masses, but they have failed.
I will not allow it to be claimed that the police had not been able to help the young people.
You used this young man's first help.
The firefire is coming right away.
It was done to try to save her, stressing the state attorneys on her side.
In Pakistan, tension is increasing
On Monday, the Pakistani police destroyed the first demonstrations, since two days before General Mustarraf was called out of the emergency.
As a result, there were approximately 2,000 lawyers in Lahore, the city of East of the country, who demonstrated their opposition to the measures taken in the context of the emergency.
Those were armed with stones they had wounded the police.
At least 350 lawyers were provisionally arrested.
Similar scenarios occurred in Karachi and Ravalpindi, where police lawyers attacked and injured.
Several would be provisionally adopted.
In Islamabad, the prosecutors of the Supreme Court’s administration have called for a general strike and announced demonstrations as a result of a wave of approximately 500 arrests by opposition, human rights defenders and lawyers during the weekend.
Monday morning, the streets leading to the Supreme Court were closed to prevent the assembly.
Further demonstrations had been held in Multitan (Mitte) and Peshawar (Northeast).
On Monday, the lawyer movement received support from religious parties united in the powerful alliance Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal, whose president urged the people to send flowers to the judges who had spoken against the emergency, and those who have made an eid before Musharraf.
Musharraf's promises are no longer valid
The Supreme Court of Pakistan is directly affected by the special measure announced on Saturday evening.
In the following days, he had to refer to the legality of President Musharrafs again in a direct election on 6 October.
The President of the Court of Justice, Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, was found and dissolved.
All that we represent is illegal, anti-constitutional and contrary to the decisions of the Supreme Court , the Master of the newspaper The News.
Pervez Musharrafs promised to issue an order on the army and to become a civil president no longer applicable since the call for emergency, the Deputy Minister for Information Tariq Azeem said on Monday.
It was expected that he would issue his military uniform until 15 November, the date on which his first term of office would end.
The Deputy Minister for Information has also confirmed that the elections could be moved from January.
In addition, the Pakistani government condemned the country's sincere complaints that President Musharraf had received a place of residence from his deputy commander.
No more than one third of pregnancy is planned
This calculation takes into account the unwanted pregnancy (24%), as well as the ill-planned or unforeseen births.
Also today, 40 years after the adoption of the Newworth Act, which allowed the prohibition of receiving in France, one of three pregnant women (36%) is not planned, as a study by the National Institute for Demographic Studies (Ined) shows.
This calculation takes into account the unwanted pregnancy (24%), as well as the ill-planned or unforeseen births.
The Inde estimates that the different methods of the reception ban, such as the pill or spirals, still show a deficit ratio of 5-6%.
According to the Institute, the percentage of pill users between 20 and 40 years of age who use pills has increased from 5% in 1970 to 60% in 1970, however, the liberalisation of the contraceptive has allowed a better control of fertility.
In any case, eight of ten births are carefully planned today.
At one of five couples even calculated exactly on the month, and, if possible, in the morning, the age at which it seems most pleasant to have a child.
Spectacular repair at the space station
Astronaut Scott Parazynski and his cameras from the possession of the International Space Station (ISS) will have been spent more than seven hours in the world to perform the spectacular repair of a defective solar collector that is indispensable for the continuation of scientific work at the station.
A waiting step, which has achieved several records due to its duration, the removal of residential modules, the speed with which it was organized, and the tools built by the astronauts to carry out repair.
The problem arises on Wednesday when the astronauts have downloaded the module Harmony from the spacecraft Discovery, a large silver-shaped part that will soon take up European and Japanese scientific laboratories.
This module is a sort of landing bridge for the module labs.
But you have to be able to take care of them with electricity.
The second task of the crew was to implement a 17.5 tonnes heavy module for electricity generation over solar collectors already located on the ISS in order to put it in its final position.
After moving it, the crew was restructured by the solar collectors of the module, whose voltage was 76 metres.
And then it happened that one of the collectors who let themselves fall like accordion was damaged by a wire hung over a length of about a meter.
The restructuring was stopped in order not to damage the collector anymore.
The astronauts who originally left the spacecraft Discovery for a check-in and then another solar collector whose rotation system was missing should be repaired, forced to appoint the damaged collector.
And Scott Parazynski was chosen to travel back to carry out the repair at the end of the 30 meters long-distance arm of the spacecraft at which the station was stationed.
He's one of NASA's best space walkers.
Large, resistant, very sent, he has a well-developed upper body and long arms.
So the 46-year-old doctor was chosen to operate the last solar collector .
After paying close attention to the damage, he removed the wrong cable and confirmed a kind of radiation on the damaged site.
He was supported by a second spacewalker who remained near the castle, and, inside, by the other astronauts, among them Peggy Whitson, Commander of the crew.
The tool he used to turn a mini hockey trigger into an insulator to prevent the astronomers at the station's table from detecting and bulging the solar collectors who made hundreds of volts.
When the action was over, Scott Parazynski waited until the collector was fully removed before he counted his tools and returned to the station.
Last afternoon the astronauts enjoyed half a day of relaxation before the seven astronauts returned to the spacecraft Discovery, which was expected to take the flight back to the earth.
The title of the EADS assigned to the bear
After the air traffic and defence group has announced that it will have to be issued between EUR 1,2 and EUR 1.4 billion in order to counter the A400M withdrawals, the EADS action currently shows a significant decline in the Paris stock exchange.
At present, EADS loses 4% to 21.96 euros in the Paris Börse.
The group was forced to review its business forecasts for 2007 once again with reference to the delays caused by the slow development of the A400M engine which delay the flight of the aircraft.
The costs announced in October to compensate for the delay in the delivery of their military transport aircraft are between EUR 1,2 and EUR 1.4 billion, including more than one billion for Airbus , announced by the mother companies of the European manufacturer EADS.
As a result of these costs, EADS will be forced to announce new operating targets (EBIT) for 2007 when it presented its quarterly results, without further details.
The Group also notes that the assessment of the new costs is linked to the six-month reduction.
To remember, the business performance of EADS fell by 86% in 2006, due to the delay of another programme, which is linked to the very large A380 aircraft.
The group originally planned a first delivery of A400M to the French army for October 2009.
The selection rectangle
On Sunday it will not be exciting to select the Urns: the mass of the Russians will be decided for President Putin's Party, United Russia.
After a very repressive election, it confirms its efforts for stability, even for authoritarianism.
Three days before the parliamentary elections, Russian President Vladimir Putin addressed a message to the voters who have already been registered, but whose content will be kept secret.
He does this in his capacity as a top candidate for the United Kingdom, the Pro-Kreml Party, for which he announces an overwhelming victory.
Yesterday, the President had nothing to look at when he received the foreign emissaries, and he was satisfied to deliver a new point of attack against the Western powers charged with emigrating - his favorite topic during the election.
We know the price of true democracy and hope for fair choices, extremely transparent and open, elections without fraud, he added.
From the point of view of the opposition they have gone away.
She is preparing for an election struggle that is under pressure.
Communist leader Guennadi Ziouganov says that it had never given such ugly choices, not even in the time of Eltsin.
After the printing of the demonstrations last week, Gary Kasparovder was sentenced to five days' imprisonment for ex-Schachwelt Master for unauthorized demonstrations, according to his lawyer.
The Russians have preserved the mentality of the Homo Sovietus
Following these parliamentary elections without delay, two further questions are raised:
Who is Putin's successor to the president?
The Official Journal announced yesterday the date of the first election of the presidential elections on 2 March 2008; the candidates had time until 23 December to make themselves known.
Since he was elected 2000 and was re-elected in 2004, Vladimir Putin cannot be represented for a third term.
And now there's no successor.
What role will Putin play after March?
Prime Minister?
Will the Government and the President be elected as President of Parliament and of the United Kingdom of Russia?
Whatever the case may be, either in Parliament or in the presidential elections, the power so far will be triumphed.
That's tradition.
The Russians have preserved the mentality of the Homo Sovietus, they are not the Lord of their destiny, meaning sociologist Lev Goldkov, director of the independent center of Levada.
Historian Nikolai Kopossov of the State University of St. Petersburg goes on to go back: the civil society in this country, which has been Christianized to Europe for five centuries, has only developed very slowly; the famous Community spirit has delayed the development of individuality.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s, Putin again referred to the model of a patriarchal state, which was fully adopted by the population, more so as this new patriarchalism did not follow terrorism, but a certain economic prosperity, Maria Lipman of the Carnegie Foundation.
Today, the Russians from free parts ignore the personal responsibility they have placed shortly after the fall of the UdSSR.
How long will it last?
This phenomenon concerns all social affairs, including the business world.
And the administrative committee understands to maintain the status quo: 65 Governors (of 85 Russian regional presidents) present the local electoral lists of the United Kingdom.
The new freedoms that come from the West are often as significant as Chaos in the 1990s.
The general public prefers stability.
In this sense the Russians are not even voting for the extremist parties.
Conclusion by Tamara Tcherednitchenko, a 54-year-old professor: How long has it been?
Those in power are not so evil, why then do they turn away?
A Hard Mind
After being treated confidentially for more than 60 years, the Nazi archives of Bad Arolsen, which document the massacres of 17.5 million victims of the Hitler regime, are now freely available.
The 47 million documents of the archive, which have been submitted for a total of 27 km in Bad Arolsen, have not been included until now, whether with a humanitarian purpose, so individually and by name, so on the request of a former victim or of its members.
In May 2006, the eleven States - including Germany, France, Israel and the United States - agreed to make them available for researchers and historians.
After the ratification process has been completed, the opening has been valid since yesterday.
High Information
The access of the historian to Bad Arolsen will allow research to be carried out, in particular on the deportations of prisoners, concentration camps and the health status of forced workers, Reto Masters, director of this archive managed by the International Committee of the Red Cross (CICR).
Until recently, several countries, including Germany, have been able to make these so-called documents available to the public in view of the nature of certain information.
For example, the alleged homosexuality or the spiritual disorder of some deportation victim.
After the war, the concentration camp or the prison orders issued by the Gestapo were brought together for a practical reason: to find civilians who were deported or forced to work, and to provide them with evidence of their detention, if possible, in order to establish their way of undoing.
In Bad Arolsen more than 300 personal requests are still being processed today.
However, part of the scientific community shows only a limited interest in accessing Bad Arolsen.
There is no basis for expecting any new information in these documents, Mr. Wolfgang Benz, director of the Research Centre for Anti-Semitism at the University of Berlin, 2006.
The EU and India want to reach a free trade agreement in 2008.
The trade between India and Europe is already reaching 60 billion euros a year.
The EU is India's main trading partner and generates 18% of its external trade.
European Trade Minister Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart, Kamal Nath, suggested that the European Union and India hope to sign a free trade agreement in 2008.
The EU Foreign Ministers had given green light to the European Commission last April to open negotiations with a view to signing Free Trade Agreements (ALE) with India, South Korea and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean).
The EU is India's first trading partner and generates 18% of its foreign trade.
The EU is also its first foreign investor, but according to the numbers of the European Commission, India is only the EU's ninth trading partner.
A free trade agreement will lead to a huge rise in the two economic spaces and India would improve its access to a market of 450 million well-being Europeans , Peter Mandelson confirmed.
Europe is the first or second market for the ten most frequently exported products in India, the European Commissioner further stated that Asian and European giants exchange goods annually worth EUR 47 billion and services worth 10 billion this week, Danielle Smadja, President of the European Commission's approach to New Delhi, explained and regretted that the potential of trade has not yet been exhausted. The EU and India will be present on Friday at their eighth diplomatic meeting in New Delhi, with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and the President of the European Commission José Manuel Durao Barrosso.

The Bank of England accepts the loan for knowledge and offers 10 billion dollars for five weeks
On Thursday, the Bank of England was concerned about reducing the current revolving claim on credit terms and announced a bid of ten billion dollars with a basic rate of 5.75% for five weeks, an offer with unusual duration.
In order to reduce the fears caused by the conditions on the financial market at the end of the year, and to give the banks greater certainty about the way in which they are to organise their liquidity positions at this time, the Bank intends to provide a significant part of its savings during the delivery phase which begins on 6 December in the form of an open market operation for five weeks , it shall be provided in a communication.
The Bank further states that on 6 December, around 12.15 GMT 10 billion (EUR 14 billion) will be put into circulation for the basic tax rate and only until 10 January.
This seems to be the first time that the BoE in an open market operation carries out liquidity for five weeks.
This usually happens for a week.
The BoE adds in its Communication that it intends to take further steps to obtain the different rates of interest of interbank loans from day to day by day with its basic rate.
The difference between bank interest rate was 5,829% on Wednesday from day to day.
The three-month rate has risen to 6.6%, somewhat higher since 18 September.
Since the beginning of the financial crisis in the summer, the sums brought into circulation by the Bank of England have been linked to tax charges which the banks have maintained to claim.
According to certain reports, strengthened by the development of the fund-raising course in contrast to the euro, many proposed to sign for the sums brought into circulation by the European Central Bank to benefit from interest rates and with safe discretion.
UMP and NC will allow it to examine the proposals of the PS for purchasing power
On Thursday, the UMP and Nouveau Centre groups refused to discuss the articles of the Socialist legislative proposal on purchasing power, which is a reflection of the text.
The text created in the framework of a socialist network (meeting on the initiative of a parliamentary group) introduced about 10 measures adopted by the National PS Committee on Wednesday, most of which were 50% for employment wages, the re-introduction of the TIPP fleet, a transport check or the rental of the rents.
After the UMP and NC voted against the examination of the article (180 votes against 115), the sitting was closed after the main discussion, which resulted in partial exchanges of words between majority and opposition, a few hours before Nicolas Sarkozy's television share on purchasing power.
The director of PS Jean Marc Ayralt announced that his group would present the whole of its proposals as an amendment to the legislative draft for financial correction which was examined last week by the Assembly.
A new festival will be born
Following numerous reports of the creation of a new music festival in Philadelphia by C3 presentations, the promoter/producer announces the Vienna Music Festival in New Jersey, in collaboration with the British producer Melvin Benn Festival.
It is an honor for our company to work with a person who, no longer or less, has served as an example for the current festival movement in America, Charlie Jones from C3 shared with Billboard.com.
C3 organizes the Lollapalooza Festival in Chicago and the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland, New Jersey, is a summer destination for camping.
The festival will probably take place from 8-10 August on a 500 Acre large private farm about 40 minutes away from Philadelphia.
The director of Festival Republic Melvin Benn, formerly known as Mean Fiddler, is one of the world's most famous festivals.
In 1989 he took over the leadership of the Reading Festival in the United Kingdom, which attracted 80,000 people annually.
In 1999, Melvin Benn added his portfolio to the Leeds Festival, and then, in 2006, the Festival Republic created the Latitude Festival in Henham Park in Suffolk.
Since 2002, Melvin Benn has also worked as a co-owner for the production of licence concessions and organizational tasks of the Glassonbury Festival, which can take up to 177,500 people on average.
Charlie Jones of C3, who describes glassbury as the most inspiring event he's ever had, says that his company and Melvin Benn work together to offer a festival event in European style.
We have chosen Philadelphia as a market and work closely with the Fairmount Park Commission to create a festival in the city centre of Philadelphia, Charlie Jones.
We held negotiations in the city and the Commission were motivated and excited about this project.
Unfortunately, we have remained behind in political debates with regard to the current administration, Charlie Jones continues.
"Happyly we were able to discuss with Melvin Benn and we are preparing to create a great festival in an extraordinary place that will finally benefit the population."
C3 Presents has revived the Lollapalooza festival in 2005 in the Great Park Chicago after it was re-elected in 2002 with the Austin City Limits Music Festival in the festival world.
In 2007, both events have been able to achieve $9.8 million and $1 11.8 million on gross tax days.
These two festivals take place in urban areas.
"The European model of Melvin Benn is a rural festival, where the unsanitary people are more likely to take place in the urban areas," says Charlie Jones.
"The aim is, in one way or another, to mix these two concepts together in order to bring together at the same time the impression of a rural festival in the European and a urban way in the US."
Vienna is about half-way between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
"The Community of Vineland, including the Mayor, takes over this event with joy," says Charlie Jones.
Finally, it allows to appreciate the terms of the agreement, but it confirms that "they are quite interesting to invest in such an event and to hold a festival that is expected to have a long life."
Charlie Jones says the recording capacity of the festival is "very large" in about 80,000 people at the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee.
He says that the invitations were sent to the groups, but that nothing could be confirmed when they were printed.
"Vinland will offer delicious rock, but music will be very diverse, in the hope of attracting all kinds of viewers," says Charlie Jones.
His partners of C3, who received the Top Independent Promotion Prize for the last ballboard Touring Awards, are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.
Montreal is on the terminal.
It is not easy to get the main platform for Hollywood films to Montreal if it is not less than the terminal.
These lock tests are part of the delegated tasks.
A political "heikles mandate" because of the governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, who calls "Runaway Productions".
Is it difficult to negotiate with the Governor?
"You must be careful because it's the industry that decides where it goes.
If she finds that the conditions in Montreal are affordable, she will go there.
Our role is to offer the best for the best," he says.
The run on the festival.
For Denis Turcotte, however, there is currently the highest priority of the Chinese.
The hunt for the Oscars has begun.
At all festivals at the West Coast, regardless of Sundance, which is from Denver, Seattle or San Francisco, it will be necessary to present the films from Quebec to evaluate them and ensure that the producers have interviews.
The dark age of the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival had a successful presentation a few weeks ago.
He will be presented at the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake hands with the Devil is on the poster in Santa Monica and will be presented on the 30th Star of Denver Film Festival in November.
This month Quebec also presented four long and four short films at the American Film Institute.
Is the bear a year-old rally before? Unanimity in the experts due to the US hypothetical crisis
With almost five weeks to the end of the year, the investors are already moving their hands towards the coming end of the year.
However, experts cannot create secure forecasts in this regard.
Banif believes that it is statistically considered that the month of December usually runs on the bridge with a positive market development
However, it is not advisable to create short-term forecasts and only on the basis of statistics. In particular, it is not when serious tensions determine the current market situation.
While other experts do not have such a strong price rise in the last weeks of the year, they note that the exchange rate is determined by the given liquidity of the market and the market participant. These are mainly invested due to the lack of a secure share fund in interest funds which is strongly affected by the current trend towards the value-added assets.
As a result, in the opinion of these experts, the stock exchanges will be shown more later, with market fluctuations, especially since we cannot yet assess the extent of the possible decline in the interest rate of the US notation bank, a uncertainty that is mainly due to the rise in the price of crude oil and the risk of rising inflation rates.
Javier Barrio, president of the sales department at BPI in Spain, agrees that it is a waiting time to announce a prosperous market-Rally.
The chances are not very good , the expert assures.
The Spanish stock index Ibex has already lost a 4 % value since its peak mark on 8 November of 15.945.7 points.
But not all experts share the same negative opinion.
According to Juan Solana, an analyst at Intermoney, the Ibex 35 could, as a result of the restructuring of the investment fund and the traditional, year-on-year interest rate allocation, resulting in nearly 16,000 points a year.
However, the expert has pointed out that this year things could develop differently, especially due to the fact that it was already in the second week of December, and therefore directly after the day of the constitution, which took place at the end of the year.
According to the analyst, price changes would not affect market trends.
Following an assessment by Federico Olucha, an analyst at the Bank Invers, the previous market assessments were at almost technical level, which could lead to a discrepancy between the index values, which could at first be attributed to the consequences of the US mortgage market crisis.
The analyst is confident that these are positive.
When selecting the values to move the Ibex to a new maximum, analysts agree.
Solana by Intermoney means this year the big values are on the line.
The experts would count the two large banks and some real estate companies as the electricity sector would be expensive at the time given.
At the same time, Federico Olucha assures the Bank of Inversis that the advances will be made in connection with the banking and industrial sector.
If the Rally actually happens, real estate companies will benefit from it.
The ACS has been on hold for the past few months and we hope that other real estate companies such as Ferrovial and FCC will attack the same path, as the expert said.
With regard to increased consumption during the Christmas day, the market share will be determined in the last half of the year.
On the other hand, the expert believes that technologies will also achieve positive consumer performance even if they are only represented in a small number on the Spanish market.
Five times in seven years
In the last seven years, December showed only two declines in course.
At the end of 2003, the technology blast led to this from its crisis and began at the same time the last real end-year rally.
This year, in which Ibex 35 stood on 28.17 percentage points, a rate increase of 668% was observed in December.
Whether 2008 will be followed by the fifth winning year (the Ibex has risen by 8.36% since January) and can also show an end-year rally will appear.
Popular will open its 200 credit institutions from Monday to Friday at 12 hours a day.
Popular has decided to modernise a large part of his branches.
In total, 200 of these are located in the most powerful regions of Spain.
For the institution operating under the brand name Popular Max, these discounts mean a large milestone.
But also for the rest of the Spanish institutions, since Popular as the first banking group represents the leap to extend the opening hours of his branches to 20.30 a.m. and to set a total day from 10 a.m. to 20.30 a.m..
The BBVA Banking Group, which has also repeatedly abandoned the extension of its opening times in the Netherlands, has not yet adopted a definitive decision.
The current Bank's negotiations with the trade unions seem to be intended to reach an agreement with 75% of all branches every day and open for it on a Sunday afternoon, even if it is not for the customer.
If other banks join the new initiative that adapts to the opening times, then the values of the Popular Bank will depend on their experience.
And that's exactly what the popular is following with its project.
The aim is to extend the opening times of those branches which can, because of their position, acquire the purchasing knowledge of their own, small and medium-sized enterprises, but also those of large purchase houses.
The Bank wants to open the new 200 branches over the next 18 months, as it is not new but changed opening times.
For this purpose, the Bank will restructure the premises of the discounts already located in business areas and will at the same time match the individual customer profile of the different zones.
In this way, the expansion of the opening times will be linked to a new space design of the branches, which is characterized by a more modern colourless design.
The competent bank representative, Ángel Rivera, ensures that restructuring does not require any greater investment, but with increased staffing, as a branch now needed no more than six but eight or nine employees.
The discounts even equipped with additional space for SMEs will not be sold for financial products.
A positive experience for the group
Popular has already tried his concept and nine branches in Madrid.
And the values of experience seem positive, says Angel Rivero.
The discounts of the streets Bravo Murillo, O’Donnel and Gran Vía have been chosen for what seemed to be a bad decision.
Popular currently leads approximately 2500 discounts.
And 60 more operate under the name Mundocredit. These are specialized in immigrants and also show extended opening times, even on Sundays and holidays.
In these branches of PopularMax the model of BBVA is not used because most of them are offered a wide selection of non-financial services for sale.
We do not want to show any competition for our customers, Rivero explains.
With telephones they have reached agreement in advance to sell their mobile phone with external banking staff.
The Spanish private Telecinco doubles its value for the first time and thus exceeds its rival Antena 3.
We got it.
With this set, the business leader of Telecinco, Paolo Vasile, was able to meet his satisfaction at the closure of the drill. The sender led by him had increased his value about his double rival Antena 3.
However, one aspect impressed his joy: that is exactly what hurt me; not that we had a higher growth, but that we had less losses, he determined.
He stressed that despite the weak market, they did not fall too deep.
Telecinco ended yesterday with a plus 2.54%.
This profit reduces its annual losses by 15.66%.
According to Bloomberg, the company's value is now reaching EUR 4.488.88 million, with media control of the capital's main share (52%), and Vocento is only participating with 13%.
The Rivala Antena 3 lost 1,52 percentage points yesterday and has been reporting a total loss of 40.5% since January so that its market value goes on half.
However, the market value of other marketed communications companies is rising; in the case of Sogecable, in the case of 3,571 million, in the case of Prisa (issuer of Cinco Días magazine), in the case of Sogecable, in the case of 1,779 million.
The comparison with Antena 3 is possible from the fact that it is about two similar companies, according to Vasile.
The question of how far we can actually act in cash is still unknown, what price we can make at customer level, and how we can make it more marketable.
Telecinco declared his plan to increase this year to the first television broadcaster with more than 1,000 million gross profits from advertising revenue. This guaranteed Guiseppe Tringali, the business leader of Telecinco and Publiespaña, the advertising company of the group.
If the project should be implemented, the sender would increase its advertising revenues by 3.6% from the previous year compared to 965.4 million.
In the case of Antena 3, the net rate rose by 1.6% in the first nine months of pregnancy (up to 734.4 million), while net income from the television business could only rise by 0.7% (630.4 million ).
The main factor for the best drilling process of Telecinco is the analysis of the high payout ratio that the company was able to show up to this point: in 2006 the company led by Alejandro Echevarría carried out a 100-percent dividend protection.
However, Vasile ensures that after buying 33% of the shares of Endemol, with mediaset as a parent company, the ratio could still vary, even if it is too early for official recognition.
We are obliged to pay at least 50% of the shares, even if we have said so much more.
I hope that we will be able to satisfy our shareholders this year, whose share values we have already been able to increase by buying 33% of the final share.
According to the analysts, the market currently shows certain losses.
Lehmann Brothers recently reduced his profit calculation at Telecinco for this year by 4% and 7% for 2009.
This is the result of a reduction in the projected growth rate, which will be reduced from 10.5% to 8.4% in 2008 and from 5.5% to 5.1% in 2009.
This also raised the expected profit calculation of Antena 3 for 2008 by 4.5% and 7.5% for 2009.
3 Options.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Ibersecurities: focus on its high efficiency and its sustainable potential and therefore recommends the purchase of both shares.
Two.
Caja Madrid: lost Telecinco (purchase) due to multiple incentives and the prosperous market a more favourable position with an antenna 3 (keep).
3.
JPMorgan: it is recommended to restore expectations in both cases in view of similar threats (increased market and worse economic climate)
The Congress agrees with the MIFID Directive which entered into force on 1 November.
In parallel to Parliamentary training, which ended today with the Congress's decision in the Senate on the draft additional/reformal proposals, the Government published the provisions of the new law with the aim of enabling the entry into force of both regulations by the end of the year.
The representatives of the various companies unanimously commended the efforts of the Congress and Senate officers who had pursued the objective in their negotiations and votes to establish the best possible arrangement to ensure the safety of investors and regulate individual business activities in order to guarantee such a general market situation.
The MIFID, which re-establishs the securities service regulation, will also continue to modernise the financial markets to improve the protection of investors, increase the regulatory requirements of the Spanish Securities Commission (CNMV) and promote cooperation between the various control authorities of the European Union.
The new Directive enables specialised companies as well as natural or legal persons to offer financial advice and also contributes to the establishment of new financial services companies (ESIS), consultancy companies which are associated with investment and transmission companies with securities.
In addition, it increases the number of financial transactions execution systems so that regulated reverse markets will be added to the multilateral trading systems and to the systems for internationalisation of trade contracts, which would end up in competition with the current economic operators.
The Law obliges investment firms, the focus of their company profile, the confrontation and the ways of dealing with risks on the market and all projects carried out to facilitate their control tasks by the CMMV.
The Commission for Economic Affairs of the Congress had made further changes in the near China, in which it decided that the debt transfer provided with titles should now be regarded as a complex financial asset by the US mortgage and bank crisis due to its high risk to investors. (US mortgage crisis)
In addition, the entry into force of the Directive on the legal integration of the working areas of diplomad economic scientists was used; 30 years after 1977, the Regulation which was restricted to the areas of work reserved for economic scientists was adopted.
On the other hand, the Senate established new positions in the financial sector, such as that the economic mediator working on foreign accounts does not require authorisation from the CNMV and can offer its services for the marketing of products and for the gain of customers at the same time more investment firms.
The harmonised consumer price index (VPI) is increased by five tenths in November and is now 4.1%.
The indicators for Eurostat’s assessment of inflation rates within the European Union provide the average price development in Spain, which took place in November.
Its publication complies with the principles of Eurostat and the European Central Bank (ECB), which, by providing data, requires a local and quality comparison to US products.
The forecast for the indicator can be made provisionally by using the same method as the harmonised consumer price index, but at the same time using other statistical modeling methods to estimate the information not available at the time of the calculation.
However, the Spanish Statistical Office (INE) concluded that the previously identified indicator should not only serve as a reference value and therefore do not agree with the final result announced on 14 December.
The consumer price index (VPI) will continue to remain at a relatively high level
Following the statement by the Deputy Head of Government and Economic and Financial Minister Pedro Solbes, the increase in GDP in November was a temporary development; while ensuring that the price index would remain at a relatively high level in the coming months.
However, Solbes pointed out in the halls of the Congress building that even if the current number is not good , Spain's inflation difference to the other members of the monetary union has remained more or less the same in recent years.
He also stated that there were fewer surprises in November than in the previous month, where the government did not count on such a high rise.
We expected a value of around 4% , the Minister for Economic and Financial Affairs announced today's forecast.
Virginia calculates over EUR 42 billion in the next three years with Northern Rock
The values of Northern Rock have fallen by more than half, after the Bank of mid-September of the past year had called on the British Notary Bank to make an emergency loan, and they are currently only $12,000 million (that is EUR 16,800 million).
At this time, the Bank's assets amount to $25,000 million, a sum that has been significantly reduced within two and a half months by the loss of customer confidence and despite the government's 100% guarantee that money will be safe until the end of the crisis.
The Virgin company, which would continue to run the group after the acquisition under the name of Virgin Money, has to invest about a quarter of the revenues of the British banks that will be collected there from the facilities for the next three years in order to buy exactly the 18 billion dollars needed to achieve their goal of 30 billion.
The Group of Multimillionaire Richard Branson, known for its outstanding advertising campaigns in the United Kingdom, intends to allow 50,000 million dollars (appropriate about 70 million euros) annually to fly in advertising and marketing campaigns to achieve its goal.
Northern Rock named this week the Virgin Group, where three other companies are still involved, as its preferred bidder to lead it out of insolvency.
The Mayor of Totana was arrested because of a common suspicion of involvement in urban corruption
This morning, the Spanish police arrested the current mayor of the town of Totano (Partido Popular), which belongs to the city of Murcia, because of the growing suspicion of urban corruption that was discovered this week.
In addition, one of the secretaries of the Community Council and the head of the Community police have been established.
José Martínez Andreo has been a member of the office of Juan Morales, who is now president of the Party Popular and at the same time President of the Council of Totana, and could be the original driver of the complex according to information provided by Cadena SER.
The officials continue to examine the Community's business documents and the Ministry of Urban Planning and do not shut down any further arrests in the coming hours.
In addition, the lawyer of Juan Morales was accused of chief suspects of urban corruption at the beginning of this week.
According to information from Cadena SER, the lawyer of the popular and therefore privileged MEP Juan Morales was appointed to leave his residence because of important binding documents that should be related to the conspiracy.
In addition, other sources of information from the common morale orders are reported to a Galician construction company, which provides for the conclusion of an urban contract in which the construction of a 200 hectares of large area was decided.
There are currently eight persons in the research department.
Bono agrees to accept the application of the PSOE in Toledo and, in the case of a voter, in Congress.
The former Defence Minister José Bono has accepted the offer of the President of the Government and Secretary-General of the Socialists, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, who will then present the list of PSOE candidates at the upcoming general elections in Toledo and, in the case of an election of the Socialists, who will take over the office of the President of the Congress.
So José Blanco, the PSOE's organization secretary, and Bono, announced at the press conference after a meeting with Zapatero at the party's headquarters today.
In the view of the Head of Government, the offer is justified by the former Minister, since it is important in politics to be able to count best and Bono is among the best.
In addition, in the case of a victory for the Socialists from the Mancha, it would appear that the president of the Congress for the Party would apply for the next election.
Bono would be replaced by Manuel Martín as president of Congress, who announced last November 15th that he would no longer participate in the next general elections to finish his career in public policy and instead use himself in the university area for climate protection.
The former Minister had to point out that since his return two years ago, the President of the Government had constantly insisted on his return to political affairs.
On the other hand, he stressed that the party, such as when appointing the Vice-Presidents for the economy, did not want to retain citizens who would take over the positions of the Presidents of the Congress in the event of a vote , and referred to this as an act of transparency .
If he should actually take over the office, he hopes to turn the room into a house of respect and not the humiliation or ridicule in order to make it seem more like to the citizens.
Unfortunately, from time to time you won the impression that the only place where you can't speak quietly in Madrid is the Congress, so the president of the Senate was interrupted up to 26 times.
At the same time, he commended current President Manuel Martín and his good work and pointed out that he did not want to raise the possibility of taking over the office, since otherwise his political opponents would call it arrogant.
Climaproganda
Since the climate debate undermines both the sceptics of climate change and those who have a social and political debate in this regard, it is necessary to put the movement together as a whole into a stronger context.
In particular, when it comes to a leader of the movement, as in the case of President Zapatero, the fight against climate change is more important than the fight against Islamic terrorism and even proposes to conclude a new treaty with the planet.
This proposal, however, makes it clear to him about the trade, or non-handling of his Government, which has contributed to the determination that Spain is within the EU at the top of the countries which have at least met the standards of the Kyoto Protocol.
Who are responsible for non-compliance with the standards on which sectors this should be carried out, and why has his Government, which had proposed the agreement with the planets, not stopped this development.
In addition, he is now forced to present to the Spanish citizens the measures he has taken against climate change without interference.
What companies are involved in changing the behaviour of citizens, what individual and collective savings must be taken, and what economic consequences are there?
Tell me exactly who must sacrifice and pay for the salvation of the planet.
However, it has and will not give such statements in the future.
It's just because it's about the sacrifice and the payment.
Because the measures that can be used against climate change are not popular.
They are expensive, uncomfortable and dangerous to the accounts of companies and citizens.
Even the petrol centre proposed by the PSOE seemed strategically elected Zapatero to the extent that he saw the pressure to resume the proposal.
It is therefore appropriate now to save the planet with nothing, so with pure propaganda and empty languages without any real consequences.
With impressive statements, the Commission, committees, protocols and new officials.
With its agreements with the planet, the other politicians must neither speak nor complain nor demand such appropriate policies for election campaigns, but rather follow the required expenditure, admire the meetings and admire others with their sense of well-being and good.
But this can only happen if the contract does not differ from its purely virtual nature and therefore does not imply that the bike will become the only means of moving in the future or that we can only refresh ourselves with a flag.
The mayor and police chief of Totana because of a common development in urban corruption.
The Guardia Civil has appointed the mayor of the town of Totana, the popular politician José Martínez Andreo. In addition, local police officers, the secretary of the mayor and a hotel entrepreneur were also taken into account because of the suspected urban destruction of Murcia.
The City Treaty was established at its residence from where it was taken to the Community and in its premises to this day, surrounded by many officials who were also involved in the city administration and the municipal construction of Suelo Industrial y Vivenda.
The three arrests are related to the past few months in Galicia, Murcia and Madrid, where more than 2 million hectares of unclosed construction projects are to be restructured under the direction of the Galician construction company Nuaria. These should build 4000 apartments after the local administration has reached illegal supplies during the last legislator period.
In addition, two other persons were not arrested directly, but an investigation procedure was followed by the first court of Totonas.
The first six arrests have been brought before the judge today.
According to media circles, it is also directed against the former Mayor of Totana and current independent PP member Juan Morales.
His ex-wife, owner of an real estate company registered in Totana, as well as his current friend living in Murcia, is still in doubt.
The president and holder of the Nuaria Group , which is from Vigo’s lawyer and entrepreneur Manuel N.A. , was appointed in the place of Nigrán (Pontevena), as well as the manager of Suelo de Imonauur Pablo José M.G. whose company is to be part of Nuaria and is to receive the money.
The findings are carried out by the municipal authorities against urban delictures, under the supervision of the central unit of the Guardia Civil, whose representatives carry out 11 further investigations in addition to the arrests, most of which are directly related to the arrests held in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rosas (Madrid) and Totana.
At this time, only one person was found in Totana: the owner of a regional known flying business, who is supposed to have acted as a middleman.
The construction group Nuaria was commissioned to build the largest residential complex of the area belonging to Murcia, which should include more than 5,000 apartments, a golf course and two Spa hotels.
The company acquired in Totana over 2.2 million square kilometers of land that it was supposed to build. The aim was to build a building project which would increase the population of the Community to 25,000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria Group includes other companies such as Autesa and Inomonauur that promote the sale of properties; Conyase, which operates in Vigo the parking places of Coruña, Venezuela and the Plaza Fernando el Católico; Hogartel, whose activity is limited to the direct market sector and Preconiza, specializes in the promotion, sale and installation of construction elements.
Things that can happen
I'm sorry.
If you agree with this, we will be separated from the expression Book of the month and instead try to find a price name other names with appropriate skills.
I already have a proposal.
People, life means change.
Of course, you are warmly invited to make your suggestions.
Two.
Our Finnish correspondent explains to us yesterday in the most important Finnish newspaper, Helsinki Sanomat, a comment (Finland is at the top of the PISA Study), which refers to the comment published in the same newspaper on 18 November; otherwise, on the day on which its issue contained the criticism of the book Blackburns.
The content of philosophy has become the subject of public debate after tragedy.
Responsible for the brutal murder is a Abiturian who quoted the works of Platons and Nietzsches in his news.
In an interview of the daily newspaper Helsinki Sanomat, the President of the Education Council for Philosophy, Pekka Elo, asked the teachers to adopt a more critical position against Plato and suggested that the teachings of Plato should be removed from the teaching plans for philosophy to Gymnasia.

A colleague informs about the illegal use of Internet downloads in the Penal Code:
A. The download of a song would be a violation of the law which would be dealt with in six months' time.
However, if you cancel a music business under a value of 400 euros, this applies only as a simple waste (Article 623.1).
B. If you move the business up to a value of 1000 euros, the table will still fall under the penalty less than one download (Article 234 of the Penal Code).
C. If you close a car and return it forty hours later, the penalty is still lower than in a download (Article 244.1).
D. It is less difficult to participate in a striker than in a music exchange.
To participate in a rebel coup, a prison sentence shall be three to 12 months after it (Article 154 of the Penal Code), while the exchange of data shall have a six-month period of up to two years.
(Article 270 of the Penal Code).
E. According to Article 184.2 of the Criminal Code, sexual harassment at work is considered less harmful than downloading a DVD film from the Internet.
F. The trade with copyright-protected films whose authorisation has not been granted by the author will be subject to a higher penalty than the distribution of pornographic material to minors (Article 186).
Well, if my colleague should have a right, then someone's demands have been pretty high.
4. (a) What does the Bible teach us?
My housewife gives me a long, rare research article entitled: Money leads to activating certain brain areas, especially when the others get more of it.
So the feelings arising from the monthly payment are dependent on the content of the colleagues.
The study was developed using a Tomographic Magnetic Reference Analysis at the University of Bonn, and the results were published in the latest issue of Science magazine.
After Bernd Webers, author of the study and director of the Bonner Hirnsungs Centre Life&Brain, the activation was the strongest when the participant had the right answers and its players broke down.
Researchers were able to recognize that brain activity was always very moderate when both participants made the right answer and therefore obtained the same content; but if one of them got it twice, it also became a stronger brain activity.
I am not quite sure whether it really takes so much scientific recovery to achieve such a result.
The Balkan State Guards
Carla del Ponte has been implicated in the crimes of the Balkans for eight years. Her office is in the State administration of the former Yugoslavia, based in La Haya.
Her mandate will be run at the end of the year and Carla will leave her office with a bright and smiling eye, as the chief officials of the Srebrenica Massacer - when the eight thousand Bosnian Muslims came to life - are still on their own, namely the former General Ratko Mladic and former Serbian leader Radovan Karadzic.
Her names are on the list that Marcel Schupbach, the director of the Swiss-born film La Liste de Carla (2006, not yet in Spain); a film that, at the time of a political thriller, followed the Swiss government's campaign from Belgrade to New York to raise the proceeds of crime and pressure the respective governments to reduce their networks.
What insurance is best for me?
The KFZ insurance, which covers a possible damage caused by the driver, includes a high cost loss, which, in turn, depends on various factors, including age, sex, time of creation of the driver's license, family status, type of car to be secured and its use, etc.
A car to own is only the beginning.
Because it is even harder to find the appropriate KFZ insurance as the right vehicle model.
First of all, we need to be clear about what we have to do here.
Car insurance is an agreement between an insurance company and an insurance undertaking.
This Agreement shall be maintained in writing by means of an insurance contract which provides that the company receives the said insurance premium and is obliged to submit the corresponding amount of compensation in the event of an injury.
The insurance premium is the price of an insurance consisting of several factors, including age, sex, time of creation of the driver’s license, family status, type of vehicle to be insured or its use.
Insurance undertakings shall set their prices in accordance with statistics so that, in the event of a higher accident, they will also pay higher contributions.
For this reason, both over 25 years of age and women must pay less contributions, as statistics suggest that these groups show a lower rate of accident due to their care.
The same applies to married persons, as they do not appear to be alone after the statement of the statistical values and, therefore, after the convincement of companies.
The benefits associated with the vehicle affect the frequency of the vehicle and thus the likelihood of an accident.
The more often the use, the more likely the damage.
When setting up the premium, the insurance must take into account a series of points.
For this reason, the driver must also study the situation thoroughly in order to choose exactly the car insurance that he first meets his personal needs.
We now list the most important points that should be taken into account in the selection of insurance in order to be able not only to achieve a performance but also to make a price-oriented choice.
The lower 25-year-olds will face many obstacles when choosing a cost-effective insurance, such as low driving practices and young drivers.
Even if it would be best for an ideal insurance protection to conclude a full insurance policy, there are still more valuable alternatives.
The expected drivers can choose a full-time coach with their own participation so that the services of a full-time insurance are covered, but are offered at a low price.
This type of contract includes that the customer must pay part of the amount caused by the damage itself.
The amount shall be fixed before the conclusion of the contract and on the basis of the amount of the insurance premium. This is higher than the amount to be paid , explains Luis Noguera, the main representative of Spain at First Europe, a brokering company for online insurance.
Another option is the extended insurance that ensures customers against external accidents, but not against the damages caused by their own car.
In addition, this type of insurance would cover diesel, fire and vehicle losses.
Here's a council.
If you are under 25 years of age, it is in your hand to reduce insurance costs; so your record increases by trying to drive carefully and avoid accidents.
A fine is a reduction in the base rate in the insurance company concerned.
In contrast, a fine includes an increase in rates.
The high rates of fines and fines depend on the company and its earnings.
If the company has a year to come back, it can allow itself to increase the bonus payments , Noguera explains.
As soon as the 25-year mark is exceeded, it is easy for the driver to conclude a contract. For this reason, the fact that the accident rate is reduced by increasing driving practice.
It is therefore most appropriate to decide for full-time insurance with self-interest.
Normally, young people cannot benefit from their previous experience, either in the event of an accident or at the time of driving , the Spanish president of the European company explains and adds that the majority of accidents occur in the second year of practice after the fear of the recipient has been removed.
However, it is advisable for a married client who does not have children to conclude a full-time insurance; of course only if the financial situation of the person concerned is allowed.
As regards the insurance policy, spouses with children are considered to be the least accident rate for customers, and therefore their contributions are also low.
In this case, full-time insurance with self-interest (with an amount of about 300 euros) would be the best option. In case you have received a high salary, an extended insurance which is used only for the third year of the vehicle is recommended.
They are generally more relaxed and possess a greater purchasing power that allows them to make a higher contribution, says Luis Noguera.
For Rentner, it is appropriate to conclude a full-time insurance with self-interest (with an amount of EUR 150), or an extended insurance which is used only in a sufficiently high accounting.
Finally, it must be noted that car insurance is something very important, not only because it protects the driver from possible accidents, but also because it costs high costs which require a basic choice which is in line with our personal situation.
Celtic Glasgow looks forward to the end point in Milan
The FC Milan and the Celtic Glasgow will be fighting the point on the next Tuesday in San Siro, which they lack to achieve their respective goals even before the end of the championship. Italians need the point to reach the tops of their group, while this will decide on their participation in the shootings.
The Italian team has already made five points and has already confirmed its participation in the fifth round with a difference in Portugal, while the Celtic Glasgow with nine points still needs another to ensure that FC Shakhtar with six points does not contain Befia Lisbon with four points.
The two games of Group D will take place one week before the end of the sixth round, as the FC Mailland has to appear at the FIFA World Championship in Japan, where he will first fight the entry into the final at the 13th semifinal.
In this way this group will be closed in front of all others and the difference in the Guiseppe Meazza Stadium to the expected outcome, even if both teams are trying to win. The Italians will not want to speculate at home, i.e. the Celtic Glasgow will know what they would have in the case of a victorious group leader and thus have a better starting position in the final.
The crew of Gordon Strachan could even be able to qualify for a lower position at a sleep of the FC Shakhtar. However, he should not rely too much on such circumstances, since at nine points of equality the Ukrainians are to take part; the last week in Glasgow (2-1), but they could have won in the second game (2-0).
Therefore, the e-mails will try to avoid the shots at night. They hope to reach the end of the finals of the redesigned champion league for the second time after they were visited in the previous game season in exactly the same round by a port of Kaka in the post-game period (1-0) and by a zero to zero discrepancies on the game.
While the FC Shakhtar awaits the victory of the Rossoneri, the team will have to focus on its own game, as both the achievement of the final and its membership in the UEFA depend on its victory and a reduction in the Celtic Glasgow.
In spite of its low table position and without the prospect of continuing to participate in the greatest European masterpiece, Benfia Lisbon could achieve its third place by winning and thus playing with the UEFA.
20,000 people visit Vancouver the first concert of the Spice Girls Tour.
The Spice Girls gave in the Canadian Vancouver fronts 20,000 spectators of the Start Committee for their first tour after the band was dissolved in 2000.
'Posh Spice' (Victoria Beckham), 'Scary Spice' (Melanie Brown), 'Baby Spice' (Emma Bunton), 'Sporty Spice' (Melanie Chisholm) y 'Ginger Spice' (Geri Hallwell) shortly before the beginning of their concert at the GM Place de Vancouver stadium, the vote was great in the reunification band.
About 20,000 people could live in the stadium where a video about the history of the band was shown at the end of the ninth year for Furore.
The reunification and the world tour are intertwined with the publication of a new album, which includes their biggest hits and two more new songs, headlines and voodoo, which appears in Spain under the label of EMI.
The five members of the Spice Girls wore gold bracelets that had previously been given to them by the husband of Posh Spice, the English footballer David Beckham.
The sporter was among the fans in the audience who brought the GM Palace to his joy, although his wife’s nerves Victoria had forbidden him in the days ahead.
While preparing for the show, Victoria Beckham suggested that the British Star didn't get our guardrobe at all, and that's why I'm already very tired of what he's going to do from the show.
Sports Spice , whose Austria from the group in 1998 because of internal differences of opinion two years later after the group was dissolved , gave her nervousness two hours before the concert at a press conference.
I was shocked.
I was nervous, but I saw that the attitude of the world's public had changed that the feelings of the Spice Girls had changed.
And that's why I didn't really think about it; so I'm glad to have made this decision, Chisholm was out to separate the band she had taken nine years ago.
The singer also admitted that the conflicts had been resolved and that in the meantime everyone was very pleased.
However, many things have changed since the last joint appearance of Spice Girls in 1998.
For the first time, the group came into contact with the CTV television transmitter's report in a special machine of Virgin Airlines in Vancouver.
When she arrived at the airport, the band was received from a gentleman from a girl.
The five have seven children together.
After the concert in Vancouver, the band will be held as the next in California, San José (December 4th) and Los Angeles (December 5th and December 7th).
In Madrid they will attend the stage on 23 December.
New threats about Earth Gas Conflict between Russia and Ukraine
A new price dispute arises between Ukraine and Russia, raising the risk that Russian exports of fuel to Western Europe will be affected.
The majority of Russian exports to the European Union (EU) will be managed by Ukraine and any conflict between the two nations will be closely monitored.
Kiew has warned that if Moscow increases the price it has to pay for the gas it will take into account higher transit fees from Russia.
A previous conflict between the two countries in the last year reduced supplies to EU countries.
The recent conflict between Kiev and Moscow takes place at a time when the Ukrainian government and the Russian State Gasmonopol Gasprom are trying to reach an agreement on how much Ukraine has to pay for Russian gas in 2008.
According to Gazprom, Ukraine has to be more calculated as the group has agreed to pay up to 50% additional for natural gas from neighboring Turkmenistan.
Analysts say this could mean that Ukraine has to pay 40% more for imports of gasprom.
"It is important for us to use our arguments as one of the most important gas transit states in discussions," said Ukrainian Minister of Economics Anatoli Kinakh of the Reuters news agency.
"The changes in greenhouse gas prices should undoubtedly be linked to our arguments regarding the level of transit charges [to Western Europe] across Ukraine."
In January 2006, the last major natural gas dispute between Moscow and Kiev accelerated gasprom delivery in Ukraine.
This led to a case of exports to Western Europe, which led to the price drop dramatically.
The Russian gas represents a quarter of the European Union's supply.
Russia has the world's largest gas developments, but many of them remain underdeveloped.
The result is that Gazprom supplements its own presentations with gas from Turkmenistan and other Central Asian countries.
NHS "We must control foreign workers"
The Scottish State Health Service has to improve the control of the pre-trial registers for workers from outside Europe, said a member of the control body outside.
The recommendation of Chief Financial Controller Robert Black came after a foreign doctor in Scotland was brought in connection with the attack on Glasgow airport in June.
Black also expressed concern that the Scottish State Health Service does not have any specific ideas regarding the number of its foreign employees.
However, his report showed that other important checks were carried out in a sample of five health authorities.
The chief financial controller examined personnel recruited outside the European Economic Area, following the attack on Glasgow airport.
Bilal Abdullah, 28, an Iraqi doctor at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was arrested at the airport after driving a land vehicle through the doors of the main airport.
He was one of three doctors who appeared in a video transmission in October in Old Bailey and was charged with the forced car bomb attack in Britain.
It is expected that the State Health Service will carry out checks in advance of the appointment of foreign staff to ensure that they have the necessary qualifications, experience and authorisations to work in the United Kingdom.
Although the health authorities will use Disclosure Scotland to verify pre-trial records, the Agency does not have the authority to obtain this information outside the United Kingdom.
The main auditor's report now includes, in addition to other recommendations, that the Board of Directors should adopt the guidelines of the tax exemption, which will help employers to control in different countries.
"Although we have found some personal data on these checks, they have not been routinely performed," the report said.
Black said that the Scottish health authorities would follow their research policies in advance of the high level of employment but added: "Our report shows areas in which the system can be improved to ensure that accurate information is available on the number of foreign health workers."
BMA Scotland-President Dr. Peter Terry said it was "extremely unlikely" that studies in the context of the setting up of potential NHS employees would identify people who might be involved in future terrorist attacks.
"In the report it means that the NHS Scotland’s current preference test works well and it is not clear which value the recommendations will deliver," he said.
The Scottish health authorities say they currently have 1,161 foreign employees, mostly doctors and nurses.
However, the financial controller warned that the number was likely to be higher, even because the main problems had been to identify those employees who were allowed for an unlimited period of time.
The investigation further found that established control procedures by NHS authorities in Ayrshire, Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire, and Lotian have been largely maintained.
This includes passports, work permits and qualification checks.
the Scottish Government is currently examining its policies and guidelines for control of foreign staff in the NHS.
The Secretary for Health Nicola Sturgeon said: "It was my duty to carry out this work in view of the terrorist attack on Glasgow Airport."
It added that the Scottish Government, in conjunction with the health authorities, would take into account the recommendations of the report and ensure that the best practices in updated guidelines on control investigations in the context of the appointment of all staff members - including those from abroad - are planned for the next month.
Joy Division dominated film price delivery
Control, the filmography about the late Joy Division singer Ian Curtis has hidden five prizes at the British Independent Film Festival, including for the best film.
Prices were also paid to Chief Manufacturer Sam Riley, who worked in a warehouse before he was cast for the role of the Curtis, Director Anton Corbín, and Deputy Manufacturer Toby Kebell.
Dame Judi Dench was awarded as the best manufacturer for the Thriller Notes on a scandal.
And Bond-Director Daniel Craig won the Variety Prize for turning the British film into the world's public.
The prices were transferred to a ceremony in London Roundhouse.
Control follows Curtis' rise to peace with Joy Division until his suicide in 1980 at the age of 23.
The blackboard film - on which the soundtrack The Killers, David Bowie and New Orders are to be found - has been stolen for only 3 million British pounds.
However, he introduced the Dutch photographer Corbín, until the first known for the cult cover of the U2 album Joshua Tree, two prizes - as the best director and the best director.
Rockmusic was the centre of another prize winner at the ceremony - as Julian Temple's film about the Clash singer Joe Streammer received the award for the best documentary film.
The price for the best performer went to Viggo Mortensen for his role as driver of a Russian mafia boss in David Cronenbergs in London playing Triller Easter Promises.
Ray Winston, who is in the mood to play hard guys, has won the Richard Harris Prize for his outstanding contribution to the British film.
The 50-year-old, whose films are Scum, Nil by Mouth and Sexy Biest, is currently filming Indiana Jones Continue The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.
Winstone said he was proud to receive the award for the honor of the Camelot and Harry Potter Stars Harris, who died in 2002.
"There were people like Richard Harris and Albert Finney who opened doors for people like me," he said.
"I was lucky to meet Richard Harris a few times.
He's my kind of man, a great actor of his time, I'm really honored."
The independent film prices, known as Bifas, are chosen by a group, which belongs to filmmakers, actors and festival organizers.
The bifa supporters and sponsors include Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Nighy, Meera Syal and Michael Winterbottem.
208 arrested in Saudi Arabia for a terrorist attack
Saudi Arabia has discovered yesterday that 208 million people have been arrested for their involvement in cells that have planned a major attack on an oil plant as well as on spiritual and security forces.
The state television of the world's largest oil exporter said one of the cells had planned to scan rockets.
Sympathians from Al-Qaida have launched a campaign against the monarchy, which has been an ally of the United States since 2003, following the invasion in Iraq.
A cell of eight Militants, led by an alien citizen, was planning an attack on an oil plant in the eastern province, following the TV report.
Saudi Arabia has formed a 35,000 men high-speed intervention team to protect a failed Al-Qaida approach to the world's largest oil treatment plant in Abqaq in 2006.
The report, referring to an in-ministerial statement, says that 18 of the arrested were members of a cell led by a "rocket expert" who illegally immigrated into the country.
He reports that the militia had planned to bribe eight projectiles into the Kingdom.
Another 22 of the detainees had to present the report with spiritual and security forces.
The government has warned spiritually to stop Saudis trying to join Al Qaida Milizen, who want to fight the Allied warring forces and the US-supported Scottish Muslim government, which is considered by the Hardliners under the Sunni Saudi.
Al Qaida Milizen viewed many spiritual people in Saudi Arabia as cooperating with the authorities in support of the policy of the royal family that governs the government.
The militia - accompanied by calls from Osama bin Laden, the leader of Al Qaida who was born in Saudi Arabia to target the experimental Saudi government - looked at foreign housing, government buildings and energy sector facilities.
"This was a very great effort by the security forces over the last... five months," a speaker from the Ministry of the Interior shared the state television.
The arrests also involved a 16 media cell from Medina, which was intended to acquire the "Takfiri thought" - the ideology of radical Sunni Muslims, which supports the violence against Muslims, which is being set on fire as unbelievers and outcasts.
Among the prisoners were 32 people who were accused of providing the military with financial support.
The climate on Venus could make a look at the future of the earth
Perhaps the Venus was once a pleasant place to live, said scientists said yesterday.
Data from a European spacecraft on a runway show that the planet is still more like a distant twinling of the Earth than has been known.
The Venus is the nearest planetary neighborhood of the Earth.
The two worlds have about the same size and have similar planetary roads, but the Venus of the sun is much closer.
Thousands of years ago, Venus had been governed by conditions that were very similar to those on earth and could even be inhabited by scientists today.
But because of the unbridled carbon dioxide effect, the erosion of the atmosphere through solar radiation and a slower rotation pace, Venus started a completely different course of development.
Today the planet is flooded by water and has a surface temperature that is hot enough to melt lead and is washed by hurricane-strong winds and lightning storm.
The knowledge of the space probe Venus Express of the European Space Agency which has examined the plants for a year provides a satisfying view of how the earth could develop in view of the catastrophic climate change.
Professor Fred Taylor of the physics department at the University of Oxford, one of the leaders of Venus Express Mission, said: "It is clear why the climate on Venus is so different from what the Earth is, while the planets are rather relatively similar."
"Our new data enables us to build a scenario in which Venus began billions of years ago like Earth, perhaps with a viable environment."
"Angerated uranium" by the police
A kilo of radioactive material, reports from Uranium, was attacked yesterday by the Slovak and Hungarian police.
A police speaker said three persons were arrested and that the material would be checked.
He did not confirm whether it was an enriched uranium, but said it could have been sold for $1 million (480.000).
Everything's still open
When Romey said that he did not consider it appropriate for a presidential candidate to be questioned by a snowman.
Nevertheless, the Republican candidate for the Presidency was finally ready to hold a debate on YouTube in the normal voters' questions on video and join them to send them to the candidate.
None of the issues raised on Wednesday, November 28, were as ridiculous as the snowman, the Democrats asked about global warming in the YouTube debate of the other party.
But the questions, and the answers, this time reflected precisely the state of the Republican party that appeared in the elections next year.
It is not known exactly how CNN producers, who supported the debates, chose YouTube clips to show the relevant candidates.
However, in the first half hour of the debate, the longest one was devoted to one subject, immigration was at the centre.
The issue is one of the most devastating subjects for Republicans.
The CNN asked a group of different voters to serve a selection when they heard things they liked: the television service noted the tops of the consent as the candidates spoke strictly over the limits.
The worst and longest exchange of the evening was between Rudy Giuliani, the national president, and Romney, who moved forward in the decisive questions in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Giuliani tried to undermine the call, he was careful about illegal immigration when he was mayor of New York.
He attacked Romney in which he accused the former Governor of Massachusetts of having appointed illegal immigrants for work at his home.
The two asked each other in particular whether one of the candidates would support an "amnesty" (the illegals would provide a regular status and opportunity for citizenship).
Unreasonable candidates such as Duncan Hunter, a California Congressman, and Tom Tancredo, a Colorado Congressman, were able to look into this subject.
None of the two men have serious opportunities for nomination, but both remain in the race, perhaps because they have gone to immigration peace earlier and harder than others.
At least in the area of immigration, candidates share the same views in large and complete terms: harsh limits, intolerance against illegal migrants.
This topic, along with anxiety over toxic toys from China or other concerns about the rest of the world, helps the Republicans to forget or minimize the differences between liberal and Christian conservatives.
But the debate was clearly problematic as other topics.
Mr Giuliani was asked why he had supported arms restrictions in the past.
John McCain and Romney discussed whether simulated drinking should be considered a folder.
One of the authors asked whether the candidates believed every word of the Bible.
This led to Giuliani’s accepting the view that although the Bible is his favorite book, he may not believe in the account of Jonah and the wall in writing.
Another questionr asked whether Jesus would support the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee - now against all expectations at the first place in a recent survey in Iowa thanks to his long-standing Christian conservativeism - said that the death penalty would be painful but necessary.
When under pressure, Jesus threatened them, laughed at them, and said Jesus was too clever to appeal to a political office.
The race remains extremely open.
Huckabee's rise in Iowa coincides with Ron Pauls' most recent fundraising and his bidder in the midweek debate.
These two are not expelled from the scene because the two flights of the party have not yet been able to join one of the most famous and traditional candidates.
In 1980 and 2000, a candidate launched the party from the beginning and was convinced to join with a victory message about the size of America and a twinner to both parties.
This time the party is split and the result is far from clear.
Pain of the Labour Party
Gordon Brown has discovered another hole for the intrusion; his way out of this remains the same.
For British scandals this is not particularly seductive.
No title seems to be sold, no Parisian policy is paid hotel bills, no exceptional lines have been applied.
But the discovery that a rich businessman spends over over 650,000 dollars (1.3 million dollars) over four years on behalf of other people and that the party has failed to report this is something that would have been good without the fighter Gordon Brown.
Two months ago, the Prime Minister had rejected the request for a choice in a way that brought the British intelligence to an end by claiming that questions of opinion had not affected this decision, there was hope that he would offer a robust, efficient government.
On the contrary, as Vince Cable, who, in an increasing degree, was a representative of the Liberal Democrats, expressed it, developed the first-feared Brown from Stalin to Mr. Bean.
The unsolicited rescue of Northern Rock, an attacked bank, demonstrated regulatory weaknesses and poor judgment powers under decision.
Poor proposals to amend tax laws have been made by companies against the government.
The administrative loss of personal data by 25 million people showed unintended administrative pfuscheries.
A trio of generals in peace began a rebellion in the upper house from protest against cuts in military spending: to be a minister of the struggle forces, so they claimed to be part-time jobs.
There are now the numerous contributions of David Abrahams; Peter Watt, Secretary-General of Labour (and her former executive director) has already returned.
None of this means that Brown produces irrevocable direction of departure.
However, governments can reach a turning point where they cannot feel it.
People don't like to trust politicians, but they usually stop their creation when a new team arrives at the office.
If once it is clear that it is unlikely that a Prime Minister will improve the situation and he does not need to be long enough, this shift is over: the public service is beginning to disappear; the cabinet ministers are beginning to play; the press is looking for bad news; and the government is becoming defensive and uncaring.
In a way, Brown's position is particularly difficult because he cannot claim to be a new bees, unlike other political leaders.
So if he wanted to curse Tony Blair, he was his superior.
The problems with Northern Rock and the tax liability, for example, are related to decisions that Brown has taken as the head of the Ministry of Finance.
And even if he wasn't directly involved in Blair's miscommunication - as in the long "Money for Adele title" investigation of political party funding - the voters may have concluded that it was.
Nevertheless, Brown's situation is not as bad as it looks
The infringements are not as terrible as the conservatives describe them.
Like Mr. Bean, no one has died or been completely shaken.
And the opposite, painfully as it may be, is to deliver what Browns of course promised Stalinist tendencies: a reliable, solid and easily brutal government.
The new witness on political spending is a good example.
The Warboss Abraham, who compares his contributions with his collective gifts, says he does not want public recognition for his well-being.
This may be so, but the decision was not made by him.
The anti-anonymity laws for large political contributors are clear and they exist for a clear reason: the public has a right to know who can buy access to those who govern the country.
What he said was known to Abraham's agreement, but not that it is illegal, of course, is going to have to ask a few questions; just like Jon Mendleson, Laborers' main financial operator, who was told about the special expenses in October.
However, Brown is not involved so far: there is nothing to indicate that he was aware of these distortions, although most of the payments were made after his office took place in June.
So far, the Prime Minister has done half the work.
He quickly condemned the violation of the law by his party, but he challenged this decision by taking a well-known instrument, a study committee on the subject - to complete the measure by a bishop in peace and a judge.
In this case, the "learning from here" is not very complicated.
If the law has been broken, it's a matter for the police.
On the other hand, there are other things Mr Brown has to do, how to find a permanent chairperson for the Independent Committee on Standards in Public Life, which has been unemployed for six months and to move forward with a comprehensive reform of political party funding.
This would require the hardline of the work to cooperate with the conservatives and, if possible, to give up the special financial relationship with the trade unions - longer pills for a partner like Mr Brown.
But he should be aware of some partial facts.
The Conservatives now have a clear lead in the issue of opinion; he has two years to win the election; and the only way he can achieve a victory is through inapplicable legal creativity and solid competence.
Cartenehae
Does the credit crisis affect America's credit card market?
If blood is in the water, it's only natural that backflows are recuperating.
Now that America's real estate market is sick, the robbers have the country's credit card market in the visitor.
Analysts of Goldman Sachs estimate that credit card losses could reach $99 billion if the risk of underfunded credit spreads to other forms of consumer credit.
Signs of tension are clearly visible.
There are increases both in the exhibitions and in the field rates that measure the proportion of credit which are not uneven or beyond 30 days later.
HSBC has announced in the last month that it has taken a $1.4 billion tax increase from its US consumer funding, partly due to the lack of credit card holders.
It's too early to fall into panic.
Loss and damage are still low.
According to the rating agency Moody, the third quarter area rate of 3.89% was almost a full percentage point among the historical average.
The deterioration in the rates can be explained in part by technical factors.
An amendment to the US Private Solvency Law in 2005 resulted in an outstanding case of competition notifications which would then result in a large part of the loss of chain cards; the number of registrations (and therefore land fees) would rise again whether the general conditions for creditors would deteriorate.
The industry also reports on solid payment rates that show how much of its debts pay consumers every month
and trust in credit-based securities is rather strong, despite the state of Stillness in other areas of structured financing.
Dennis Moroney of the TowerGroup, a research company, calculates that expenditure for 2007 will be 25% higher than last year.
Direct infection channels between the real estate credit crisis and the credit card market are certain: it is more likely that consumers will assume credit card debts, now that they will withdraw their own credit.
However, the card issuers look at the cash flow instead of the capital value, so due domestic prices do not necessarily result in a change in the creditworthiness of the creditor.
You can even be useful to the card exhibitors.
The incentives for consumers to continue to pay mortgage rates are reduced when properties are less valuable than the value of the loan; as a result, card debt is more important under the return priorities.
Cartoon manufacturers can also respond much faster and more flexible than credit providers to the more stringent conditions by changing interest rates or credit limits.
This should theoretically reduce the risk of rapid reassessment of assets.
"We won't wake up one day and reevaluate the loan completely," says Gary Perlin, Capital Ones Financial Reference.
Even if a sudden undermining crisis in the credit card market is unlikely, the risks of sustainable disposal are much more real.
If lower home prices and a credit reduction in America are forced into the recession, industry will undoubtedly face a worse future.
Keep looking after these hafiflages.
British banks are known guilty in the case of Enron
Three British bankers who should be brought before the court for their role in the fraud system with the former Chief Financial Officer of Enron, Andrew Fastow, changed their search in the middle of the week.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew had originally made use of seven cases of fraud using telecoms means for the alleged conspiracy with Fastow in a secret financial backlog in 2000 in order to guarantee himself at the expense of their employer.
The procedure was applied on January.
But during a hearing before the U.S. District Court, Ewing Werlein Junior complained about a case of fraud using telecommunications.
The three former leadership forces of Greenwich NatWest, a unit of the Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC, were known in Britain during two years of delivery procedures.
In the United States, its case is a free end to an investigation that was launched after Enron's collapse in 2001.
The original charges against them were made in 2002 by Fastow that he was the target of an investigation by the government in relation to Enron's descent.
The complaint against the banker - called the "NatWest Three" - claimed that they had come to Houston in 2000 to raise a fraudulent complication with Fastow and his former top advisor Michael Kopper.
Greenwich Natwest had invested in a subsidiary of an Enron partnership controlled by Fastow, which was the architect of countless counterfeit Enron companies that have contributed to the company's moving into the competition strand.
At the beginning of 2002, the bank had valued its participation in the subsidiary at zero, but the three British men knew that it had really significant value.
A company under copper control purchased the bank's share of the subsidiary for $1 million.
The bankiers paid copper $250,000 for participation in this company.
According to the complaint, Fastow falsely claims against Enron that the energy company would pay $20 million to Greenwich NatWest for its share in the subsidiary.
But in fact, the 20 million dollars went to the British banks, Fastow and others.
The bankers received $7.3 million, while Fastow, Kopper and other about $12.3 million were withdrawn, according to the complaint.
In January 2004, Fastow was known for his role in the Enrons Pleite.
The British Trio was arrested three months later.
Fastow is a six-year prison sentence in the federal prison of Louisiana.
Kopper sits a three-year sentence and a month in an institution in Texarkana.
Each of the three men was on a free foot on the basis of a $1 million bailout that required them to live in the United States in anticipation of the trial.
Enron, one of the seven largest companies of the nation, broke down in December 2001, could no longer make billions of debts or weaker businesses appear profitable after years of accounting tricks.
The collapse destroyed thousands of jobs, more than 60 billion market value and more than $2 billion pension plans.
The Enron Founder Kenneth Lay and former President Jeffrey Skilling were sentenced last year to their roles in relation to the Enron Summit.
Skilling is a punishment of more than 24 years.
Lays were dismissed for harassment, fraud and other complaints after his death in the last year because of heart disease.
Not all down in Moscow
The price of an aircraft of the brand Golfstream G550, equipped with a Rolls Royce engine and enough scope to fly from Moscow to Los Angeles, is at least $54 million.
But this is small money for some of the rich Russians.
"It offers room for up to 18 passengers," said Dan Firer, a golf stream representative.
"But none of you asks for so many seats because it is for a private family or company president."
Four were at the golf course on the last Friday at the millionaire exhibition, a four-day watch-up of a consumer who was held in a large exhibition centre on the city’s central street.
In addition to Gulfstream, more than 200 other luxury suppliers had built exhibition stations, hoping to attract new Russians to money at all, from mahogany-covered yachts to diamond-resisted cars that would be suitable for 50 cents.
Four carefully took a brilliant orange porcelain at the next exhibition in the visitor.
"It's a beautiful car, but it's small money compared to us," he said.
"In the United States, Russia is the second largest private vehicle market in Russia."
Exhausted by an olive tree, the Russian capital seems to be so overloaded with money like Dallas to its glaciers.
"We went through the same phase in the 1890s, when some Americans came to enormous wealth and went to Europe, where they were considered materialistic," said Marshall Goldman, a scientist at Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian studies at Harvard University.
Like the Saudi-Arab oversupply of the 1970s and the Japanese in the 1990s, the Russians appear to be the world's most visible freelance seller.
The most exclusive luxury brands are looking for their share in gold rush.
On the other hand, in Moscow this week a conference of the luxury industry Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, president of LVMH, has been invited to exchange ideas on how to sell high-quality goods on markets such as Russia.
(The conference is organised by The International Herald Tribune, which is part of the New York Times Company.)
Russia has 53 billion dollars, totaling 282 billion dollars, according to the Forbes list of the richest people.
In addition, 103,000 Russian millionaires in the second class, which are worth 670 billion dollars together, are a study on the development of private assets in the former Soviet Union, which was written by economic experts of the Centre for Economic and Financial Research, an expert group here.
(The World Bank says that in 2005 there were 15.8 per cent of Russians living below the existing minimum.)
"There are hundreds of millions in Moscow - that is why we are all here," said Nicole Marais, a sales and marketing representative of David Morris, a London Jewelier.
She had first visited the fair with the Russian trader of the brand, Soho Jewelry Group.
"The women are all exemplary and the men are all worth a fortune."
As they go through the halls, two real estate models, Evgenia Yumatova, 21, and Svetlana Turovtsova, 26, call themselves and their clients as millionaires.
"I looked after the cars and I tried to decide between Infinite, Mercedes and Porsche," said Mrs. Yumatova, who delivered the designer clothes she wore, as a roter-teppich veteran with Joan Rivers.
The exhibition appeared first to focus on the novels, the type of famous Russian buyers who would be willing to stand in the marketplace for several hours to visit an attractive warehouse, which was beautifully decorated Cadillac Escalades, bag-measuring from Platinum, Movöenpic Eiskrem, balanced billiardtics, apartments in Dubai and Gund Teddybären.
The public was able to buy tickets for 30 euros (44.57 dollars).
"The Russians are interested in learning which brand is the most expensive and best," said Mr. Gijrath, who was patriotically at a exhibition of the Dutch porcelain manufacturer Royal Delft before a walled imitation of a Rembrandt image from handmade blue mosaics.
"Of course Russians are more interested in hairdressers."
In fact, the traders here say that Russians with old money (10 to 15 years old according to Russian standards) have already moved from large-sized logos to the type of new brands with limited number of items that would not be marketed at a trade show.
Nevertheless, thousands of people, whether they were millions of people, sent by millions of people or simply tourists every day through the halls.
And some of them bought it.
On the first night of the show on the last Thursday, Roman Ershov, the general manager of King Koil Betten here, had sold two $70,000 matrazensets, made of silk, cashmir and cotton, with fine gold feet.
Also on the first night, Mikhail Lyubiumov, a sales manager for A1 Moto, a company equipped the high-end cars with high-end alarm systems that its company had sold the grey orange Porsche for $170,000 to a Russian million.
By Sunday afternoon, Andrei Karapetian, president of L.A. Connection, a company that adapts luxury to customer wills, had sold three car coolers for a Rolls Royce Phantom, which is the same as related chain guns for each of the $55,000.
He showed a reporter an autograph that was developed for a Russian casino owner with memory that he had passed on with colorful Swarovski crystals, so it looked like a rollertterad.
The cost: $22,000 for a four-six.
"The Russian millionaire, the streetleader or an image of his wife's face from a Cuban circus will not be forced to ride on these wheels," said Mr. Karapetian.
"He will keep it in his 30 or 40 car garage."
Even though many of his Russian customers are rich, Mr. Karapetian said that the phrase "Russian millionaires" would not at present express a lot of exclusion in view of the rise in the price of his real estate.
"If you bought a apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, they are probably already millionaires, at least on the paper if they're not in Bargeld," he said.
"There are more than you believe."
Those who were not able to do at least the same thing as if they were rich at a position run by Alliance Continental, a Russian asset management company.
The company had set up four red telephone cells according to the British model, which were completely stopped with mountains of wrong millions of dollars.
Azad Karryev, the company's marketing director, said his employees had issued 500,000 false bank notes for the millionaire fairs.
Passives were about to throw back the wallets, making mobile phone photos, while they were back in the middle of the exchange order, letting friends cut them off, or simply hiding a few million.
"See, in Moscow everyone can feel like a millionaire," said Mr. Karryev.
Hidden operation suspected at deathfall in New Jersey
It was the day before the funeral feast as Ronald Livingston through the large glass window of just a Little Healthy Restaurant here and watched as a hospital car stopped at the white Cape Cod two doors further down on the West Scott Avenue.
Soon there was a police car.
And then there was another one.
"Then I saw the boxcar of the medical nurse," said Livingston, an overseer of the restaurant, on Wednesday.
"That was the point when I knew someone was dead."
The authorities found that the dead woman Olga Arroyo, 41, was an assistant to the director of the Newarker Police Agency.
Now the investigators are trying to determine whether they died due to a procedure carried out by an unauthorized cosmetic surgeon who was not identified by the police and who worked in the house at West Scott Avenue 212.
The authorities have not yet established what has caused Mrs Arroyos to die, and it is hoped that toxicological studies which cannot be available for weeks will help to clarify a mysterious death that has sent a grief through the Newark Police's lead point.
Since September 2006, Ms. Arroyo has been an assistant to the police director, Gary F. McCarthy, and her voice has been widely known in the department.
"She was loyal, hard work and hard work," said Mr. McCarthy about Mrs. Arroyo in a telephone interview on Wednesday.
"She was my Pitbull.
She protected me."
McCarthy said that Mrs. Arroyo was Jimmy Arroyo's wife, a former Newarker police officer working for the alcohol control committee, and that she left two sons, 14 and 11, and a stepmother.
Eileen Walsh, a speaker for the Union County State Hall, Theodore J. Romankow, said that investigators would try to determine whether Arroyo died as a result of an unauthorized, surgical treatment.
"This is one of the possibilities," said Mrs. Walsh.
"It's an ongoing investigation."
The authorities said they had arrived at the house about 3 p.m. in November.
And they found Mrs. Arroyo on a sofa.
She was declared dead somewhere.
More than a week has passed and the authorities have reported little about their investigation or about the owner of the house, which is listed as Flor Margarita Castro.
Walsh didn't mean to say whether Mrs Castro was questioned by the authorities.
The investigators are trying to determine whether part of the house has been used as a medical practice.
On Wednesday, no one opened the door to Mrs. Castro's house, where a green rose stream stands in the close front yard and calls a Dalmatian behind the house.
A blue fass is described as "Ethyl Vanillin" - used as a substitute for Vanille in food and perfumes - in the parking lot near a door leading to the under-shoe.
Two mountain bikes hang from Haken on one side.
McCarthy said that when he first arrived in Newark, after spending 25 years with the New York Police Department, Mrs. Arroyo was of invaluable value and helped him to adjust to the provincial and hard political culture in his new city.
"She said, 'You have to watch this or that," he said.
"She was always here when I came here and she was always here when I went.
It was painful."
Hopes that the central bank will lower interest rates will lead to the rise of world action markets
The shares will explode on both sides of the Atlantic yesterday after market openings that the central bank will try to calm the credit markets down by further interest rates, with serious comments from the Vice-Presidents of the United States Central Bank.
The shares markets rose in London, New York and throughout Europe after Donald Kahn, number 2 of Ben Bernanke, the central bank's president, said that the policy must respond "flexible and pragmatic" to the continued pressure on financial markets.
In a clear effort to calm corrupt markets in view of signs of rising credit tensions, Kohn, who were the youngest turbulence, said that "partly some of the improvements in market functions have been reversed by late September and October".
If there were to be increased turbulence, it would increase the possibility of further deterioration of the financial conditions for consumers and businesses, he said.
The comments were received by investors as a signal that the central bank is ready to step up and with new capital prizes in the US markets and potential other interest rates stabilize the credit conditions.
The performances also helped calm down Wall Street, in view of further bad news from the US economy, since the sale of US real estate reached a new record depth in October.
The consequences of financial turbulence have been underlined by the announcement of Bear Stearns, the Investment Bank, that they will eliminate 650 jobs or 4% of their global employees in a cost-reduction measure to offset serious losses from their lost assets in the U.S. mortgage credit sector.
It is expected that only 20 of these jobs will be lost in London, where the Bank employs 1,500 employees.
In New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Index launched 331 points, or 2.55 percent to close at 13.289.40, while the S&P 500 index increased by 2.65 percent.
In London the FTSE 100 Index increased by 165.5 points, or 2.7 percent to close at 6.306.2, which added more than 39 billion pounds to the value of British standard values.
Germany's Index Dax grew by 2.6 per cent and France CAC40 by 2.3 per cent.
In the past, the rescheduling of credit pressure on the markets was emphasised after a strong demand for an auction of three-month guarantee funds from the European Central Bank, which were granted to the European Trade Banks, to a considerable 4.7 per cent, the highest Council since April 2001.
The pressure on the Bank of England, the US Central Bank and the European Central Bank to follow up and invest more capital in the monetary markets in London increased when the three-month interest rates for loans between UK banks increased by 6.59 per cent since late September, following a continuous increase since 21 November.
England faces a decision on the statements by Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara
Here are two dilemmamas, each of them almost as difficult as the other.
Who is going to hit England as number 6 in Candy this weekend, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And, no less relevant in a broader context than the first test against Sri Lanka, who will make the decision?
The second question is important because David Graveney, the president of the election, at least under this special title, is here to help Chief coach Peter Moores and Captain Michael Vaughan, and because the board of High Morries, the English executive director, is generally filled with applications for national electoral rooms, if not even for any part of the time.
Whoever doesn't always get the sixth position will be unhappy, but life is often unfair and sports is undoubtedly.
It is never easy to establish exactly what enables a person to achieve the tops of his professional class, while otherwise someone never gets out of the lowest rank, sometimes from lack of success instead of ability.
It is not only in the cricket where the selection is difficult, where judgments are necessary, which are always subjective at the end.
Is it the right time for Bopara to rise?
Is it fair to Shah if he does?
The same may also be asked in another area if, for example, John Edwards or "Tubby" banner, both intelligent young leadership forces with good conclusions that know the business well.
Who can say what the right class is for a cricket player is because he will be given the opportunity to swim or to take a walk.
Of course, numbers have a major impact on decisions, but these also have opportunities.
Within a team, a cricket player must catch the attention of the captain at the right time if he can take a wicket and a fighter must get regular opportunities on the line if he wants to make a one-day cricket player impression.
The eyes of the voters are more complicated.
There were many who were better in the last season than, for example, James Anderson who seemed to be playing in the first test, even if Stephen Harmison explained himself for health and how the wind went into the net.
Anderson took 32 first-class wickets with every 33 runs to earn a position in this tour.
Chris Tremlett took only 29 with the same determined average, but both had their point of view and hoped for more.
Whether Shah or Bopara plays in Asgiriya Stadium can only be a visual question.
The choice could make the careers of both men, or it might make a little difference.
Four years ago in Sri Lanka, Garreth Batty played in each test and was successful in the first, with five weeks and 40 useful run, but Paul Collingwood was still struggling to fix himself, which created the break into a significant test click player and who, although he scored a double hundred against Australia, may still be underestimated.
It is likely that Graveney, Vaughan and Moores, after a further discussion of today's online presence at Asgiria Stadium, will follow their conservative instincts and excitement for Shah's greater experience with Boparas’ youth enthusiasm.
There are arguments for both.
For Shah, it speaks of its functioning and valuable 88 test-debüt-innings in Bombay, 43 first-class hundreds and only six of Bopara, who is 22 years younger, and an excellent balance against dedicated dogs.
But Shah only made ten runs in his two innings against the West Indies in the Lord's test, his homeitariana as a player from Middlesex, and this, in addition to his immediate departure from the voters as Vaughan, was healthy in order to take his position for the next game, seems to have taken the jump out of his battle, which was still open in Bombay.
On the other hand, the old man from Essex has a life-threatening pleasure.
He is not impressed by anything on a cricket platform and his attitude has since been brought to the point when he recently hit a four-wheeled vehicle in an exhibition for English Sponsor Volkswagen.
He suffered minor injuries and probably a shock, but the first thing he did was to get his vodafone out (of course also sponsored) and call his teammate Alastair Cook, who had watched this from the distance and excitedly say, "Have you seen it?".
Bopara is a much better field player, he walks his middle time with some effect here on the playing field, which seems to fit him and hits him with confidence and skill.
The right man to choose is one thing to choose the right time to choose another.
Maybe this is the actual art of the selection.
I wish to give Bopara his chance now, which doesn't mean that Shah may not be doing well if, as the teahouse from Ceylon suggests, he is the one that will play here this weekend.
Buses bring refugees back to work - and to fight Al-Quaida
The first busloads of Iraqi refugees from Syria arrived in Baghdad yesterday, with a stream of salesmen whose money or visas have gone out, and others who hoped the city would return to normality.
Some even returned to fight the rebels who had driven them out of their homes.
At the bus station Mansour, even before the arrival of 800 people from Damascus in an official government convoy by a dozen buses, the terminal was busy with refugees from Syria and Jordan who had returned to private transport.
"I decided to go to Syria after they killed many doctors in Baghdad," said Sabah Al-Qubaisi, a Sunni doctor.
"I came back today because of what I saw on television and what I read in the newspaper about what happened in Baghdad and how it would be safe now."
They say that the Mahdi army has stopped killing people," he said, regarding the soldiers' shield militias, Moqtada Al-Sadr, who has ordered his forces back at the present time.
Qassim al Atwani, a 38-year-old skitish teacher from the main Sunni part of Amariah, returned with his two children because he could not renew his Syrian visa and because the Iraqi regime was not allowed to work.
His Scythian neighbors in Amariyah called on him to tell him that a local, United States-supported militia had contributed to the move of Al-Qaida from its base to the west of the capital city, and forced him back.
One of the new settlers from Jordan was the leader of a Sunni and Schitian tribe who had been displaced from his home in Sleikh in northern Baghdad by an attack with hand grenades after he had called on his fellow citizens to fight Al-Qaidas.
He was back to fight.
"Two days ago some of my friends called me and told me that they started an anti-Al-Qaida militia in Slekh and that they needed my support and my boys.
That's why I'm back today," said Sabaah Alu Obeidi, 62.
Many reported that they had been kidnapped by the increasing peace in the capital since the rise in U.S. troops and the growth of local "groups of citizens" who were armed and defended their quarters in cooperation with the American military.
But more talk about being forced by visa problems and money-laundering in Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqis have fled in recent years.
Salaam al-Samarrai, a 51-year-old three-year-old father, expressed the general suspicion among the Exilants that Nouri al-Maliki, the Swiss Prime Minister who had asked the Syrian government to impose visa restrictions on refugees to force people to return.
More than two and a half million people have probably fled from the sectarian death squadrons in the country.
"We went well to al-Maliki Syria and the government no longer forced the Iraqis to give a visa to force them to return to Iraq," said the Sunni Renter.
"I can't trust a government that supports the criminals who burned down my house after I left."
Part of the reason for the retreat of violence is that Sunnites were distributed from skiing areas and vice versa, which led to the creation of many places where tensions have occurred.
There are fears that an urgent flow of refugees will be rescinded by sectarian tensions and there will be conflicts.
Small Saarland, good education
The smallest German country is leading in vocational training and is even glancing at the international level of its universities.
In a single field of education, the Saarland countries face the same deficit as the rest of the country.
"I've explained yesterday at 50th time that we are not French" - this slogan is picturing the smallest German country itself on its 50th birthday.
France and Luxembourg play a major role in the Saarland education system, which is located five times in the education monitor of the Institute of German Economy Köln (IW).
In this way, the schools are already closely co-operated from tradition with the neighbouring countries.
The University of Saarbrücken was founded in 1948 by the French.
To date, students can complete their study here with a double or even triple degree.
At the same time, the proportion of foreign students is 15.6 per cent.
However, the landscape also brings the Saarland in an average number to the universities - many of them without a conclusion at Gymnasium.
"In Saarland, the vocational education system is used," says Axel Plünecke, a education expert at IW.
More than five young people are entitled to study at a vocational school, so the Saarland is more than seven percentage points above the federal average.
The combination possibilities of vocational and academic training are also very well developed.
Measured by the population number, the equipment with double studies is the second largest in Germany.
Despite practical training and increasing demand, however, the number of engineers in recent years has declined by one third.
As a result, the Ministry of Education has now committed the universities to a marketing campaign for engineers.
"In the general education schools, after the first Pisa study, we have accepted several reforms," says a speaker from the Ministry of Education.
So the government conducted country-wide comparison tests.
In order to start learning early, the last Chinese year is free of charge - a model that also copies among other German countries.
If the benefits of the students improve consistently, future comparison studies will be shown.
In Pisa 2003, the proportion of risk students decreased from 29 to 20 per cent.
In general, however, Saarland was not as strong as other German countries.
The Bayers do better.
And because of the misery of the Saarland countries, foreign language knowledge is not measured at Pisa - it is possible to point out otherwise in this area.
Because the language of the neighbours is a Gymnasian obligation - even if the Saarland are not French.
Chávez sets the time
In Venezuela, the hours are usually different from the rest of the world.
On 9 December, President Hugo Chávez allowed time to return to the South American country for a half hour.
In Spain, therefore, Chávez will become the white figure.
As the Official Journal of Venezuela announced, a new law will then be imposed on the world time less than four and a half hours.
In this way, the South American state gets a time zone that does not exist in any other country in the world.
The U.S. enemy Chávez based his decision, inter alia, on the fact that the United States of the world had delayed the division in full hours.
In addition, Chávez announced on Wednesday (Ordertime) the destruction of relations with neighboring Colombia because of a dispute.
The left-wing nationalist said that while the conservative Alvaro Uribe President of Colombia remained, he would not hold any relations with the head of state or Colombian government.
"I can't do this anymore alone because of my worth," said Chávez, who is proposing a constitutional reform which the citizens of the old must vote in a referendum on Sunday.
With the reform, he would build his power in the country.
The resolution of the dispute was the decision of Uribes to withdraw Chávez's mandate for negotiations with Marxist rebels in Colombia, where it took place to release Geisels.
Uribe had condemned Chávez on Sunday with his decision "his face was broken".
Also in Spain is Chávez in all languages.
A new phone-Klingelton provides for Furore in the country: "Por que no te callas" (Why don't you keep the mouth) is the phrase that has already downloaded more than half a million people from the Internet.
He spoke to King Juan Carlos of Spain, who was the youngest Ibero-American gyppel of the constant calls of the left-wing police and was threatened by the mouth.
German Drunken 2007 Lohnminus
Despite the strong conjugation, German workers are expected to lose real wages after this year.
Experts called a whole set of reasons for their pessimistic forecast.
According to a calculation of the Hans-Böckler Foundation, the employees could actually count on the account less than in the previous year.
"This is because of the various wage developments, the increase in VAT and the price shift in food and energy," said Gustav Horn of the Institute for Macroeconomics and Conjuncturing Research of the "Image" series.
New charges could also be paid to employees in the unemployment insurance.
Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück said the "New Osnabrück newspaper", the planned retirement of unemployment insurance to 3.3 per cent for the current situation is quite correct and reasonable.
However, the Federal Labour Agency may no longer be able to ask for loans or grants when it has to ask for loans or grants, the SPD politician has been quoted.
On Tuesday, it was announced that the price explosion in foodstuffs and mineral oil products had taken place at the highest rate of inflation for 13 years.
The prices rise by 3.0 per cent in total in the year compared with the year.
Venus is the solemn twinling of the Earth
The Venus, despite its life-threatening atmosphere of the earth, has been thought to be more similar than ever: the European Space Sun "Venus Express" has discovered lightnings in the atmosphere and wind turbines on the Poles, as they occur on the earth in the winter.
For nearly three decades scientists have been convinced that it is turning on Venus.
Now the European probe "Venus Express" has come up with evidence - it sprayed electromagnetic waves along the edge of the atmosphere: The lights on the Venus shoot at about 56 kilometers from cloud to cloud, says Christopher Russell of the University of California in Los Angeles in the science magazine " Nature".
According to the famous "Usuppen theory", lightnings have caused life to rise on earth: whites should have responded to reactions in the ocean that led to the formation of amino acids, the building blocks of life.
Not on Venus: "If there were ever life there, it must have been in the very early history," explains Sean Solomon of the Carnegie Institute in Washington.
Today there must be almost something alive on the surface of Venus: the atmosphere is about a hundred times closer than the earth, it dominates between temperatures of 500 degrees.
"The Venus may be the devil's will of the earth, but it is a twinling," said Russell.
Why has the Venus, which is so similar to the earth in mass and size, affected such a completely different development, is the basic question of the Esa mission.
The beginning of Venus Express in November 2005 was a milestone for Venus research, since since since the early 1990s there has been no more sin to explore these planets.
The latest research results presented in several "Naturity" articles are not only emphasised by the researchers' view of the uniqueness of Venus within the solar system.
"They also show that the communities of our neighbouring planet are larger than the first adopted," says the Esa.
In addition to the well-known wind at Nordpol, the researchers also found a cloud strode on the South Pole, which is much faster.
The phenomenon is reminiscent of air currents on the earth's winter hemisphere, writes a researcher about Giuseppe Piccioni from the Italian Instituteto di Astrofisica Spaziale e Fisica Cosmica.
The second planet of the solar system has almost the same mass as the earth and is nearly as large with a diameter of 12.100 kilometers.
The planet also known as morning or evening stars orbits the sun in almost 225 days.
However, he is much slower about himself: a Venus day lasts 243 days.
Although the Venus with surface temperatures of 460 degrees Celsius and a pressure of 92 bar almost reminds the earth of the fact that both planets have been created under similar conditions.
Both collected water that remained on the surface of the ocean, but lost on the Venus in the world room.
And while carbon dioxide is fixed on the earth in carbon dioxide, it forms most of the atmosphere on Venus.
Köhler defends Merkel's encounters with the Dalai Lama
The Federal President Köhler wants an end to the party's dispute about the reception of the Dalai Lama in Canzleramt.
Indirectly he criticised the SPD for its attacks on the Chancellor after the September meeting.
Federal President Horst Köhler has taken care of Germany's view and has called on the great coalition to end the struggle to receive the Dalai Lama.
"We should not present the outside world with a nation united in this matter," Köhler said to the trade page.
At the same time, coal signaled understanding for the reception of the Dalai Lama by Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) in September.
"Human rights have universal validity for me, even if I have respect for the diversity of cultures," Köhler said.
Anyone who knew that Germany had to be in a sensitive balance in foreign policy, the Federal President stressed, but he took note of the proposal for a new Chinese policy.
"The Federal Chancellor has not taken away from the traditional one-China policy.
It also knows China," Köhler said.
Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier (SPD) had indirectly failed to recognize the receipt of the Dalai Lama and was therefore arrested from Union ranks.
Stonemeier had, among other things, accused the Union's "schauster policy" in foreign policy.
After receiving the Dalai Lamas in the Canzleramt, there were strong irritations in the German-Chinese relationship.
Thus, the Chinese leadership not only launched the German Minister of Finance Peer Steinbrück (SPD), but also launched the so-called strategic dialogue of both countries, according to information from the SPIEGEL.
Head of Government of China When Jiabao has now urged German Chancellor Angela Merkel to accept the Dalai Lamas as a mistake.
China resigned when European politicians officially received the religious leaders of the Tibetans, Wen Jiabao confirmed the Chinese position.
The actions and words of the Dalai Lamas showed that he was trying to expel Tibet and the other Tibetan region, which also includes other provinces today.
Schäuble warns against Krawalls like in France
Road strikes with the police, shootings, burning cars: Wolfgang Schäuble warns against Krawalls like in France.
It must be done so as not to bring social dissatisfaction into the streets in Germany, the Federal Minister asked.
Barikaden Fired, Randalliers shot at the police with scotch flints: After the heavy youth riots in France, Federal Minister Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) fears a similar development in Germany.
"We need to make sure that social explosives are not built up and forced into violence.
We have to take this seriously," he said the "New Press" that appeared in Hanover.
Not every young person comes right with the rapid change in social reality.
Bund, countries and municipalities have already worked with pressure to solve problems, said Schäuble.
This is not just about the integration of migrants.
"From the integration gap to the Islamic Conference, this is already the first success."
But it's too early for caution.
Schäuble also pointed out that in German cities there are no urban and sociological problems such as in France.
In the north fronts of Paris, young people had suffered serious street attacks with the police during the last night.
Cars and public buildings also burned in Toulouse.
The President of the Turkish Community in Germany, Kenan Kolat, requested greater integration efforts from the Federal Government.
In view of the Krawalle in France, Kolat warned of "neglecting effects".
The situation in Germany is not as fragile as in France.
However, there is a need for action.
Kolat points out that the unemployment rate for young people with a migration background is "on average" for less than 25 years.
In particular, more training should be provided.
Kolat stressed: "We must give the young people a perspective."
The President of the Turkish Community, however, added that in Germany there is more than "social control in the families" in France.
Many young people with a migration background also did not want to destroy what their parents built here.
Kolat said, "But we still have to be careful."
You have to give the young people "the opportunity to participate in work and training".
In the evening, however, it remained quite quiet in the Parisian Vorort Villaries-le-Bel.
Hundreds of thousands of police were in use, a helicopter overflew the area with radiation.
The competent authorities reported three arrests as well as a couple of burning trucks and cars.
Since the day before, an offer of about 1000 security forces has been provided for peace.
The police will take as long as necessary, Minister of Interior Michelle Alliot-Marie announced after a visit to the city.
On Tuesday night, about 80 police officers were injured at Krawallen in Villaries-le-Bel.
As a result, the rest falls on Toulouse.
The Krawalles collapsed in a traffic accident, where on Sunday two young people came to life.
According to the government's first findings, the police are not responsible for the death of young people.
In the realm of Angela Wolke
The real-time event of the Chancellor confirms that the coalition is at its end - and that it is no longer expected by itself.
In which country does this federal chancellor actually live?
After its incredible event in the general debate on the Federal Day, which was true and contained, one must say: not here - not in the country which you were finally to rule.
The claim that she was too much focusing on foreign policy, Angela Merkel referred back with an argly over-the-counter.
That was provincial, she said and showed that she didn't want to understand why the critics are going.
On the Bundesday, she has documented for all the most visible cases of their case.
There was neither concrete interest nor even a sense of feeling about the problems in the country.
Instead, Angela Wolke presented himself: a retired politician who is running into foreign policy and remains in danger.
For example, climate protection: There is no doubt about the decisions of Heiligendamm, but it does not say how the climate targets should be achieved in this country.
In general, the self-defense lobby - so much uncertainty would have failed the CDU chief two years ago.
Now she leans on the bottle that the excitement reaches people.
It thus damages her image as a pragmatist who solves the problems instead of beautiful the world.
But in the realm of Angela Wolke, internal political problems are a barrier.
Children's poverty and the concerns of the low-income workers?
She's got a few extra beds left for it.
It is remarkable how often she promises when it comes to child abuse.
Three races need markers to get a half-way straight out.
She's proud like a foreign country when it gets concrete.
Division Attack
In the YouTube debate of the Republican presidential candidates, the two favorites, Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney, are a hard exchange - and must now fear an external candidate.
The efforts of the candidates are already being made on the first topic.
He has made New York a "place of refuge for illegal immigrants", Mitt Romney suggests his opponent Rudy Giuliani.
This concert, on the other hand, with severe prejudices: "I would say his own house was a port for illegal people," rejected Giuliani and urged the former Governor of Massachusetts to have private immigrants without papers.
The candidates are launching an attack: because the Republican base still has no clear preferences, the eight presidential voters use the debate on CNN in particular to discredit their opponents.
The self-managed 30-second videos that Internet users have posted via YouTube are almost more than a word.
"With this kind of isolationism we have given Hitler power," John McCain suggests his opponent Ron Paul, who as the only one in the circle demands immediate withdrawal from Iraq.
Romney is also able to read the Levites strongly by the Vietnamese veterans when he refuses to judge the so-called "waterboarding", a method of control that is simulated by drinking as a folder.
However, that the main topics of the campaign are between Iraq's war and its folder debate, the public's reactions in St. Petersburg in Florida show.
When conservative values are always priced and future tax increases are rejected, the auditorium fires if necessary.
It shows again where the weaknesses of the two preferences lie.
"I've called myself at that time," Romney said circuitry and told the public about Abbitte that he was still a member of the operating system in 1994.
On the contrary, Giuliani comes to the Schlinger when he feels that he is asked to explain the Bible in a literal way.
Musharraf first ruled in Civil
One day after his return as chief of the army, the Pakistani Machthaber Musharraf was destroyed as President.
The end of eight years of military rule in Pakistan.
Pakistan's President Pervez Musharraf was destroyed on Thursday for another five-year term of office.
The Pakistani television broadcast left the ceremony in the presidential palace of the capital of Islamabad live.
Musharraf's duty is to observe the Constitution and act for the well-being of the nation.
On Wednesday he had handed over his office as chief of army to his trusted Ashfaq Kiyani and was therefore particularly impressed by the international pressure from the United States.
Eight years after his defeat in a bloodless military coup, the former General now reigns for the first time as the civil chief.
With his return as chief commander of the fighting forces, Musharraf had met a core requirement of the opposition and the West.
A further central requirement is an end to the exceptional situation that the Muharraf had attached on 3 November.
Soon after its destruction, Musharraf will, according to General State Secretary-General Malik Muhammad Qayum, raise the situation of exclusion and meet a further demand for the West.
In the past week, the Supreme Court of the State, who had held the Musharraf following the closure of the exceptional situation in early November, had rejected all charges against the contested re-election of the Head of State on 6 October.
Meanwhile, five soldiers were killed and four more injured during an attack on a military convoy in the northern tribal region of northern Waziristan.
According to an army speaker, the bomb exploded on a street near the border to Afghanistan.
The father of the Krauttrick will return
Germany's Supergroup of Sevenzigers is resounding: The three members of Harmonia took their consoles back to a concert in Berlin.
To the Revival, an average of her great time "Live 1974" appears.
At that time they were much more popular in the country.
The above-mentioned feeling then occurs in the form of three sets of lords at the evening table.
Everyone's got his helmets in front of himself, his cable, and especially his buttons.
Dieter Moebius spins in the white hemd at 63 years of age in the middle.
Left flanked by Michael Rother, 57 years old and owned by Laptop and guitar.
Right from the audience, Hans-Joachim Rodelius, 73, concentrates on the console.
Everyone has noises, even a beat.
And sometimes it's suddenly added to a traditional piece of music.
This does not seem to disturb the rulers themselves.
That band Harmonia resounds, under Krautrock lovers, has provided for some excitement.
Where you can understand here: Targeted questions indicate that the name was difficult by means of collective pop memory, but not so sustainable to lose this band for 32 years.
But why should the Germans not celebrate their live holidays from the 1970s?
Once again, what Krautrock is called unreputable, in England and America is becoming more common than in his own country.
When the music company gave the survivors of the Kölner Group Can 2003 the echo prize for life work, it was seen in the hall in questioning German pop viewers.
When the Red Hot Chili Peppers also thanked the La Düsseldorf and New Bands in Laudatio, the surprise could not have any limits.
At the concerts Michael Rother later jumped at the Red Hot Chili Peppers on the stage as an old partner.
The problem of ignorance at home and the explanation in foreign countries is one.
That is why the memory is already overwhelmed by harmonia because the trio existed for only two years and at this time also had a much lower effect than was assigned to them overnight by others.
Moebius and Rodelius had already performed with artist Conrad Schnitzler under the many promising names Cluster.
First, you played in the basement under the Berlin Schaubühne.
Then in Düsseldorf, for economic reasons for a plate label held by the church.
Rutherford had recently resigned from his military service and then played a call as a guitarist at New!, which at the time may have been the most radical German group.
In 1973, however, Roth followed the cluster musicians in Exil to Forst in Weserberg.
There, in the old Weserhof, a ruin from the 16th century, they lived as urban communists.
Less ideologically than in the Commune I, where Rodelius still had to suffer as a girl.
It's a very expensive artist's studio.
It appears that in the Springmüll there was also a drum of the harmony of harmonia Ottenstein and a name for the art.
Manches kept Harmony's party.
The first album was "Music by Harmonia" and the next "De Luxe".
Because so let and clear the music also sound, the band leaves material note.
The travel collection was not the only thing to find.
The CD "Live 1974" now appeared was mediated at a concert in Greece, before a short 50-headed record gallery, as one believes to be inspired.
At the time, it was his desire to force harmonia and to exercise on occasion.
For Rodelius and Moebius an endless demand.
The band declared its separation in 1975.
Rutherford landed in the Esoteric Spherical and ensured his existence with albums as "flamming hearts".
Cluster was re-lived in the eights and is more successful than it was every day.
The Greeser Live Album is Herbert Greeneyer to thank.
This plate company Greenland has set its goal of providing Krautrock as a pure German contribution to live music.
New! has already been dug out like Rodelius Solowerk.
The physical reconstruction of Harmony takes place in the Berlin House of Cultures of the World.
Publicly subsidised under the Waldronics Festival.
Julian Cope is the British, Altpunk and author of the "Krautrock Sampler" manual.
There's also Dr. Motte's Loveparade Erfinder.
With the entire band width of the impact of the Krautrock on the following pop music.
This will fill the spaces of the supergroup with harmony.
Brian Eno's set is playing with the most unique sound in the hall: "The only true music you hear is the future."
There are pictures showing producers with harmonia in the farm.
The training of the legend serves as projections of other black-white photographs from our devices.
The three veterans are once again infected with improvisation.
Not anymore, by putting microphones on the organ and on the instrument to unlock the instruments over self-contained devices.
Today, electronic music looks like electronic music.
Three-in-a-Row Tüftler.
Nor does the choir of the house change anything.
Under the direction of Barbara Morningsterns, under the sun cloud is heated and convinced and in a beautiful place with the emphasis "Aaaaaaaah!".
Krautrock was always a very English word.
It was never about Rock.
The roots were searched less in blue than in music schools (Can), technologies (power plant) or on the flight to art and social conventions (cluster).
Whoever calls here '68' doesn't have a lot of injustice, and harmony doesn't get out of it anymore.
Still the best of course is thoroughly covered at the stage.
Where does music start and when does it end?
This can protect one's nerves or flight moments from great happiness.
Richard Gere is simply not cynical enough
With "The Hunting Party" and "Morderic Peace", two more films are dealing with the Balkan war.
But they both don't believe it.
Either the concepts are too much on action and ballers or they are too rigid.
There, too, Richard Gere can't help in "The Hunting Party."
The good news is first: although the war criminals Karadzic and Mladic are still hiding in the mountains of the Balkans, but it is calculated there, in the dark back of the Bosnian war, that player Richard Gere has now been found.
We had lost the most beautiful man in the last eight years because too many netly important roles in women's welfare films and too many press conferences on the subject of Buddhism were a pleasure.
Now Richard Gere is suddenly the most important argument, "The Hunting Party - When the Jäger gets married" (Why should film titles always be as long and we should be as final leaders' tariff contracts?)
He gives a wonderful face-to-face appearance: In fact, his war reporter Simon Hunt has taken what could have been from Gere if the delivery room and the film industry were not so good: a man who has been behind all his best times for a long time, but who himself has kept a considerable remnant of his last charm as a terrible reminder of his fall.
But despite this storm, "The Hunting Party" sets together with the German production "Morderic Peace", which also begins this week, only the endless series of war-distributed Balkan films continues.
With "Morderic Peace" you can make a short process: the film is made by two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt), who save a Serb from Kosovo's heck protection, where he still loves himself.
Although it is a pleasure that not even the Serbs are represented here as the only roots of all the apples, the TV film loses itself too quickly in gambling and action.
There's a kind of "Alarm for Cobra 11" without a bus but for it war.
On the other hand, the "The Hunting Party" can be just an example of why it has never actually given a proper Balkan war film.
The story of three U.S. war reporters who are opening up to provoke the Serbian war crimes "the Fuchs", could have been a new "Apocalypse Now" with another director and another driver (both in the Staff Union Richard Shepard).
Because the stories seem to be shocking: Both times go small teams into the forest to accomplish something that the military cannot and both times will be a journey in the van.
One of the reasons for the shooting of "The Hunting Party" is that Simon Hunt is not simply allowed to be the cynicer below with heart when he first introduces us.
No, the script must contain him above all another romantic affair with a later murdered Muslim Bosnian.
Finally, "The Hunting Party" goes down the bank when the reporters within the last five minutes of the traffic procedure have achieved what Nato, the CIA and all the world's capitalists have not accomplished in five years: the war criminals have been arrested and the Muslim Bosnians have been released.
This is so bad that you want to call the International Court of Justice in The Hague for crimes against kinology.
The film has a deep human attachment to it.
He wants to call for Karadzic and Mladic to be free to walk, and he suspects the Americans and the French (here they are to be extremely few) that they are not being persecuted because of secret political talks.
But the good community and the bad are sometimes so similar that a famous court case comes into mind.
It says about the wood mask of an Asian demon at the work desk of the poet: "I can feel the lost strands, amusing: how hard it is to be bad."
Films like "The Hunting Party" have exactly such shellheads, but they don't know how hard it is to be good.
The problem is not limited to the generation of the Balkan war film.
Recently it has been reported in this newspaper that all the Iraqi films Hollywood were large flops.
You can add: There has never been a good South Africa film.
It's almost always true: If a star falls on the world's crisis guards or mines, something comes out like "Rangon" with Patricia Archette, "Jensiets of all borders" with Angelina Jolie or "Blood Diamonds" with Leonardo DiCaprio.
Perhaps all the conflicts are too close at this time.
It always had to pass decades before Hollywood could run a good film about the Holocaust with "Schildler's List".
Some films are still being filmed - which are now known as classic Vietnam works "The Deer Hunter", "Apocalypse Now" or "Full Metal Jacket" have not been celebrated in any way as masters.
But maybe today we know where each mass murder comes at the same time as two screens, too simply about the world's conflicts.
And that robs the drivebooks of the carefreeness it takes to tell good stories.
"His or not" or "the great dictator" have also become so good, because Lubitsch and Chaplin have not yet known how badly the Nazi regime really ruled.
Maybe you don't want to be good if you want to make good movies.
Perhaps you need to have the far-fetched artist view of Romance Lawrence Norfolk.
When asked about parallels between his historical novel "Lemprières Wordbook" and the Balkan War, he replied: "This is only because some things have never changed.
Large cities will always be extremely dangerous, people will always be killed in a cruel manner and war will always prevail in Yugoslavia."
By Boustate Critics for Olympic Absage
The resignation of the Mayor of Hamburg's application for Olympic Summer Games is based on strong criticism in politics and the economy.
Many still want to fight for the games on the water.
But by Boust, realism comes into play in assessing the opportunities.
The chief business director of the Chamber of Commerce Hamburg, Hans-Jørg Schmidt-Trenz, named a "not good for the place of business" on Wednesday.
No other project has recently emerged as much motivational forces in the city as the Olympics.
"Without this goal, the sport political movement would not be able to stand up to the same level."
Schmidt-Trenz asked the Senate not to finish the project but to find a new long-term approach to "it goes from a modified time line".
Mayor Ole of Boust stayed on Wednesday with previous statements, since the Hamburg Olympics were at least unrealistic by the year 2028.
"Not Hamburg decides on an Olympic application, but on the German Olympic Sports Union," said Bust WELT ONLINE.
He referred to the decision of the Sports Board expected for the beginning of December on an application by Munich for the Winter Games 2018.
"This preference means to us that we will not have realistic opportunities in the period from which we have been thinking about until 2028."
However, the dream wasn't out of range for all the time, he said of Beust.
The Hamburg Sportbund (HSB) regretted the statements of Beauts.
This will create the impression that Hamburg no longer wants to apply for Olympic games in the next 25 years.
"It is too early to create an opportunity by completing the plans at this time," HSB President Günter Ploß said on Wednesday.
A list of applications is also in opposition to the statement made by the Head of the Senate on the basis of an invitation to complete the general meeting of the German High School Sport Association.
There, from Buust, he named Hamburg's application for the University 2015 "not as a substitute" for Olympic Games in Hamburg.
The university sports association had only been appointed as the applicant city in the last week of Hamburg.
The SPD-Currency Group proposed that the Senate should not use valuable time for housing in Hamburg.
"The development of the small Grasbrook is delayed by the Senate for years because it has placed on the map of Olympia and has slowed down the building," said SPD coordinator Carola Veit and Jan Quast.
While the small Grasbrook SPD has always required an integrated planning for Olympics and later use, the CDU has put on the "Event factor" side by side.
The application for the 2012 Olympic Summer Games had been very excited in Hamburg since then.
However, Hamburg was divided into Leipzig.
These aren't Warhols kittens.
Whoever connects the terms of Sweden and woodkist, thinks of Ikea, but not Andy Warhol.
Or is it?
In Sweden, made wooden boxes are currently making dark shadows on Warhols' workshop.
Most of the 14th-century Brillo boxes listed there from "Type Stockholm" are counterfeits.
After the Swedish newspaper "Express" some months ago doubted the reality of Andy Warhols Brillo Boxes of 1968, internal research in Moderna Museum in Stockholm now comes to an interesting result: The six "Brillo Boxes", which the former museum director Pontis Hultén commissioned the Modern Museum 1995 as a gift, are copies - and probably the majority of the approximately one hundred more British Boxes from the "Type Stockholm" are in circulation on the international art market.
History is fascinating, a confusing generation of artistic and curative productions.
In 1964 Warhol created his first "Bryllo Boxes" in New York, painted wooden boxes based on the red-blue-white design of the pappcarton of the sea pulver "Brillo".
A exhibition of his works at the Modern Museum in 1968 - with Warhol's understanding - shows hundreds of Brillo-Kisten from Pappe: These were not from Warhol (from cost reasons) but were delivered directly from the Brillo Carthona factory.
It was not about works of art, it was about their models, just about exhibitions.
At the same time, Warhol in 1968 may have granted permission to produce some small Brillo wooden kits in Sweden, which were not exposed to modern museum.
Newspapers now speak of about fifteen boxes that were then entered into the art and auction history as authorized original-andy-warhol-Brillo-boxes with the name "Type Stockholm".
Some of them have reached over $100,000 on auctions.
The problem is now that the legendary museum director Pontis Hultén later falsely claimed that there were about a hundred wooden kittens produced and exposed in Sweden, which Warhol then left him.
In fact, Hulténs 105 kittens were produced in Malmö in 1990 for an exhibition in St. Petersburg.
Warhol was already dead for three years at this time.
Lars Byström, Chief Conservative at Moderna Museum, has also examined three of the six museum-contained Brillo boxes of Swedish private property, two of which were made in 1968 in Stockholm: their presspant plates were first grounded and then rolled off, and white oil was painted with a brush.
The structure of the copies from 1990 is against the fact that the color of a painting roll was placed directly on the press panel – it is not about oil but about Acrylic color.
"These boxes were not authorized by the artist and should be removed from the official list of Andy Warhols Brillo Boxes," said the director of the Moderna Museum, Lars Nittve, "If the 'Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board' in New York does not come to another conclusion, the modern Museum will classify the six boxes in its collection as copies/exhibitory material."
Already in July, the Authentication Board announced that it would follow the "hard charges" that will be raised in matters of sea powder.
However, since then it has been found in an unpretentious wedge.

Loyal government troops are closing the area around the hotel.
The President introduced an urgent meeting of the Security Council.
The national security adviser Norberto Gonzales condemned the presence of soldiers.

"We call the people to join us."
General Danilo Lim, who previously authorized the elite unit of Scout Rangers, said other Army units wanted to join the march in a short time.
Government critics had called for large demonstrations against the President for Friday.
Your government has been overestimated for months by corruption prevention.
Manilas Financial District has already been the main site of the attempted killing of about 200 military members against Arroyo.
The revolt broke out within 24 hours of the refusal of the army to join.
Since 1986 there have already been at least seven fire attempts against democratically elected governments in the Philippines.
