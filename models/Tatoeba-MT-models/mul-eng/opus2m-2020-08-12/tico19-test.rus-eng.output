A rapidly growing indicator of the cumulative incidence of coronary infection (COVID-19) in the European Union and in Great Britain from 1 January to 15 March 2020.
The cumulative incidence of coronary infection (COVID-19) has similar trends in the countries of the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, thus confirming that, despite various stages of development in different countries, COVID-19 pandemics are growing in all countries.
In view of the experience of Italy, countries, hospitals and intensive treatment offices, there is a need to increase the level of readiness to influence patients with COVID-19 who will need treatment and, in particular, intensive therapy.
On 31 December 2019, a number of cases of pneumonia of unknown etiology were identified in Khanh Province of Hobey.
On 9 January 2020, the China Centre for Disease Control and Prevention reported that the cause of the infection is a new type of cornavirus known as a coronavirus of type 2 severe respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
Since then, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 has been called cornovirus infection (COVID-19).
According to today's available data, approximately 80 per cent of COVID-19 people are infected in an easy form, i.e. in the form of respiratory infections with or without pneumonia, while most patients are cured.
About 14 per cent of COVID-19 cases develops into a more severe form with the need for hospitalization, and in the rest 6 per cent adopt a critical form when intensive therapy is required.
The mortality rate of patients treated with COVID-19 is approximately 4%.
This study analyzes the trends in COVID-19 cumulative disease in each country of the European Union (EU)/European Economic Area (EEA) and in Great Britain and compares them to trends in the Chinese province of Hobbey.
We also compare the current number of cases of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and Great Britain with data on Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
Cases of COVID-19 in EU/EC and UK
Since the outbreak in China, COVID-19 has spread to other countries, and the rest of the COVID-19 pandemic is currently developing according to the same dynamic as in China.
On 11 March 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) announced the COVID-19 pandemic.
Mr. Spiteri (Spiteri) and his colleagues reported on the first confirmed cases of COVID-19 disease in Europe, which met the criteria for WHO identification of diseases.
Three first confirmed cases in the EU/EEA were registered in France on 24 January 2020; all three patients returned from the Chinese province of Hobby.
As at 15 March 2020, COVID-19 cases were identified in all 30 EU/ECE countries and Great Britain, with 39,768 cases of infection and 1,727 deaths, of which 17,750 cases, including 1,441 deaths, were reported for the period from 31 December 2019 to that date, with only one Italy.
Definition of cumulative quantity and cumulative disease COVID-19
The European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC) updates daily at 8:00 a.m. data on the number of registered cases COVID-19 in each country of the world received from official sources such as the Ministry of Health of these countries, national and regional health management bodies and WHO.
These data are used to analyse trends in the EU/EEA and in Britain and to compare them with the Italian data.
As an indicator of the spread of active COVID-19 cases, the cumulative disease COVID-19 has been calculated for 14 days, taking into account the normal course of COVID-19 in each EU/EEA country and Great Britain for the period from 1 January to 15 March 2020.
We also presented the cumulative number of cases recorded in each country at 8:00 p.m. on 15 March 2020, compared with data on Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
Trends in the development of COVID-19 in EU/EU countries and Great Britain
The trends in the development of COVID-19 cumulative disease for the 14-day period in the EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom were generally consistent with trends observed in the Chinese province of Hobbey (see Figure 1).
The cumulative disease COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and in Great Britain started to grow around 21 February, and a sharp drop of this indicator (additional material) occurred on 28 February 2020.
This was mainly due to a sharp increase in the number of registered cases of disease in Italy, but similar trends have been observed in all other EU/ECE countries and in Great Britain to increase the cumulative disease COVID-19 (additional material).
Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of cases of COVID-19 disease in EU/EEA countries and Great Britain compared with the same indicator for Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
According to these data, the total number of cases already recorded at 8:00 a.m. on 15 March in 15 other EU/EU countries and in Great Britain is similar to the number established in Italy almost three weeks earlier.
Our results show the rapid increase in the number of COVID-19 registered cases in the EU/EEA and Great Britain.
The trends observed in COVID-19 cumulative disease suggest that the pandemic is developing at a comparable rate in all countries.
Despite the various stages in various countries, the different response measures taken by national public health authorities, and possibly different criteria for the recognition of cases of disease and different patient selection rules for the analysis of the existence of COVID-19, including the “surpassing” test.
In early March 2020, doctors in the affected regions of Italy reported that about 10 per cent of COVID-19 patients needed intensive treatment, and the media noted that hospitals and intensive treatment offices in these regions had already been fully completed.
Currently, only 6 % and 1 % of COVID-19 patients are available at the hospital and/or intensive treatment office in the EU/EEA, respectively.
However, a systematic collection of such information is necessary in order to supplement the current monitoring data for which the number of recorded cases and the number of deaths are recorded.
According to a study conducted in 2010-2011, there is a significant breakdown in the number of cases in intensive treatment and intensive care offices in Europe: from 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 in 100 000 in Portugal.
This means that other countries may have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 coca in intensive treatment and intensive care offices for over 100,000 people in 2010-2011).
The sixth updated ECDC report on the risk assessment results of COVID-19 presents the modelling of health-care systems load scenarios with assessment data for the hospitalization of infected COVID-19 in each EU/EEA country and in Great Britain, where the risk of lack of available cocaine in intensive therapy offices exceeds 90 per cent.
Since cases are currently grouped by certain regions of the EU/ECE and the United Kingdom, hospitals and intensive treatment offices usually serve the population of a particular territorial group, information on cases of infection and the number of cats in intensive treatment offices is recommended to provide units of level 2 of the territorial unit nomenclature for statistical purposes (NUTS-2).
Italy's experience and current trends in other countries show that COVID-19 pandemics are developing in the EU/EEA and Great Britain.
Therefore, countries, hospitals and intensive treatment offices should be prepared for the long-term SARS-CoV-2 contact infection scenario and for the increase in patients with COVID-19 who need medical assistance and, in particular, intensive therapy, which can be observed in the affected regions of Italy.
As reported in the latest ECDC report on the results of the risk-expression assessment, the SARS-COV-2 has an operational, preventive and comprehensive approach with a follow-up approach to minimizing the effects, as it may not be enough time to think, take and adjust its response measures if such measures are not previously taken.
The risk assessment report also lists public health measures to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.
The countries have only a short period of time in which they can intensify their control efforts to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce the burden on their health systems.
If not, in the next few days or weeks, the EU/EEA health system will deal with the influence of patients who will need intensive therapy.
The outbreak of coronary infection in 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe severe severe respiratory syndrome (SARS) type 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has become a human tragedy: more than 3,000 people have been killed at this time in China and other countries of the world and more than 80,000 have been infected.
Similar to the GMO virus SARS-CoV caused by the development of a severe severe respiratory syndrome in thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 may also be transmitted from flies and may cause similar symptoms using a similar mechanism.
However, COVID-19 is less severe and less mortality than SARS, but it is much more vulnerable and vulnerable to older people than young people and men than women.
In response to the sharp increase in the number of new diseases publications in this article, an ongoing and comprehensive review of the rapid development of the research subject is proposed.
We will consider key aspects of epidemiology, etiology, viruses, diagnostics, treatment, predictation of further flow and prevention of this disease.
Although the answers to many questions still need to be found, we hope that this review will help to understand and eliminate the threat of illness.
The spring (China's New Year), which fell on 25 January 2020, was an unprecedented and unforgettable event for all Chinese people who were urged to stay home throughout the holiday and for many weeks after it.
In view of the high level of coronavirus (CoV) caused by severe severe respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreaks in 2003, the World Health Organization (WHO) called it the SARS-CoV-2 virus on 11 February 2020 and the associated disease was COVID-19 (COVID-19).
The epidemic began in the Chinese city of Khan and spread rapidly throughout the country, then almost 50 other countries of the world.
More than 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 were identified on 2 March 2020, more than 40,000 patients were cured and more than 3,000 were killed.
The WHO warns that COVID-19 is “the enemy number one for society” and potentially more dangerous than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nei.gov/pubmed/), more than 200 publications on COVID-19 have been published, including articles on his virology, epidemiology, epidemiology, diagnosis and treatment, starting from the first report of 7 January 2020, which identified the traceability of the virus identified by a number of patients.
This review is an attempt to summarize the results of studies in the new and rapidly developing area.
As far as possible, we are trying to compare COVID-19 with SARS and another caused cornavirus disease, a coronavirus of the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), which occurred in 2012.
We will also discuss the facts of prevention and predictation of disease at this time as well as some other issues that are not less serious.
Coronavirus has traditionally been associated with pathogens that are not fatally dangerous to humans and are mainly due to approximately 15 per cent of general respiratory diseases 4.
However, in this century we have faced two cases of highly pathogenic human coronavirus, a serious severe respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) and a coronavirus of the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV), which caused serious diseases in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, and have spread to many other States at an alarming level of disease and mortality.
Consequently, the current COVID-19 is the third outbreak of coronary infection in human history.
As shown in Figure 1.1, the report on the cases of pneumonia of unknown origin first appeared in the National Committee on NRC Health from 31 December 2019.
The genetic sequence of the virus was released seven days later.
On 15 January 2020, the first death case was registered in Mr. Khan.
At the time, the epidemic was rapidly spreading in neighbouring cities, provinces and countries.
On 20 January, it became known about the infection of workers, which allowed the possibility of human transmission of the virus.
On 23 January, the quarantine was introduced and the city's public transport stopped.
On 24 January, according to the first clinical study on this disease, 21 out of 41 patients with confirmed coronary viral infection had direct contact with the market for marine products in H. Khan, which was considered to be the starting point for spreading the infection from unknown animals.
On 30 January WHO announced that the outbreak of coronavirus was a global emergency in the field of public health.
At the time of the preparation of the report, disease had spread throughout China and had already spread to about 50 other countries around the world (see Figure 2).
Taking into account the urgent development of the situation, the final level and the level of emergency risk still needed to be determined.
On 11 February 2020, a multicentre clinical study involving 8,866 patients, including 4,021 COVID-19 confirmed patients, presented the following updated development picture of the epidemic (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bbbbdA).
The infection of SARS-CoV-2 was committed by all age groups but mainly by people from 30 to 65 years of age.
Almost half (47.7%) of those infected were over 50 years of age, a total of only 20 years of age and only 14 of those infected were not yet 10 years old.
Infection of SARS-CoV-2 among men higher (0.31/100 000) than among women (0.27/100 000).
COVID-19 was distributed mainly in the province of Hobay and in nearby regions.
On average, from the time COVID-19 symptoms occurred, 5 (2-9) days passed.
The incubation period was on average 4.8 (3.0 - 7.2) days.
From the time of symptoms until death on average, 9.5 (4.8-13) days passed.
The basic product index (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05), and the corrected R0 was 2.23-4.82.
As of 23 January 2020, there has been an exponential increase in the number of infected persons who have been in contact with large transport to attend the New Year's celebration.
The mortality of patients with confirmed diagnosis was 1.44 per cent (95 per cent CI: 1.10-1.86 per cent), and the adjusted mortality rate among patients was 3.06 per cent (95 per cent CI: 2.02-4.59 per cent).
Three main risk factors for COVID-19 infection were: gender (male), age (≥60) and severe cases of pneumonia.
Coronavirus is a sub-family of major obese viruses containing either one or more meaningful NNAs.
They can be divided into four types, e.g. alpha, beta, gamma and deltas from which alpha and beta-coron viral infections are known to affect people.
In the case of cancer virus-type SARS and MERS glycoprotein of ophthalmic fibrosis (S), the cell receptors of type 2 angiotensin-reversive plant (ACE2) and dipethidylpepidase-4 (DPP4) are associated, respectively, with membrane synthesis.
Citoplasm is released by the virus NNC gene; following the replication of the virus gene, the genome RNC together with the glucoproteins and nucleopaside proteins generates virus-containing tissues that then release from the membrane cell by releasing the virus.
The first reports on the genetic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 appeared on 10 January 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 has been found to be a new type of beta-coronovirus, which, by 99.98 per cent, corresponds to 10 successive samples collected in the first outbreak of disease on the Huananian marine market in Khan.
Genetic SARS-CoV-2 is closer to SARS-CoV than MERS-CoV.
With the help of an electronic microcopy of the SARS-CoV-2, ultratonous human respiratory tract was detected.
It was found that the human plant ACE2 is a receptor for SARS-CoV-2 as well as for SARS-CoV.
However, S-protein SARS-CoV-2 is related to the human ACE2 enzyme rather than in the case of SARS-CoV, which explains that SARS-CoV-2 causes patients less severe disease than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 may also generate an unknown short-lived protein coded with orf3b and a secreted protein coded with orf8.
The Orf3b virus SARS-CoV-2 may play some role in the pathogenicity of the virus and suppress the expression IFNb; however, Orf8 does not contain any known functional domain or motive.
On 18 February 2020, a collection of authors, led by Zhou (Zhou), submitted reports on the crio-electronic Tomography of the ACE2 complete-size farm structure with a B0AT1 component with a B0AT1 aminoquislot transporter.
They found that this complex of open and closed conformities was collected as a diameter and that the ACE2-B0AT1 complex could bind two S-proteins, which served as evidence for the identification and infection of coronavirus.
B0AT1 may become a therapeutic tool for carrying out a medical screening for SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Origin and intermediate trade
It is known that both the source and SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV were flies from which viruses transmitted man through tissues and vertebrates, respectively.
A philogenetic comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with other coronaviruses has established that the first SARS-CoV-2 companies are flies since the new virus is 96% identical to two similar coronaviruses, namely coronaviruses of SL-CoVZX45 and SL-CoVZX21.
However, it remains unknown what has become an intermediate business, which has enabled the virus to overcome the type barrier and to afflict the human being; the means of transmission must also be clarified.
Mr. Zzi (Ji) and his colleagues suggested that the carriers of the virus from flying flies to human were snakes, during which homologous recombination occurred in S-protein.
According to their study, Chinese scientists from Guangjuu suggested that the pangoline, long-term dairy that is eaten by mice and which are often used in traditional Chinese medicine, are potential intermediate markets SARS-CoV-2, based on a 99 per cent genetic relationship between pangoline and SARS-CoV-2.
However, the difference in 1 % between the two genes is still very large, so it is considered that the final results have not been obtained with specific evidence (see Figure 33).
The physical and chemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 in most are still unknown.
In laboratory conditions SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV may live for 48 hours in the dry environment and up to 5 days at temperatures below 20 °C and 40 to 50 % humidity.
SARS-CoV-2 may have similar properties.
It is known that SARS-CoV-2 is sensitive to ultraviolet and burns up to 56 °C for 30 minutes; effective blocking of the virus activity may be epher, 75 per cent ethyl alcohol, disinfectives, peroxide, chlorofor and other soluble solvents but not chlorogexidine.
The human population in general is not immune to SARS-CoV-2, so people are susceptible to the new virus.
There are currently no data on detailed immunological studies conducted at SARS-CoV-2.
Thus, we can only refer to earlier studies of other coronavirus, primarily SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (see Figure 4.4).
As a rule, the virus has begun to recognize the immune system of the infected person by image-recognised receptors (ODRs), including C-type, Toll-like receptors, NOD-like receptors and RIG-I-like receptors.
By means of various mechanisms, the virus causes the expression of inflammation, dendrite cells and the synthesis of Type I interferons that inhibit the spread of the virus and speed up macrophasis with respect to virus antigens.
However, N-white SARS-CoV may avoid immune reactions.
An adaptive immune response is soon included in the fight against the virus.
T-lympocytes, including T-cells CD4+ and CD8+, play an important role in the protection of the organism.
T cells CD4+ stimulate virus-specific antibodies in B cells and T cells CD8+ directly kill infected cells.
T-Helfers produce anti-inflammatory cytokines that help protect cells.
However, coronavirus may inhibit T cells by causing their scheduled death.
Human immunities including components such as C3a and C5a and antibodies also play an important role in the fight against viral infection.
For example, antibodies from the healthy patient neutralized MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, the immune system's hyperaction will result in local education of a large number of free radicals, which could result in serious damage to both the light and other organs, and the worst scenario would lead to a polyurethane deficiency and even death.
SARS-CoV-2 infection, for which there is a classical phenomenon, is more likely to affect older people with associated pathology and pregnant women.
The likelihood of infection above is for people who are affected by a large number of viruses or who are immune.
According to the study of the first 425 cases of infection in Mr. Khan, the average incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 is from 1 to 14 days, mainly from 3 to 7 days.
However, a study of 1,099 cases showed that the average incubation period was 3 days, with an explosion from 0 to 24 days.
A later survey based on the demographic data of 8,866 cases showed that the incubation period was 4.8 (3.0 - 7.2) days.
For health authorities, it is very important to adjust the timing of quarantine measures, taking into account the exact duration of the incubation period, which will prevent the spread of the virus by infected subjects with non-communicable diseases.
The general practice was a 14-day quarantine for persons who had contact with the virus or infected virus.
Should the quarantine be extended for 24 days?
The main and primary symptoms of COVID-19 are often high temperatures which may be the only occurrence or accompanying other symptoms, such as dry cough, difficulty breathing, muscle pain, headache, headache, pain in the throat, dizziness, chest pain, diarrhoea, cough and dizziness.
In some patients a week after the start of the disease, nausea and/or hypoxia were observed.
In severe cases, the disease was rapid and patients developed severe respiratory disease, septic shock, metabolic acidosis and coagulopathy.
Patients with high temperature and/or symptoms of respiratory disease and acute lubricant should check the virus for early diagnosis even if there are no pathology in breast cell photosynthesis.
A demographic study conducted at the end of December 2019 showed the following symptoms prevalence indicators: 98% high temperature, 76% dry cough, 55% dry and 3% diarrhoea; 8% of patients required artificial ventilation.
Similar results have been obtained from two recent studies of family infection and transmission of virus from non-communicable infected people.
Similar results were obtained in 2012 in the study of patients with MERS-CoV with major symptoms of high temperature (98%), dry cough (47%) and nausea (55%).
However, 80 per cent of these were required for artificial ventilation, which was higher than that of COVID-19 patients, and corresponds to a higher mortality rate than COVID-19.
Patients with MERS also had diarrhoea (26 per cent) and throat pain (21 per cent).
The main symptoms of patients with SARS are high temperatures (99–100%), dry cough (29–75%), nausea (40–42%), diarrhoea (20–25%) and throat pain (13–25%), and artificial ventilation is required in 14–20% of patients.
On 14 February, deaths from COVID-19 amounted to 2 per cent, and the total number of confirmed cases in the world reached 66,576.
Compared to this indicator, the mortality from SARS to November 2002 was 10 per cent of 8,096 confirmed cases.
In the case of MERS, a demographic study conducted in June 2012 showed a death rate of 37 per cent of 2,494 confirmed cases.
As a result of a previous study, the baseline product (R0) for SARS-CoV-2 was determined at the level of 6.47 at 95 % confidence interval (CI) within 5.71-7.23 while R0 for SARS-CoV was in the range only from 2 to 4.
The SARS-CoV-2 comparison with MERS-CoV and SARA-CoV on symptoms, mortality levels and R0 is shown in Table 1.1.
The above indicators show that SARS-CoV-2 is higher than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but the level of mortality in the case of a new virus lower than the last two.
It will therefore be much more difficult to hold the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic than the MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV epidemic.
The classic event often occurs within one family or group of people gathered together for some reason or on some transport such as a cross-line.
Patients often visited Mr. Khan or other affected regions, lived there or contacted the infected or sick during the last two weeks before the start of the disease.
However, according to the data provided, people may be carrying the virus without any symptoms for more than two weeks, while patients treated from the hospital may be carrying the virus again, and this is an alarming signal for an extension of the quarantine period.
An early stage in patients with normal or reduced leukocyte count (especially lymphocytes) in peripheral blood.
For example, 1,099 patients with COVID-19 had lymphophapic leukocytes < 4x109/L, including leukocytes < 1x109/L, as well as elevated asparagine aminotransferase and virus.
In some patients, elevated levels of paper enzymes, muscle enzymes and myoglobin were found in the blood, and in most patients, elevated levels of C-reactive protein and hydroxycytosis were observed in the blood.
In patients with severe D-Deminar disease, the fibrin deficiency product present in the blood has been increased and the number of lymphocytes has been steadily decreased.
In most COVID-19 patients, pathology was detected in the X-ray study of the breast cell, characterized by disproportionate darkness with both sides or light glass types.
Patients often develop typical pneumonia, severe pain of the mild to severe respiratory disease (ORD).
In the development of the OCTs, uncontrolled combustion, fluid loss and progressive fibrosis result in significant gas spills.
Pneumocydis function of Types I and II lowers the level of surface-active compounds and increases the surface load, thus reducing the capacity of the people to increase easily and increase the risk of low-density.
Thus, the worst results of X-ray studies are often the most serious cases of disease.
On 18 February 2020, the first COVID-19 pathological analysis demonstrated the release of pneumocytics, the formation of gial membranes and intermittent lymphocyte infiltration, and multiple syncitic cells in patients who died from the disease, corresponding to the pathology of viral infection and the ODS and similar findings in patients with SARS and MERS.
As the main criterion for the diagnosis of COVID-19, RNC SARS-CoV-2 was used by a polymeric-temperature reaction with reverse transcriptase (PCR with reverse transcriptase).
However, given the high level of false results that could speed up the development of the epidemic, from 13 February 2020 in China, diagnosis was started on the basis of clinical manifestations (not more than the reverse transcriptase CPC).
The situation with SARS diagnosis was similar.
Thus, data on disease, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests and results of X-ray studies are critically important for effective diagnosis.
On 14 February 2020, Mr. Feng Zhang (Feng Zhang) described the SHERLOCK-based methodology for detecting SARS-CoV-2; this methodology allows for the identification of synthetic fragments of SARS-CoV-2 with a range of 20 × 10-18 mol/l to 200 × 10–18 mol/l (10–100 copies per microlitre of the original model) with an indication of less than once using complex equipment.
This new approach, if it successfully checks clinical preparations, can significantly increase the sensitivity of tests and facilitate their conduct.
Due to the lack of experience with an unknown cancer virus, doctors may primarily provide patients with COVID-19 only supportive therapy while trying to use any therapeutic methods that have been used or proposed in the treatment of other cancers such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, as well as other viral diseases (Table 2.2).
These therapeutic methods include the current or potential use of antiviral medicinal products, immunodeficiency factors, steroids, plasma of healthy patients, traditional Chinese medicine and psychological support.
It was suggested that even plasma should be used in healthy patients.
Pharmaceutical companies are still developing antibodies and vaccines to fight the virus.
At the initial stages SARS-CoV-2 attacks in particular, and possibly to a lesser extent, other organs that express ACE2, such as iron ore and lead.
Nevertheless, violations of the work and rejection of respiratory organs are the main threat and cause of death for patients.
Thus, support for respiratory function, including general oxygen therapy, high oxygen concentration, non-invasive artificial ventilation and invasive mechanical ventilation, which is directed depending on the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms need support in the form of extracorporal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), modified method of extrapulmonary blood treatment used to treat a life-threatening risk of heart or respiratory failure.
In addition, the important importance for patients with SARS-CoV-2 is the maintenance of aqueous balance, prevention and treatment of secondary infections and septic shock, as well as the protection of vital organs.
It is known that cytokine fever is a consequence of the hyperreaction of the immune system of patients infected with SARS and MERS.
The cytokine is a form of a systemic combustion process that develops in response to the cytokine series, including TNFα, IL-1b, IL-2, IL-6, IFNA, IFNb, IFNG and MCP-1.
These cytokines cause immunities to release a large number of free radicals, which are the main cause of development of the OBD and polyorganization.
In the treatment of cytokine strains, particularly in patients with severe conditions, it is important to increase immunity.
Corticosteroids and tocilizumab were used to treat cytokine strains, monoclonal antibodies serving as an interleicin-6 inhibitor.
Other methods of cytokine therapy based on ammonia include modulation of immune response to T-cell control; blockade of the development of cytokines IFN-g, IL-1, and TNF; yanus kinase pressure; blinatumumab, cytokine 4 inhibitors and hystondecatetala inhibitors.
In order to reduce the seriousness of the effects of the combustion process on the treatment of SARS viruses, steroids are widely used as immunodeficiency agents.
However, steroids at large doses do not benefit from the treatment of severe harm to patients with SARS and COVID-19.
On the contrary, they can cause serious side effects, especially ascular osteonecrosis, which significantly undermine forecasts.
However, short courses of corticosteroids in small and medium doses are recommended for careful use in the treatment of COVID-19 patients in critical conditions.
There is no evidence of effective antiviral therapy at the time of the preparation of this document.
However, the internal administration of rhemedesivir, a nucleotide analogue, was effective in treating an American patient with COVID-19.
Remdesivir is a recently developed anti-virus product originally developed by Gilead to treat diseases caused by Ebola and Marburg virus.
Later remedexivir also demonstrated the possibility of straining other viruses with single-stage NNC, including MERS and SARS viruses.
Based on these data, Gilead provided this medical component of China to conduct male studies in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, and the results of these studies were not tolerated.
In addition, baricitinib, a-interferon, lopinavir/ritonavir and ribavirin were proposed as possible options for treatment of patients with severe respiratory symptoms.
Combination treatment with lopinavir/ritonavir may be accompanied by diarrhoea, cough, vomiting, diarrhoea and other side effects.
The interaction of these preparations with other medicinal products for patients should be monitored with caution.
Plasma of healthy patients and the development of antibodies
Blood collection in patients treated with infectious diseases has been used for a long time to treat other patients suffering from the same disease or to protect the health of the population.
In fact, the blood of healthy patients often contains relatively high antibodies to fight pathogens.
An antidote is an immunoglobulin produced by B lymphocytes to fight pathogens and other alien objects; they recognize individual pathogen molecules and neutralise them directly.
Based on this assumption, plasma from the blood samples of patients treated with COVID-19 was administered, which then weighed 10 weights to patients with disease.
Within 24 hours, their symptoms improved, the intensity of inflammation and viral load decreased, as well as increased blood oxygen saturation.
However, in order to propose a mass application of this method before specific therapy is carried out, it is necessary until the verification has been carried out and the explanations have been made.
In addition, some plasma-related deficiencies should be carefully studied taking into account the therapeutic effect.
For example, antibodies may overstimulate the immune system and cause cytokine emissions syndrome, which, given toxicity, poses a potential risk to life.
Concentration of antibodies in blood is usually very low and plasma is required to treat patients in critical conditions.
It is not enough to develop and produce specific antibodies quickly enough to combat the global epidemic.
Thus, it is more important and practical to assign B-cells to healthy patients and determine the genetic code of effective antibodies or to use screening to find effective antibodies against critically important whites of the virus.
So we can move to the mass production of antibodies.
For thousands of years, Chinese people have used traditional medicine to treat various diseases.
However, its effectiveness is largely dependent on the combination of many components of the formula, which is different from the diagnosis of disease based on Chinese traditional medicine.
Most of the effective components are still unknown or have unexplained activity, as it is difficult to identify and verify these components or their optimal combination.
In the current absence of effective specific treatment COVID-19, Chinese traditional medicine has become one of the main alternative methods of treating patients with mild and moderate severity of symptoms or for patients treated after a severe stage of illness.
For example, Cho Feng Zze Du (Shu Feng Jie Du) and Lian Hua Cin Wen (Lian Hua Qing Wen) capsules were recognised as effective in the treatment of COVID-19.
The largest proportion of patients with COVID-19 were observed in several provinces of China where Chinese traditional medicine was used in treatment of 87 per cent of patients, including in Ghana (63.7%), Ninse (50 per cent) and Huanë (50 per cent), while the Chinese traditional medicine used only about 30 per cent of COVID-19 patients, the lowest percentage of patients (13 per cent).
However, this is quite a comparison, since the assessment should take into account the number of other factors, such as the number of patients and the degree of severity of their disease.
On 18 February 2020, Mr. Boli Zhang (Boli Zhang) and his colleagues published research materials that compared treatment exclusively to Western medicine and combined treatment with Western medicine and Chinese traditional medicine.
They found that time-limits for normalizing body temperature, eliminating symptoms and providing medical assistance under the station were significantly lower in patients treated with combination methods of Western and Chinese traditional medicine than in patients treated only by Western methodologies.
Most surprising is the fact that the proportion of patients who began to develop symptoms (from mild to severe) was significantly lower in the group treated by combining Western and Chinese traditional medicine than in the group treated only by Western methodologies (7.4 per cent compared to 46.2 per cent), and the mortality rate in the first group was lower than in the second (8.8 per cent compared to 39 per cent).
Nevertheless, the effectiveness and safety of traditional Chinese medicine still require more closely controlled studies conducted in large-scale and large-scale regions.
It is also of particular interest to be able to describe the mechanism of action and to explain the aspects of the effectiveness of components used in Chinese traditional medicine methodologies or their combination.
Patients who suspect or confirm the existence of COVID-19 mainly experience severe fear of acute and even fatal disease, while people who are closed to quarantine also experience shock, loneliness and extreme shock.
In addition, symptoms of infection such as diarrhoea, hypoxia and cough, as well as side effects of treatment, such as corticosteroids, may cause more anxiety and psychological stress.
Early stages of the outbreak of the disease caused by the SARS virus reported a number of psychiatric disorders, including chronic depression, increased anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotor awakening, psychotic symptoms, delinquency and even suicidal behavior.
Compulsory monitoring of contacts and quarantines, including measures taken by health authorities to prevent the COVID-19 epidemic, can enhance people ' s concern and sense of guilt related to the spread of infection, quarantine and social stigma on their families and friends.
In this regard, psychological and psychiatric assistance should be provided to COVID-19 patients, suspects and contactants, as well as to all the other people it requires.
In the context of psychological support, multi-profile psychiatric assistance should be developed, clear and accurate information on the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic and treatment plans should be provided, and professional electronic devices and applications should be used to avoid close personal contact.
Effective vaccines play an important role in halting the spread of infectious animals and infected people into susceptible economies and are often used in addition to antiviral therapy used to prevent infections caused by new viruses.
Work has been done on the establishment of vaccines based on S-protein, aimed at developing long-term and high-acting neutralising antibodies and/or protection against SARS-CoV.
In animal studies, live weakened vaccines from SARS virus were developed.
However, prior to the initiation of clinical studies, the effectiveness of these potential vaccines should be further determined in the natural context of their use in elderly patients, the model of mortality and the level of protection against zone virus infection.
The possible reason is that SARS virus disappeared 17 years ago, and no new case has been reported since.
At the same time, random cases and classes of diseases caused by the MERS virus born in the Middle East and spread in other regions continue to occur because of the conservation of zoonoses in endemic areas.
In order to combat MERS, vaccination strategies have been developed using inactivated viruses, DNA plasmas, virus vectors, nanoparticles, similar components and components of recombinant proteins, and some of these strategies have been evaluated on animals.
The development of a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 for persons with no immunity is an urgent and critical task that requires a solution to prevent the epidemic.
However, there are serious difficulties due to the long-term long-term (mean 18 months) required for the development of vaccines and the dynamic transformation of coronaviruses.
Because of an unknown disease, COVID-19 is only beginning to show a full picture of the patient's clinical course by thousands of patients.
In most cases patients can be gradually cured without complications.
However, COVID-19, similar to SARS and MERS, is also associated with high frequency of complications and high mortality among patients with severe disease.
In this regard, it is critical for health authorities to set up a predictive disease model to identify the priority of the measures taken by them, particularly in areas where there is insufficient resources.
Based on current clinical studies, the following factors may affect the predictability of COVID-19 disease in or related to COVID patients (Table 33):
Age: Age was the most important factor in predicting the duration of the disease caused by the SARS virus, which was also true in the case of COVID-19.
COVID-19 mainly affects patients aged 30 to 65 years, 47.7% of whom are over 50 years of age, according to the above-mentioned study.
Patients who needed intensive treatment were more likely to have their starting disease and complications and were significantly older than those who did not require such treatment (average 66 years versus 51 years), which shows that age was a predictive factor for COVID-19 patients.
Paul: Infection of SARS-CoV-2 among men above women (0.31/100 000 against 0.27/100 000), as mentioned above.
Disease and complications: patients with COVID-19 who require intensive therapy are more likely to develop acute myocardial infarction and arthritis.
Cardiological events were also the main cause of the death of patients from SARS.
It was reported that SARS-CoV-2 could also be associated with ACE2-positive Holangiocytes, which could lead to a violation of the paper in patients with COVID-19.
It is worth noting that age and early illness are closely linked and can result.
Reactions identified in laboratory studies: the level of C-reactive protein in the blood reflects the severity of the inflammation or tissue damage and is proposed to be considered as a potential predictive factor of disease, treatment response and final treatment.
It was also proposed to take into account the relationship between the C-reactive protein level, the severity of the disease and the predictation at COVID-19.
In addition, the result can also be expected to increase lactatedehydrogenase, asparagin aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase and creatinine.
These plants are widely distributed by different organs, especially the heart and liver, and their emissions occur when tissue damage occurs.
Therefore, they are traditionally markers of cardiac or renal dysfunction.
The main clinical symptoms: data should be taken into account for predicting results and complications in the treatment of COVID-19 as well as other factors in the X-ray study of breast cancer and in the development of clinical symptoms over time.
The use of steroids: as already described above, steroids are immunodeficiency factors that are widely used in infectious diseases as additional therapy to reduce the severity of the combustion process.
In view of the widespread use of corticosteroids in SARS to treat patients with severe forms of treatment, many of the patients have developed asacular osteonecrosis, which is a cause of life-threatening disability and low quality of life.
Therefore, when steroids are needed to treat patients with COVID-19 these preparations should be administered in small doses and short courses.
Psychological stress: as described above, many patients suffer from unforeseen stress, as they often have to endure long periods of quarantine, experience high uncertainty and observe the deaths of their relatives and other patients.
In order to reduce the stress of such patients and help them to return to normal life, psychological advice and long-term support must be provided.
According to the present demographic studies, the COVID-19 epidemic appears to be different from the SARS epidemic.
In addition to low respiratory replication, SARS-CoV-2 virus, as well as other coronaviruses that cause common mental illnesses, can successfully multiply in upper respiratory tract and cause weak symptoms or not cause symptoms at an early stage of infection.
For this reason, patients with an early stage of illness or an incubation period have been able, with their normal life, to spread the virus to a large extent, which is a major challenge for epidemiological control.
However, it was considered that the transmission of the SARS-CoV virus occurred when patients were seriously ill, while in most cases there was no early infection.
Thus, the COVID-19 epidemic today is much more serious than the SARS epidemic, and it is more difficult to control it.
At present, China is carrying out a major work in which the overall quarantine in Mr. Khan and the neighbouring cities have been announced and the quarantine regime has been extended to virtually all populations introduced to stop the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
While these measures have a major impact on the economy and other areas of life in the country, the number of new patients identified is reduced, which is about slowing down the spread of the epidemic.
At best, the outbreak will end by March and the vaccination phase will extend from 3 to 4 months.
However, some experts are not so optimistic.
Mr. Paul Hunter (Paul Hunter) and his colleagues believed that the outbreak of COVID-19, which would look much more vulnerable than SARS, would not end in 2020.
Researchers of the group, led by Ira Longini (Ira Longini), developed a model for predicting the end of the epidemic and assumed that the SARS-CoV-2 virus could defeat two thirds of the population of the world.
The Panel of Canadian Experts reported that the SARS-CoV-2 virus was detected in the nose and throats taken in patients who had been treated and prescribed from the hospital two weeks earlier, indicating that the new virus could become a cyclical disease similar to the flu.
However, the reduction in the number of new cases in China is encouraging, indicating that the current strategy may have had an effect.
According to the original estimates, Ebola was to defeat millions of people and cause the loss of half a million patients.
However, due to severe quarantine and insulation of the disease at the end of the end, it was possible to control.
It is likely that, like SARS-CoV virus, the infection of the SARS-CoV-2 virus may weaken and in time it will disappear or become a less pathogenic virus associated with man.
The comparison of the COVID-19 epidemics with the Sars and MERS epidemics (Riz. 55) is shown below.
The SARS-CoV-2 virus is characterized by a high rate of transmission through cassette or casing and possibly through direct contact with contaminated materials.
The virus has also been discovered in the circle, which means that there is also a oral and effective means of transmission.
According to one recent study, 41 per cent of 138 studies may have been caused by infection in the hospital, including 17 patients with other previously diagnosed diseases and 40 medical personnel.
Thus, serious precautions should be taken to protect the population, especially health workers, social workers, their relatives, colleagues and even those in contact with patients or infected.
The first line of protection in combating the risk of infection is wearing masks for persons; and surgical masks and N95 respiratory systems (series No. 1860s) help control the spread of viruses.
The surgical masks do not allow micropalages from potential infected aircraft to fly into the air and sit on the surfaces from which they can be transferred to the environment.
However, only class N95 (series No. 1860s) can protect against the breathing of viruses from 10 to 80 nm, they only miss 5% of viruses; SARS-CoV-2 virus is the same size as SARS-CoV and both are about 85 nm.
Since particles can detect even a range of five surgical masks that are complex together, medical workers who are directly in contact with patients must carry Class N95 masks (series No. 1860s) rather than surgical masks.
In addition to masks, medical personnel should carry a protective needle attached to the figure in order to further reduce the possibility of contact with viruses.
The virus can also fall into the organ through the eye.
On 22 January 2020, the doctor infected SARS-CoV-2 despite his wearing the N95 class mask; the virus may have exploded into his body through burned eyes.
Medical personnel should therefore also wear eyelashes or eyeglasses of a closed type.
In the affected or potentially threatened regions, it is strongly recommended that all people tend to wash their hands with disinfectants, try not to leave home by self-insolation and limit contact with potential infected people.
The acceptable distance to the patient is considered to be about a metre distance.
These measures effectively reduce the risk of infection and prevent the spread of the virus.
Although the SARS-CoV-2 virus has not previously been known to humanity, its high level of comparability with SARS-CoV reported on 7 January 2020 should have been a alarming signal for China, taking into account the experience they had gained during the SARS outbreak in 2003.
However, only after 19 January 2020, the Director of the Centre for Disease Control in Mr. Khan has calmed down citizens, stating that the new virus has low contagiousness and limited reproductive productivity in human transmission and that prevention and control of disease will not be a problem.
This statement has significantly reduced social stress, particularly during the period when all countries were preparing for the New Year's celebration, and a critical time was lost when the disease could be kept within Mr. Khan's limits with minimal losses.
China's health authorities can take this serious lesson and make significant improvements in the future.
For example, health authorities should: (1) make more careful public statements as each word is taken into account by citizens and can affect their relationship and decisions; (2) monitor and respond to unusual information coming from the clinic rather than waiting for official reports from doctors and officials; (3) take more decisive measures to prevent the potential epidemic at early stages of its development than to calm the public; and (4) to conduct more targeted and effective education to increase public awareness of epidemic diseases and regular checks and improvements in public response systems.
The outbreak of COVID-19 caused by previously unexplained coronavirus of the second type severe respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) began at the end of December 2019.
More than two months of disease covered all China, and at the time the document was produced, it was distributed in 50 countries of the world.
Since the virus is very similar to the coronavirus of a severe respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV) and COVID-19 symptoms similar to the symptoms of a severe severe respiratory syndrome (SARS), COVID-19 has experienced relapse.
However, there are some significant differences between COVID-19 and SARS in terms of the prevention of the epidemic and the treatment of patients.
COVID-19 affects older people more than young people and men more than women; the proportion of serious cases and mortality among older people is also higher than among young people.
Deaths resulting from SARS above COVID-19 (10.91 per cent compared to 1.44 per cent).
Patients with COVID-19 spread the virus even when it is non-communicable, whereas patients with SARS are usually infected only in serious cases of disease and therefore contain COVID-19 more difficult than SARS.
This explains in part why SARS-CoV-2 is being distributed much faster and larger than SARS-CoV.
Some patients with COVID-19 may have negative normal samples available for SARS-CoV-2.
On the other hand, patients treated may again show positive samples of the virus.
All of this significantly increases the risk of spreading the virus.
As a result of this rapid move of COVID-19 studies, there are still some important issues that have not been resolved, namely:
What is the origin of the SARS-CoV-2 virus?
Despite the discovery of 96 per cent gomorrhage between SARS-CoV-2 and two like SARS-like coronavirus flyers, we still cannot deny that SARS-CoV-2 infection has occurred in flies.
What animal has become an intermediate species that transmits virus from the original industry, such as flying flies, to man?
Without knowing the answers to the first and second questions, we cannot safely stop the transmission process, and the epidemiological situation can be compounded at any time.
Modelling at the molecular level and biochemical samples showed that SARS-CoV-2 is associated with ACE2, but how does the virus enter into respiratory cells and cause subsequent pathological changes?
Is the virus also linked to other organs producing ACE2 cells?
Without a clear answer to these questions, we cannot ensure rapid and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will the epidemic last?
How does the virus genetically evolve in the process of human transfer?
Will it become the cause of the world pandemic, will it also disappear like SARS, or will it recur periodically?
These aspects are of primary importance, but time will be needed to find answers to these and many other questions.
However, we have no choice but to stop the epidemic as soon as possible and return to normal life.
The origin of human coronavirus
Mutation and adaptation have stimulated the evolution of coronavirus (CoV) and their carriers, including people, for thousands of years.
By 2003, two human coronaviruses (HCoV) were known to cause mild disease, such as common leprosy.
The outbreaks of severe severe respiratory syndrome (SARS) and neighboring respiratory syndrome (MERS) have changed our view of how disastrous and life-threatening cancer can be.
The occurrence of a serious type 2 severe respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) in central China at the end of 2019 has again brought us to the attention of the Coronaviruses and impressed us with the high transferability of the virus, but the pathogenicity of this virus is more pronounced than the family virus SARS-CoV.
Coronavirus infection is a zone, and its understanding of its zone origin will be very useful.
Most human coronaviruses come from flies that are not pathogens.
Intermediate reservoirs of some human coronaviruses are also known.
The identification of animal carriers directly affects the prevention of the spread of human diseases.
The study of the interaction of coronavirus-containing animals can also shed light on the pathogens of coronavirus in humans.
In this review, we present available data on seven human coronaviruses, focusing on the history of their discovery, as well as their geographical origin and methods of intermodal transmission.
It is important to note that we are comparing and comparing various human coronaviruses from the perspective of virus evolution and genetic recombination.
In this context, there is also a modern epidemic of diseases caused by coronavirus found in 2019 (COVID-19).
In addition, conditions are noted for the successful exchange of carriers and the impact of the virus on the severity of the disease.
Coronaviruses are part of the Coronaviridae family, which is a group of ophthalmic viruses with one positive or polar NRC.
These viruses, with the largest of RNC-containing viruses, have been named by the brain from 26 to 32,000 nucleotides because of its form, which reminds the region of its electronic microscope.
From a structural point of view, coronaviruses contain non-segregated genes with an identical organization.
About two thirds of the genes contain two large partially-opened read-in frameworks (ORF1a and ORF1b), which are transfused into polyproteins of pp1a and pp1ab.
These polyproteins are further processed to generate 16 unstructured protein identified nsp1~16.
The rest of the gene contains an open range of calculations for structured proteins, including lipid protein (S), oval protein (E), membrane protein (M) and nucleoprotein (N).
Other lines of coronavirus also coded a number of line-specific accessor proteins.
According to the differences in the coronavirus sequences, there are four types (alpha, beta, gamma and delta coronavirus), which include most human coronavirus and is divided into four lines (A, B, C and D).
There is phylogenetic evidence that the genetic origin of most alpha and beta-coronovirus is flies and viruses, whereas birds are the main reservoir for gamma and delta-coronvirus.
For thousands of years, coronaviruses have constantly overcome intermittent barriers, and some of them have evolved into dangerous pathogens.
Today seven human coronaviruses are known.
These include HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63.
The remaining five beta-ocetranavir includes HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, coronavirus of severe severe respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV), coronavirus of the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) and coronavirus of severe severe type 2 SARS-CoV-2.
Human coronaviruses HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 usually cause symptoms of mild form such as dizziness and/or diarrhoea.
In contrast, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and recently discovered SARS-CoV-2 pathogens are causing severe low respiratory infections compared to a higher number of patients with a higher risk of developing severe respiratory disease (ODS) and external symptoms.
The first HCoV-229E human coronavirus, B814, was derived from a sample separated from the nucleotide of patients with brain disease in the 1960s.
Since then, extensive studies have gathered more detailed knowledge of HCOV-229E and HCV-OC43 viruses that cause local infection.
Indeed, prior to the outbreak of a severe severe respiratory syndrome (SARS), there was a general concept that the infection with human coronavirus was considered totally harmless.
The SARS outbreak in 2003 was one of the most devastating epidemics in the current history; more than 8,000 people were injured, and the overall mortality rate was about 10 per cent.
Ten years later, the outbreak of the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) led to a long epidemic on the Arabian Peninsula, with disease spreading slowly in the rest of the world.
The new human coronavirus (2019-nCoV) discovered in 2019, which was subsequently renamed SARS-CoV-2, is the cause of the current cancer epidemic of 2019 (COVID-19), which by 3 March 2020 had more than 3,120 lives and more than 91,000 people had been infected.
The alarm signal has been received, and peace must be prepared for the next SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
All seven human coronaviruses have a zoonoses, their sources are flies, mice or domestic animals.
Many data collections testify to the evolution of all human coronavirus from flying flies that are highly adapted to organisms that do not display pathogenic properties but demonstrate a wide genetic diversity.
The COVID-19 epidemic has exposed China and the world to serious medical, scientific, social and moral challenges.
A study of the zoological mechanism of human coronaviruses will enable them to understand their natural history, the forces of their evolution and factors limiting intermodal transmission.
It may also indicate or speed up the search for a reservoir, an intermediate and amplifying carrier SARS-CoV-2, which is very important to prevent the spread of the disease in the future.
This review contains general information on the origin, intermodal transmission and pathogenicity of human coronavirus.
In particular, we note and consider the following general feature: the original viruses from which human coronaviruses are usually not pathogenous to their spare parts, but are obtained by pathogens following the intermodal transfer of the new carrier.
We are also analysing the trend of human coronavirus evolution, which often leads to the weakness of the pathogenic properties.
In the same context, the result of the current shock SARS-CoV-2 is also considered.
Coronavirus has been known since the end of the 1930s.
Before the B814 strain of HCoV-229E was first obtained from a sample separated from the nostalgia of patients with mental illness, various coronaviruses were found in various infected animals, including mice, dogs, pigs, pigs, cats and dogs.
Seven human coronaviruses have been identified in recent decades.
Table 1 provides a brief account of the discovery of human coronavirus in chronological order.
The first strain of HCoV-229E was derived from samples taken from the respiratory tract of patients with highly infected respiratory tract infection in 1966; the virus was further adapted to the proliferation of WI-38 lymph nodes.
Patients infected with HCoV-229E had mental symptoms, including headache, dizziness, general discomfort and chest pain, while high temperature and cough were observed in 10-20 per cent.
Later, in 1967, HCoV-OC43 was separated from the organic culture and the subsequent serial passage into the brain of the mouse.
Clinical signs of HCoV-OC43 infection are similar to symptoms of HCoV-229E infection, which are unique to other pathogens of respiratory tract infections such as A influenza virus and rinvirus.
Both HCOV-229E virus and HCV-OC43 virus are widespread worldwide in the world and are usually distributed in the winter in the moderate range.
During the primary incubation period, these two viruses are less than a week and are followed by approximately two weeks of disease.
According to the study on volunteers, healthy people infected with HCoV-229E have developed an ordinary form of light.
Only a few patients with weakened immunity had severe respiratory infections.
The SARS outbreak, also known as “atypical pneumonia epidemic”, has become the first for the history of humanity to be well documented by a pandemic caused by coronavirus, and the cause of the disease has been the SARS-CoV virus, the third of identified human coronavirus.
The first case of SARS disease was found at the end of 2002 in the Chinese province of Guangdu.
During the SARS epidemic, 8,096 cases of disease and 774 deaths were documented and disease spread in many countries and on various continents.
In the absence of overactive distributors, it was considered that each patient could be infected by about two other people; the incubation period was 4 to 7 days and the viral load was 10 percent of the disease.
In patients infected with SARS-CoV, pain in muscles, headaches, high temperature, general discomfort and dizziness, and later symptoms include nausea, cough and respiratory failure.
The laboratory deviations from the SARS standard are lymphophapic, lipophilia, and elevated creatinine levels.
Patients with SARS also experience diffusion of alveoliar damage, spread of epithetic cells and increased macrophages.
Some 20-30% of patients are subsequently required for intensive treatment and mechanical ventilation.
In such severe cases, other organs, including iron ore, may also be infected in addition to low respiratory conditions, which are usually accompanied by cytokine fever, which may be fatal, especially for patients with impaired immunity.
The first virus was derived from an open biopsy of a patient's relative who came to Hong Kong from Guangjuo.
Since then, great efforts have been made to study human coronaviruses.
At the end of 2004, HCoV-NL63 was allocated to a 7-month-old child from the Netherlands.
It was initially established that it was mainly vulnerable to young children, elderly people and patients with weakened immunity and respiratory diseases.
For HCoV-NL63 diseases, such as nausea, conjunctivitis, high temperature and bronchialitis are characterised.
A second independent study described the same virus from the nasal material taken by an 8-month-old boy from the Netherlands suffering from pneumonia.
The virus was discovered in the Netherlands, but in fact it was spread everywhere.
According to estimates, HCoV-NL63 is a cause of approximately 4.7 per cent of widespread respiratory diseases, and the outbreaks of disease occur early in summer, summer and winter.
HCoV-NL63 is connected to an obstructive laryngitis, which is also called a big one.
HCOV-HKU1 was assigned to Hong Kong in the same year from a 71-year-old man who was hospitalized with pneumonia and bronchialitis.
In addition to non-communicable pneumonia and bronchiolitis, HCoV-HKU1 is associated with asthmatic diseases.
Like HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 virus, which causes respiratory diseases of mild form, have been detected worldwide.
All of these four human coronaviruses, which are caused by non-communicable infections, have been well adapted to humans and their mutations resulting from highly pathogenic diseases, usually minor, although their causes are unknown, such as rare cases with a more viral subtype HCOV-NL63, which, according to recent reports, has caused serious low respiratory infections in China.
Usually, the ability to effectively transfer and remain in the human body has become less viral or pathogenic.
Coronavirus of the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) was first assigned to Saudi Arabia in 2012 from a 60-year-old patient with severe pneumonia and initial failure.
Most of the laboratory confirmed cases were located in the Middle East, but in several European countries and Tunisia there were registered cases of road accidents and spread through two cases of acute contact injuries.
Another second shock with 186 confirmed cases occurred in South Korea in 2015.
Clinical manifestations of the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) call to mind the symptoms of severe severe respiratory syndrome (SARS) — a progressive acute pneumonia for both infections.
Unlike SARS, many patients with MERS have also developed a severe starting deficiency that is still different from the other diseases caused by human transferor viruses.
More than 30 per cent of patients experience symptoms such as diarrhoea and vomiting.
As at 14 February 2020, more than 2,500 laboratory confirmed cases of a high mortality respiratory syndrome (34.4 per cent) were recorded, therefore MERS-CoV is considered one of the most deadly viruses known to man.
From mid-December 2019 to the end of 2019, there were groups of patients with pneumonia in the province of Hubey, China, who are now considering the past, associated with an infection caused by a severe type 2 severe respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
The World Health Organization has announced that the continuing outbreak of low respiratory infections caused by SARS-CoV-2 is a global emergency in public health, and the same disease has been called Coronavirus 19 (COVID-19).
As at 3 March 2020, 90,053 confirmed cases were registered in the world, with mortality of about 3,4 per cent.
It should be noted that death in the province of Hobey is 4.2 per cent and beyond it is 1.2 per cent.
SARS-CoV-2, such as cornavirus SARS and MERS, is causing a severe respiratory infection characterized by a rise in temperature, neck and shoulder.
Some patients also experience diarrhoea.
Pneumonia is one of the most serious symptoms and is able to pass quickly into the syndrome of severe respiratory failure.
Despite the similarities between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, taking into account the high gomology of nucleotide sequences (82 per cent), these viruses nevertheless form a variety of philogenetic trees.
SARS-CoV-2 is apparently less pathogenic, but has more ability to transfer than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Cases of non-symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection have been reported, which shows that the virus can be spread rapidly throughout the world.
The comparison and comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with other six human coronavirus shows significant similarities and differences.
Firstly, human transmission of coronaviruses has a similar period of incubation and duration of the disease caused by them.
In this regard, SARS-CoV-2 shows the same trend as that of the other six human coronaviruses.
Second, the severity of COVID-19 symptoms is between SARS-CoV and four human coronaviruses resulting from non-communicable infections (e.g. HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
On the one hand, the occurrence of SARS-CoV-2 infection is similar to that seen mostly when human coronavirus is infected with non-communicable infections, including non-specific manifestations, mild symptoms or even lack of symptoms.
On the other hand, as in the case of SARS-CoV infection, a small subgroup of serious COVID-19 cases can be assigned, although the ratio here is slightly lower.
Thirdly, the transfer of SARS-CoV-2 also highlights the interesting legalities of both human coronavirus and SARS-CoV.
On the one hand, the transferability of SARS-CoV-2 is as high as that of human coronavirus that causes non-communicable infections.
On the other hand, it is still necessary to check whether the transferability of SARS-CoV-2 to each subsequent virus (i.e. infection of each subsequent person), such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, is reduced.
Finally, like other human coronavirus that causes non-communicable infections, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in rock samples.
We still need to answer the question whether the oral route of transfer of SARS-CoV-2 is as significant (at least in some cases) as in the case of SARS-CoV.
It is also of particular interest to consider the possible seasonalization of SARS-CoV-2, which is characterised by human coronavirus that causes non-communicable infections.
Nevertheless, the future development of the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19 will depend on the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, including transferability, pathogenicity and sustainable distribution after transition.
All four human coronaviruses that cause non-communicable infections with mild forms have been well adapted to humans.
On the other hand, these people may well have adapted to these four human coronaviruses.
In other words, and others could be called the only survivors after the pandemic of human coronaviruses in the past.
Human coronaviruses that cause serious diseases in humans and people in which human corona virus causes serious diseases have simply not survived.
In order to do so, human coronaviruses must be replete in the human body sufficiently to detect adaptive mutations that are resistant to the factors of the carrier ' s restriction.
In this sense, the greater the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and the more people will be infected, the more likely the virus is to be fully humanized.
If it is well adapted, it will be difficult to stop human transmission through quarantine or other infectious diseases control activities.
For many years, there have been four non-communicable coronary viruses that have been common among people with healthy immunity.
These viruses do not require an animal reserve.
High pathogenic coronaviruses SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV did not adapt well enough to man, and their transmission to humans could not be supported.
They need to remain and multiply in their zone reserves and to look for a fall in acceptable human muscles, perhaps through one or more intermediate or intensifiers.
SARS-CoV-2 has images similar to SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and four non-patient HCOV viruses.
It is very easy to translate as non-patient HCoV at least at present.
But he is pathogenier than non-patient HCOV and less pathogenic than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
It remains to be seen whether it is fully adapted to man and whether it will circulate in the human environment without a reservoir or with an intermediate animal carrier.
Before discussing the animal origin of HCoV viruses, it will be useful for us to discuss the definitions and characteristics of the evolution, natural, intermediate, strengthening and reserve carriers of HCoV viruses.
The life-threatening HCoV is a life-threatening carrier if it carries the same high gomology as the nucleotide sequence.
The previous virus is usually well-adjusted and non-patogenic in this carrier.
Similarly, the tanker will carry HCOV for a long time.
In both cases, carriers are naturally infected and are natural carriers of HCoV or its parent virus.
On the other hand, if HCoV was only placed in the intermediate carrier directly before or around the time when it was carried to the person, it was not well adapted to the new carrier and was often pathogenous.
The intermediate carrier may serve as a zone source of human infection and play the role of the active carrier, allowing the virus to be replete in prayer, and then transmit it to its people, increasing the level of human contamination.
HCoV may be transmitted by the oral infection if it is not possible to sustain intracomputer transmission.
On the contrary, HCoV viruses can also adapt to the intermediate carrier and even establish long-term endemicness.
In this case, the intermediate carrier shall become a natural reserve carrier.
Epidemiological data have shown retrospectively that a zero patient in SARS had more contact with an industrial animal (child).
Further studies of seropivity have shown that IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV virus are more widespread for animal traders than for the general population.
The Himalayas (Pamularvata) and the unique dog on live animals markets became the first established carriers of viruses such as SARS-CoV.
This was confirmed in detail by the fact that all targets on SARS' markets were no longer reported.
At the same time, it was reported that in Himalayas living in the environment or on farms and not in the market, SARS-CoV did not in most cases establish that the Himalayas could serve only as an intermediate booster rather than as a natural Sars-CoV reservoir.
It is noteworthy that since 80 per cent of different animals on the Guangjuo market have an antidote to SARS-CoV, it cannot be excluded from the possibility that medium-sized carriers can also serve many types of small dairy products.
They're all said to be the silent carrier of the SARS-CoV virus.
The next study of the natural carrier SARS-CoV identified a nearby CoV flyer, which was known as atypical coronavirus-related subcombinant flyer HKU3 (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3) and which is present in Chinese subcombinant flyer.
These mice are positive for SARS-CoV and genetic traceability SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3.
These and other coronaviruses are 88 to 92 per cent of the same nucleotide sequences as SARS-CoV.
These studies laid the basis for a new concept that flies became carriers of new human pathogens.
A number of SARS-like coronaviruses (SL-CoV) have also been detected in flies, but none of them, except one marked by HIV1, cannot be isolated as a live virus.
It is known that SARS-CoV receptor is human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2).
It has been shown that WIV1 obtained from the sample of fecal fly flyers uses ACE2 flyers, tissues and humans as receptors for entry into the cell.
It is commendable that the cures of patients with SARS could neutralize HIV1.
Today, WIV1 represents the closest family advance of SARS-CoV in flying mice by 95 per cent of the nucleotide sequences.
Despite the high homology between these two viruses, it is generally considered that WIV1 is not a direct parent virus SARS-CoV and that flies are not a direct backup carrier of SARS-CoV.
The physiological analysis relates to the same group as the CoV-HKU4 flyer and the CoV-HKU5 flyer.
CoV-HKU4 flies and MERS-CoV use the same carrier receptor as diptildipeptidase-4 (DPP4) to detect viruses.
The consequences of NNC-dependent MERS-CoV polymerase virus are phylogeneticly close to the follow-up of beta-coronavirus in avian mice identified in Europe and Africa.
There were still no live MERS-CoV virus in the wild.
The homology of the nucleotide sequences of MERS-CoV and its close relative CoV-HKU25 flyers is only 87 per cent.
It's a fly-in mouse that could not be the direct backup carrier of the MERS-CoV virus.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East have shown that single-cell verbs are seropositive to neutralising antibodies specific to MERS-CoV as well as those of Middle East origin in many African countries.
The live MERS-CoV, an identical virus discovered in humans, has been identified from the nasal shells of one worm, which further confirms the role of the worm as the real sparemers of the MERS-CoV.
It is also noted that there have been minor symptoms of vertebral failure, experimentally contaminated MERS-CoV.
It is noteworthy that infected vertebrates have been administered not only by respiratory means but also by physiologically- oral means, which is also the main means of detecting the virus in flies.
However, there are still issues since many confirmed cases of the Middle East respiratory syndrome have not had any contact with vertebrates prior to the occurrence of symptoms and are likely to be associated with human transmission or the transfer of unknown channels including unset species of animals that are carrying MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 nucleotide homology of 96.2% is equivalent to CoV RatG13 fly-in mice identified in Asian sub-consulates Rhinolophus affinis.
As in the case of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the difference between SARS-CoV-2 and RatG13 is too large to be attributed to parental relationships.
It was possible that flies could not be directly retained by SARS-CoV-2 unless there were almost identical coronaviruses of flies in the future.
It is assumed that direct animal carriers of the SARS-CoV-2 virus should be among wild species that sell and kill on the Hungarian market of marine products associated with many very early cases of COVID-19, which shows the likelihood of animal transfer.
A number of recent studies based on metagenic sequencing have concluded that a group of small mammals known as the Pangoline (Manis javanica) could also carry the parent betacoron virus, which is a family strain SARS-CoV-2.
The homology of traceability of these new pangoline coronavirus genes is 85-92 per cent consistent with SARS-CoV-2.
However, they are also closely related to RatG13, which is about 90 per cent of the nucleotide sequences.
They are classified in two subdiversity of viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 in a phylogenetic tree in which the connective domain receptor (RSD) is closer to SARS-CoV-2 with a traceability of amino acid at 97.4 per cent.
On the other hand, SARS-CoV-2 and RatG13 prints are more divergent, despite higher levels of traceability in all genes.
A previous study of pathogens also reported the identification of viral contaminants in light samples that were similar to SARS-CoV-2.
Other methods of collection and manual processing were used in this study to achieve the consistency of a gene involving around 86.3 per cent of the complete virus gene.
It cannot be excluded that Pangolin has become one of SARS-CoV-2 intermediate carriers.
However, due to the divergence between SARS-CoV-2 and beta-coronavirus pangoline, family SARS-CoV-2, there is currently no evidence to support the direct origin of SARS-CoV-2 from pangoline.
Furthermore, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RatG13 is more than between SARS-CoV-2 and beta-coronovirus pangoline related to SARS-CoV-2.
The evolution path SARS-CoV-2 has not yet been established in flies, pangolins and other mammals.
While the highest traceability homology was found in RSD between SARS-CoV-2 and beta-coronavirus pangolins, family SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-2 and RatG13 were found to be the highest traceability homology throughout the gene.
The theoretical, high degree of similarity between beta-coron viral pangoline, family SARS-CoV-2, and SARS-CoV-2 is associated with parallel evolution through selectivity.
The opposite proposal is for a combination of beta-coronavirus pangoline, family SARS-CoV-2, and RatG13 in the third species of wild animals.
As a driving force of evolution, the recombination is widely distributed among beta-coronavirus.
The final decision on the direct zone origin of SARS-CoV-2 is not yet taken.
In addition to highly pathogenic HCOV viruses, the zoological origin of HCV-229E, HCV-OC43, HCV-NL63 and HCV-HKU1 are also studied.
Phylogenetic evidence shows that both HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E may occur from coronavirus in flies while parental strains of HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 are found in rats.
Coronavirus is reported to have been shown to have a close birth with HCoV-NL63 in North America.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E is genetically related to other coronavirus flying flies called Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, which was discovered in Ghana, although there was a suspicion that its intermediate carrier could also be vertebrates.
For the sake of clarity, current knowledge of the origin of known coronaviruses is summarized in figure 1 and in table 2.
The phylogenetic analysis has shown that HCoV has been transmitted to the anemone.
When HCOV-OC43 was transmitted by means of an intermediate transmission of HCV-OC43 and people were infected with domestic animals, a pandemic of respiratory infection was registered.
The history of cross-border transmission HCoV-229E is not so clear.
Alfacoronovirus was detected in flies near HCoV-229E.
Among them is alfacoronavirus alpacas.
Some data support direct transmission of the virus from flying human mice.
Firstly, humans, not alpines, could contact flying flies in the common environmental net.
At the same time, people are in close contact with alpines.
Secondly, avian alcoronavirus, family HCoV-229E, is diverse and pathogenic in birds, while alfacoronavirus alpacas has caused respiratory disease in infected animals.
Finally, alphacoronovirus alpacas was not found in wild animals.
Thus, it cannot be excluded from the possibility that alpacas received alphacoronavirus, a family HCoV-229E, from humans.
In fact, flies are the direct source of human pathogenic viruses, including hepatitis, Ebola virus, Nipah virus and Hendra virus.
So it's no wonder that flies were able to transmit HCoV-229E directly to humans.
On the other hand, while avian alfacoronaviruses could serve as HCoV-229E gene strains, alpacas and vertebrates could become intermediate carriers that transmit viruses to humans, just as in the case of MERS-CoV virus.
MERS-CoV serves as an excellent example of intermodal transfer from flying mice to one or more human vertebrates.
The evolution of the MERS-CoV virus from flies is known for its initial identification and was subsequently confirmed by the following studies.
It is evident that flies provide a rich range of viruses for inter-cellular exchange of gene fragments and intermodal transmission.
Long-term, densely populated colonies, close social interaction and flight capacity are conducted by flying mice “imperfect distributors”.
On the other hand, the MERS-CoV virus was introduced by just one vertebrate ten years ago.
He adapted well to these valves that were turned from the intermediate carrier into a stable and natural reserve carrier.
These animals have the MERS-CoV virus, which is very easy to develop and is relatively low in mutations.
His epidemiological transmission is an accident, and he remains a dumb carrier of MERS-CoV, as his transmission is not supported.
Unlike the role of vertebrates in the transfer of MERS-CoV, the role of pangolins, if any, in the transfer of another SARS-CoV-2 virus.
In particular, pangoline beta-coron virus is highly pathogenic to pangoline.
They may be the dumbfounded carriers of beta-coronavirus family SARS-CoV-2, as well as cities in the case of SARS-CoV.
Future studies need to confirm or remove several possibilities for the intermodal transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from animal species.
Firstly, flies may be a replacement carrier for the virus of SARS-CoV-2, almost identical SARS-CoV-2.
Humans can make an environmental nest with flying flies by looking at or dividing the tissues of these animals.
Secondly, the pangoline may be one of the intermediate-strengthening carriers where the family SARS-CoV-2 virus has recently fallen.
People are infected by the virus through the distribution of tissues and the use of meat for wild animals.
It is quite possible that many animals, including domestic animals, are acceptable to SARS-CoV-2.
The investigation of domestic and wild animals was justified.
Thirdly, as mentioned above, the combination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 could occur in a third type, which has been associated with both flying mice and Pangos.
The search for animal origin continued for SARS-CoV-2.
In addition to various types of animal carriers, three main factors from viruses have also contributed to cross-border barriers.
First of all, they are relatively high rates of mutations in RNC replication.
Compared to other viruses with single-stage NNCs, the frequency of coronavirus mutations can be considered to be "measurable-high" from an average replacement of approximately 10-4 times per year in the same area 2 depending on the phase of adaptation of coronavirus to new economies.
Coronaviruses have a adjustable exorbonuboclaase, which can lead to an extremely high frequency of mutating and weakening or even life-threatening.
It is interesting that the nucleotide analogue Remdesivir increases the replication of coronavirus due to the induction of exorbonuclease and NNC-dependent PNNP.
Remdesivir is one of the most promising against SARS-CoV-2, which needs to be checked during clinical studies.
Nevertheless, the frequency of heart disease mutations is nearly one million times higher than their carriers.
Moreover, the frequency of mutations can often be even higher if crown virus is not adequately adapted to the carrier.
Compared to SARS-CoV with high frequency mutations, the frequency of SARS-CoV-2 mutations is shown below, which shows a higher level of human adaptation.
Supposedly, this virus has already been adapted to another human carrier.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, this also applies to MERS-CoV, which is well-adjusted to one or more valves.
Theoretically it is unlikely that vaccines and antiviral preparations from SARS-CoV-2 will quickly lose effectiveness as a result of the genetic drive.
Secondly, a large gene of RNA in crown virus results in increased plasticity in genetic modification with respect to mutations and recombination, thereby increasing the likelihood of intermodal co-evolution that is beneficial for new crown viruses when appropriate.
This contributes to the numerous unique open range of calculations and functions of protein coded towards the end of the gene.
Thirdly, due to the unique mechanism of choice of the matrix, coronaviruses are randomly and frequently converted into the matrix during the replication of the NNC.
In the case of a transcrisis of coronavirus DNA in the carrier serving as a mixed trial, it is often replaced.
High-level full-scale and subgenome NNCs can combine and create new coronaviruses.
Phylogenetic evidence of natural recombination was found both in HCOV-HKU1 and HCOV-OC43 and in animal coronaviruses such as SL-CoV and batCoV-HKU9.
Interoperability of the virus-transmitter
In addition to the three virus factors mentioned above, another key factor of intermodal transmission is the interaction of the virus with the carrier's receptor.
In this article as a typical example, which also shows evidence of a positive selection in cross-transition events, the SARS-CoV recombinance is shown.
Based on a comparative analysis between SARS-CoV human and urban strains, it is considered that SARS-CoV is undergoing rapid adaptation to various carriers, particularly with regard to white S S S S.
In general, coronavirus S CSD interacts with cell receptors, and the response of the carrier's antibodies is intensively selected.
SARS-CoV RSDs are amino acids, from 318 to 510, on S1 fragments, which are linked to human angiotensin-reversing enzyme 2 (APF2) and its correceptors.
The SARS-CoV virus RSD is able to identify the APF2 receptors of various animals, including mice, mice, mice and entovised dogs, by making possible intermodal transmission of the virus.
In fact, there were only 6 amino acid residues, which were different from human and urban strains, 4 of which were in a receptor-related motif for interaction with AAF2 receptor.
SARS-CoV cities have K479N and S487T mutations in RSD, which can increase the affinity of schizophrenic protein interaction with human APH2 receptor.
In other words, these two amino acid substitutes may be of particular importance in adapting the virus to human beings.
It is noted that SARS-CoV-2 has the same cell receptor as SARS-CoV.
The difference in 30 per cent between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in S1 protein S leads to a change in the binding affinity of white S to human ARF2.
Indeed, a study with the help of an electronic microscope says that the affinity of this relationship is 10 to 20 times higher than that between AAF2 human and S virus SARS-CoV.
It would also be interesting to determine whether any other corrections are required to transfer SARS-CoV-2.
Surprisingly, HCoV-NL63 is also linked to APF2, but with another segment of white S.
There are many other HCoV receptors such as aminopeptide N for HCoV-229E and 9-O-acetylsylate for HCoV-OC43.
They may also be responsible for the successful adaptation of these coronaviruses in humans after intermodal transmission from animal carriers.
In addition to cell receptors, the result of the intermodal transmission of HCoV is also managed by other factors of dependence and limitation of the carrier.
The differentiation of these white carriers between humans and natural reserve carriers of HCoVs such as flies, single-celled and grey can be a barrier to intermodal transmission.
For the successful intermodal transmission of HCOV viruses, it is necessary to incorporate the factors of dependence and to subsidize the factors of stress for carriers.
In this regard, molecular determinants in this important area of interaction between the virus and the carrier are still required to define and categorize.
Good results can be provided by an unexplained full-genome screening of the dependency and strength of carriers for SARS-CoV-2 with the help of new CRISPR technology.
Start of new HCov: Back to zero
The diversity of coronaviruses in flies provides a wide range of opportunities for new HCoVs to develop.
In this sense, coronaviruses of flies serve as a genetic cure for HCV.
In addition, rapid mutation and genetic recombination are also a driving force for HCov evolution and serve two important steps in this process.
For example, the acquisition or loss of new white-coding genes has the potential for radically modifying virus-types.
Among SARS-CoV accessor proteins are considered important for human adaptation to ORF8, such as avian viruses, family SARS-CoV, but found to be detecting different whites of ORF8.
A 29-nuclear-depletion delegation was found in the stamps isolated at the beginning of the human epidemic.
The delegation divided ORF8a and ORF8b into ORF8b and considered it to be an adaptive mutation that accelerates the change of carriers.
In addition, SARS-CoV has a history of possible combinations with alpha and gamma-coronavirus lines where a large number of less recombinant sites have been identified in NNC-dependent RNC polymerase.
The location of the combination was also defined in non-structured white nsp9, most nsp10 and parts nsp14.
It has also been shown that the MERS-CoV epidemic has occurred on a number of lines between the two lines, which have occurred in several caves in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, recombinant events were also observed in other HCoVs in which HCoV recombined with other animal coronaviruses in their non-structured genes.
It should also be noted that artificial selection can contribute to unprecedented changes in viral genes, which are most likely due to the release of the virus from the selective pressure, for example by the carrier's immune system.
For example, the loss of full-size ORF4 in the prototype HCoV-229E is due to the double-delegation.
At the same time as an indictable opening of the ORF4 count, the virus of the mouse and vertebral virus of HCoV-229E, alfacoronavirus of the alpacas, can be observed in a single nucleotide input that leads to the movement of the framework.
Finally, the evolution of new HCoVs is also due to pressure from the selection of their backup carriers.
The signs or absences of the symptoms were recorded by Coronavirus in the case of outbreaks of flying mice, which were related to the mutual adaptation of coronaviruses and flies.
It has been said that flies have been anatomically and physically adapted to crown viruses.
For example, failure to activate the oral response in flies effectively reduce the pathology caused by coronavirus.
In addition, natural activity of the killer cell in flies has been enhanced by the amplifying of the inhibitory receptor of the NKG2/CD94 natural killer cells and the low level of expression of the molecule of the primary Histotoxicity complex of Class I.
Moreover, the high level of active oxychloride, which provides high metabolic activity in flies, may have an effect on the replication of coronavirus, while at the same time affecting exorbonuclese, thereby creating pressure for the generation of strains of the virus, which, when discovered in the new carrier, are highly pathogenic.
More pathogenic strains of coronavirus may also evolve as a result of a combination that leads to the acquisition of new protein or protein properties to adapt the carrier.
Thus, it is no coincidence that in the last two decades there have been three new human coronaviruses.
Coronaviruses are not pathogenic or cause mild symptoms in their reserve containers such as flies or worms.
They are probably replications without causing a strong immune response to the carrier.
This is the secret to why we see non-sympathetic carriers and what causes serious cases of human infection.
Serious symptoms are mainly related to hyperactivity of immune response and cytokine strains, where the stronger immune response is, thus causing a more severe infection.
On the other hand, the immune response to non-sympathetic carriers is not consistent with the replication of coronavirus.
The same immune response strategy may have beneficial effects on treatment against SARS-CoV-2.
Birds have a particularly strong interferonal response.
Thus, the adoption of type I interferon should at least have a beneficial effect in the initial phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
In addition, inflammation of NLRP3-inflames has been contaminated in flies.
On this basis, NLRP3-inflamesmation with MCC950 may be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
The establishment of SARS-CoV-2 is followed by a common scheme for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
While beta-coronovirus has been found, a 95 per cent nucleotide gomologic equivalent to SARS-CoV, there is also a coronovirus that is 96 per cent of SARS-CoV-2.
Although it has been found that cities and other animals on the market carry viruses, the same SARS-CoV, the immediate intermediate carriers for SARS-CoV-2 have not been established.
Pangolin beta-coV-2 has been detected, somewhat homologous SARS-CoV-2, which says that it could serve as one of the intermediate carriers or that gangs of Pangolin beta-coronavirus genes could enter the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
Despite the remaining questions, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 was designed or created by man.
Coronaviruses attracted attention because of the recent outbreak of SARS-CoV-2.
The study of coronaviruses in flying mice and other animals has radically changed our perception of the importance of zone origin and of HCOV reserves in human transmission.
Evidence has shown that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are derived from flies and have been transmitted to humans through intermediate carriers.
If SARS-CoV infection comes from contact between people and tissues on the market, closure of the feed markets and destruction of the tissue on them could effectively end the SARS epidemic.
For the same reason, in the light of the opening of different lines of beta-coV-Pangolins near SARS-CoV-2, it is necessary to remove pangoline in order to prevent the spread of the infection on the product markets.
However, SARS-CoV-2 is transferred through pangolins and other dairy products and how this can continue to be the task of future studies.
On the other hand, the MERS-CoV virus has existed for a long time in one wormhole.
These valves serve as an important vehicle as well as as as the main source of meat, milk, leather and articles from the local population.
They are widely distributed in the Middle East and in Africa.
Therefore, it is not possible to offer all vertebrates for control over MERS, as it was done on Chinese wildlife markets to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
In order to stop the periodic outbreaks of MERS, an integrated approach is needed to develop an effective vaccine against MERS-CoV for vertebrates in combination with other infection control measures.
As we cannot eliminate these viruses, new genotypes may occur that cause outbreaks of disease.
In the world, various zone viruses are circulating.
In particular, there is an extremely diverse range of coronaviruses in birds with zoonosal potential.
There is a large number of possibilities for the evolution and recombination of these zone coronaviruses, which will in future lead to new coronaviruses that are easily transmitted and/or more deadly to humans.
In order to reduce excessive contact between humans and animals, it is necessary to reject the culture of animal feeding in some areas of China.
Following severe trials such as SARS, MERS and COVID-19, better preparedness and response plan are needed.
In fact, many viruses have existed on the planet for a very long time.
They remain in their natural reserves until it is possible to capture new territories.
While many of the properties of flying flies are beneficial for the spread of viruses, learning to stay away from them can minimize the likelihood of human contact with flying flies and other wild species.
In order to better understand the environment of coronaviruses and their natural carriers, constant epidemiological monitoring of lactating patients is necessary, which will be useful in preventing the transmission of coronavirus from human beings and future outbreaks of diseases.
In conclusion, the most effective way to prevent the virus virus is to keep people away from the environmental scarcity of the natural reserves of the virus.
SARS-CoV-2 is still missing some fragments.
First of all, if flies have transmitted SARS-CoV-2 virus to the pangoline, it is interesting to see what conditions the mouse and the pangoline are separated by the same environmental strain.
Secondly, if flies play a more direct role in human transfer, it is necessary to determine how people have entered into contact with flies.
Thirdly, if the role of the real intermediate carrier plays a third dairy, it should be clarified how it interacts with various types, including human, flying flies and pangolins.
Finally, since many dairy species, including domestic animals, may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, both epidemiological and experimental infections should be carried out.
It is expected that in the future SARS-CoV-2 or its precursors will be identified by their natural carriers.
Further research in this area will shed light on the evolution path of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, which will have an important impact on the prevention and control of COVID-19.
It is necessary to update diagnostic criteria for “disquieting cases” and “confirmed cases” COVID-19
On 6 February 2020, our group published a short background guide on diagnosis and treatment of the new crown virus infection in 2019 (2019-nCoV), which provides information on our experience and provides concrete recommendations to combat this pandemic worldwide.
Coronavirus infection 2019 (COVID-19), however, is a new disease, and our understanding and knowledge has been gradually increased on the basis of the current results of research and clinical experience; so diagnostic strategies and therapeutic practices have also been continuously updated.
In this letter, we responded to one comment on our recommendations and introduced new diagnostic criteria for “disquieting cases” and “confirmed cases” in accordance with the COVID-19 recommendation (seventh version) issued by the National Committee for the Health of the NRC.
In December 2019 the outbreak of the new crown virus 2019 (2019-nCoV), now officially known as COVID-19 (COVID-19), and the same virus was called “a severe severe respiratory syndrome 2” (SARS-CoV-2).
On 11 March 2020, WHO qualified COVID-19 as a pandemic.
To combat SARS-CoV-2 infection, our group developed short-term guidelines and published them on the website of Military Medical Research on 6 February 2020.
This publication drew great attention to itself.
Noting that COVID-19 is a new disease, our understanding and knowledge has been gradually increased on the basis of the current results of research and clinical experience; so diagnostic strategies and therapeutic practices have also been continuously updated.
For example, from 16 January to 3 March 2020, seven issues of the COVID-19 Recommendations on Diagnosis and Treatment, published by the National Committee on NRC Health (http://www.hnc.gov.cn/), have been substantially altered.
Recently, comments were made on our recommendations in the work of Zhou (Zhou) with the co-authors, and they contained simple diagnostic proposals based on existing clinical experience.
This work has added new practical evidence to our recommendations and provided valuable background information on this pandemic covering the world.
We reaffirm the importance of their work and express our gratitude.
However, according to the latest issue of the “COVID-19 Recommendations on Diagnostics and Treatment” (examination of the seventh version) and the results of current studies, their work needs to be updated.
According to the seventh issue of this document (from 3 March 2020) for a comprehensive analysis of the case of disease suspects, any element of epidemiological history with two clinical manifestations of the disease must be combined:
Epidemiological history: (1) the history of movements or locations in H. Khan and its neighborhoods or other population sites where cases of COVID-19 have been recorded within 14 days prior to symptoms; (2) the history of contacts with patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 (with a positive test based on nucleinic acid); (3) the history of contact with patients with high temperature or respiratory symptoms from H. Khan and its strengths or other population sites where cases of CVID-19 disease have been recorded during the last 14 days prior to symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 (with a positive test based on nucleinal acid); (3) the history of contact with patients with high fever or respiratory symptoms from H. Khan and other population sites where cases of CVID-19 have been recorded; and cases of CVID-19 have been reported in the past 14 days prior to the occurrence of symptomss; (4)
Clinical manifestations: (1) high temperature and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) the presence of external symptoms of COVID-19 infection; (3) the total number of leukocytes is normal or reduced with a reduced number of lymphocytes at an early stage of symptoms.
The diagnosis for the confirmed case of disease should be based on suspicion of disease with one of the following pathogenic or serological evidence, namely: (1) the CPC test in real-time is positive for SARS-CoV-2; (2) the full-genome sequence of the virus shows high homogenousity of new coronaviruses; (3) the positive results of the serotest for specific SARS-CoV-2 antibodies IgM and IgG; or the change of the test result from a positive test for the specific SARS-CoV-2 antagonist IgG, or an increase of titre at a rate of 4 times.
It may also be noted that on the second (18 January 2020) and on the third (22 January 2020) of the above-mentioned document, the CPC test was added in a real-time mode for nuclear acids in respiratory or blood samples.
The pathogenic blood test diagnosis was added on the fourth (27 January 2020) and fifth (8 February 2020) and then the seventh issue added the need for serological evidence.
These changes are based on the results of the continuous work of researchers who sought an optimal set of nuclear acids for rapid diagnosis, as well as for the analysis of samples taken from respiratory systems, including blood samples, which increase the availability of various samples and facilitate the inclusion of positive results for specific antibodies in the diagnosis of disease.
However, more and more evidence of the need to be careful when treating patients with typical symptoms and patients without expressed symptoms appears.
Thus, the road map presented in the work of Zhou (Zhou) and etc. should be updated as it is classified as a “low risk” group.
The evaluation system also requires clarification in further clinical practice and studies.
Finally, we note that we hope to obtain more direct evidence and call upon readers to leave their comments.
With regard to the diagnosis of “disquieting cases” and “confirmed cases”, we invite readers to follow and strictly follow the latest recommendations made in the countries where they live.
Our group will also update its recommendations in time to provide effective assistance.
Bangladesh reported five new deaths as a result of COVID-19 - daily maximum
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths as a result of COVID-19 per day.
It's the largest number of deaths from the virus per day.
As of yesterday, the Bangladesh Institute for Epidemiology, Control and Disease Studies (IEDCR) reported that 114 cases of infection had occurred, as well as 33 patients who had been home.
17 deaths were recorded.
In the online briefing, IEDCR Director, Dr. Mirjabi Sabrina Flora said that the victims had become four men and one woman.
According to Dr. Mirjabi, two endors were aged 60 years, two were aged from 51 to 60 years, and one was from 41 to 50 years old.
She also reported that the two victims were from Dhaka.
On 11 March, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced the COVID-19 pandemic.
The clinic staff reported to the local news agency Anadolu that one of the victims was Jalal Saifur Rahman, director of the Bengal Anti-Corruption Commission, who was treated at the Kuwaiti Meitri clinic.
On Saturday, in an online video statement, the Minister for Car Transport and Bridges of Bangladesh Obadul Qader said that the public transport work would be stopped for a longer time than planned for the next Saturday.
The public transport work was resumed from 26 March and was to be resumed on Saturday, 4 April.
The transport of first-time goods — medicines, fuel and food products — was still permitted.
The first cases of COVID-19 infection were registered in Bangladesh on 8 March in two persons who returned from Italy as well as one of their wives.
By March 19, these three people had already been healed.
SARS-CoV-2 has exceeded the millions of cases of infection worldwide
According to the University of Jones Hopkins, the total number of cases of cancer infection in SARS-CoV-2 worldwide increased by one million worldwide.
Coronavirus COVID-19 killed at least 52 thousand people.
Rubez arrived on the same day when the first case of infection was confirmed in Malawi and the first case of cancer virus death was confirmed in Zambia.
North Korea claimed that on Thursday it was one of several countries in which cases of coronary infection had not been identified.
As of yesterday, the World Health Organization reported 1,051,635 confirmed cases of infection, including 79,332 cases in twenty-four hours prior to 10:00 per Central European Time (0800 UTC) on 4 April.
More than 244,000 cases of coronary virus infection were registered in the United States, of which there were at least 5,900 flights.
CBS News, referring to the data from the University of Jones Hopkins, reported that more than 1,000 deaths from coronary infection had been recorded in the United States.
Countries around the world have announced increased measures to prevent the spread of disease.
In Moscow, Sergey Sobianin extended the system of self-insolation of citizens of the city until 1 May.
Former President Vladimir Putin stated that Russians throughout the country, despite self-determination, would receive a salary by 30 April.
The Portuguese Parliament voted in favour of an extension of the emergency situation for 15 days; the results of the vote were 215 votes with ten abstentions and one against.
Saudi Arabia has extended the time of command in the sacred cities of Mecca and Medina on a full day, while the time of command has gone from 3 hours a.m. to 6 a.m.
Thailand planned to enter the command hour from 10 o'clock till 4 o'clock in the morning.
The governor of Ohio, Mike Devain, announced that the regime of domestic self-determination in the State's territory was extended by 1 May.
Australia's stores limit the quantity of toilet book packages that can be purchased once
The Australian Woolworths and Coles shops were reduced by the number of toilet books that could be obtained once in all of the country's shops, up to two and a half packages, respectively.
ALDI also limited one pack on Monday.
These restrictions were reported in case announcements, as well as on the Facebook website.
It is reported that citizens have begun to make extraordinary savings because of the fear that COVID-19 could lead to the introduction of a common system of self-determination.
In the middle of the Woolworth network, the number of toilet books purchased was also limited to one package.
Earlier, 4 and 5 March respectively, Woolworths and Coles already limited this quantity by 4 packages.
In its press release of 8 March, the Coles network reported that by restricting the four packages “in many stores the toilet book is still buying too fast — one delivery over time” and called such a “unprecedented” question, while ALDI in Facebook post published on Tuesday called such a “unexpected” trend.
According to the representative of Woolworths, there was a rapid increase in sales last week.
Costco store in Canberra also limited this number by two packs last week.
In order to meet the deficit, Coles has been ordering larger parties to suppliers and increased delivery rates, Woolworths has ordered additional parties, while ALDI has made spare parts for special early sales.
Russell Cimmerman, Executive Director of the Australian Ritillar Association, reported that the Ritillars were trying to fill their stocks, but this was difficult because of restrictions on local authorities on the schedule of the carriage of vehicles.
It looks forward to the increase in the productivity of the product, as suppliers are trying to satisfy the demand, but there are still less favourable proposals available.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that some stores could not operate on the environment due to the origin of stocks.
In a report on News.com.au, Dr. Gary Mortimer, an expert on trade at the Queensland University of Technology, said that stores fill stocks every night.
He noted that the toilet book was a fruitful commodity, so the number of stock stocks was small, and after the sale of all the goods, a number of long sections remained empty, strengthening the lack of stocks.
“Coles and Woolworths believe that if the fields could be filled, and such goods as toilet paper rolls and hand-definition tools could be placed on these fields in large quantities, buyers would probably not be so panicking,” says Russell Cimmerman.
In the past, the manufacturer of the modified toilet book Who Gives a Crop reported the end of the stocks.
According to News.com.au, Kimberly-Clark, the manufacturer of the toilet book Kleenex and Solaris Paper, as well as Sorbent brands, reported that they work round-the-clock to ensure a sufficient quantity of goods.
Domain.com, a real estate sale site, reported that when the number of auctions in Melbourne decreased due to the absence of buyers on the week of the workday, some real estate sellers began to offer the first auction participants a free toilet book.
The fourth edition of the daily NT News printed in Darwin included an eight-page tab for drawing and use as a toilet book.
According to ABC Australia's report of 3 March, the beginnings of shops have unduly limited the number of goods acquired, stating that they are not planning to do so.
Russell Zimmerman added that other products were also used with an increased demand, including medical masks, hand-definitions, gloves, hand-washing and pain.
Similarly, in addition to the events in Australia, it was noted on the evening that Ocado’s online store of British supermarket also limited the sale of a toilet book by two packs of 12 rolls.
The World Health Organization announced the COVID-19 pandemic
The World Health Organization (WHO) announced a pandemic of COVID-19 infection caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.
Despite the fact that the term “pandamia” refers only to the extent of disease and not to the risk of specific cases, WHO notes that Governments need to take measures:
“All countries are still in a position to influence the development of the pandemic”.
This is possible if countries are to identify, test, treat, isolate the sick, follow up on cases of disease, and mobilize their citizens,” explained Mr. Tedros Adam Hebresus, Director-General of WHO.
“We are deeply concerned at both the alarming level of spread and the seriousness of the disease and the alarming level of inactivity”.
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the United States Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, this pandemic is “unprecedented”.
He said in his interview with CNN in February that “no other respiratory virus than influenza has yet to follow from its occurrence to its continuing global spread”.
Mr. Hebreus expressed a similar view, saying that "We have never observed pandemics caused by coronavirus.
We have never seen any pandemics that can be controlled."
At first, in January WHO announced the outbreak of this emergency situation in the field of public health, which was of international importance and then adopted a new status as a pandemic.
The director of the National Institute for Allergy and Infections in the United States, Dr. Anthony Fauchi, said of the shock: “This is just the beginning, it will be worse.”
According to the Associated Press on Thursday, at least 126,000 cases of COVID-19 disease have been recorded in the world, and more than 4,600 people have been killed.
Coronavirus pandemic 2019-2020 g. is currently present at the 2019 Coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19), caused by a severe severe severe respiratory syndrome-2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The outbreak was detected in Uganda, China, in December 2019 and on 30 January 2020 was announced an emergency situation of international importance in the field of public health, which was subsequently recognized as a pandemic on 11 March 2020.
As of 10 April 2020, some 1.61 million cases of COVID-19 disease have been recorded in 210 countries and regions, resulting in approximately 97,000 deaths.
About 364,000 people were healed.
The mortality rate in China is 4 per cent, while it varies worldwide from 13.04 per cent in Algeria to 0.08 per cent in New Zealand.
The most common symptoms include nausea, cough and difficulty breathing.
There are potential complications of pneumonia and acute respiratory stress syndrome.
The time from the first symptoms to the outbreak usually consists of about five days, but may vary from two to fourteen days.
No vaccine or specific treatment has been found at this time.
The main treatment is symptomatic and supportive. The recommended preventive measures include handwashing, cover of the neck, respect for the distance between people, identification and self-insolation of persons suspected of infection.
Around the world, authorities have responded to the situation by introducing restrictions on travel, quarantine measures, time of command, risk control at work and closure of various facilities.
The pandemic has led to serious global social and economic consequences, the transfer or cancellation of sports, religious, political and cultural activities, as well as a widespread shortage of goods that are under way by panic.
Schools and universities were closed at national or regional levels in 193 countries, which affected about 99.4 per cent of the world ' s students.
The Internet has begun to spread misinformation about viruses, cases of xenophobic and discrimination against citizens of China, other citizens of East and South-East Asia, or those of outsiders, as well as other groups of people living in areas where significant cases of virus spread have been reported.
As a result of the decline in travel and closure of heavy industrial enterprises, air pollution and carbon emissions have decreased.
On 31 December 2019, the health authorities of the town of Huangh (Hobey Province), China, reported the occurrence of pneumonia for an unknown reason, and the situation began to be investigated early in January 2020.
The cases of infection were mainly related to the common market of the Huanan marine products, so the virus is thought to have a zoological origin.
The virus that causes outbreaks is known as SARS-CoV-2. It is a recently-opened virus that is closely related to cornavirus viruses in mice, cornovirus and SARS-CoV. It was later discovered that the first case of disease occurred on 1 December 2019 and that the infected has not visited the market since that date.
Two thirds of the violations recorded in December 2019 were related to this market.
On 13 March 2020, the publication of the newspaper Morning Post, which was not verified, suggested that the first case of infection had occurred with the 55-year-old resident of the province of Hobey on 17 November 2019. On 26 February 2020, WHO reported that the number of new cases of infection in China had declined but the number of new cases of infection in Italy, Iran and South Korea had increased unexpectedly, and the number of new cases of infection outside China had first exceeded the number of new cases of infection in China itself.
The number of cases of disease may be substantially reduced, in particular due to the number of cases with mild symptoms.
As of 26 February, relatively few cases of young people were registered, with patients 19 years of age and younger with less than 2.4 per cent of the world ' s cases. The United Kingdom's chief scientific adviser Patrick Wallans believed that 60 per cent of the British population would be infected by effective group immunity in the country.
Statistics include cases of violations of persons tested in COVID-19 and whose test was positive under official protocols.
As at 23 March, no country was able to verify more than 3 per cent of its population, and in many countries such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland, official policies were adopted to prevent testing of minor symptoms.
A study published on 16 March showed that 86 per cent of COVID-19 infections were not detected in China until 23 January and that such unregistered diseases were the cause of 79 per cent of reported cases.
A statistical analysis published on 30 March showed that the number of cases of actual infection in Italy was significantly higher than the number of reported cases.
The initial evaluation of the basic reproductive number of infections (R0) to COVID-19 was from 1.4 to 2.4.
In a study published by the United States Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, this figure is expected to be 5.7.
Most COVID-19 patients are well cured.
In other more complex cases, from the beginning of symptoms to the moment of death, the most common period was 6 to 41 days.
As at 10 April 2020, some 97,000 deaths were related to COVID-19.
In China, as at 5 February, about 80 per cent of deaths occurred in individuals over 60 years of age and 75 per cent of deaths were associated with heart disease and diabetes. Official mortality data from the COVID-19 pandemic usually include information on the deaths of patients with positive results of COVID testing carried out under official protocols.
The actual number of deaths from COVID-19 may be much higher because official figures may not take into account those who died, not tested, such as those who die at home, in the homes of the elderly, etc.
The lack of data on Italy indicates that the actual number of deaths during the pandemic exceeded official COVID rates 4-5 times.
The U.S. Secretary-General for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recognizes: “We know that [the number of dead] is lower than actual”. His words are confirmed by reports of some individual cases in the United States. Such data are often seen in pandemics, such as H1N1 2009 swine flu epidemics. The first confirmed death was registered in Huhan on 9 January 2020.
The first death was registered outside China’s mother’s borders on 1 February in the Philippines, and on 14 February in France.
By 28 February, more than ten deaths were registered outside China ' s mother ' s borders: Iran, South Korea and Italy.
By 13 March, countries and regions on all continents, except Antarctica, reported deaths.
All indicators vary depending on the region and time of spread of disease; they also affect the quality of tests, health systems used in treatment schemes, from the start of the outbreak of disease and population parameters such as age, gender and overall health. The death/poverty factor represents the number of deaths due to the number of diagnosed cases of infection during the time period.
According to statistics from the University of Jones Hopkins, as at 10 April 2020, the global number of deaths and injuries is 6.0% (97 039/617,204).
The data vary from region to region.
In China, mortality rates fell from 17.3 per cent (for those with symptoms from 1 to 10 January 2020) to 0.7 per cent (for those with symptoms since 1 February 2020). Other methods include the identification of mortality as a result of disease (CFR) as a percentage of diagnosed patients dying from the disease and as a percentage of death from the infection (IFR), which reflects the percentage of infected (both diagnosed and undiagnated) patients dying from the disease.
These statistics are not time-bound and reflect the indicators of certain population groups from the point of view of infection to the end of the disease.
Some scientists have tried to calculate these indicators on specific groups of people.
According to estimates of the Oxford University Evidence Centre, the mortality rate from this pandemic is 0.1 to 0.39 per cent.
The upper figure of this range is consistent with the results of the first voluntary test at COVID-19 in Germany, as well as with a statistical study analysing the impact of the CFR assessment.
WHO claims that the current pandemic can be controlled.
The peak and correct duration of the shock are not defined and may vary depending on the location.
Mace Boni, a staff member of the University of Pennsylvania, claims that “uncontrolled infection outbreaks usually go to bed, and then when the number of available carriers is completed, they begin to breathe.
In the present situation, however, it is practically impossible to make any reasonable forecast as to when this will happen.”
The senior medical adviser to the Chinese Government of June Nanishan claims that “all can end by June” if all countries are able to mobilize and implement WHO recommendations on measures to stop the spread of the virus.
On 17 March Adam Kucharski of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine stated that SARS-CoV-2 “will be circulating, perhaps within a year or two”.
According to a study conducted by the Imperial College under the direction of Nil Ferguson, “until a vaccine (maybe 18 months or more) has been established”, physical distance measures and other measures will be required.
William Shaffner, a staff member of the University of Vanderbilt, says: "I don't think this corna virus will ever disappear because it's so easily transmitted," and "it can become a seasonal disease that lasts every year".
The frequency of new outbreaks will depend on collective immunity and degree of mutation.
COVID-19 symptoms may be relatively non-specific, and some infected people may carry disease without symptoms.
Two of the most common symptoms are increased temperature (88 per cent) and dry cough (68 per cent).
Less common symptoms include stiffness, dyspnoea (lowness), loss of appetite, nausea, muscle pain and ingredients, pain in the throat, headache, dizziness, vomiting, bleeding, diarrhoea or cionosis. WHO claims that it is seriously sick with respiratory problems for almost every six people.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) lists immediate symptoms such as difficulty in breathing, permanent pain or chest depression, sudden sensation of consciousness, difficulty in awakening, and loss of a person or loss.
Some infected people may experience the disease without any clinical evidence, but the results of the analysis confirm the fact of infection, so doctors recommend that patients in close contact with patients who have been diagnosed with a diagnosis that is confirmed under strict control and investigated for infection.
According to Chinese scientists, the number of cases of non-communicable disease is estimated from several units to 44 per cent of all cases.
The usual incubation period (time between infection and symptoms) is cycled from one to 14 days; it usually consists of five days. It is still not fully clear of the symptoms of infection: according to initial estimates, the percentage of patients with COVID-19 who developed the symptoms was 30 per cent and then fell to 15 per cent.
Some details on how to spread the disease are still unknown.
The disease is considered to be primarily transmitted during close contact, as well as through small capillaries that are distributed in air together with a glass, a chicory or during conversation; under close contact, contact is indicated by a radius of from 1 to 2 metres (3 to 6 feet).
According to some studies, open-ended cables can be spread from 4.5 metres (15 feet) to 8.2 metres (27 feet).
There are assumptions that the virus can also be transmitted through small capillaries released in the air during conversation that can remain in the air for longer periods. Respiratory capillaries can also be formed during the discharge, including during the conversation, even though the virus is normally not transferred to the air.
Capsules can fall into the mouth or nose of a number of people, as well as into ease.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and heart disease (SLD), may lead to the spread of respiratory products and therefore to the spread of the virus in the air.
It can also penetrate the body if a person concerns contaminated surface, including skin, with subsequent contact with his or her eyes, nose or neck.
There are also fears that the virus may be transmitted through fecalis, but the risk of this transmission is low.
The Government of China rejects the possibility of oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The virus is most infected within the first three days of symptoms, although its spread may occur before both symptoms and later stages of disease.
There were cases when tests were positive in the three days prior to symptoms, which indicated the possibility of transmission of the virus until the symptoms were expressed.
There are only a few reports of laboratory confirmed cases of non-communicable disease, but in some countries, cases of transmission of disease from non-communicable carriers have also been identified.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) claims that until it is clear how easily the virus is spread, however, it is known that one is usually infected by 2 to 3 other people.
In particular, it was found that the virus can live up to three days on a plastic surface (polypropylene) and on a non-sanitary table (304), on a cardboard surface for one day, and on a nursery surface for up to 4 hours.
However, these data vary depending on the quality and temperature, with positive results for domestic and other animals on COVID-19.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit viruses to humans, although the British authorities advise them to wash their hands after contact with animals, just as they do after contact with other areas where infected people may be exposed.
The heavy respiratory tract syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new virus first detected by three people with pneumonia from the group with severe respiratory diseases registered in Huhan.
All signs of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are found in nature in family coronavirus. The virus can be destroyed outside of the human body by means of a home virus that creates its protective surface. SARS-CoV-2 has a great similarity to the original SARS-CoV virus.
It is supposed to have a zone origin.
The genetic analysis of coronavirus showed that it was genetically clasterized with Betacoronavirus, Sarbecovirus (cell line B), along with two other strains of avian viruses.
At the full-genome level, it is 96% identical to other models of mouse lung virus (BatCov RatG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers discovered that there was only one difference in amino acids in certain parts of the consequences of pangoline and human viruses.
A full-genome comparison today showed that the largest proportion (92 per cent) of the coronavirus is found between Pangolin and SARS-CoV-2, but that is not enough to prove that Pangolins are intermediate viruses.
The virus infection may be pre-diagnosed on the basis of symptoms, although in the end it should be confirmed by a polymeric response analysis with reverse transcription (RT-PCR) of the infected secret or computer tomography.
The results of studies similar to the CPC and CT methods used in Huhan showed that CT was significantly more sensitive than CPC, although less specific, since many of its visualization functions are consistent with other pneumonism and disease-consuming processes.
Since March 2020, the American Institute of Radiology has issued a recommendation “not to use CT for screening or as a method of testing the first line in COVID-19 diagnostics”.
WHO published several RNA test protocols on SARS-CoV-2 and the first of them was published on 17 January.
Tests are conducted on a polymeric-temperature reaction in real-time mode (RT-PCR).
It can be performed on breathing samples and blood samples.
The results are usually ready for a period of several hours to several days.
The test is usually used to test the brain from the nose, although the brain from the stomach can also be used. A number of laboratories and companies are developing serological tests to detect antibodies.
As at 6 April 2020, none of these were sufficiently accurate to obtain approval for universal application.
In the United States, a serological test developed by Cellex was approved for use in extracurricular cases only by certified laboratories.
The characteristics of X-ray and computer-tomography (CT) symptoms include asymmetric peripheral disturbances of the type of maternal glass and the absence of pulmonary embolism.
The Italian Radiological Society is involved in the development of an international photo of confirmed violations.
Due to other infections such as adenovirus, COVID-19 photos not confirmed by PCD tests have a limited clinical specification.
A major study was conducted in China, during which the results of the CT breast cell and CPC testing were compared, and it was found that, although the photos were less specific in case of infection, they could be easily decrypted; they were more sensitive, and therefore the diagnostic method could be considered as a screening tool in infected areas.
In order to diagnose the virus using X-ray and computer tomography, wired neuron networks have been developed on the basis of artificial intelligence.
The disease prevention strategies include the maintenance of general personal hygiene, washing hands, avoiding eye contact, nose or neck injuries, the use of knives or lashes that should be excavated immediately after use.
Those who may already have been infected should wear a medical mask in public places.
In order to prevent the spread of disease, it is also recommended to stay physically away from people, and many Governments recommend refraining from any short-term journey to countries and areas affected by outbreaks and restricting the movement of civilians.
Nevertheless, the virus could be spread in most regions of the world.
This means that the virus is spread among people who do not know where and how it has been infected. Medical workers who are infected are advised to use standard precautions and precautions when contacting other people and the means to protect their eyes.
The use of data on the location of citizens through their mobile phones for this purpose caused concern about compliance with confidentiality, such as Amnesty International (International Amnesty), as well as over 100 other organizations, made statements requiring that this type of surveillance be restricted.
Various mobile applications for voluntary use were developed and proposed; as of 7 April 2020, more than ten expert groups were working on the development of decisions to ensure the confidentiality of personal data, such as user proximity to other mobile phones using Bluetooth technology.
If a mobile phone user has been in close contact with a person whose test on COVID-19 has been positive, he will receive a corresponding notice. There are also unsubstantial versions of how to prevent infection, such as nose and neck swelling, which is in fact ineffective.
There is currently no COVID-19 vaccine, although most organizations are working on its creation.
In order to prevent the spread of disease, it is recommended to wash your hands.
The CDC (Control and Prevention Centre for Diseases) also recommends more frequently washing hands with lead and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after a toilet visit or when the hand is severely contaminated, as well as before the needle, after it is crushed, itching or itching.
This is necessary because, in the presence of the human body, the virus is destroyed by a domestic virus that engulfs its protective face.
In addition, if flour and water are not available, CDC recommends the use of disinfectants to process hands on a spirit basis of at least 60 per cent.
WHO recommends that people avoid eye contact, nose or face with their hands.
The surfaces may be affected by a number of solutions (at the surface of the navigator, the disinfectant starts operating at a minute after wear) with 62 to 71 per cent of ethanol, 50 to 100 per cent of isopropanol, 0.1 per cent of sodium hypochlorite, 0.5 per cent of hydrochloric acid and 0.2 to 7.5 per cent of iodine.
Other components, such as Benzalconic chloride and gluconate chloride, are less effective.
CDC recommends that, if COVID is suspected or confirmed in the establishment, such as office or daily station, all areas of such space, including cabinets, toilets, general use facilities, electronic equipment, such as planets, sensors, keyboards, remote controls and ATMs used by people with disabilities.
Medical organizations recommend covering the mouth and nose with the back of a flat or sludge and immediate release of the hygiene items used.
Those who may have been infected are advised to use medical masks as the use of masks may limit the volume and range of outlet products that are absorbed in air during speech, washing and brushing.
WHO has issued instructions on when and how to use medical masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist from the University of Lids, “the use of medical masks can reduce people's perception of their faces, and exposure to people with disabilities is a major means of infection”.
WHO recommends that healthy people wear medical masks only if they are at high risk, for example, for people who are infected with COVID-19 while it also recognizes that using masks actually reduces the amount of exposure to individuals.
Several countries have begun calling for the use of public health masks.
CDC centres, the United States, recommend wearing tissue masks for non-medical appointment. China has emphasized the importance of using single-time medical masks for healthy people, especially if they are in close contact with other people (1 meter (3 ft) or less).
In Hong Kong it is recommended to wear a medical mask in public transport or in public places.
Health officials in Thailand call on people to prepare face - to - face masks in domestic conditions and to wear them daily.
In the Czech Republic and Slovakia, citizens are prohibited from entering the street without masks covering their nose and legs.
On 16 March, the Government of Viet Nam requested all citizens to wear masks in public places in order to protect themselves and others.
The Government of Austria has imposed medical masks on all visitors to the product stores.
The Government of Israel has also requested citizens to wear masks in public places.
On 1 April, in Taiwan, where 10 million medical masks were produced per day from the middle of March, medical masks were required to be used for all passengers on trips and international buses.
In Panama, residents are required to wear a medical mask on the street; those who cannot afford masks were advised to stay on their own in their homes.
Medical masks are also widely used by the inhabitants of Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social distance (also known as physical distance) is an infection control measure aimed at slowing the spread of disease by minimizing close contact between people.
Protection measures include quarantines, travel restrictions, school closures, workplaces, stadiums, theaters and shopping centres.
People can use social distance measures, staying home, limiting travel, avoiding public places, using uncommunicative greetings and physically distanced from others.
Many governments of the regions, especially those affected by shock, are currently prescribing or recommending social distance.
The maximum number of people who could be gathered in one place according to the recommendations of the United States Government and health organizations was rapidly reduced from 250 people (in regions where no COVID-19 was available), up to 50 people and up to 10 people later.
On 22 March 2020, Germany refused to meet in groups involving more than two people. Elderly people and others suffering from diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, hypertonia and weakened immune system are faced with an increased risk of virus infection in a serious form. The CDC recommends that they stay home if there is a outbreak of disease in the region. At the end of March 2020, WHO and other health authorities began to replace the term “social distance” with “physical distance” to “physical distance”, thus explaining the purpose of these measures in relation to virtuosity, so as to avoid physical contact.
The use of the term “social distance” has been understood to mean that people should be subjected to full social isolation instead of staying in contact with other people in alternative ways; some public authorities have published guidelines on sexual health that should be used during the pandemic.
Among other things, it has been recommended that only your permanent partners with whom you live and that you are convinced that there is no virus and its symptoms.
Persons with COVID-19 diagnosis and those who suspect that they are infected are recommended for home isolation.
Health institutions have published detailed instructions on appropriate self-insulation, and many Governments have also imposed obligations or have recommended that all affected areas themselves be placed on quarantine.
Persons in high-risk groups were required to have a better quarantine.
Persons who may have contacted infected COVID-19 or recently visited the country or region, to a large extent affected by the epidemic, have been advised to find quarantine within 14 days of the last possible contact.
Emergency strategies include preventing the spread of disease, its impact or mitigation.
The prevention of disease spread is early and aims to trace and isolate infected persons, as well as other infection control and vaccination measures aimed at stopping the spread of disease among the rest of the population.
At a time when the spread of disease is no longer possible, efforts are being made to mitigate the effects: measures are being taken aimed at reducing the spread and mitigate the effects of the epidemic on health and society.
Measures to prevent and mitigate the effects of spreading the disease may be taken simultaneously.
The strain of infection requires more extreme measures to reverse the pandemic, reducing the basic number of cases of infection to level below 1. Part of the effort to manage outbreak outbreaks is aimed at reducing the epidemic's peak, known as an epidemiological bleeding.
Such efforts reduce the risk of overloading health services and provide more time for the development of vaccines and treatment methods.
Non-pharmaceutical interventions that can help deal with outbreaks include personal preventive measures such as hygiene, the use of medical masks and self-sustainment; public measures aimed at physical distance, such as closure of schools and the abolition of mass activities; community involvement in the promotion of such measures and their participation; and environmental protection measures such as surface cleaning; after the serious outbreak in China, more decisive actions were taken to prevent outbreaks such as seizures and destructions.
Other countries have also taken a number of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus.
In South Korea, there were massive screenings and localized quarantines, as well as the work of the system of reporting on the displacement of infected persons.
In Singapore, there was financial support for infected persons who were self-insolated and severely punished those who had not done so.
In Taiwan, the production of medical masks has increased and drug seizures have increased. The United Kingdom and the United States modelling has shown that there are serious problems with mitigation (slowing but not stopping the spread of the epidemic) and stress (the end of the epidemic growth).
The optimal disease mitigation policy can reduce the physical burden on the health system by 2/3 and mortality by two but still lead to hundreds of thousands of deaths and collapses of health systems.
The pressure may be preferable, but it should be used until the virus is circulating among the population (or until the vaccine is not developed if it occurs earlier), as the spread of the disease is rapidly repeated when the measures are weakened.
Long-term intervention to push the pandemic brings social and economic costs.
Antiviral preparations approved for COVID-19 are currently not available, but efforts are being made to develop them, including testing existing preparations.
Taking non-receptive medicines out of the mouth, drinking sufficient fluids and breathing may help relieve symptoms.
Depending on the severity of the patient's illness, oxygen therapy, internal fluid intake and respiratory support may be required.
The use of steroids can only harm.
Several associations previously approved for the treatment of other viral diseases are also considered for use in the treatment of COVID-19.
WHO has also reported that some “traditional and household resources” may alleviate symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.
WHO considers enhancing the health capacity and adaptability of patients with COVID-19 as a key response to the outbreak.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and the European Regional Office of WHO have issued guidelines for primary medical assistance clinics and services to help allocate resources at several levels, including the focus of laboratory testing services on COVID-19, the abolition of emergency procedures where possible, identification and isolation of patients with COVID-19 confirmed diagnosis, and the increase of intensive therapy through training and the increase in access to HIV and cocaine.
There are various theories about where the first case of infection could occur — the so-called “null patient. ”
The first known case of infection of a new cornovirus infection was likely to take place on 1 December 2019 in the town of Huboye, China.
During the month, the number of cases of cornavirus infection in the province of Hobey increased gradually.
They were mainly linked to the very market of Huananian marine products, which also sold live animals, and one of the theories is that the virus originated in one of these animals; in other words, the virus has a zoological origin. On 26 December in Hobey, a case of massive pneumonia in which Dr. Jan Tianczyn was working, reported on the case at the Zianhan Control and Prevention Centre in the city of Khan.
On 30 December, the medical group of the city’s central clinic had warned its colleagues about “coronavirus similar to SARS”.
Eight of these doctors, including Li Venlan, were warned by the police about the responsibility for spreading false hearings, and the doctor, Ay Fen, received an order from his superiors for panic.
Later, on 31 December, the Huhanya Municipal Health Commission published a public announcement and informed WHO of the situation.
The Hughan health authorities reported the number of cases of unknown pneumonia, which appeared to be large enough to initiate the investigation early in January, and at early stages, the number of cases doubled by about every seven and a half days.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus was also spread in other Chinese provinces, which contributed to the Chinese New Year's celebrations and the fact that Khan was a transport and a major railway damage.
On 20 January, China reported 140 new cases of infection in one day, including two people in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
According to later official data, by 20 January 2020, there were already 6,174 people with symptoms of disease. By 26 March the United States had infected China and Italy with the highest number of confirmed worldwide violations. On 9 April 2020, more than 1.61 million cases of infection were registered worldwide, more than 97,000 were killed and more than 364,000 were cured.
About 200 countries and territories had at least one registered case of infection.
Because of the pandemic, many European countries in the Schengen area have limited freedom of movement and have established border control.
National responses included measures to prevent the spread of disease, such as quarantine (known as compulsory residence, home or isolation), as well as a time of command. As of 2 April, about 300 million people, or about 90 per cent of the United States' population, were in any form of quarantine, more than 50 million people were in the Philippines, and about 59 million people were in isolation in South Africa and 1.3 million people in India.
On March 26, 1.7 billion people around the world were in one form or another, and within two days this figure increased to 2.6 billion people — about a third of the world’s population.
The first confirmed case of COVID-19 disease was registered in Huhana on 1 December 2019; according to another report, the authenticity of the information that was not verified was dated 17 November.
On 26 December, Dr. Jan Zizian worked with a massive neuron disease of an unknown type, and on 27 December her clinic informed the Center for the Control and Prevention of Czjanhan's disease in the city of Huang.
The first genetic testing of patient samples, which took place on 27 December 2019, showed the presence of SARS-like coronavirus.
On 31 December, the Huhanya Municipal Health Commission issued an appropriate public notice.
The WHO was notified on that day.
In connection with such notifications, the police warned the Hahan doctors about the responsibility of “suspending.”
The Chinese National Health Commission initially claimed that there was no “open evidence” of the ability to transfer the newly discovered virus from man to man.
At the end of January, the Chinese Government launched a radical campaign to halt the spread of the virus, later referred to by the Secretary-General of the Chinese Communist Party Si Ci Zhinpin “national war”.
The events of “the largest quarantine in human history”, on 23 January, were announced on the health chain and on the ban on access to the Huang and, on the other hand, were later widely distributed in 15 cities in the province of Hobay and affected in total about 57 million people.

In addition to newly-built hospitals in China, 14 other institutions, such as conference centres and stadiums, have also re-profiled in temporary hospitals. On 26 January, the Government has taken additional measures to prevent COVID-19 outbreaks, including the issue of health records for passengers and the extension of the New Year's celebration period.
All over the country, universities and schools were closed.

For example, a 14-day mandatory quarantine was introduced in Beijing for all international passengers entering the city, and as at 23 March, only one case of intra-country transmission of infection occurred five days earlier, in the case of a man who returned to Guangzhou from Istanbul.
On 24 March 2020, Prime Minister Lee Ketten reported that the spread of domestic diseases had been largely halted and the outbreak in China had been controlled.

It was confirmed that COVID-19 had spread across the territory of South Korea on 20 January 2020 from China.
On 20 February, the National Ministry of Health reported a significant increase in the number of confirmed cases of disease, many of which were due to the large number of followers of a new religious movement known as the Church of Jesus Shinchongji.
The Shinchongji investigators came to Togo from Uganda, which is supposed to be a source of shock.
As of 22 February, 1,261 (about 13 per cent) of the 9 336 followers of the church reported symptoms of disease. On 23 February 2020, the highest level of anxiety was announced in South Korea.
On 28 February, more than 2,000 confirmed cases of infection were registered in Korea, with an increase of 3,150 on 29 February.
All South Korean military bases were placed on quarantine after three military analyses confirmed the presence of viruses.
The outbreak affected the number of flights, so the flight schedule of airlines was changed, and South Korea launched a population screening programme on the presence of viruses, contact monitoring and quarantine measures for contact individuals, which is considered to be the largest and best of its organizations in the world.
The screening methods included mandatory information on their symptoms through the mobile application of all visitors from abroad, criminal testing on the virus that was already ready for the next day, as well as increased testing opportunities that allowed up to 20,000 people to be tested daily.
The South Korean programme is considered successful in combating the outbreak of disease, despite the fact that the entire city has not been isolated there.
Many Koreans have signed requests which have either praised the President ' s actions or called upon Mr. Munu to make an impression on them that the Government ' s response to the outbreak of the disease is inadequate.

By 17 March, at least 12 or former Iranian policies and government officials had ended.
By March 23, Iran had registered 50 new cases of coronary virus and every ten minutes — one new death from the coronary virus.
According to the WHO representative, the level of disease in Iran may be five times higher than that reported at the official level.
It is also expected that US sanctions on Iran may affect the financial capacity of countries to protect against the spread of the virus.
The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights required mitigation of economic sanctions against countries most affected by the pandemic, including Iran.
On 31 January, it was confirmed that the disease occurred in Italy when two Chinese tourists tested SARS-CoV-2 in Rome gave positive results.

One CNN report notes that such a high level of mortality in Italy can contribute to the combination of two factors — the large number of elderly citizens in the country and the lack of access to more people today than do Korean virus.
The United Kingdom responded most peacefully to this virus from all affected countries, and by 18 March 2020, the British Government did not require citizens to comply with any form of social distance or quarantine.
As a result, the Government was criticised for the insufficient rapid and serious response to the threat posed by the people of the country. On 16 March, Prime Minister Boris Johnson made a statement recommending that all trips and social contacts not be of primary importance, offering people the opportunity to work from home and avoid public places such as pubs, restaurants and theaters.
On 20 March, the Government announced that all entertainment establishments, such as pubs and sports clubs, should close as soon as possible and promised to pay up to 80 per cent of their wages, but not more than 2,500 pounds per month as measures to support the population during the crisis. On 23 March, the Prime Minister announced more severe social distance measures, preventing more than two people from getting together and restricting the travel and active rest of the air only in extreme need.

On the other hand, Chinese assistance was well received in some parts of Latin America and Africa. On 2 April, the World Bank launched emergency assistance operations for developing countries.
WHO has highly appreciated the efforts of the Chinese authorities to combat the epidemic and prevent the spread of infection.
WHO noted the clear difference between the situation with the outbreak of typical pneumonia, which took place between 2002 and 2004, during which the Chinese authorities were accused of concealing information that prevented the prevention of disease and its spread, on the one hand, and the current crisis when the central government " regularly provided updated information on the situation in order to avoid panic during the New Year of China".
On 23 January, in response to the decision of the central authorities to prohibit the movement of public health in Uganda, the representative of WHO, Mr. Goden Galea, noted that although “this measure has been recommended not to do so”, it was also “an important confirmation of the commitment to prevent the epidemic in the most widespread place”, and called it “unprecedent in the history of public health”. On 30 January, after confirming the ability to transfer infection from person to the borders of China and the increase in the number of infected countries in other countries, WHO announced an emergency situation with the international population in drought;
The Director-General of WHO, Mr. Tedros Adam, stated that the PHEC declaration was “a risk of global distribution, particularly in low and medium-income countries with no reliable health systems.
Commenting on the restrictions on travel, Mr. Tedros stated that “there are no reasons for measures that are too restrictive of international movement and trade” and that “the WHO does not recommend that trade and movement be restricted”.
On 5 February, WHO called on the world community to allocate $675 million to provide strategic preparedness for the low-income epidemic, reporting the need for immediate assistance to countries that “have no systems to identify people infected with the virus, despite the fact that the epidemic has not yet reached them”.
Mr. Tedros also stated that “the indicator of our readiness is the degree of willingness to deal with the epidemic of our very weak reputation”, and called on the international community to “make a choice: invest today or pay in the future”. At the press conference held on 11 February, WHO established the official name of the disease, COVID-19.
On the same day, Tedros stated that UN Secretary-General Antony Guterrich agreed to provide “the capacity of the entire UN system to respond to the problem”.
As a result, the United Nations Crisis Management Group, which coordinates all United Nations response measures, has been established; these steps, as WHO states, will allow “to focus on health response, while other governments can use their experience to combat the spread of disease in a broader social and economic perspective”.
On 14 February, WHO and China launched a joint special group, which provided for the work of international experts and WHO staff in China to assist in addressing the situation within the country and to assess “the seriousness of the disease and its vulnerability”, organized seminars and meetings with leading national institutions, as well as on site to assess “effective response measures at the provincial and district level, including urban and rural areas”. On 25 February WHO stated that “the world must do more to prepare for the possible pandemic of the crown virus, noting that “the disease is not yet on its way to end” that “the disease is still on its way.”
When the outbreak broke out in Iran, WHO sent a joint group to assess the situation. On 28 February WHO officials stated that the likelihood of global coronavirus spread would be increased from “high” to “high” face” to “high” – the highest level of preparedness and risk.
Mike Ryan, Executive Director of WHO ' s Emergency Health Programme, warned in his statement: "This is a check by every Government on the planet to be ready for real-time cases: early action.
This virus may already be on its way to your country and you need to be ready," he also stressed that the right response can help the world to avoid the “bad development scenario”.
Ryan also stated that current data do not serve as a basis for announcing the global pandemic to official public health representatives, and he added that the pandemic declaration would mean that “we are in fact acknowledging that every person on the planet will be at risk of being infected by this virus”.
On 11 March, WHO announced the outbreak of cornovirus pandemic.
The Director-General of WHO stated that WHO was “deeply concerned at the high level of spread and serious disease and at least the alarming level of non-effects on this issue”. WHO was critical of the perceived inadequate approach to the understanding of the pandemic, including the subsequent announcement of the emergency situation in public health and the classification of the virus as a pandemic.
As a response to the situation, Mr. Tedros Adanoma, Director-General of WHO, was invited to resign, which was signed by 733 000 persons on 6 April.
On 26 March 2020, ten UN human rights experts emphasized the importance of respect for each human rights during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The Group stated that everyone had the right to apply life-saving measures and that the Government was responsible for the organization of such measures.
The Panel stressed that the lack of resources or medical insurance should not at any time serve as a justification for discrimination against any particular group of people.
The experts stressed that everyone had the right to health, including people with limited opportunities, representatives of minority groups, elderly citizens, internally displaced persons, homeless persons, citizens living in extremely poor conditions, prisoners and refugees and other disadvantaged groups in need of public support.
International government organizations consider the economic and social consequences of the COVID-19 crisis.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development has set up a platform for providing timely and comprehensive information on policy responses in countries around the world, as well as for identifying views and recommendations.
The digital user contains information on the political measures of various countries (Country Policy Tracker) to strengthen health and the world economy, address the impact of quarantine and travel restrictions in order to help countries learn from one another and to promote coordinated global response to crown virus.
The Government of China has been criticised by the United States, the British Cabinet Minister Michael Gowa and Eduardo Bolsonaru, the son of Brazil's President Jaira Bolsonar, for the anti-Pandemy actions that began with the Chinese province of Hobey.
A number of leaders of the Chinese Communist Party (CPC) had been removed from the provincial level for the quarantine measures they had taken in the central part of China and had witnessed the failure to respond to the political suffocation in these regions.
Some commentators believe that this step aimed at protecting the Secretary-General of the Chinese Communist Party, Si Zzypin, from the anger of the public over the outbreak of crown virus.
Some Chinese officials, such as Jáo Lizjanj, have expressed disagreement with the earlier statement that the outbreak of corona virus began in Huhane, but have taken sides in the theory of speech, according to which COVID-19 appeared in the United States or Italy.
The U.S. President Donald Trappa's Administration called the crown virus “China virus” or “Uhanya virus” and said that “cancer in China only aggravates the situation with the virus that has now become a global pandemic”, and this expression has been criticised by some commentators who claim that this approach is racist and “restraints the ability of the President of the United States to prevent the spread of disease”.
The Daily Beast had access to a government telegram of the United States containing communication strategic urgency, which was apparently endorsed by the National Security Council; while there were references to the strategy: “All the cases in China.
We are asked to disseminate this information in any way possible, including press conferences and television presentations." Such organizations as Politico, Foreign Policy and Bloomberg said that China's efforts to provide assistance to countries suffering from the virus are part of a “propagandist effort” aimed at achieving global impact.
The head of the EU Foreign Affairs Board, Joseph Borrell, warned of the presence of “a geopolitical component that includes the fight against peer influence and so-called charity policy”.
Borrell also stated that "China strongly promotes its role as a responsible and trusted partner, in contrast with the United States".
China also called on the United States to abolish sanctions against Syria, Venezuela and Iran, while some reports indicate that assistance was being sent to the last two countries.
The victim of Jack Ma 100,000 medical masks in Cuba fell under ban in connection with US sanctions imposed on 3 April.
The US authorities are also accused of transferring assistance to other countries in their own country.
There has also been disputes between other countries, such as Germany, Austria and Switzerland, Czech Republic and Italy.
In addition, Turkey has adopted hundreds of ILL equipment for Spain.
At the beginning of March, the Italian Government criticised the lack of support from the European Union in relation to the spread of the Italian crown virus.
Maurizio Masari, an Italian Ambassador to the EU, said that "China only responded bilaterally.
This is not a sign of European solidarity.”
On 22 March, following a telephone conversation with Italian Prime Minister Josephe Conte, Russian President Vladimir Putin organized a shipment to Italy of Russian military sanitaries, specialized in disinfection transport and other medical equipment.
The Italian newspaper La Stampa quotes an anonymous "high-level political source", claiming that 80 per cent of Russian aid was "useless or of little benefit to Italy".
The source accused Russia of seeking to make a favourable impression on the world public at the “goopolitical and diplomatic” level.
President Attilio Fontan and Italian Foreign Minister Luigi Di Mayo rejected the attacks on the media and expressed their appreciation for the assistance.
Russia also sent a cargo aircraft with medical assistance to the United States.
Press Secretary Cremla Dmitry Peskov stated that “by offering assistance to American colleagues, [Putin] assumes that when the American producers of medical equipment and materials find their production pace, they will also be able to provide adequate assistance if necessary”.
NATO Military Training "Protection 2020", planned in Germany, Poland and the Baltic States — NATO's largest military training after the end of the cold war — will be conducted in a reduced format.
The Secretary-General of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, Kate Hudson, criticised the teachings of Defender 2020 (Protection-2020), "In a crisis situation that has taken place in public health today, the conduct of these studies is a threat not only to the military of the United States and many European parties but also to the population of the countries where such activities are to be carried out." The Government of Iran suffered a serious injury from the virus. It was infected by about two dozen members of Parliament, as well as five other present or former political actors.
On 14 March 2020, President Iran Hasan Ruhani addressed the world leaders in an open letter, reporting that his country was experiencing difficulties in combating the epidemic due to lack of access to international markets in relation to sanctions imposed against Iran. The epidemic had caused calls to the United States for the adoption of a social policy distributed in other countries, including the introduction of a single health and care system for children paid for family leave and increased public health funding.
Politicians expected that this could have a negative impact on Donald Trapa's chances of re-election at the 2020 presidential elections. The pandemic had undermined diplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea.
South Korea criticised Japan ' s "some significant and passive quarantine measures" after Japan declared that any citizen coming from South Korea would be placed on a two-week quarantine in the areas specifically designated by the Government.
South Korean society has been greatly divided by the reaction of President Mun Xe-ina to the crisis.
Many Koreans have signed a petition which has either praised the President ' s actions or called upon Mr. Munu to make an impression on them that the Government ' s response to the outbreak of the disease is inadequate; the pandemic has forced countries to adopt emergency laws as a response.
Some commentators are concerned that this step will enable Governments to strengthen their powers.
In Hungary, the Parliament voted in favour of granting Prime Minister Victor Orbanan ' s permanent right to manage, suspend Parliament's work, and to hold elections and punish those who will be charged with spreading viral information and government measures to combat the crisis.
The outbreak of coronavirus was called a number of cases of supply deficits related to the global increase in the use of equipment to combat the epidemic, the purchase of goods under panic conditions and the flows of production and logistics operations.
The Administration of the United States Food and Drug Quality Control Office issued a warning of a shortage of medicines and medical equipment, resulting from an increased demand for consumer goods and supplies.
There were also panicked purchases in several populations; this resulted in the loss of supplies from the warehouses, such as food products, toilet books and bottled water, which, in turn, led to a lack of stocks.
In particular, the technology industry warns of delays in supplying electronic goods.
According to the Director-General of WHO, Mr. Tedros Adanoma, the demand for individual protection grew 100 times.
This jump has led to a two-fold increase in prices compared to the usual price and delays in supplying medical supplies for four to six months.
It also caused a lack of resources for individual protection around the world, and WHO warned that health workers would be affected by this.
In Australia, in connection with the pandemic, system buyers were given a new opportunity to sell Australian goods in China.
This activity led to a lack of child food in some supermarkets and was subsequently prohibited by the Government of Australia. Despite the high prevalence of COVID-19 cases in northern Italy and the Huang region, as well as a high demand for food, food shortages were avoided in both areas.
The measures taken by China and Italy to combat the accumulation of stocks and illicit trade of critically important products that have proved to be successful have helped to prevent the sharp food shortages expected in Europe and North America.
North Italy, which has small agricultural production, has not experienced significant declines, but it is believed that prices for agricultural production can grow.
Several food stores remained empty only temporarily, even in the city of Khan, while the government officials of China provided access to pig stocks in order to ensure that the population was fully fed.
Similar laws require food-producing producers to keep food stocks in emergency situations exist in Italy.
The damage to the world economy has affected China: According to the media of 16 March, China's economy suffered a significant drop in its sales volume in the first two months of 2020 due to the measures taken to combat the spread of the virus by the Government, resulting in a 20.5 per cent decline in sales of differentials.
China is a major economic and productive centre; therefore, it is considered that the virus outbreak poses a serious destabilizing threat to the world economy.
According to the Agate Demarai, Economicist Intelligence Unit, market volatility will remain until there is a more clear view of potential outcomes.
In January 2020, some analysts believed that the economic effects of the current global growth epidemic could affect the effects of the epidemic of the epidemiological pneumonia in 2002-2004.
One of the estimates made by an expert from the University of Washington, St. Louis, may amount to over $300 billion in damage to the world supply chain and may have a negative impact for up to two years.
It is reported that the Organization of Petroleum Exporters (OPEC) has begun to take “severe measures” following a sharp decrease in oil prices due to demand from China.
On 24 February, the world's financial markets were torn apart by a significant increase in the number of people infected with COVID-19 outside China ' s mother country.
On 27 February, due to growing fears about the outbreak of coronavirus, various fund indexes of the United States, including NASDAQ-100, S&P 500 and the Dou-Johns index for industrial companies, demonstrated the fastest decline since 2008, while the Dou index fell to 1191 — the largest one-day fall after the 2007-2008 financial crisis.
At the end of the week, all three indexes showed more than 10 per cent decline.
On 28 February, the Skopje Ratings GmbH confirmed the sovereign credit rating of China but maintained a negative forecast.
The action was rescinded because of the threats to the spread of coronavirus, and the largest fall occurred on 16 March.
Many believe that economic recession exists.
Economist Mohamed El-Erian has given high appreciation for the timely emergency measures taken by central banks and States.
Central banks respond faster than during the 2008 financial crisis.
Tourism is one of the most affected sectors with regard to the prohibitions on movement, the closure of public places, including tourist attractions, and the recommendations of Governments to avoid any travel.
As a result of all of these measures, many airlines cancelled flights due to a sharp reduction in aircraft demand, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines and Qantas, and the British regional airline Flybe ceased to exist.
The negative impact on the cross-line industry has never been strong.
A number of railway stations and port ports of parallel movement have also been closed.
The epidemic coincided with Chung-jun, the main tourist season of Chinese New Year's celebrations.
National and regional Governments have abolished a number of activities involving large numbers of people, including annual festivals; private companies have also closed their shops and tourist attractions, such as Hong Kong and Shanghai.
Many of the new activities have been cancelled and tourist attractions have been closed to prevent mass seizures; for example, in Beijing the Prohibited City has been closed and traditional temple flags have been removed.
In 24 of the 31 provinces, municipalities and areas of China, the authorities extended the new Canicula by 10 February, and indicated that most companies were not open until that date.
There were 80 per cent of GDP in these regions and 90 per cent of exports.
The Hong Kong authorities have raised the level of response to infectious diseases to the highest level and announced an emergency situation, closed schools until March, and cancelled the New Year's celebration.
A 40 per cent reduction in trade in Europe and Latin America has been observed.
The sales volume in North America and the Middle East decreased by 50 to 60 per cent.
As a result, in March the presence of trade centres fell from 33 to 43 per cent compared with February.
Trade centres around the world have taken additional measures, such as improving health conditions, establishing equipment to check the temperature of visitors and cancel activities. According to the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, a pandemic in Latin America may leave a limit of 14 to 22 million people more than that would have been in a similar situation without a pandemic.
In January and February 2020, about 5 million people lost their jobs in the outbreak of the Hughan epidemic in China.
Many of the 300 million Chinese rural workers were housed in their country's provinces or closed up in the province of Hobay, and in March 2020 more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and sought help from the Government.
According to estimates by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, in the United States, an estimated 47 million people could be unemployed and 32 per cent unemployed. Self-insulation measures introduced in India leave 10 million Indian migrant workers paid daily. A study conducted by the Institute of Angus Reida showed that 44 per cent of Canadian households were either unemployed or unemployed. Almost 900,000 Spanish workers also lost jobs since the 20th of March in Spain.
During the second half of March 4 million French workers made temporary claims for unemployment, while 1 million British workers sought a single social payment. Nearly half a million companies in Germany transferred their staff to a government-subsidised reduced work schedule — a day of lack of work.
The German working day pay scheme was also introduced in France and Great Britain.
The areas of art and cultural heritage have also suffered greatly from a pandemic that has affected the activities of organizations as well as individuals, whether officially or independently, throughout the world.
Cultural and artistic organizations have tried to support their (often funded by a State) mission to ensure access to cultural heritage for society, ensuring the security of their staff and the public and, where possible, supporting the arts.
By March 2020, museums, libraries, concert halls and other cultural institutions had been closed around the world for an unlimited period of time, or their access had been limited to a variety of extent and exhibitions, events and presentations had been cancelled or transferred to other dates.
There have been active efforts to provide alternative services through digital platforms, and yet another recent and emerging traffic has been affected by the spread of the virus — the abolition of religious services, large sports events and other public events such as musical festivals and concerts, technological conferences and fashion exhibitions.
The Vatican also announced the abolition of the Lord’s Evening Meal in Rome, which took place during the last week of the Christian period of the Great Post.
Many Europeans recommend that older Christians stay home and do not visit services for the resurrection; in some churches, church services began to be broadcast on radio, on the ephemeral or on television, while some church leaders offer to perform public service.
The Roman Catholic Church closed up to visit its churches, churches, churches, churches, churches, churches, temples and shrines, and later other religious organizations.
The Ministry of Health of Iran announced the abolition of Friday prayers in areas affected by the outbreak of the crown virus, and the shrines were later closed; Saudi Arabia prohibited foreign settlers and its own residents from accessing the shrines of Mecca and Medina.
The pandemic has led to the most significant changes in the calendar of world sports events since World War II.
Most of the major sports events were cancelled or transferred, including the UEFA 2019-20 Championships League, the Prime Minister 2019-20, the Euro-2020 WEFA, the NBA 2019-20 and the NHL 2019-20 season.
Coronavirus also destroyed plans for the 20th Olympic Games to be launched at the end of July; on 24 March the International Olympic Committee announced that the event would be “transmitted to the period after 2020 but not later than the year 2021”. Casinos and other world-wide gambling establishments were closed and poker tournaments, which were usually transferred to the Effrey River, were either transferred or cancelled.
This has led to the fact that many games have moved online and many gambling sites report a significant increase in the number of new subscribers.
Many large theaters, such as the ships, have also canceled all their performances.
As an alternative to traditional online activities, some artists and musicians have been studying options for continuing their activities and sharing their results on the Internet, organizing direct online concerts or web festivals; this helps creative professionals to continue to perform, publish or publish their works.
There has been a lot of Internet memes on the subject of cornavirus, many of which are hosoriistic and are related to worrying attitudes that are characteristic of periods of uncertainty.
Since the outbreak of COVID-19, there has been an increase in predictability, xenophobic and racism in relation to Chinese citizens and people of East Asia, as well as to the people of Europe, the United States and other countries.
The causes of fear, suspicion and hostility were observed in many countries, particularly in Europe, East Asia, North America and the Asia-Pacific region.
Information on February (when most of the cases of infection were still limited by China) established racist attitudes expressed in various groups around the world against Chinese citizens, who had already paid for the virus or received a fair compensation for anything.
In some African countries, anti-China trends are also observed.
Many Huhanya and Hobeya reported discrimination on the basis of their regional origin.
China's citizens, as well as its inhabitants living in infected areas, were supported in both online and online.
The epidemic has begun to spread in new countries, in particular Italy, the first in Europe with a serious outbreak of COVID-19; in this regard, it may also have an impact on the population of such regions, such as Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea, which have already signed an application to prevent its citizens from entering China in order to prevent the epidemic.
In Japan, #ChineseDontComeToJapan (@ChinaDontToJapan) took leading positions in Twitter.
China's citizens, as well as other Asians living in the United Kingdom and the United States of America, report on a growing level of racist attitudes and even attacks.
U.S. President Donald Tramp faced criticism that he called crownavirus "China virus"; critics consider this to be racist and anti-Chinese.
In Ukraine, protestors attacked buses transported to New Singapore by Ukrainian and foreign nationals evacuated from Uganda.
Students from the border with China, North-East India, and trained in major cities of India reported cases of persecution related to the outbreak of coronavirus.
Dilip Ghosh, President of the State Department of the Party of Bhartia Janat, Western Bengal, said that the Chinese destroyed nature and “that is why God punished them”.
These statements were later convicted by the Chinese council in Calcutta, which called them “injurious”. In China, because of the pandemic, xenophobic and racism against non-Chinan citizens were resounded: foreigners became known as “foreign Mussor” and objects entitled “utilization”.
Many newspapers with paid access to information have eliminated such restrictions for some or all areas affected by cornavirus.
Many scientists have presented their scientific articles on cornavirus outbreaks in open access.
Some scientists have decided to give short-term access to the results of their studies on print-out services such as bioRxiv.

Wild animals and diseases transmitted from animal species are health risks related to exotic animals.
The laboratory testing of the 2019 coronary virus (COVID-19) and associated SARS-CoV-2 include methods to detect the presence of the virus and detection methods of antibodies produced in response to the infection.
The presence of viruses in samples is confirmed by OT-PCR, which recognises coronavirus RNC.
This test is specific and is intended only for detecting SARS-CoV-2.
It is used to confirm sufficiently recent or active infections.
The detection of antibodies (serology) can be applied both for diagnostics and for population control.
Antalytic analyses indicate the number of people who have contracted the disease, including those who have been too poor to treat them in the hospital or are not at all present.
The exact level of mortality from this disease and the level of collective immunity can be determined as a result of this test.
As at March 2020, there was no reliable data on the spread of the virus among the population due to limited testing opportunities.
By 23 March no country had been able to verify more than 3 per cent of its population, and the number of tests carried out in various countries was very contradictory.
Such differences in data are likely to have a significant impact on recorded mortality rates which may be significantly higher in some countries.
A test may be performed using a polymeric response of reverse transcription in real-time (rRT-PCR) test on different respiratory methods, including bone marrow or micronucleus.
The results are usually available within a few hours to 2 days.
The OT-PCR test carried out on chickens taken from the throat is only valid during the first week of the disease.
Later, the virus may disappear from the throat, yet it continues to multiply easily.
In infected patients tested during the second week of the disease, alternatives may be taken from the lower respiratory tract using a catheter or may be used for decarcination products (mocrotum).
One of the early PCR tests was developed at the Sharite clinic, Berlin, in January 2020 using a polymeric response with real-time reverse transcription (rRT-PCR) and was based on 250 000 packages that were subsequently distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
As of 23 January 2020, the United Kingdom also developed its test. On 28 January 2020, the South Korean company Kogenbiotech developed a set to detect SARS-CoV-2 on the basis of the PowerCheck Coronavirus CPC.
It identifies the gene E, common to all beta-coronaviruses, and the gene RdRp specific to SARS-CoV-2. China's BGI Group has become one of the first companies to be authorized by the National Drug Administration of China for the extra-use of SARS-CoV-2 based on PCR. In the United States, the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) are distributed through the organization of the International Reagent Resource to carry out its diagnostic panel for RT-PC in real-time (2019-Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel in public health laboratories.
One of the three genetic tests from older versions of the test kits produced incomplete results due to the married reagents and the late CDC test area in Atlanta, resulting in an average of less than 100 samples per day during February 2020.
Two components were not considered reliable until 28 February 2020 and only after that date were allowed to be tested by public and local laboratories.
The testing was approved by the Office for the Monitoring of the Quality of Food Products and Medicines under an external authorisation.
On 5 March 2020, LabCorp announced the possibility of testing COVID-19 infection on the basis of RT-PCR across the country.
Question Diagnostics began testing at COVID-19 throughout the country from 9 March 2020.
No quantitative limitations were stated; collection and processing of analyses should be carried out in accordance with CDC requirements.
In Russia a COVID-19 test was developed and conducted by the State Research Centre for Virusology and Biotechnology.
On 11 February 2020, the test was registered by the Federal Health Supervisory Service. It was reported that on 12 March 2020, Mayo’s client developed a test to detect COVID-19 infection. On 13 March 2020 Roche Diagnostics received FDA approval for the use of the test, which could be performed for 3.5 hours on a large scale, allowing one machine to process approximately 4128 tests within 24 hours.
On 19 March 2020, FDA issued an additional authorisation for the use of Abbott laboratories (EUA) for the testing of Abbott m2000; previously FDA issued a similar authorisation for Hologic, LabCorp and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On 21 March 2020, Cepheid also receives EUA from FDA for a test of approximately 45 minutes.
FDA also approved a test using the technology of amplification of isothermal nuclear oxygen instead of CPC.
Since this test does not require a series of average temperatures cycles, this method can detect positive results in five minutes and negative ones in 13 minutes.
At present there are about 18,000 such machines in the United States, and Abbott plans to increase production to 50,000 tests per day. At present Taiwan is developing a test using a monoclonal antibodies specifically linked to the nucleopasid protein (N-white) of the new crown virus, and there is hope that results will be obtained within 15-20 minutes, such as a flu-like test.
A review of specialized literature in March 2020 concludes that “nurse-cell X-rays have a small diagnostic value in early stages, while CT [computer tomography] results may have such value even before symptoms occur”.
The typical signs identified during the CT include two-way sub-pleural performance focussing on the type of matte glass with peripheral, asymmetric and apostoric distribution.
Subpleural domination, the symptoms of bulimic bridge and consolidation are developing as the disease progresses.
The results of studies similar to the CPC and CT methods used in Huhan at the time of the current pandemic have shown that CTC is much more sensitive than CPC, although less specific, since many of its visualization functions are consistent with other processes for pneumonia and other diseases.
Since March 2020, the American Institute of Radiology has issued a recommendation “not to use the CT for screening or as a first line test method in the COVID-19 diagnosis”. As of March 2020, CDC recommends using the CPC method.
The partial immune response to the infection is expressed in the development of antibodies, including IgM and IgG.
These antibodies can be used to detect infections in humans after 7 days of symptoms, to identify immunity and to control population.
In many clinical laboratories, these analyses will be able to perform high-performance automated systems, but their availability will depend on the speed of production of each system.
CLT usually uses a peripheral blood sample, although serial samples can also be used to monitor immune response.
At PoCT one sample of blood is usually obtained by means of each cover.
Unlike CPC methods, the blood collection phase is not required to take the test analysis. On 26 March 2020, FDA called 29 organizations that have passed all the necessary registration procedures and are now able to pass their tests on the antidote.
As at 7 April 2020, only one test was approved by FDA. At the end of March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics were granted European authorisations for the use of their test kits, which can be found in samples of IgG and IgA antibodies capable of fighting the virus.
The effectiveness of the test consists of several hundred samples over a few hours, and therefore this method works much faster than the normal CDR analysis.
The antibodies can normally be detected within 14 days of infection, and at the beginning of April Britain found that none of the samples it acquired for analysis were satisfactory.
In Hong Kong, a scheme has been developed that allows patients suspected of leaving home: “Auxiliary assistance officers transfer a sample sample sample to the patient”, the patient pays back and sometimes receives test results. Britain’s NHS announced that its pilot test scheme will be launched under domestic conditions that removes the risk of infection by other patients, or that it needs to disinfect the ambulance if it has been used for the patient’s transport. During the express-testing of COVID-19, all suspects will be considered.
On 2 March, the National Medical Medical Association in Germany stated that it was ready to conduct about 12,000 tests per day in ambulance conditions and that it was possible to perform only 10,700 tests per week.
If the investigation is directed by a doctor, the costs are covered by medical insurance.
According to the President of Robert Koha Institute, Germany's overall productivity for testing consists of 160,000 tests per week.
As at 19 March, it was proposed that several large cities should be tested.
As at 26 March 2020, the total number of tests in Germany was unknown as only positive results were recorded.
The first laboratory study showed that according to the calendar week 12/2020 of SARS-CoV-2, at least 483,295 analyses were performed by week 12/2020, including 33 491 samples (6.9 per cent) were positive. Israeli Technion and Rambam Hospital researchers developed and tested methods of simultaneous testing of samples taken in 64 patients, combined samples and conducted further analysis only if the combined sample showed positive results. In Huhane 5 February 2020, BGI opened a 2000-year-old murder case.
The construction of the laboratory was organized by BGI Van Czjanam and completed in 5 days; the model showed that if the laboratory was not implemented at such a rapid rate, cases of disease in Hobea would be 47 per cent more and quarantine costs would also be twice as high.
The opening of the laboratory in Huhane immediately opened the Hoo-Jan labs in Shanghai, Tanzania, Beijing and Shanghai, in 12 Chinese cities.
Up to 4 March 2020, the total daily pass-off rate was 50,000 per day. Open multi-plex Origami Assays schemes were released, which could test up to 1,122 patients on COVID19 using only 93 samples. Such balanced constructions could work in small laboratories, except for the use of robotic fluid manipulators.
In March, due to the lack of and insufficient number of reagents, there was a problem with mass testing in the EU, the United Kingdom and the United States.
As a result, some authors have referred to test samples processing protocols, which provide for the burning of samples at 98°C (208°F) within 5 minutes to release RNC genes for further testing. On 31 March, it was announced that the number of tests on coral virus currently carried out by the United Arab Emirates on the human soul is now higher than those of any other country, and that the majority of the population will soon be protested.
This was due to the possibility of an express test, together with the acquisition by the Group 42 and BGI of a mass testing laboratory (based on their laboratory for emergency detection of Huo-Jan in China).
This laboratory, which has been deployed within 14 days, is able to conduct tens of thousands of RT-PCR tests every day and is the first in the world to be so large a laboratory operating outside China.
Various test options for various parts of the genetic profile of Coronavirus were developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The World Health Organization has adopted a German version of the production of low-income test kits that are deployed in countries with no resources to develop their own sets.
The German version was published on 17 January 2020; the protocol developed by the United States Sanitary and Epidemiological Centres was not available until 28 January, leading to the absence of testing packages in the United States. At the beginning of the outbreak in China and the United States, there were problems with confidence in testing packages, and those countries, as well as Australia, were unable to provide enough packages recommended by health experts.
In South Korea, the wide availability of testing has helped to reduce the spread of the new corona virus, as experts have suggested.
For several years, the Government of South Korea has been working on the possibility of testing mainly in private laboratories.
On 16 March, the World Health Organization called for the development of testing programmes as a better way to slow the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result of the increase in the demand for testing resulting from the rapid spread of the virus, many U.S. private laboratories with hundreds of thousands of samples of analysis have been overloaded and the storage of substances for the removal of fats and chemicals has been rapidly overloaded.
In March 2020, China reported problems with the accuracy of its test kits.
The U.S. test kits developed by CDC had “inadequate” and therefore the Government had removed bureaucratic barriers that involved private testing; Spain had acquired testing sets at the Chinese company Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd but found that the results of the use of these sets were not accurate.
The company explained that the lack of results could be a failure to take samples or misuse them.
The Spanish Ministry stated that it would withdraw the collection of incorrect results and replace the other collections of Shenzhen Bioeasy. 80 per cent of the test collections that Chechia had obtained in China had given the wrong results. 1.2 million of the tests collected by Slovakia in China were also recognized as incorrect.
Prime Minister Matovic proposed that they be deleted in Danube. Atesh Kara, a staff member of the Ministry of Health of Turkey, claimed that the high level of error in China and the United Kingdom “did not use them”. Britain bought 3.5 million samples in China, but at the beginning of April 2020 it was announced that these packages were not suitable for use.
The quarantine measures for persons with positive results for SARS-CoV-2 as well as for those with whom such patients were contacted had positive results.
Researchers working in the Italian city of Vo, where the first person died from COVID-19 in Italy, conducted two test cycles of about 3400 people at an interval of about ten days.
About half of the people with positive results had no symptoms, and all patients with confirmed cases of disease were quarantined.
The entry into the territory of the population has been closed and this measure has completely halted the spread of infection.
In the context of intensive monitoring of contacts, entry restrictions, testing and quarantine measures of the 2020 Coronavirus pandemic in Singapore, there was much less urgent than in other developed countries, and there was no need for extreme restrictions such as the forced closure of restaurants and shops.
Many activities were discontinued there, and on 28 March Singapore began to urge residents to stay at home, but schools that ended on 23 March were opened on schedule.
A number of other countries, such as Iceland and South Korea, also faced pandemics through intensive monitoring of contacts, entry restrictions, testing and quarantine measures, but their limitations were less aggressive.
The statistical study showed that in countries where more tests were conducted compared to the number of deaths, mortality rates were significantly lower, possibly because they were able to identify more patients with mild symptoms or lack of symptoms.
WHO recommends that countries with no resources for mass testing, as well as national laboratories with limited experience with COVID-19, deliver their first five positive and first 10 negative results of the COVID-19 analysis in one of 16 WHO-controlled laboratories for confirmatory testing.
7 of these 16 control laboratories are located in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
The following graph shows the indicator of positive results depending on the test policy adopted in a particular country.
The country where only hospitalized patients are tested will have a higher positive effect than the country in which all citizens are tested, regardless of the symptoms of the virus, under other conditions.
The hand is also known as the “hygiene hand” as the process of cleaning hands with a view to removing contamination, fat, micro-organisms or other harmful substances.
The regular wash of hands at certain “critical times” during the day prevents the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhoea and cholesterol, which are transmitted orally.
A person may also be affected by respiratory diseases such as flu or normal faeces, for example, if it is attached to his eyes, nose or neck (that is to his left eye) with unwashed hands.
Five critical moments during the day after which hands should be washed with flour: before and after failure, after the child's equidae or replacement of beginners, before the child's feeding, before the eggs, and before the preparation or processing of raw meat, fish and poultry.
If water and flour are not available, your hands can be washed with the help of the pool.
Yes, in time and after cooking.
Even after the procedure for treating a sick person.
After the change of undergarments or the suspicion of a child belonging to a toilet.
After the shock, the horse or the chichan.
After touching animals, cows or waste of animal origin.
The health care arm is related to medical procedures.
Hand washing before taking medicines or medical procedures will prevent or minimize the spread of disease.
The main medical purpose of the hand is to clean hands from pathogens (bacterials, viruses or other micro-organisms capable of causing disease), as well as from chemicals that may be harmful or cause certain diseases.
This procedure is particularly important for people who are preparing or working in the medical field, but it is also important for all others.
My hand is very useful for health: for example, it minimizes the spread of influenza, cornavirus and other infectious diseases, prevents infections of the diarrhoea, reduces respiratory infections,
It also reduces the level of infant mortality in households.
The 2013 study showed that a higher quality of arm support could lead to a small increase in child growth by five years of age.
In developing countries, infant mortality rates associated with respiratory and diarrhoea diseases can be reduced by adopting simple practices such as hand washing.
This elemental procedure is able to reduce mortality from these diseases by almost 50 per cent.
Regular reminders on the benefits of hand washing can reduce the number of cases of diarrhoea by about a third, and this will be compared to ensuring low-income regions with clean water.
The reduction in the number of cases of diarrhoea by 48 per cent can be related to soft hands with mildew. The soft hand is the only effective and inexpensive way to prevent diarrhoea and acute respiratory diseases (ADS) in the context of developing appropriate habits in each home, school and other public places around the world.
Pneumonia, one of the major complications of CRI, is the main cause of death among children under five years of age who live about 1.8 million children a year.
On average, about 3.5 million children die each year from diarrhoea and pneumonia.
The United Nations Children's Fund reports that handwashing before and after a toilet, which has become a strong habit, can save more lives than any individual vaccine or medical intervention, and reduce the mortality from diarrhoea almost twice and death from severe respiratory infections to four.
The arms are usually combined with other health activities carried out under the water, sanitation and hygiene programmes (WASH).
The right hand also prevents the occurrence of an impetuous disease that is transmitted directly to physical contact.
A small negative effect of the commonly used hand is that it can lead to skin drying and consequently damage to the skin.
The 2012 data study showed that too often hand washing can lead to loss of skin and loss of skin – a disease known as exceme or dermatitis, which is especially common among health workers.
Too often hand washing may also be considered one of the symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCR).
There are five so-called “critical moments” during the day when hand washing is important to reduce the risk of fecal or oral transmission of the disease: after washing (duration, failure), after the supposement of a child's equidistant (mixture), before feeding the child, before eating and/or before preparing or processing raw meat, fish or birds.
Some other cases where the hand should be held to prevent the transmission of disease: before or after treatment of the wound or wound, after shaking, riding or shaking, after touching the waste of animal or animal, after touching the must.
In many countries, hand milling is fairly widespread.
A study on handsets conducted in 54 countries in 2015 showed that 38.7 per cent of the average family handset with lead is a common practice. The 2014 study showed that the highest rate, 97 per cent, was fixed in Saudi Arabia; the United States is closer to the average, their 77 per cent; the lowest rate was set in China by 23 per cent. Currently there are several methods of changing behavioural and developing handholding skills in critical situations. In developing countries, the group target of schoolchildren has been used in such a manner as to help students.
“An urgent health assistance programme”, carried out by the Ministry of Education of the Philippines, is an example of extensive activities to strengthen child health and improve the education of children.
The national programme is based on degelminization, which takes place twice a year, as well as daily hand washing with soft and daily brushing.
The same programme is being carried out successfully in Indonesia.
The removal of micro-organisms from each cover is more effective if the lead or power resources are added to the paint process.
The main action of the mill and its assets is to remove barriers to its resolution and improvement.
Water itself is not considered an effective means of cleaning the skin, since fat and whites, which are part of organic contamination, are badly dissolved in water.
A sufficient quantity of water, however, contributes to the process of cleaning.
The solid powder, due to multiple use, may also contain bacteria that may fall on it during previous use.
A small number of studies on each layer of bacteria from contaminated solid honey are referring to the low probability of such a fall because bacteria mix with pen.
The CPC still claims that “a hand-driving mill is a preferred option for hand milling”.
Antibacterial honey is actively promoted in health-care communities.
Today there is no evidence that the use of recommended antiseptic or disinfectants has a selective effect on organisms that are resistant to antibiotics by nature.
However, antibacterial honey contains distributed antibacterial agents such as triclosan, which sustains a number of resistant strains of organisms.
Thus, even if strains resistant to antibiotics are not selective in relation to antibiotics, their effectiveness may not be in line with the announced.
In addition to surface-active substances and skin protection, complex compounds may contain acids (excessive, ascorbinic, milk) as an RN regulator, as well as antimicrobial active Benzoic acid and other wastes (aloia, vitamins, minerals, extracts of plants). A complex analysis carried out by the University of Oregon School of Public Health has shown that in order to prevent disease and remove bacteria from the skin, simple varieties have been as effective as the conventional antibacterial honey containing triclosane.
The warm water comfortable for human skin temperature is just as hot enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteries are rapidly increasing at 37°C.
However, to remove natural pollutants and bacteria, hot water is more efficient than cold.
Despite the widely held view, research has shown that the use of hot water does not affect the reduction of the microwave load by hand.
The disinfectant for hand (sanitary) or an antiseptic for hand is a non-water treatment for hygiene.
At the end of the 1990s and at the beginning of the 21st century, the availability of non-aircraft means for hygiene (also known as respiratory disinfectants, antiseptics for manual disinfection or sanitation).
Most of these funds are made from isopropyl alcohol or ethanol with added contaminants such as carbon (acrylic acid polymer) in the form of gel, or solvents, such as glycerin in liquid or pendant form, which facilitate the use of these funds and reduce the effects of breathing.
The addition of the diluted water flow increases antimicrobial activity, and disinfectants containing at least 60 to 95 per cent of spirit are effectively destroying microbes.
Diabetes agents kill bacteria, including multi-pharmaceutical bacteria (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis fever, as well as some viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rinvirus, vaccine, influenza and hepatitis).
The disinfectants containing 70 per cent spirit kill 99.97 per cent of the bacteria (a decrease of 3.5 to 35 decibels) in their hands in 30 seconds after use and 99.99 per cent of the bacteria (a decrease of 4 to 5) in their hands within 1 minute after use. The disinfectants are most effective against bacteria and less effective against certain viruses.
The disdefining agents are practically ineffective against the virus of the type norwalk, the most common cause of infection gastroenteritis. An adequate amount of antipsychotic or respiratory device should be used to treat and wash the skin thoroughly with both sides.
The lens and soil surface of both vessels, as well as between the fingers throughout the length, extend for about 30 seconds until the fluid, penis or gel is fully absorbed.
The end of the fingers on both hands should also be carefully washed, and the U.S. Center for Control and Prevention of Diseases recommends that the choice be made for the benefit of hand washing rather than for the use of disinfectants, especially if the hands are severely contaminated.
The increase in the popularity of such disinfectants is due to their easy use and rapid destruction of micro-organisms, but they must not serve as replacement for fully-assessed hand if there is access to water and lead.
Frequent use of disinfectants on a spirit basis may cause dry skin if their composition does not contain softeners and/or softeners.
The effect of raising the skin by breath can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin and/or other sweetening substances to the substance.
In clinical trials, hand disinfectants, which contain sweetening components, caused much less irritation and dryness of the skin than honey or antimicrobials.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact cramp syndrome or hypersensitivity to alcohol or additives present in disinfectants are practically not present.
A lower probability of developing an explosive contact dermatitis has been a factor in the choice of disinfectants compared with lead and water.
Despite its effectiveness, non-water resources do not wash hands from organic substances but simply definite them.
That is why the desalination of hand tools is not so effective in preventing the spread of many pathogenic micro-organisms, such as conventional salts and water, as pathogenic micro-organisms are still on hand.
The effectiveness of the disdefining instrument for non-aircraft is largely dependent on components and composition and has historically been significantly lower than that of spirit or spirit-containing instruments.
It has recently been shown that preparations using Benzalconic chloride have a stable and cumulative antimicrobial activity in contrast to the spirit that has been demonstrated to lose effectiveness after multiple use, probably due to progressive side effects.
Many people in low - income communities do not allow themselves to be bored and replace it with gold or clay.
Gold or coal may be more effective than simply water, but they will always be less effective than honey.
One problem with this approach is that if the glyn or soil is contaminated by micro-organisms, it may, on the other hand, increase the spread of the disease.
Like honey, salt is a disinfectant because it forms a cellular solution in contact with water.
If honey is not available, WHO recommends using salt or sand as an alternative.
In order to prevent the infection of the Disease Control Centre in the United States, it is recommended to use hand washing techniques, including the following steps:
Wash your hands under hot or cold water.
Water is recommended because standing water can be contaminated and the water temperature is as low as once.
Help your hands, with large amounts of honey, including the back of your legs, as well as between your fingers and your legs.
It removes skin germs, and studies show that people tend to wash their hands more closely when using salt (not just one water).
Three hands at least 20 seconds.
The third helps to remove skin germs, and the third time you move your hands, more germs are removed.
Hardly wash your hands under the water.
The swelling of the hand in the current water may cause a refrigerant.
Wash your hands with clean soap, or let them lift themselves up.
The soft and soft hands are easily contaminated, and most often people are left without attention from areas such as large fingers, arms, fingers and feet.
Artifacts and broken leg can contain many micro-organisms.
It is often recommended to use an adjustable solvent to prevent skin rash that can cause skin damage and increase the risk of infection.
If liquid water and honey are not available, there are many other ways to wash hands: washing water from a high canister or bottled tea with cuts and/or using soil if necessary, such as in developing countries. In areas with limited water supply (e.g. in schools or rural areas in developing countries) there are water-saving solutions, such as foot-and-mouth disease and other non-road alternatives.
A knife with a knife is a simple structure consisting of a frame attached to a rope and a knife that should be cut into the hands of water; this should be used as a hammer.
An effective dry hand is an integral part of the process of hygiene, but there are some disputes about the most effective form of drying in public toilets.
A growing number of studies show that breast cancer is much more hygienic than hand dryers, which are found in many toilets.
In 2008, the University of Westminster London conducted a study sponsored by the European Symposium on the Production of Buffalos and Poultry; this study compared the level of hygiene of bookkeepers, hot-air dryers and more modern-water dryers.
It was found that after dust and dry hands in the dry air, the total number of bacteria in the thumbs increased by 194 per cent and 254 per cent in ships.
It has also been found that after dust and dry hands in dry air, the total number of bacteria in the thumbs is increased by 42 per cent and by 15 per cent on ships.
After dust and drying, the total number of bacteria on the thumbs is reduced to 76 per cent and on the boats up to 77 per cent. Scientists have also tested the possibility of cross-sectional contamination of several toilet visitors and toilet environments in each type of drought.
The air dryer, which emits air at expressed speeds 180 m/s (650 km/h, 400 m/h), is capable of generating micro-organisms by hand and from its own block and potentially harming other users of the toilet room and satellite in a radius of up to 2 metres.
The use of an air-heat mill is distributed by micro-organisms within a radius of up to 0.25 metres from the mill.
In 2005, TÜV Product und Umwelt conducted a study on the assessment of different methods of dry hands.
The following changes in the number of bacteria depending on the dry hand method are observed:
There are many different hand dryers, and hand dryers are compared to dry bookworms.
Washing hands with disinfectants may be an alternative solution during trips when there are no flour and water.
At least 60 per cent of the windscreen is to be dedefinable for the windscreen.
The medical method of handwashing became mandatory long after the Hungarian doctor Ignaz Zemmelweis discovered his high efficacy (1846) in prevention of foot-and-mouth disease.
There are electronic devices that remind hospital staff of the need to wash their hands if they forget about it.
According to one study, the use of such devices actually helps to reduce pollution.
At least 15 seconds, the hand is applied to a large number of mills, water or gels for milling and front-handing each part of the hand.
Your hands should be firmly attached to each other by touching your fingers.
If there is a hole under the legs, it can be used to remove it.
Since microbes can stay in the water that is present in their hands, it is important to wash them well and wipe them out with clean soap.
After drying hands, closing the crane and, where necessary, closing and opening any door, should be used as a bookshop.
This enables us to avoid re-infection of our hands from these surfaces.
The objective of hand-seting in medical institutions is to remove pathogenic microorganisms (microbes) and prevent their spread.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that handwashing remains unacceptable in most medical institutions: a large number of doctors and nurses regularly forget to wash their hands before they contact patients, and so they distribute micro-organisms.
As a result of one study, proper hand washing and other essential procedures may reduce the level of catalytic infections by 66 per cent. The World Health Organization published a standard brush and hand treatment package to be used in the health sector.
The WHO manual on hygiene is also available on its website and is open to public discussion.
The relevant review was conducted by Whitby as a co-authority.
Where confirmation is required to comply with the regulatory requirements, commercial devices may be used to measure indicators and test hygiene.
The World Health Organization means “five minutes” when it needs to shake hands:
after contact with blood or biological fluids,
before use of antipsychotics, as well as
After the patient's treatment procedure, the addition of antiseptic chemicals to the bone by hand (medicine or antimicrobial) helps to destroy bacteria.
Such antibacterial properties may be required prior to surgery or in the environment with high levels of organisms resistant to antibiotics. To “cleanse” hands before surgery, a crone that may be included and excluded from its hands should be used; a small amount of chlorgexide or iodine water should also be used to wash hands, sterile to dry hands after meals, sterile training and other sterile tools for dental cleaning.
All damages must be removed.
This procedure usually takes 2-6 minutes to wash your hands and towels.
There's no need to stretch your hands too long, for example, 10 minutes.
At the time of application, spring water should not fall back on its hands.
After the wound is finished, the hands dry out of sterile tissue and hope for a surgical condition.
To reduce the spread of microbes, it is better to wash your hands or use an antiseptic before and after treatment for a sick person.
In order to combat staphylococcal infections in hospitals, it was found that the greatest benefit from handwashing was the first 20 per cent harvest and that very little additional benefits were obtained when the rate of soft hands was increased by more than 35 per cent.
Compared to the fine antibacterial mill, the hand mill of the ordinary mill results in more than threefold increase in the incidence of bacterial infections transmitted through food. The comparison of the spraying arm with the antibacterial milling mill in the average by 30 seconds per procedure showed that the treatment of the oral solution reduced the bacterial contamination by 26 per cent compared to the antibacterial mill.
However, honey and water are still more effective than hand ventricular solutions, in order to reduce influenza A H1N1 virus levels and dispute Clostridium difficile. Health-related health care activities can include training of disabled personnel, improving access to hand-containing respiratory solutions, as well as written and oral reminders of the need to wash hands.
Additional studies are needed on the most effective types of measures in various medical institutions.
In developing countries, hand milling has been recognized as an economical and important means of improving health and even nutrition.
However, the lack of stable water, mills or tools to wash hands at home, in schools and at work makes it difficult for the habit to wash hands regularly.
For example, in most rural areas of Africa, there are not far from each private or public toilets, although there are many ways to organize empty hands in such areas.
However, insufficient hygiene may also be caused by contaminated habits, not by lack of salt or water.
The promotion and promotion of handsets can adversely affect political decisions, raise awareness of the benefits of handsets and bring about long-term changes in the behaviour of the population.
In order to ensure the effectiveness of such measures, monitoring and evaluation of results must be carried out.
During the systematic analysis of 70 studies, it was found that, in order to improve the health situation in countries with low-income income, effective health care, while public marketing campaigns are less effective. One example of the promotion of school-based crafts is the approach of the United Nations Children's Fund Three Star Approach: it promotes implementation in schools of simple economic measures that stimulate the use of lead by students, as well as the implementation of other health requirements.
By ensuring compliance with minimum standards, schools can increase their levels from one to three stars.
The establishment of manuals is one of the possible measures undertaken in the field of health information campaigns aimed at reducing the level of disease and child mortality.
The Global Hand Washington Day is another example of an information campaign aimed at changing behavior, and as a result of the 2019-20 crown virus pandemic, the United Nations Children's Fund promotes the use of hand-smoothing models.
In some studies, the overall effectiveness of hand milling in developing countries was considered compared with the DALYs (sustainable years of life without disability).
One study, however, suggests that the promotion of soft hands is a much more economic solution than other health measures.
The importance of hand washing for human health — especially for vulnerable categories such as young mothers or wounded soldiers in hospitals — was first recognized by two medical professionals in the mid-19th century: Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis (Ignaz Semmelweis), who worked in Vienna (Austria), and Florence Nightingale (Florence Nightingale), the English nurse and “the founder of modern care for the sick”.
At the time, most people were still convinced that the infection was caused by the ghastly smells known as amphetamines.
In the 1980s, disease outbreaks spread through food tract and infections related to medical assistance, disease control and prevention centres in the United States have become more active in promoting health care as an important measure to prevent the spread of infection.
As a result of the outbreak of swine flu in 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, people in many countries were better able to understand how important it is to wash hands with mildness to protect the body from such infectious diseases.
For example, in Germany a number of manuals were published in public toilets as well as in office buildings and airports.
The phrase “to think hands” means to express a refusal to take responsibility for anything or to be a participant of something.
It comes from the Bible, the Gospel of Matthew: Pontius Pilate ‘ laid his hands upon ’ in making a decision about Jesus Christ’s impalement; later that phrase became more widely used in some English communities.
In the Song of Shexpere, Lady Macbet is not allowed to wash her hands in an attempt to clean up the thoughtful fifth, a symbol of an unclean conscience, because of the crimes she has committed herself and urged her husband to do.
It has also been observed that people who remember or observe any non-ethical action tend to stretch their hands more often than others, and that their leadership is more important to them.
It is also less likely that people who have the opportunity to wash their hands after seeing will participate in any other “cleaning” compensating activities, such as volunteer activities.
In false religion, the hand has both a hygienic purpose and a symbolic meaning. The symbolic hand washes with water, but without honey, is part of the ritual prescribed in many religions, including Bahiaism, Induism, tevilah and netillat yadayim in Judaism, Lavabo in Christianity and Wudhu in Islam.
Indians, Jews and Muslims are required to wash their hands after a tour of the toilet.
In India, Buddhism, Sikhism and Islam, it is considered necessary to wash your hands before and after every meal.
Control of production factors in relation to COVID-19
The control of productive factors related to COVID-19 involves the use of methods of safety at work and health in order to control risks and combat coronary virus 2019 (COVID-19).
The appropriate risk control at the workplace depends on the location and task, based on the risk assessment, the seriousness of the situation with the epidemic in the community and the risk factors for individual workers that may be vulnerable to COVID-19.
The U.S. Department of Labour and Industrial Hygiene (OSHA) reported that low-risk posts had minimum professional contacts with the public and colleagues and, in such cases, basic measures were required to combat infection, including handwashing, incentives for workers to stay at home with signs of disease, follow-up of respiratory label and day-to-day care and work environment disinfection.
The average risk functions require partial or close contact with persons who do not have COVID-19 confirmed or suspected diagnosis, but there is a risk of infection due to the current spread of disease in society or international travel.
Such categories may include public workers, such as schools, high-level work environments and some large-scale retail shops.
Risk control measures for such a group, in addition to basic measures to prevent infection, include the use of high-efficiency air filters, the use of protective screens and the availability of personal protection in case of contact with a person infected with COVID-19.
OSHA considers that medical and marine staff who have contacted a person with a confirmed diagnosis or suspicion of COVID-19 infection are at high risk; however, the risk is increased to a very high level in carrying out such procedures accompanying aerosol education or collecting/processing samples from a person with a confirmed diagnosis or suspicion of COVID-19.
Risk control measures for such staff include the use of engineering and technical security equipment such as ventilation rooms with negative pressure as well as personnel protection equipment suitable for the relevant task.
The COVID-19 impact on the workplace may be different.
Workers may be absent at work because of their own illness, the need to care for other persons or because they are afraid of possible injury.
Commercial patterns may change as regards the types of goods for which such goods are requested and how to obtain such goods (e.g. purchases during non-delivery or maintenance periods without leaving the machine).
Finally, it is possible to prevent the delivery of goods from geographical areas affected by COVID-19. A plan for preparedness for the epidemic and response can be used when the protection is organized.
The plans deal with risks related to different workplaces and tasks, including pollution sources, risk factors arising from homes and communities, as well as risk factors for individual workers, such as older age or chronic illness.
The plans also provide the means of control necessary to address the risks and plans of external action for situations that may result from the epidemic.
Plans for preparedness for the epidemic and response may be subject to recommendations at the national or state level.
Some of the objectives of responding to the epidemic are: reducing the spread of HIV among staff, protecting people at a higher risk of serious health problems, maintaining business operations and minimizing the negative effects of other organizations on their supply chains.
Responsibilities are affected by the severity of the disease in the community where the business is located.
The hierarchy of risk control instruments is a structure that is widely used to ensure safety and health at work to group such funds according to efficiency.
Where the risk of COVID-19 disease cannot be eliminated, the most effective engineering and technical means of security are the administrative measures and, finally, the means of personal protection.
The engineering and technical security means imply the isolation of workers from workplace risks and are not dependent on the behaviour of the worker, which may be the most economical solution.
Administrative measures require changes in working policies or procedures requiring action by the employee or staff member.
Staff protection funds (PPE) are considered less effective than engineering or administrative measures but may help to address some risks.
All types of personal protection should be selected depending on the risks to the worker, to be sized (e.g. respiratory personnel), to be used regularly and properly, to check regularly, to be duly maintained and to be replaced as necessary, as well as to be properly stored, cleaned and stored or toiletd in order to avoid contamination.
The Office of the United States Department of Labour and Industrial Health (OSHA) believes that posts with the lowest risk have minimal contact with the public and its colleagues.
The basic measures to combat the epidemic recommended for all workplaces include frequent and thorough hand washing, recommendations for sick workers to stay at home, compliance with respiratory label, including the closure of the arm while cutting and sealing, the provision of sulphate and containers for the wearer, readiness for remote or variable work, where necessary, recommendations for workers to avoid the use of other tools and equipment, as well as the day-to-day training and disinfection of the working environment.
The rapid identification and isolation of persons who may be potentially infected is a critical step towards protecting workers, clients, visitors and others at work.
The United States Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that staff with severe respiratory diseases stay at home until the end of the summer, lack of increased body temperature and many other symptoms for at least 24 hours without the use of irradiating agents or other medicines that remove symptoms, and also prescribes that hospital lists policies be flexible, allow staff to remain at home to care for the sick member of the family and to provide awareness of such policies.
According to OSHA, high-risk posts require regular and close contact at least six feet (1.8 m) with people with no confirmed data or suspects of COVID-19 infection, but there is a risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the community in the area of business or in recent visits to COVID-19.
Such categories include staff with public contact, e.g. in schools, working environment with high-performance population and some major different stores. Administrative measures for such groups and high-risk groups include the establishment of high-efficiency air filters, the increase in ventilation, the establishment of physical barriers such as plastic screens, and the installation of air-conditioned areas without exit.
In rare cases, workers from such a risk group may need respiratory care.
If a person is sick on a plane, such measures as isolation of a sick person from other persons at 6 feet, appointment of a crew member to care for a sick person, delivery of a sick mask or treatment to such person with a request to cover the nose and mouth of a wheelchair.
Secondary-level crew members shall carry one-time medical devices when approaching a sick passenger or when compared to physiological fluids or potentially contaminated surfaces and possibly additional personal protective equipment if they have a sick fever, regular cough or difficulty breathing.
The doors and other items used should be placed in a biologically safe place and the damaged surfaces should be cleaned and disinfected. In the case of commercial ships, including cruise lines and other passenger ships, safety measures include the removal of travel in case of disease, isolation and immediate information of the medical centre on board when there is fire or other symptoms on board.
Ideally, medical examination should take place in an isolated case of such a person, and in the case of schools and childcare institutions, CDC recommends short-term closures for seizures or disinfection if the infected person is in school building, regardless of the prevalence of the disease in the community.
In the presence of a minimum or average level of spread of infection in the community, social distance strategies can be introduced, such as cancelling out visits to personal meetings, assemblies and other mass activities such as physical or mental drinking, eating in the cafeterias, increasing distance between parties, regulating time of arrival and care, limiting unnecessary visits, using a separate location of health facilities for children with flu symptoms.
In addition to social distance strategies, measures may be considered at a significant level in the local community. For law enforcement officers carrying out daily duties, the direct health risk is considered to be low, as the CDC believes.
Law enforcement officers who are obliged to contact persons with confirmed diagnosis or suspicion of COVID-19 infection are advised to follow the same instructions as those required by quick assistance campaigns, including the use of appropriate personnel protection.
In the event of close contact during detention, workers should clean up and disinfect their formal limbs and cupboards before re-use using domestic cleaning aerosols or through treatment, comply with standard operating procedures to prevent the spread of disease and the use of personal protective equipment, as well as to use and strip of clothing.
OCHA believes that some categories of health and maritime workers are at high or very high risk.
High-risk posts include medical assistance, support, laboratory personnel and medical transport personnel who have been contacted by patients with confirmed diagnosis or suspected COVID-19 infection.
They have a very high risk of infection when conducting aerosol education procedures or when collecting/producing samples from persons with confirmed diagnosis or suspected COVID-19 infection.
The procedures accompanying aerosol education include probes, cassettes, bronchoscopy, some dental procedures and surveys or samples of invasive methods.
High-risk seafarers are involved in the processing of human bodies with confirmed disease or suspicion of COVID-19 at the time of their death; if such personnel are involved in the detection, they are at a very high risk. Additional engineering and technical safety measures for such groups include the use of isolated facilities for patients with confirmed disease or suspicion of COVID-19, including in the course of aerosol education procedures.
In some health and marine institutions, the use of special ventilation with negative pressure may be effective.
The tests should be followed by compliance with the precautionary measures for the biological safety level 3.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that patients be distributed in restricted waiting zones depending on the presence of suspects of COVID-19 infection. In addition to other means of personal protection, OSHA recommends the use of respirators for workers who work up to 6 feet in combination with patients with confirmed disease or suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection, as well as those who conduct procedures with aerosol education.
In the United States, approved NIOSH reflectors for N95 or higher-class persons should be used within the framework of a comprehensive written programme for respiratory protection, which sets out requirements for individual collection of funds and medical examinations.
Other respiratory types can provide more effective protection and comfort for a staff member. WHO does not recommend the use of special care because COVID-19 is a disease transmitted by respiratory rather than by physiological fluids.
WHO recommends the use of only surgical masks for staff performing screening at the point of patient reception.
Persons receiving respiratory samples in patients with COVID-19 or carriers with this disease without aerosol education procedures are advised by WHO to wear a surgical mask, protective glasses or screen for persons, halves and glasses.
In the course of procedures accompanying aerosol education, a N95 or FFP2 shall be carried instead of a surgical mask.
In view of the insufficient availability of individual protection worldwide, WHO recommends minimizing the need for such protection through the use of remote medical facilities, physical barriers, such transparent areas, to ensure access to a patient infected with COVID-19, only those with direct care, to use only the personal protection resources needed for specific tasks, to continue the use of the same respiratory device, without recording, working with several patients with identical diagnostics, monitoring and coordination of the delivery of personal protection funds for persons with disabilities.

Subject: [Covid-19] Relief of cargo and preparation for the future
Date/time RECORD: 14 March 2020, 00:24 UTC
DECISION: CC0: Protection rights are missing
This month we live in extraordinary circumstances.
The COVID-19 epidemic is a phenomenon that shines light on the relationship between peoples of the world and our responsibility to each other.
We have not had such problems before, but we know that the effectiveness of our actions depends on the ability to feel compassion, cooperation and development of communities around the world, which is based on such an organization.
We observed friendly and caring relations between all our colleagues, as reflected in the e - mails, calls, and chats — a remarkable confirmation of the fact that, unfortunately, people are working with us.
I am so grateful and proud of you as my colleagues.
Last week I was informed of the high value of our work.
I was reminded of how important it is for the world to have access to Wikipedia right now and how useful it is for everyone to have access to this key resource online.
This may be due to your work, whether it is to ensure that websites are available, paid by our colleagues or to protect the security of the community.
Peace needs information provided in Wikipedia, and it is more important today than ever before.
At such a time as to achieve significant results for peace, it is important not only what we do but also how we do it.
With regard to the importance of such a mission and your role in this process, we will make important changes in our joint work starting next week.
Adjusting our work schedule and schedules
As Robin said earlier, the team "c-team" met yesterday evening to discuss our approach and schedule for the coming days and months.
In the course of the meeting, we considered our ideas on the most effective measures in the current situation and the best ways to ensure the sustainability of the organization during that period.
The overwhelming majority of us wanted to remove the pressure and support our long-term mission.
If you want to quit, let's do it.
For all staff, contractors and staff:
It is expected that about 4 hours per day or 20 hours per week will be required before the following arrangements are reached.
We do not announce the dates of departure: if you can work regularly for more hours, this is allowed for the purposes of our mission.
But now we do not predict the world; no matter what your needs are, whether it is to care for relatives, to buy food or to go to a doctor, your welfare is one of our priorities.
We're not following your working time.
If you're sick, you shouldn't work.
That's understandable and irrefutable, but we're talking about it.
There is no need to draw up a hospital letter or leave: just inform your manager and help the team review the calendar and work schedule to ensure that key areas are covered.
(If you have a confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis, report to Brian from T&C Ops, so that T&C can provide support and appropriate attention from the guidance to your situation).
The payment of interest rates will be carried out in full.
We have already announced and reaffirmed our intention to comply with the obligations before our contractors and staff with an hourly payment rate.
Each person shall be paid in accordance with the usual hourly rates applied under normal circumstances.
This means, in particular, periods of illness when you cannot work.
If you want to work, we'll support you.
Many people use their work as a means of bringing their efforts into the world around us.
What we do can bring wonderful results, especially at such times.
And it's about self-help again.
We ask you to contact our guide so that we can know what to expect and be able to adjust our actions accordingly.
Some types of work are considered essential.
We must always support such activities.
The SRE, HR Ops, Trust&Safety and Fundaising (except for others) teams perform critical work that may require additional support.
We are initiating a process for all entities to assess the current objectives and focus on providing support, which is very important for our mission.
There are many challenges for each of us, and we are just focusing on the most important projects.
Today's delay does not mean a negative impact in the future.
We are not planning to work "two more to raise the missing" after the end of the pandemic.
You will not need to work overtime to meet the unrealistic deadlines for the current period.
We recognize that circumstances have changed, and we will work on setting new goals and deadlines as soon as possible.
What happens to APP (annual plans)?
In order to build on the new reality and expectations of daily working time, we intend to adjust the implementation of our Annual Plan for the years 2020-2021.
We intend to propose an extension of the timeframe for our 2019-2020 plan so as to allow more time for budgeting, which will allow staff to give priority to critical work, self-help and care for those who need or want to work, a reduced schedule will be provided for the next few weeks.
Such an extension of time allows a significant reduction in the current burden of planning and stress throughout the organization.
The following week, we will submit our proposal to the Council, to the representatives and the team, the latest information on the following steps immediately after receipt of the relevant confirmation.
Thank the APP team for its leadership role in this work.
Status of office, risk and charge
Last week we learned that one of our colleagues in San Francisco could be infected with COVID-19.
However, in addition to many precautionary measures, we have hired an anti-fraud camp command to disinfect all surfaces in the San Francisco office.
They have used anti-viral medical class solutions to disinfect all surfaces, as well as acceptable and liftable boilers that allow access to our stage.
The buildings shall apply their own rules to comply with the precautionary approach to the use of products to ensure the safety of their contractors.
We feel that the office will be well prepared until we decide to return.
Our area office in Colombia (DC) is on the WebWork network, which has shared with us and all staff in DC its rules related to COVID-19.
Last week, our district office in Colombia had completely moved to remote work in accordance with the instructions received in San Francisco.
As some of our colleagues from New York know, we have also discussed the rent of premises in Brooklyn.
Such discussions continue, but they can be postponed.
Some of our colleagues are working far away.
Our former colleagues who are working far away are aware of the possibility of adjusting the situation and would like to give you some advice:
It is recommended that the duration of the meetings be limited to one or two hours.
If necessary, consider the possibility of a course of several days in longer sessions.
Set carefully the objectives of the meeting, the agenda and previously the various materials to be identified.
Please use video-links to facilitate interaction and use tools such as Google Docs and Zoom.
To facilitate the appointment of a coordinator, a person who will monitor the availability of issues in reading and control the list of speakers as well as the person responsible for taking notes (or joint vision).
If necessary, please contact the technical support service by e-mail.
Take advantage of your advantages on the Wellness Reimbursement program when you buy lunch.
Connect to #remoties channel in Slack to talk to colleagues about shared work.
The HR Operations team is studying the guidance on irgonism available in web-based format to facilitate the effectiveness of distributed work across the organization.
Last week, we asked all Community border recipients to cancel the mass activities funded by Wikimedia, such as Editathons, until WHO announced the end of the pandemic.
We understand and report that our requests for such cancellations and other restrictions may result in the inability to carry out agreed border operations, and no one will be punished for any delay or change in such objectives.
In the coming week, we will conduct the following activities with additional instructions on Wikimania, as well as other Community regional and thematic conferences.
General attitudes in the global community are not only a setback in terms of interruption of work but also a sense of ease in terms of understanding and the possibility of focusing on their own communities, Wikimedia and not just on their own.
With regard to the perspective, CRT works on the Meta-Wiki pages, which will provide a space for the community to monitor the impact and community.
We remain on issues related to COVID-19
We will send you an invitation to a special staff meeting on Thursday, 14:00 UTC/07:00 PT.
This time, we are taking advantage of the opportunity to share more information on the subject, to answer your questions and to spend time together, interfering with each other.
We are together in this situation and are ready to help as much as we can.
In this case, you can still obtain information from such an e-mail and other important information on COVID-19 from Office Wiki.
The CRT will update such pages, and all information will be collected in one place.
We are also working on maintaining regular communication with staff living in countries that have had a significant impact on the current situation.
If there are travel issues, activities, key workflows, information-related issues or, where necessary, other assistance, contact CRT.
We are ready to support and communicate as much as necessary.
In case of confidentiality problems, please contact Brian Juden, Director of HR International Global Operations by e-mail.
No such changes should be considered as a rejection of our work and our obligations.
On the other hand, this is a recognition of the possible current need to make a careful new adaptation of our work and obligations.
We believe that such steps are necessary to support one another and to ensure that we can continue our work, to provide the necessary support to our movement and to the whole world with the assistance of the necessary service.
Our planning work will wait until the appropriate time.
Today it is time to support each other and to create space for important work that will take place in the coming weeks and perhaps months.
For this to happen, we will need help from each of you; and we need you to be able to care for yourself and your families, as well as to work with maximum performance as soon as such need arises.
Now, please help your hands and don't touch your face!
Katherine, CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M, Tony S), and other members of the Steering Team (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janeen U, Lisa S, Robyn A, Ryan M, and Toby N).
Angiotensin-reversing plant 2 (ACE2) is a plant attached to the outer surface (cell membranes) of cells in light, arteries, heart, joints and fluid.
ACE2 is opposed to the activity of the corresponding angiotensin-turning plant (ACE), reducing angiotensin-II content and increasing Ang (1-7), making it a promising solution to treat cardiovascular disease. AC2 also serves as a point of entry into cells for some coronary viruses.
The human version of the farm is often referred to as hACE2.
Angiotensin-reversing plant 2 is a zinc-containing metal farm located on the surface of endomellial and other cells.
White ACE2 contains N-conceived peptidase domain M2 and C-conective transport domain of the renal amino acid collection.
ACE2 is a single transverse membrane of type I and its active domain falls on the surface of light cells and other tissues.
The ACE2 field is separated from the transmembrane domain by another farm known as the shedadas, and the soluble protein obtained is released into the bloodstream and eventually released by force.
ACE2 is present in most organs: ACE2 is attached to the cell membranes of most light type II alvelor cells, enteroctolic thinner cells, arterial and venous endothellial cells and cold muscle cells of most organs.
Biosynthesis ACE2 iRNC is also found in the brain core, striatum, hypothalamus and brain stem.
The primary function of ACE2 is to act as an ACE opponent.
ACE emits angiotensin I hormone in contaminant angiotensin II.
ACE2, in turn, removes carbon monoxide phenylalaline from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolyses it into angiotensin vasodilate (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ACE2 may also dissipate a number of other peptides, including [des-Arg9]-bradidine, apeline, neurotensin, dinorphine A and grelene.
ACE2 also regulates the membrane transport of SLC6A19 neutral amino acid carrier and is present in Hartnup disease.
As a transmembrane protein, ACE2 is the primary entry point for some coronavirus including HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (SARS virus); and SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19).
Strongly speaking, the binding of white S1 SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 strains with the plantmatic domain ACE2 on the surface of the cell leads to endocytosis and transmission of both the virus and the enzymes contained in the internal cells.
This process of entry also requires the prevention of white S serial TMPRSS2 protease, which is currently being studied as a potential therapeutic tool, which has led some to believe that reducing the level of ACE2 in cells can help fight infection.
Nevertheless, many professional communities and regulatory bodies are recommending that the standard treatment of AFP and BRA inhibitors continue.
According to a systematic review and analysis published on 11 July 2012, “the use of AFP inhibitors was associated with a significant reduction in the risk of pneumonia by 34 per cent compared to the control group”.
Moreover, “the risk of pneumonia has also been reduced in patients at higher risk of AFP inhibitors, especially those with insulin and heart failure.
The use of AFP inhibitors was also associated with a reduction in pneumonia mortality, although the results were less reliable than in patients with general risk of pneumonia”.
Recombinant human ACE2 (rhACE2) is expected to be a novelty in treatment with mild to severe injury and is likely to improve renal hemodynamics and oxygen consumption by developing a severe respiratory failure syndrome caused by lipopolischarides.
The rhACE2 half-life for humans is approximately 10 hours, and the start of action is 30 minutes apart from 24 hours.
Some data show that rhACE2 may be a promising means for people with the inference of classic reginin-angiotensin inhibitors (RAS inhibitors) or in patients with increased circulating angiotensin II. The rhACE2 was evaluated in clinical trials in the treatment of severe respiratory depression syndrome.
The COVID-19 annexes are software applications for mobile phones intended to assist in epidemiological investigation under the 2019-20 Coronavirus pandemic, which can be identified by individuals (“contacts”) who have been able to contact an infected person.
In some regions, numerous applications have been developed or proposed by the authorities.
Several options for monitoring contacts have been developed.
This led to a discussion on confidentiality issues, particularly with regard to systems based on the geographical location of the users of the applications.
The softer options in this regard include the use of Bluetooth signals to register user proximity to other mobile phones.
On 10 April 2020, Google and Apple announced that they would combine their efforts to integrate their support for such applications directly into their Android and iOS operating systems.
In China, the Government of China, together with Augha, has circulated an annex that allows citizens to check whether they have been contacted by people infected with COVID-19.
It is used more than 200 Chinese cities and is used in Singapore under the name TraceTogether.
The annex was developed by local IT companies, has an open source code and will be handed over to the Government. North Macedonia launched the "StopKorona" application, which works on Bluetooth, which helps to monitor contacts with potential infected people and ensures operational contact with health authorities.
The annex was jointly developed by the Ministry of Communications and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
As at 14 April 2020, the annex was expected to be registered in Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
On 12 April, the Government stated that the contact tracking application was at the final stage of development and would be available for deployment within a few weeks. Similar applications were planned to be launched in Ireland and France (StopCovid).
Australia and New Zealand are considering the possibility of using applications based on the TraceTogether and the BlueTrace protocol. Russia intends to use an application with a geozone function aimed at ensuring that patients with COVID-19 diagnosis living in Moscow do not leave their homes.
Ross Anderson, professor of security, Cambridge University, identified a number of potential practical problems that could arise from applications, including false work and potential inefficiency in the use of only a small part of the population.
In view of the concern about the proliferation of misleading or vulnerabilized “colon virus” applications, Apple limited the list of types of organizations that could propose their own applications related to coronavirus in the App Store, including only “official” or other trusted organizations.
Google and Amazon have also introduced similar restrictions.
The participants in the Privacy Protection campaign expressed concern about the impact of mass monitoring on the population by means of applications related to coronavirus; in particular, the question was whether the monitoring infrastructure created to combat the pandemic would be dismantled when the threat disappeared.
The International Amnesty Organization and more than 100 other organizations have published a statement calling for such supervision to be restricted.
The Organization announced eight conditions for public projects:
The monitoring shall be “lawful, necessary and proportionate”;
Increased monitoring and monitoring should be accompanied by reservations on the limitation of the duration of action;
The use of data should be limited to the purpose of combating the spread of COVID-19;
The safety and anonymity of data must be protected and evidence of such protection must be provided;
Digital monitoring should exclude cases of incitement to discrimination and marginalization;
any exchange of data with third parties must be determined at the legislative level;
protection against abuse and the right of citizens to respond to abuse;
The German Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (reporter ohne Borderen) (RSF) have also published their lists.
Google and Apple have proposed their joint plan to address the issue of permanent monitoring, which is being taken to remove the tracking mechanism from their operating systems as soon as necessary.
In some countries, instead of applications, online monitoring of the location is used, which excludes the need to load the application and avoid tracking.
A network monitoring was approved in Israel.
Network decisions that have access to source data also have major potential confidentiality issues.
However, not all systems with central servers should have access to personal data on the location; a number of systems with confidentiality were developed, which are used only for communications (see section below).
In South Korea, a non-application system was used as a basis for tracking contacts.
Instead of using the special application, the system collected trace information from different sources, including data from mobile devices and card transactions, and then combined them to create notifications in the form of text messages which were sent to potential infected persons.
The Government not only used this information to warn citizens about potential contact with infected persons but also provided information on the location of public access, which has been possible as a result of significant changes in the law on the protection of information that has been submitted since the outbreak of MERS in that country.
Access to such information can be obtained through a number of applications and websites. Countries, including Germany, consider access to both centralised and confidential systems.
As of 6 April 2020, details have not yet been published.
Follow-up to contacts with confidentiality is an ongoing concept that is a major research literature dating at least in 2013. As of 7 April 2020, more than ten expert groups worked on confidential solutions such as Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to register user access to other mobile phones.
However, PEPP-PT is a product of coordination efforts that include both centralised and decentralised approaches and is not a single protocol; decentralised protocols include decentralised transit with confidentiality (DP-PPT/DP-3T), temporary contact numbers (TCN, fka Contact EventNumbers, CEN), protocols to ensure confidentiality, mobile communications tracking mechanisms (PACT) and others.
These protocols are responsible for the fact that identified personal data have never left the device and all comparisons have occurred.
The Privacy Group, MIT Media Lab is engaged in the development of SafePaths, a platform that ensures confidentiality when collecting and using location data or crossing routes to track the spread of COVID-19.
The work of this platform is based on the research carried out in the “Apps Gone Rogue: Maintaining Personal Privacy in An Epidemic”, published in March 2020. Another similar project is the SafeTrace platform developed by Enigma MPC, a company developing confidentiality technology, which was also originally founded by MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrace uses reliable equipment technologies that allow users to exchange confidential location and health data with other users and officials without risking their confidentiality.
On 5 April 2020, groups sharing the same approach and using similar protocols were established by the global coalition of TCNs aimed at reducing fragmentation and ensuring global compatibility of applications for monitoring and reporting, which was a key factor in their widespread dissemination.
On 9 April 2020, the Government of Singapore announced that it had opened the BlueTrace source code used for its official application.
On 10 April 2020, Google and Apple, companies that control the work of Android and iOS mobile platforms, announced the contacts follow-up initiative, which they claimed would ensure confidentiality, based on the combination of Bluetooth Low Energy technology and cryptography to maintain confidentiality.
They also published the technical characteristics of key technologies used in the work of the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system should be deployed in three stages:
Deployment of tools to enable Governments to establish official applications for monitoring the movement of infected civilians by crown virus but maintaining data confidentiality
By integrating this function directly into iOS and Android, Google and Apple are planning to deal with the problems with constant monitoring, starting with the introduction of an operating system update and then removing it in the same way after the threat has disappeared.
Repositioning a medicinal product (also known as re-profile, re-administration, change of tasks or therapeutic re-administration of medicinal products) is a re-profile of an approved medicinal product to treat disease or a medical condition other than that specified in the preparation.
This is one of the research approaches currently being used to develop safe and effective COVID-19 treatment methods.
Other research areas include the development of COVID-19 vaccines and reconcentration plasma. SARS-CoV-2 contains about 66 proteins that affect medicinal products, each containing several binders.
The analysis of these associated sites provides an appropriate basis for the development of effective anti-virus preparation against COVID-19.
The most important protein for SARS-CoV-2 is Papian-like protease, NNC-dependent polymerase, helicase, S protein and ADF-ribophosphatase.
Hussein AA and the authors in their clinical study studied several associations of candidates who were then optimised and analysed their structure with the most similar approved preparations to speed up the development of high-efficiency preparation against SARS-CoV-2, which will be recommended for clinical studies.
Chloroquin is a antimalarial preparation that is also used to treat some autoimmune diseases.
On 18 March, WHO announced that chloroquine and its associated hydrochloroquine would be included in the four preparations studied in the Solidarity clinical trial.
Governor of New York Andrew Kuomo announced that tests of chloroquine and hydroxyrokine would begin in New York on 24 March. On 28 March, FDA authorized the use of hydroxyroquin sulphate and chlorocine phosphate according to the exclusive authorisation (USA).
The treatment scheme has not been approved during the FDA clinical trial process and has been approved in accordance with the USA only as an experimental treatment for immediate assistance in patients who have been hospitalized but cannot be treated under clinical trials.
CDC stated that “the order of use, dose or duration of hydroxychloroquine for prevention or treatment of SARS-CoV-2” had not yet been established.
Doctors say they use the product when there's no other way out.
The Turkish research group in Istanbul conducts a small study on the use of chlorogen in combination with zinc and vitamins A, C and D.
Major studies are conducted at Duke University and Oxford University.
The New York University Medical School studies the safety and effectiveness of the prevention of hydroxichloroquine.
The Chinese clinical trials in Huhan and Shenzhen showed that the favipivira was “very effective”.
There were 35 patients in Shenzhen who had taken this preparation, with negative results on average over 4 days, while 45 patients who had not taken the product had 11 days to live.
A study was conducted in Huhane during which 240 patients were monitored with pneumonia, one half of which were received by favivir and one half by imifenevir.
The Italian pharmaceutical community has reminded the public that the results of the preparation are poor and should not be considered final.
On 2 April, Germany announced that it would buy supplies in Japan and that it would be used by military resources to treat COVID-19 patients.
According to the newspaper South China Morning Post, Sindzo Abee informed the Authority of the possibility of buying the product. The preparation may be less effective in cases of infectious diseases.
Its use may be unsafe for pregnant patients or for those who are trying to take it.
According to one study on the combination of antiviral preparations, lopinavir and ritonavir (Calthera), it was concluded that “the efficacy of use of preparations has not been established”.
Preparations have been developed for preventing HIV replication by linking protease.
The group of researchers from the University of Colorado is trying to modify medical preparations to find a link that will be linked to SARS-CoV-2 proteases in the scientific community critical of the re-profile of medicinal products specially developed for HIV and AIDS therapy.
WHO included the combination of lopinavir and ritonavir in the International Solidarity Test.
Remdescivir was established and developed Gilead Sciences for the treatment of Ebola virus and Marburg virus infections. Later, Gilead Sciences staff found that remedeivir has antiviral activity in vitro with respect to many philo-, pneumo-, paramix- and coronaviruses.
One of the problems associated with antiviral treatment is the development of resistance through mutations that can lead to more serious diseases and transmissions.
Some early preliminary studies have shown that rhemedesivir may have a high genetic barrier to resistance. There are currently several clinical trials, including two at Cleveland University clinics; one in patients with moderate disease and the other in patients with a more severe form.
Three clinical trials are currently being conducted on the subject of internal administration of vitamin C for people who are severely treated with COVID-19: two placebo-controlled studies (China, Canada) and one without placebo (Italy).
On 24 March 2020 in New York State, an azithromycin antibiotics test began.
The Japanese National Centre for Global Health and Medicine (NCGM) plans to conduct a clinical study of Alvesco (cyclicalsonida) Tejin, an inhalation corticosteroid for asthma treatment, in order to treat pre-symptomatic patients infected with new coronavirus.
Phase II test, the form of angiotensin-turning farm 2, involves 200 patients from Denmark, Germany and Austria who have been treated with severe forms of disease with a view to determining the effectiveness of treatment.
Researchers from the Montreal Institute of Cardiovascular Diseases, Canada, are currently studying the role of colchicin in reducing inflammation and sleep problems in patients with poor COVID-19 symptoms.
For the study under the name COLCORONA, 6,000 adults aged 40 and older were invited to have COVID-19 diagnosed with mild symptoms that did not require hospitalization.
Women who are pregnant with breast-feeding and who do not use effective contraceptives cannot participate in this study.
In Italy there are several coagulants tested.
The low molecular heparin is widely used to treat patients, which has prompted the Italian Medical Office to publish recommendations on the use of this medicinal product.
On 14 April, a multicentre study with 300 patients involved in the study of the use of sodium enoxaparin at prophylactic and therapeutic doses was announced in Italy.
Since SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, significant scientific attention has been focused on the re-profile of approved anti-virus preparations that have been developed for previous epidemics such as MERS, SARS and West Nile virus.
Ribavirin: Ribavirin was recommended for treatment with COVID-19 in accordance with the 7th Chinese recommendations.
Umifenovir: Umifenovir was recommended for treatment with COVID-19 in accordance with the 7th edition of Chinese recommendations
Some antibiotics that have been recognised as potentially suitable for use as COVID-19 treatment:
Tocilizumab (receptor anti-IL-6): approved in China.
Also trials in Italy and China, see Tocilizumab#COVID-19.
COVID-19 vaccine is a hypothetical vaccine against cornavirus 2019 (COVID-19).
Although no vaccine has undergone clinical trials, numerous attempts to develop such vaccines continue.
At the end of February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) stated that it was not expected that the SARS-CoV-2 virus vaccine could be received earlier than 18 months later.
In April, five vaccine candidates conducted safety studies at phase I.
The COVID-19 virus was identified in December 2019.
A major outbreak of this disease was spread worldwide in 2020, leading to significant investments in the development of vaccines and research activities.
Many organizations are using published genes to develop possible vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.
As announced in April, the key objectives of the CEPI initiative for the development of vaccines are to ensure the necessary speed, productivity, mass deployment and global access.
In April, CEPI scientists reported that at the beginning of 2020, there were 10 different technological platforms for effective vaccines against COVID-19.
Some of the main objectives of the platform included in phase I safety studies:
Nucleinal acid (DNC and RNC) (stage I developer and vaccine candidate: Moderna, IRNC-1273)
virus vector (stage I developer and vaccine candidate: CanSino Biologics, adenovirus vector type 5)
As scientists from CEPI reported in April, 115 potential vaccines are available at early stages of development, 78 of them are used in approved active projects (79, according to the Institute of Milken); 37 more vaccines have been reported, but there are little general information available (proposally available at the planning or development stage).
A preliminary safety and immunogenicity test is conducted in stages I-II, usually randomized, placebo-controlled and several areas with a more precise and effective dose definition.
Phase III trials usually cover more participants, including the control group; preparation at this stage is tested for effectiveness in preventing disease and monitoring side effects at optimal doses.
Of the 79 vaccine candidates in active development (as confirmed at the beginning of April 2020), 74 human trials were not yet carried out (are still in clinical trials).
On 24 January 2020, the University of Queensland, Australia, announced that it was studying the potential of vaccines with molecular strains that genetically modified viral proteins to stimulate immune response.

At the end of March, the Government of Canada announced the allocation of US$ 275 million to fund 96 medical research projects against COVID-19, including the development of a number of vaccine-candidate preparations in Canadian companies and universities such as Medicago and the University of Saskatchewan.
At the same time, the Government of Canada has announced the allocation of 192 million Canadian dollars specifically for the development of vaccines against COVID-19, as well as plans to establish a national vaccine bank, where several new vaccines could be used in the event of a new outbreak of crown virus.
On 2 April 2020, researchers from the University of Pittsburgh Medical School reported that PittCoVacc, a possible vaccine against COVID-19 on mice, stated that “MNA introduced SARS-CoV-2 S1 subunital vaccines, calling for strong responses to anti-specific antibodies [in mice] that occurred within 2 weeks of immunization”.
On 16 April 2020, the Canadian pharmaceutical school of the University of Waterloo announced the development of a potential DNA-based vaccine that may be released as a nasal stop.
With the help of DNA bacteriophages, human bacteria will multiply within human bacteria and develop harmless viruses that can stimulate the immune system to develop antibodies to SARS-CoV-2.
In March 2020, the Government, industry and three universities of the United States combined the resources of IBM supercomputers with Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft and Google.
Some vaccines have heterological effects, as well as so-called non-specific effects.
This means that they may have other advantages than those for the prevention of diseases.
Another randomized study conducted in Australia involves 4170 health workers.
The vaccines developed may be dangerous or ineffective.
An early assessment of the effectiveness of vaccines using animal models, such as COVID-19 such as ACE2 transgenic mice, other laboratory animals and lower strains, indicates the need for measures to prevent biosafety infection 3 in the processing of live viruses, as well as international coordination of standardized safety procedures.
Vaccines against SARS and MERS were protested on animal models.
As of 2020, there are no medicinal products or protective vaccines that would be safe and effective for humans.
According to research work published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of new vaccines and medicinal products for the treatment of typical pneumonia was a priority for Governments and public health institutions around the world.
When MERS began to spread, it was considered that the study of SARS at the time could be standard for the development of vaccines and anti-MERS-CoV vaccines.
As of March 2020, there was one (based on DNA) vaccine from MERS that passed phase I clinical trials in humans and three other vaccines that were all virus-based vaccines and were in the process of development, two aderior (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac) and one MVA vector (MVA-MERS-S).
Social networks have spread the theory of condoms, claiming that the COVID-19 virus is not new, and that the vaccine already exists.
Publications on social networks quoted a number of patients who claimed that there were patents on genetic traceability of other strains of coronavirus such as SARS, as well as vaccines for these strains.
Coronavirus is a disease identified in 2019 (COVID-19), which is a serious infection caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome of Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The most common symptoms include nausea, cough, and difficulty breathing.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhoea, pain in the throat, loss of consciousness and pain in life.
The time from the first symptoms to the outbreak usually consists of about five days, but may vary from two to fourteen days.
Most of the cases are mild symptoms, but in some cases the disease is due to viral pneumonia and polyurethane deficiency.
As of 17 April 2020, more than 2.24 million cases of infection were registered in 210 countries and regions, and more than 153,000 people died from this disease.
More than 568 000 people were cured; the virus was mainly spread through close contact with each other, often through microscopic capillaries that were distributed in the air by coughing, shingling or talking.
Although these capillaries are formed on the surface, they usually pose a threat to the ground or the surface, but they are not transferred by air to large distances.
People are also infected by contaminated surfaces and then their eyes, nose or mouth.
The virus can live on the surface for 72 hours.
It is most affected during the first three days after symptoms, although its distribution may be possible before symptoms occur and at later stages. The standard diagnostic method is a polymeric cirrhosis reaction with real-time reverse transcription (RT-PCR) to the image taken as a noglytic brain.
The use of medical masks is recommended for patients suspected of disease as well as for those who are suffering from them.
Recommendations for the use of medical masks vary: some departments recommend not to use them at all, others recommend their use and others require them.
There are currently no vaccine or specific treatment for COVID-19 virus.
The local spread of disease has been recorded in most countries in all six regions of WHO.
Infected persons may not have symptoms or symptoms of influenza such as fever, cough, stiffness and swelling.
Extraordinary symptoms include difficulty breathing, constant pain or chest pain, confusion of consciousness, difficulty in awakening, swelling of the person or loss; if the above symptoms occur, medical assistance should be sought immediately.
These can be observed with symptoms of upper respiratory tract diseases such as nausea, vomiting or pain in the throat.
There are also various percentages of iron and steel symptoms, such as dryness, rye and diarrhoea.
Some cases of diseases registered in China were markedly only by chest discomfort and heart failure.
In some cases, disease may progress, resulting in pneumonia, polyurethane deficiency, and death.
This is called the incubation period.
The incubation period COVID-19 usually consists of five or six days, but may vary from two to 14 days.
In 97.5% of people, symptoms begin to occur within 11.5 days of infection, and according to data available, symptoms are not available in all infected people.
The role of such non-sympathetic carriers in the transmission of disease is still unknown, but preliminary data show that they can contribute to the spread of infection.
The percentage of people infected with non-communicable disease is currently unknown; while the Korean disease control and prevention centres (KCDC) reported that 20 per cent of all confirmed cases and hospitalizations were non-communicable.
The National Health Commission of China has begun to include non-sympathetic cases in its daily summary since 1 April; of the 166 cases of violations recorded on that day, 130 (78 per cent) were rejected at the time of testing.
And wets, and elephants can have a greater concentration of virus.
There are more hats in the air than in the words of normal boredom.
A study conducted in Singapore showed that cables can be distributed at a distance of up to 4.5 metres (15 feet).
The virus is usually not transmitted by air, but the National Academy of Sciences has suggested that the transmission of parts of the virus by bioaerosol is still possible and the testing of air processed by air collectors located in corridors outside the room showed the presence of HIV.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and heart disease (SLD), may lead to the spread of respiratory products and therefore to the spread of the virus in the air.
There are also fears that the virus may spread through fecalities, however, this risk is considered low. The virus is the most contagious when people have symptoms; the spread of the virus may even be prior to symptoms, but this risk is small.
Officials of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) claim that until it is clear how easily the virus is spread, however, it is known that one is usually infected by 2-3 other humans.
In particular, it was found that the virus was able to live on the cardboard surface for one day, on the plastic surface (polypropylene) and on the nostalgia (AISI 304) — up to three days, and 99 per cent of the honey surfaces up to 4 hours.
However, these indicators vary depending on the humidity and temperature.
Malaria and potential resources for proper use have a sufficiently useful effect on the fight against infection: honey destroys the fatty protection layer of the virus by deactivating it in such a way as to remove it from the surfaces of the skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions, such as Benzalconic chloride and Chlorgexidine glucanate (a surgical disinfectant), are less effective against this virus.
In five out of six patients, the first test showed the highest level of the virus in the blood and in the sixth patient the highest level of the virus in the blood was found on the second day of testing.
The severe acute coronary artery syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the new severe acute coronary artery syndrome, first discovered by three people with pneumonia from the group with severe respiratory diseases registered in Huhana.
All signs of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are also found in Coronavirus families.
While outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by a home virus that covers its protective surface. SARS-CoV-2 is closely linked to the original SARS-CoV.
Easy is the body most affected by COVID-19 because the virus penetrates into the host cell through angiotensin-reversing enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is the most widely distributed in alveoliar cells of type II.
The virus combines with ACE2 and penetrates into the ozone cell using a natural surface glycoprotein – a “ship” (peplomer).
12 per cent of infected people in the hospital in Huhana have been diagnosed with acute myocardial infarction, which is more often encountered in the form of a serious illness.
The incidence of cardiovascular symptoms is high due to systemic inflammation and immunosuppression observed during progression of disease, but acute myocardial infarction may also be associated with the presence of ACE2 receptors in the heart.
ACE2 receptors are present in the heart in large quantities as they are involved in the work of this body.
The high incidence of thrombosis (31 per cent) and venous thromboembolism (25 per cent) were observed in patients with COVID-19 who could testify to adverse forecasts.
Although SARS-COV-2 has a tropical to Ace2-expressive epithetic respiratory cells, symptoms of systemic hyperburn are observed in patients with severe COVID-19.
In particular, it was found that pathogens of GM-CSF T cells correlate with the recruitment of IL-6 fuel monocytes and heavy pathology in patients with COVID-19.
Lymphocytic infiltrates have also been detected when revealed.
WHO has also published several test reports on this disease.
Polymeric response in real-time mode (RT-PCR) is the standard test method.
The test is usually carried out on respiratory samples obtained from the bone marrow but may also be used as a sample of the bone or marrow.
The results are usually ready for a period of several hours to two days.
Blood tests can also be carried out, but they require two samples of blood taken with the interval in two weeks and their results are of no direct significance.
Chinese scientists have been able to identify the strains of cornavirus and to publish its genetic sequence so that scientists in laboratories around the world can develop tests on their own using a polymeric-temperature response method (PCR) to identify the virus.
As at 4 April 2020, an anti-personnel test that could identify infections at the present time, as well as possible contamination in the past, had been in the development phase but had not yet been widely distributed.
The Chinese experience of testing results has shown that their accuracy is 60 to 70 per cent.
On 21 March 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug Control Office (FDA) approved the first on-site diagnostic test and approved its application at the end of this month.
Bilateral multi-dominated sub-pleural focusses of metallurgical glass with peripheral, asymmetric and ostetric distribution are part of the symptoms identified at an early stage of disease.
Subpleural domination, the symptoms of bulimic bridge (dwelling relief with altered alveoliar filling) and consolidation are developing as the disease progresses.
There are few data on microscopic infections and COVID-19 pathophysiology.
Key results of the pathological study carried out on discovery:
Macroscopy: Pleviritis, pericarditis, inflammation and weakness
Four types of viral pneumonia may be observed:
Easy form of pneumonia: father of mild pneumonia, hyperplasia of pneumonia, major epileptic pneumonia, interstitial inflammation with lymphocytic infiltration and multi-digit giant cells
Heavy form of pneumonia: diffusion alveal injury (DAD) with diffusion alveal excusate.
DAD is a cause of severe respiratory depression and severe hypoxia.
Life-threatening pneumonism: organization of exodus in alveoliar deserts and sleepy interstitial fibrosis.
Blood: Diffusive intrasystolic circulation (DV-syndrome); lycoeroblastic reaction
The prevention measures to reduce the risk of infection include housing, human settlements, often hand washing with lead and water for at least 20 seconds, compliance with respiratory hygiene rules, as well as avoiding eye, nose or mouth damage.
The CDC recommends that the mouth and nose be covered with a shoe or a shoe, or, if there is no shoe, cover the mouth and nose of the inner part of the lock area of the hand.
It is recommended to carry out a quality hygiene procedure for hand.
The Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends the use of tissue masks in public areas, in particular with a view to limiting the transmission of infections to people with chronic disease.
The distance recommendations also imply that people should be at least 6 feet (1.8 m) away from each other.
There is no evidence of efficacy against COVID-19, since the end of the vaccine is not expected before 2021, the main part of COVID-19 anti-dispersion measures are due to a reduction in the incidence of the epidemic known as “emission to pay”.
CDC is also recommended to wash your hands with flour and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after a toilet or during a strong hand pollution, as well as before and after a shower, a horse or a washing machine.
CDC also recommends the use of a disinfectant (at least 60 per cent of alcohol) as a means of handling hands, but only where flour and water are not available. In regions where such disinfectants are not sold, WHO provides two prescriptions for local production.
These compounds use ethanol or isopropanol with antimicrobial activity.
The passage of water is used to remove bacterial dispute in the air and is not an appropriate means of antiseptic processing.
Glycerol is added as a sweetener.
Patients have been shown to support therapy that may include infusion therapy, oxygen support and other vital organs.
The CDC recommends that those who suspect that the virus is infected wear a normal medical mask.
Extracorporal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been used to address respiratory failure, but its advantages are still being studied.
To enhance immunity, it is recommended to comply with the rules of personal hygiene, health and diet.
Supporting treatment methods can be shown in patients with mild symptoms at early stages of disease. WHO and the National Health Commission of China have published recommendations on care for patients treated with COVID-19.
In the United States, intensive therapy and pulmonologists reported the therapeutic recommendations of various institutions in free resource, IBCC.
As of April 2020, there is no specific treatment with COVID-19.
Some medical staff recommend that paracetamol (acetaminophen) be chosen for the treatment of symptoms as preparations for the first line.
In implementing procedures during which air-cable emissions such as intuition or dry hands may occur, precautions should be taken to minimize the risk of transmission of viruses, especially in medical institutions.
Medical staff with COVID-19 recommended that CDC be placed in the air-capable insulator (AIIR) — an additional measure in addition to the standard precautions for contact and air. The CDC issued recommendations on the use of individual protection funds (SICs) during the pandemic.
The recommended means of individual protection: protective needles, respiratory or medical masks, eye protection and medical devices.
The N95 reflectors were approved for use under industrial conditions, but FDA permitted the use of these reflectors according to the U.S.
They are intended to protect from particles in air such as dust, but they are not guaranteed when they are not used as an indication of effectiveness in the protection of a specific biological agent.
If medical masks are not available, CDC recommends using protective personal screens or, in the end, making masks on its own under domestic conditions.
In most cases the COVID-19 flow form is insufficient to require artificial ventilation or its alternatives, but there is also a certain percentage of cases where necessary.
The type of respiratory support for patients treated with respiratory failure associated with COVID-19 is currently being actively studied, while there are some evidence that intubation can be avoided by a nose oxygen channel with intense air flow or double-pressure pressure in breathing.
Until now, either of these two methods for patients in critical condition is as effective as IVL.
Some doctors choose for the benefit of invasive mechanical ventilation if it is available because this method significantly limits the distribution of particles in air compared to heavy air currents. The risk of serious forms of disease for older people (those over 60 years of age and especially those over 80 years of age) is high.
In many developed countries, health care is not available to the population, and the resources of health systems are too limited to deal with the rapid increase in the number of cases of COVID-19 infection in the form of severe hospitalization.
According to one study conducted in China, 5 per cent of patients were hospitalized in intensive treatment offices, 2.3 per cent were required for mechanical support for light ventilation and 1.4 per cent were completed.
In China, about 30 per cent of COVID-19 hospitalized persons end up in reanition.
The task of providing artificial ventilation is easy because the acute respiratory stress syndrome (ARDS) developed at COVID-19 and oxygenation is becoming increasingly difficult.
ILLs supported by pressure on the air and PFCs are needed to deliver the maximum amount of oxygen in the light and to ensure that they are minimally damaged by ventilation, which may result in pneumotrox.
A high PDP may not be available in earlier models of fans.
The studies of potential treatment methods began in January 2020, and at present several antiviral preparations are in clinical trials.
The most promising is remedécivir.
The development of new medicinal products may take up to 2021, but some of the tested products have already been approved for other purposes or are in recent stages of testing.
Antiviral preparations may be tested in patients with severe forms of disease.
WHO volunteers are involved in the effectiveness and safety of potential treatments. FDA has provided temporary permission for the use of recombinant plasma as a experimental treatment in cases where life is seriously or directly hazardous.
It was not applied to clinical studies that should be conducted to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the treatment method.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile application designed to combat outbreaks.
Users must enter their name and identification number for entry.
The annex may detect “close contact” using observation data and therefore identify the potential risk of infection.
Each user can also check the status of three other users.
If the potential risk is identified, the application not only recommends self-insulation but also sends a notification to the local health authorities. Analytical analysis of large data collected from mobile phones, identification technologies, tracking mobile phones and artificial intelligence are used to track infected people and people they contacted in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Government of Israel granted security authorities permission to trace data from mobile phones of persons who were supposedly infected with cornavirus.
Measures were taken to ensure quarantine and protection for persons who could contact infected citizens.
Also in March 2020, in order to study and prevent the spread of the virus, Deutsche Telekom provided collected data to the Federal Government institutions of Germany and Robert Koha Institute on the location of hundreds of subscribers.
In Russia, technology for identification of carantine offenders was introduced.
A regional health authority from Italy, Julio Gallera, said that hundreds of network operators reported that “40 per cent of people still move equally across the territory”.
The Government of Germany has conducted a 48-hour program day marathon involving more than 42,000 participants.
The President of Estonia, Kersti Kalulayid, also called for creative solutions against the spread of cornovirus.
People may experience stress related to quarantine, travel restrictions, side effects of treatment or fear of infection themselves.
BBC quotes Rory O'Connor as saying: “Strengthening social isolation, unity, concern about health, stress and economic degradation is the ideal conditions for harming people’s mental health and well-being.”
The disease can be easily detected with minor or missing symptoms that mention other widespread upper respiratory diseases, such as normal dyspnoea.
Patients with mild forms of disease usually recover within two weeks, while patients with severe or critical forms may need from three to six weeks to be treated.
Pregnant women may be at higher risk of receiving the heavy form of COVID-19 on the basis of other such viruses as SARS and MERS, although there are no such data on COVID-19.
Those with the most severe disease COVID-19 may make rapid progress in severe respiratory stress syndrome (ARDS), resulting in respiratory failure, septic shock or polyurethane deficiency.
COVID-19 complications include sepsis, anomaly thromboembolism, as well as heart problems, strokes and pain.
Thromboembolism anomalies, in particular increase in prothrombin time, were described in 6 per cent of patients treated with COVID-19 while the expected impairment was observed in 4 per cent of this group.
About 20-30 per cent of patients with COVID-19 have increased print farms (transformations).
According to the same report, the average time between symptoms and death was ten days, five of which were patients at hospitalization.
However, the average time between hospitalization and death in patients transferred to intensive therapy was seven days.
According to an early stage disease study, the average time from early symptoms to day of death was 14 days with a full range of six to 41 days.
According to a study conducted by the National Health Commission of China (NHC), the mortality rate among men was 2.8 per cent and 1.7 per cent among women.
Histopathological studies of post-mortem samples of mild to moderate evidence of diffusion of alveoliar damage with cell fibromoxoid exodus in both cells.
Pneumocytosis has been observed with viral cytopathic changes.
The outer layer of light remember the intense respiratory stress syndrome (ORDS).
In 11.8 per cent of deaths recorded by the National Health Commission of China, heart problems were caused by the increase in troponin or cardiac arrest.
According to data provided by the United States in March, 89 per cent of hospitalized patients had their previous health problems, and access to medical resources and the socio-economic situation in the region could also affect mortality.
Death estimates vary depending on the state, due to these regional differences, as well as due to methodological difficulties.
Inadequately effective reporting of cases in an easy-to-be way can lead to death.
Nevertheless, the fact that deaths are caused by diseases that have occurred in the past may mean that the current level of death is inadequate.
In smokers, severe COVID-19 symptoms were generally more frequent than 1.4 times, and patients were about 2.4 times more likely to need intensive therapy or die compared to non-inflammable ones.
The administration of one Hong Kong clinic found that some patients who had been treated with this disease were mild to 20 to 30 per cent and that their scan was harmful.
This may also lead to the post-intensive treatment syndrome.
As of March 2020, it was unknown whether permanent immunity to the vaccine is being developed in patients who have been infected with the virus.
The court of other coronaviruses is considered to be likely, but also reported cases where COVID-19 tests on coronavirus were equally positive after treatment.
In these cases, it is believed that there was a widespread spread of disease rather than re-infection.
The virus is considered natural, has an animal origin and is an infectious disease.
The actual origin of the virus is unknown, but by December 2019 the spread of the infection was almost entirely due to its human transmission.
The first 41 cases of COVID-19 confirmed, published in The Lancet in January 2020, call 1 December 2019 the most early date of the first case of disease.
According to official data published by WHO, that date was 8 December 2019.
A number of methods are usually used to measure mortality.
All numbers vary depending on the region and the time of the spread of the disease, which is also affected by testing, quality of health systems used by treatment schemes, from the start of outbreaks of disease and population parameters such as age, gender and overall health.
At the end of 2019, WHO approved emergency aid codes for ICB-10: U07.1 — for the death of SARS-CoV-2 and U07.2 - for the deaths of COVID-19 clinical or epidemiologically diagnosed COVID-19 without laboratory confirmation of SARS-CoV-2. The number of deaths and cases of infection is the number of deaths separated from the number of diagnosed cases within a given period of time.
According to statistics from the University of Johns Hopkins, as at 17 April 2020, the global number of deaths and injuries is 6.9 per cent (153 82/22 240.1).
This figure varies depending on the region, and some other methods include the identification of the mortality rate due to disease (CFR), which reflects the percentage of patients diagnosed as a result of the disease, as well as the identification of the mortality rate as a result of the transmission of the infection (IFR), which reflects the percentage of infected patients (both diagnosed and undiagnated cases) who have ended up with the disease.
These statistics are not time-bound and reflect indicators of a certain population from the point of view of infection to the end of the disease.
Despite the fact that antibodies are not available in all patients who have been infected, it is possible to understand how many people have been infected in the presence of such antibodies.
At the outbreak in Italy, Castileon d'Adda, a small village with a population of 4600, 80 people (1.7%) are no longer alive.
In the city of Hangelt, the disease spread throughout the holiday season among young people, causing relatively low deaths, and not all deaths from COVID-19 could be officially classified as such.
Moreover, the German health system was not overloaded.
In the Netherlands, about 3 per cent of the population may have an antidote, a donor blood judge.
COVID-19 — Official cause of 69 deaths (0,004 per cent of the population).
The effects of pandemics and mortality levels are different for men and women.
According to studies conducted in China and Italy, the mortality rate is higher than that of men.
The highest risk group is men over 50 years of age; the gap between men and women decreases only from 90 years of age.
In China the mortality rate was 2.8 per cent for men and 1.7 per cent for women.
The exact causes of this difference are unknown, but may be attributed to genetic and behavioural factors.
Gender immunological differences, lower prevalence of smoking among women with male diseases (e.g. hypertonia in men younger than women) may lead to higher mortality among men.
In Europe 57 per cent of men were infected, and 72 per cent of deaths from COVID-19 occurred in men.
As at April 2020, the Government of the United States does not conduct gender statistics on COVID-19.
Research has shown that viral diseases such as Ebola, HIV, influenza and ARV have different gender statistics.
Most health workers, especially medical personnel, are more likely to be infected by women.
On 11 February 2020, the World Health Organization announced the official name of this disease, COVID-19.
WHO leader Tedros Adam Hebreus explains: "CO" means "coron", "VI", "virus", "D" (disease), and 19 when first outbreaks were detected: 31 December 2019.
Such a name was chosen to avoid any reference to a specific geographical location (e.g. China), species of animals or groups of people, as required by international name recommendations for the prevention of stigmatization. The virus, which causes COVID-19, is known as severe acute coronary respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
In WHO's public communications, the terms “COVID-19” and “COVID-19” are also used.
And disease, and the virus itself is usually called koronavirus.
During the initial outbreaks in Huhana, China, the virus and the disease were usually referred to as “coron virus” and “Hungary virus”.
In January 2020, in accordance with the 2015 recommendations on the use of geographical sites in the names of diseases and viruses, WHO recommended the use of the terms “severe respiratory disease 2019-nCov” and “2019-nCOV” as temporary names of viruses and diseases.
Official names were published on 11 February 2020: "COVID-19" and "SARS-CoV-2".
Due to the limitations of the standard ranges of delivery, some digital service manufacturers print medical materials such as pumps for the removal of fat from the nose, as well as details of IVL devices.
In one such case, the Italian clinic was urgently in need of ventilation valve and the supplier was unable to deliver it at the required time, while one of the local productions was re-profiled and was able to print the required 100 valves per night.
Following the first outbreak of COVID-19, the Internet has been highly rapidly spreading various theories of the origin of the virus, its size, prevention, treatment and other aspects.
It is possible that humans may be infected with the virus of other animals.
The results of the studies did not confirm the spread of HIV among pigs, mice and mice.
There is currently no approved vaccine from the virus or medicinal product for its treatment.
Various international studies of vaccines and medicines from COVID-19 are currently being conducted by government organizations, academic groups and industrial researchers.
In March WHO launched the SOLIDARITY Trial programme (“SOLIDARITY Testing”) to assess the medical impact of the four existing compounds that are considered most effective today.
The vaccine is not yet available, but various organizations are actively preparing vaccine-candidate preparations.
Both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 enter human cells using ACE2 receptors, so the results of previous studies under SARS-CoV are used in scientific development.
There are three vaccination strategies.
First, researchers are trying to create a complete-vironial vaccine.
The use of this virus, whether of an inactive or dead form, is aimed at prompt immune response by the human body to a new COVID-19 infection.
The second strategy, the establishment of a single vaccine, is aimed at the establishment of a vaccine that increases the sensitivity of the immune system to certain viruses.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, such studies are aimed at the destruction of S-chibovir protein, which helps the virus penetrate the ACE2 receptor.
A third strategy is the development of a vaccine based on nucleoic acid (NPC or RNC vaccines, a new vaccine-producing methodology).
Experimental vaccines developed under any of these strategies should be tested for safety and efficacy. The first clinical trial of four volunteers was initiated in Seattle on 16 March 2020.
The vaccine contains a harmless genetic code derived from the virus that causes disease. Anti-televisional enhancement has been identified as one of the potential problems in the development of vaccines from SARS-COV-2, but this assumption has a controversial nature.
As of April 2020, more than 300 active clinical trials were conducted.
Preparations approved for Malaria treatment were evaluated in seven trials, four of which were based on hydroxyroquine or chloroquine.
The reproducination of antiviral preparations is a major part of Chinese studies; at the end of April, nine studies were conducted in several countries at phase III on rhemedesivir.
As of April 2020, a dynamic review of the clinical development of vaccines and candidate preparations for COVID-19 was carried out. To that end, several other existing antiviral preparations were also considered for COVID-19, including rmedesivir, chloroxin and hydroxyroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir and lopinavir/ritonavir in combination with beta interferon.
As at March 2020, there are preliminary data on the effectiveness of the use of rhedecivir.
Clinical improvement was observed in patients receiving rhemedesivir as an exception.
Phase III clinical trials are already taking place in the United States, China and Italy, and the use of chloroquinine previously used to treat malaria was considered in China in February 2020 and there are preliminary results.
However, there is a need for an expert assessment of the study.
Korean and Chinese health authorities recommend the use of chloroquine.
The Hungarian Institute of Virusology recommends a daily dose of one gram, but notes that double this dose is very dangerous and can lead to summer expenses.
On 28 March 2020, FDA granted authorisation for the extra use of hydroxyrokine and chloroquine to treat patients with COVID-19.
Preliminary data indicate that high doses of ribavirin are required to incubate SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
Nitazoxanid was recommended for a detailed study in vivo, showing SARS-CoV-2 in low concentrations, and studies have shown that the whiteness of TMPRS-CoV-2 is needed to detect SARS-CoV-2 by interacting with ACE2 receptor.
Studies of the use of chloroquine and hydroxyroquine with or without azithromycin have serious restrictions that do not allow the medical community to use these treatments without further study. Ozeltamivir does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and its role in the treatment of COVID-19 is unclear.
Hypercytokinaemia may occur as a later complications of heavy form COVID-19.
There is evidence that hydroxyroquine may have hypercytokine properties, and a recent study by the National Health Commission of China included tocilizumab in the recommendation to treat cornavirus.
This preparation has taken up 2 phases of an unmanaged test conducted at the national level in Italy after positive results have been obtained from its use in patients with severe disease.
In combination with the analysis of blood clotting on ferritin to detect cytokines, it is intended to counteract factors that are considered to be cause of death in some patients.
In 2017 the FDA was approved by an interleukin-6 receptor antagonist based on retrospective thematic studies to treat steroid-refractory cytokines syndrome, which is another cause of CAR cell therapy.
Today there are no randomised and controlled evidence that tocilizumab is an effective means of treating cytokine release syndrome.
The transfer of cleansed and concentrated antibodies produced by immune systems of patients treated with COVID-19 to persons in need is now considered as a non-vaccinated method of passive immunization.
This strategy has been tested in the treatment of patients from SARS but its results have been uncertain.
The neutralisation of the virus is the expected effect by which passive anti-arthroptic therapy can protect SARS-CoV-2.
However, it is possible to use other mechanisms such as antithelossive cytotoxicity and/or phagocytosis.
Other forms of passive treatment of antibodies, such as monoclonal antibodies, are at development stage.
The use of reconvalescent blood can be increased, consisting of the liquid part of the blood of healthy patients and contain antibodies against this virus.
Coronavirus disease, high-level syndrome group
Li Venlan, Dr. Juan, who later became infected and died from COVID-19 after reporting the spread of the virus.
