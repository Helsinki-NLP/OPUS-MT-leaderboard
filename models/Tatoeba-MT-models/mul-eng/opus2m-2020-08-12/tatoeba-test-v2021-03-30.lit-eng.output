Whoever's got everything can lose everything.
Did you start?
You never understand my laughs.
I found a pair of fingers behind my chest.
He's back in the morning.
I need an e-mail sign.
I can't just leave you here.
Life's too short to drink some of the bad wine.
If the car is damaged, you're responsible.
This is my car.
They're for us somewhere higher.
I thought she had no reason to do what she did.
Aren't you tired?
Good evening, how's it going?
She's very beautiful.
I said that myself.
People should work.
"Shut up," he whispered.
Since he often prays, he cannot be trusted.
What do you mean?
Leave me alone!
I'm doing it without any problems.
Mark took his things and left.
We finally learned the truth.
There's a few.
At present, Thomas is learning English in Japan.
Thomas complains about sadness.
No one's here.
Which two did you want to borrow?
Did someone say where our secret is?
I came to Japan for the first time.
Look what Mary's doing.
He knows how to play poker.
Thank you very much.
It's over.
I don't like school.
The bird's looking for the turtles.
I grew up for my son.
Mary got into the kitchen.
I don't have the slightest understanding.
Don't move like that.
Why are you so angry?
There are many words I don't understand.
Can I get a bottle of eggs?
I have to tell her the truth tomorrow.
My dream is to teach Totor's language in Kazanë.
I'm a student.
I'd like to dig a map.
You're gonna have to drive.
Take your brother with you.
Beth always managed to get what she wanted.
You didn't say anything?
Stay with me, ladies and gentlemen.
She knows exactly what she wants.
Hello.
Did Thomas forgive you for what you did last week?
Good morning. It's time to go.
The baby slept all night.
She doesn't like the city of life.
This size is too big for me.
It's okay.
Do whatever you want.
The man you saw last night is my uncle.
I don't like snow.
I gave Tom a chance.
We're playing golf without touching things.
What's the test?
He told me his life story.
I decided to be happy because this is good for my health.
I'll wait here until he gets back.
One doctor.
What are you looking at?
What do you see?
That's not what you think!
In that store you can buy your dog.
He likes a sweet old man.
You have to do the same thing.
It's simple and intuitous.
How many hours do you work per week?
Yeah, two.
They don't.
Please contact me when you get to Boston.
She asked me who came out first.
We'll all die sooner or later.
How long will it stop?
It's six.
Where's the German embassy?
Be friendly.
This rose is amazing.
But he knew it couldn't continue.
Maybe not.
I want it too!
She's looking but she's not seeing anything.
He can't eat any sweets today.
She's white.
I'd like to travel around the world.
Do you like Italian?
I got five years in prison.
I didn't.
Any thing that is quite simple in order to understand it is too simple to create a mind that could understand it.
We didn't have to hurry.
Excuse me?
It doesn't matter what team we win.
He's running.
This dress is too big for me.
Go and stay at your car.
Bring her a piece of salad.
We're friends.
She didn't answer.
I heard Mary wanted a divorce.
Is this a snake or a snake?
My father came home this morning.
This mountain is covered with snow all year round.
Never lose hope.
Can I give you some sugar?
This book belongs to the libraries.
I want to die with Getter Jani.
From milk we produce cheese and butter.
When I was in high school, I spent six hours a day in the morning.
You kids are the best jokes.
How can you say something like that?
Be careful!
I guess you've done this before.
Did you get a letter?
Two years ago, I couldn't play basketball.
What is the difference?
You're hurt.
She rejected my request.
Who do you call primacy?
I like Korean food.
He invited me south.
You're still green.
There's nothing here.
You never know what will happen in the future.
We're making wet forms of wet.
Everybody likes to dance.
What did you do to make this happen?
Look at the example given above.
Her flight seemed very funny.
I wanted to be a philosopher.
You're not fast enough.
We made the door open.
Can I come in?
Why are you calling?
They discussed the problem.
If I didn't get his help, I wouldn't be alive.
He was almost asleep.
I have one brother.
Where did you come from?
Do you like this color?
Isn't it true that Tom's not always here at this time?
Millions have lost their lives in war.
Compare your word with that on the board.
She made him happy.
They need our help.
Did you get Tom's note?
I don't like what he's talking about.
I don't know what's going on with me anymore.
I learned a lot from him.
He killed that man.
Don't believe too much.
That red hat is old.
He plays golf every Sunday.
Be creative.
I couldn't understand what he said.
Close the door.
I'm always tired.
He changed his mind.
Go back to your place.
Be friendly.
Isn't it a wonderful morning?
It's just a statement.
I've got more and more live hair.
He's turned off the light.
I can't sleep.
The sky is blue.
The old woman broke down and couldn't get out.
They're stuck in the movie.
You can use my word.
I want to talk to you about it.
You like Tom.
He rarely stays home on Sundays.
When would you like to see him?
Thomas got help.
His son's eight.
If I had a hurry, I'd run to you.
Where the hell are you going?
He promised me he'd be more careful in the future.
When did you hear the bell?
I forgot to buy one thought.
I've heard a lot about you.
We're ready to eat south.
Italy is a very beautiful country.
It's an old mess.
Eat the gift!
Although he lives in the United States, Thomas does not learn to speak English.
The school is five miles from my home.
I opened my gun.
Who ate all our food?
I know it's gonna be nice.
Please come.
Women change the world.
An explosion on the grounds of Singapore is considered to be a crime.
I wanted Mary to love me instead of Tom.
You can sit on the couch.
We need more sugar.
The rose scent filled the room.
Sometimes it's good luck.
Thomas already has three bottles of coffee.
I don't understand German.
Yes, please.
I'll help you.
You're hurt.
What are you looking for?
What does that mean?
Both on the other side of the wall are the sweetest.
Is that it?
I studied Japanese.
That's unreasonable.
She had a woman's head, the body of a lion, the wings of a bird, and the tail of a living bird.
Tell me how you solved the problem.
Would you like to join me?
Even if I wanted to, I couldn't explain what happened there.
I was afraid of heights.
I don't know where to go.
If you don't mind, let's go.
What's going on with you?
I'm a percentage.
Let's look at the facts.
I'm not the mayor now.
I'm going to France to leave.
You can sit where you want.
You're an engineer.
The door was shut.
It's just history.
Have you ever been involved in any sports?
It's time for you to start a new business.
Let's wait here.
That girl I told you to live here.
Please, just leave.
I can't believe she's older than my mother.
Look back and see the black cat.
I've got a lot of travel for my family.
Do you know him?
I don't know if to turn to the left or to the right.
I'll take the kitchen off later.
He came from a small town in the mountains.
I broke up with my friends.
All your cats are girls.
I and I remember the time when we were dating you.
As long as we're not sleeping, we're going to call it "blanks."
Scandals served his career.
Cats are complex individuals.
He was so poor that he couldn't buy the data.
I suggest you ask Tom.
This mixture is not small.
There's nothing wrong with it.
If you invite him, he'll be coming soon.
I know you know I know.
Go home before 6:00.
Duona's fresh.
I'll be back in half an hour.
I don't want to be bad anymore.
Are you a lawyer?
Where did your school go?
The lights lit the room.
I'm sorry.
Put the paper in half.
What does he write in his letters?
A woman's lunch date.
I ate apples.
A single person finds pleasure in observing the circuits.
Who's that man sitting at the other end of the table?
Are you pregnant?
Now I'm really tired.
His steps have been made.
I'm being punished for all these endless spaces forever.
Where do you need a new one?
He drew a straight line on the wall.
You need a car?
Take your coffee when you get into class.
They don't seem to complain anymore.
She ran.
Please contact me when you get to Boston.
Thomas arrived at seven o'clock.
This is for us.
I'm listening to the radio.
Bernie wants to know the truth.
Thomas ate all the pizza one.
You have to take care of yourself.
You need patience, Tom.
How's your time?
Your trip starts here.
Can you believe what he said?
Thomas asked where you were.
I'd like to help, but I'm very busy.
Thomas couldn't stop thinking about Mary.
I think we need to call Tom.
Don't get on the bus.
It's all there.
You're gonna have to pay.
When should we go to the station?
The more I think about it, the less I like it.
I'll take you to the new store.
Everyone knows her.
She's an amazing bride.
Where are you living in Turkey?
Tom's starting.
I can't.
Get out of class.
On my mother's bed are three dogs.
Thomas has already finished the job he had to do.
If you can't have children, you can always be impressed.
That's what I thought.
Although she ran as fast as she could, she still couldn't get to the bus.
They need friends.
Happy, please.
Can you learn as a gift?
You like living like this?
It's hot today, isn't it?
Don't you really have a home?
Are you playing chess?
Her boy is Turkish.
Answer me.
My mom can't come.
There's a lot of people in Bavaria.
Do you know if he has a girl?
I don't have families.
The parents believed too much of their son.
What would you like to order, sir?
It happened to him.
He came into my room without permission.
You can't just leave.
Come on, move!
You can sit on the couch.
Where do you live if you don't have a home?
Our Union can be good.
He told me I could use his car.
Almost all students like English.
That test was so difficult that we didn't have enough time to finish it.
That's all.
You have to work fast.
If you believe that society has made no difference, you can say that you believe in mass destruction.
English is spoken around the world.
All their efforts were pointless.
Where did you get it?
This girl doesn't sound bad.
Life is unfair.
Each person paid a thousand dollars.
Julia's the only girl in our club.
Schools don't have to go to school today.
The sun shines through the sky.
His parents were satisfied with his success.
Now it's our house.
I'll call them tomorrow when I get home.
He helped fix my watch.
No one's worth helping me.
John doesn't know what to do next.
He suffered from severe headaches.
I want a son of a bitch.
I have to find my letter.
At times Nigeria was a British colony.
Don't throw stones into the river.
I'm good at teaching Germans.
She wears her room's white color.
I can't go until he's gone.
I asked her to cook.
Have you done your homework already?
John is a professor of French literature at Oxford University.
Do you understand what he said?
What colors are her hair?
The sooner you get back, the happier your father will be.
Are you ready to start your trip?
Your watch is 10 minutes late.
They gave it to you.
I mean, you said she was yours.
How much money do you have to hide behind your back?
We believe in God.
I'm a hero.
This is the man I was expecting.
He didn't pay debts and start.
Mr. Brown is very well spoken in Japanese.
No, he's not my new kid.
I like to watch baseball and football.
All except her, they're gone.
The queen stood by the king.
This bridge was built two years ago.
She's my first love.
You have to keep your promise.
Today, Thomas appears to be different.
What is the room's rental price?
We have to get out of here.
Thomas never wants to do that again.
I asked her to wait a minute.
How did you start learning Spanish?
They don't pose a threat.
Their advice encouraged me to move abroad.
You're the only one who can help me.
What places does this visit take?
That's why we played inside.
Your origin is completely white.
But I don't want to.
I'm glad I can't meet you tonight.
Thomas has a sister who is a lawyer.
I'm like my mother.
You just look crazy this morning.
Doctor, can you hear me?
You understand, don't you?
I hope to see him on Monday.
Tom's ready.
The orchid is hot, so be careful not to give up.
Do you create your letters?
For God's sake!
He doesn't remember if that room was empty or not.
The store sells expensive accessory for women.
I don't like listening.
It's not them.
I don't understand how old I am.
Just where you are.
The house is hers.
The doctor advised him to stop working so much.
Are you sure?
You were busy.
I can't live like this anymore.
He'll do anything to make money.
I just want to talk.
What kind of music does Thomas like?
This tree grows near her house.
Don't talk in the library.
How's it going with you, panel?
I'd just go to the dollar.
I don't hate snow.
I think Thomas is going to kill Mer.
There are only two other answers.
If I had been rich, I'd have given you some money.
When and where did you meet her?
Where the hell are you?
Tom didn't give up.
Don't be so serious, it's just a game.
He told me a funny story.
I don't have time now.
Thomas is the captain of our team.
This trend is very long.
Listen to what the teacher says.
Why don't no one eat my balls?
I asked Tom to play guitar.
What do you remember?
She interpreted it as a word.
What a great night!
I can't find Tim.
She named him Charles.
I'm not sure it's a boy or a girl.
Life is beautiful.
She's taking them to school.
However, it was temporarily unreachable.
Nobody liked what you said.
I didn't know what to say.
Do you think I should go alone?
Just answer the question.
I never want to be a slave to anyone.
Look at the train going through the bridge.
I'm not the only one who loves Tom.
Now I'm really sorry.
No, I don't think I'm hurt.
Where are we?
I've got fifteen.
Her flight seemed funny.
She's too young to understand.
I bought this suit just for this suit.
It's similar.
Be honest, okay?
This is the only explanation.
I can't believe I'm really here.
Don't you know the way?
I love it very much.
It'll need help.
I printed a hundred pages.
I see and hear.
Don't forget the ticket.
Put your hand in front of your answer.
Please change your password.
Isn't it true that you have a gun?
I spent the whole day in the hunt.
The war ended their investigation.
When the spring comes, the day will be longer than the day after.
I'm listening to the radio.
Sweet dreams!
Leave my car in bed.
This is Tony's book.
I had to go ahead.
Thomas eats only what he wants to eat.
Who's got this apple?
He threw his ticket into the movies.
What would you do if you were in his place?
I don't like leftovers.
Bee, what's your address?
She was lying on the bed face down.
African drums are larger than Asian drums.
What I've always said.
He heard it on Wednesday night.
Please bring me a glass of water.
He grabbed her hand.
Eat the gift!
If God did not exist, we would have to create it.
You should do the same thing this time.
My family was very hospitable.
You don't understand.
She has green eyes and bright red hair.
Does Thomas have experience?
She left her nest in the train.
I'm a vegetarian.
You must go there.
Why?
I don't see anything from here.
Because I didn't get the answer, I wrote her one more time.
She's already on the wall.
Don't believe too much of me.
They've missed a great walk.
Fight for your right.
He always talks to me when he meets me on the street.
Look at the book on the table.
I threw out one of my eggs, and I'd be very tired.
Thomas did not think he needed someone to protect him.
Someone opened the door.
Do you have any questions about this lesson?
We saw how she got into the park.
I don't think we're busy.
It doesn't look like you wanted those books.
I've got a red bike.
He's low and big.
I want to go to Tokyo.
The trip was exhausting.
He's much smarter than me.
Tom still doesn't seem interested.
It's quiet today.
I didn't want this to happen.
I'm trying to get rid of this.
Like I said, I'm not gonna do anything.
After that there is a small red dog.
Stop them.
Ana likes chocolate.
I know Mike likes a doll.
I've got to throw all my hips into the boots.
He died two years ago.
Get me to your room.
That's what I've been doing right now.
Yes, I understand.
I'll be right back in ten minutes.
He was murdered.
If you don't go to school, you won't pay anything.
If anything happens, call me quickly.
Would you like to have some coffee?
Is there any danger?
You're dangerous to swim in this river.
My friends are amazing.
The gold won't buy anything.
We have enough water.
Who will inherit the throne?
She's working hard.
Don't be changed.
Please open this box.
Is it healthy to eat fish?
My baby wants to talk.
I asked her how she likes music.
There are no eyewitnesses.
Is she satisfied?
But he knew he had no choice.
Do you remember this game?
It's starting without documents.
I'm often here.
She kept her language.
Mike doesn't pay well to play baseball.
Buyers are often used when travelling on the streets.
Mary is a book.
I'll see you next week.
I saw his car on the window.
Are you ready?
I'm glad I'm not a woman.
Stop cleaning up and get back to work.
The better, the better.
Ten years is a long time.
Is this your car?
I can't believe you're still a slave.
To be happy is absolutely normal.
We have to move very carefully.
Did you get Tom's name?
I was hurt last night.
If I had been rich, I would have given you some money.
I don't have a computer at home.
My father didn't eat a lot of fruit.
Can you give me a break?
She threw me up and left me for a good night.
My friend's here.
Where's life now?
The older you are, the harder it is to learn the language.
Thomas doesn't like coffee, but he smoked cigarettes.
Not all people like dogs.
I'll stay here a few days.
I feel bad.
Why did you say such a stupid thing?
You can't beat me.
I don't think I could do that.
Is that true?
She's pregnant.
We'll get to the beach.
He's my father.
He doesn't want to wait for you.
He brought the family into the zoo.
Thomas refused to go to the hospital.
It's half nine.
This car was manufactured in Japan.
Is this your first time in Japan?
Tony was happy.
My father asked me to open the door.
Make his photobot!
Your brother wasn't in school today.
Thomas will never touch you.
I was in Canada then.
I made this food myself.
Write a note.
Someone wrote his name on the wall.
What can only happen if we turn away from what is bad?
They don't have sugar anymore.
I love your daughter.
Thomas wants him to stay tonight and not eat again.
Someone opened the door.
I'm not your mom.
Why isn't Tom in the car?
My name is Ricardo.
When did you get a telegram?
You shouldn't swim in that tent.
When's the snow going down?
He thought I was too tired.
I don't think she needs to eat anymore.
Either you're with us or you're in front of us.
Please help me!
Thomas knows he likes Mary.
I like this music.
She's out of the dog.
He went to the store, but they stopped at her house.
It's snowing fast.
We're on our way here.
Of course I should read this book.
At this point, Thomas is not in prison.
Thomas and Mary went to the museums.
The ship is heading towards the horizon.
Good morning, my dear dog.
God is pleased with those who turn away.
I can't work when you're there.
Marilla had problems with her lungs.
We were one big happy family.
What color car did she buy?
The boy slept all night.
Do you see me?
She testified against him.
My father's growing rice.
We speak Japanese.
The result was disappointing.
I got through the window.
Meat's not ready yet.
Give me your hands.
She needs more sleep.
Did you hear anything?
Is she your mother?
Can you turn on the light?
He's more dangerous than a doctor.
This was the first time I visited museums.
We're going to spend a lot of time.
I think Thomas wants to stay.
What a nice family.
Do you think you're Florida?
You didn't have to eat those green fish.
Wake up! It's the last day.
We looked at the window, but we didn't see anything.
When was the last time you saw Tom?
The capital of Sweden is Stockholm.
They were talking about love.
Thomas never wants to do that again.
I don't understand.
If left alone, the child would feel very lonely.
I don't know anyone here.
Our team lacked mobility.
Cat's gone over the street.
Tenai is a ghost.
Why don't you wanna help the police?
I want to meet your father.
Please try.
He was busy.
I'm sent.
I saw him.
I'm paying for Lozbano.
"Good morning," said Tom with a smile.
I hurt my arm.
He needs a hat.
You shouldn't go.
You shouldn't trust him.
There are seven days a week.
You have to figure out your own way of life.
Without air and water, no one could live.
He's been sneezing, and he's not alone.
They work eight hours a day.
I ate better.
I do it every Sunday morning.
She quickly opened the letter.
Are you busy right now?
I'll take everything I said.
Where'd you get all that stuff from?
I went inside through the window.
Take Tom to the hospital.
I have a white cat.
He wrote our names immediately.
Our son died in the war.
It is not satisfied with the result.
Obviously you're wrong.
I can't tell you who's coming first.
I don't want to talk to you because you broke my heart.
Don't trust him.
We're better off than everyone else
Who's that guy sitting at the other end of the table?
This idea is very interesting.
They're going to buy it.
Everything that's genius is simple.
Their lessons are too much.
Thomas took his hand.
We're going south.
The birds are heading south.
This bet is very expensive.
I don't like him.
I'm hurt.
It's not bad, but I'm tired for a while.
It's a great idea.
He's very proud of his game.
That's what's gonna happen to us.
I didn't mean it.
A woman wants to know the truth.
Is this word often used?
Lithuania shall join the European Union.
I want to be a speaker.
Where's the cat?
I'm sorry about what I did.
She's become a mailman.
I learned to ride a bike when I was six.
He's taken off his neck.
Let me do it.
I like jazz.
I'm sure he's innocent.
Open the window and release the fresh air.
Have you ever proposed a word?
It's heavy snow.
Did you see my mom?
I know his name.
Thomas doesn't want to live like this.
Do you agree with what she's doing?
He came here before he finished his studies.
You know their address?
What can you do?
He looked down on his furry boots.
Her cat was lying on my shoulder and didn't want to die.
There are several good hotels in the city.
From where did this letter come from?
He doesn't want to teach today.
We're all different.
You don't know how hard I love you.
I wrote her a long letter.
He couldn't do what he wanted.
I feel weak today.
Life is interesting.
She's here?
I don't like listening.
Be careful, okay?
I bought a camera for $30.
This is great.
It's no method, it's a provocation.
Answer in English.
He wants to see us again.
There's a lot of water here.
Where are you living?
My friend doesn't use sugar.
I fell off my head.
He's got to talk to people.
Bob was in the boat at the time.
My brother is two years older than I am, but he is three inches lower than me.
I can only tell you what I know.
I think about you.
What's your home address?
He'll be free in the morning.
Didn't you see my wife?
Your daughter heard us talk.
Tom's gonna die fast.
I'm ready to go to sleep later.
I've accepted it before.
Look at that house with a red roof.
My butt is on the fourth floor.
She was already pregnant.
We're poker players.
These clothes are good for you.
Don't touch her.
Do you know you're stronger than I am?
I love her so much that I can't leave her.
Can he come with us?
I don't care.
Thomas could not find a reason why he had to return home early.
Hold your hand.
He didn't sell the house.
No one has ever seen God.
She saw something waiting for her at school.
I don't think we're busy.
Where's Maria?
The new contract allows us to demand what we want.
Tomas is still a prisoner.
Go and open the door.
I told you I'd be able to fix each other later.
Oh, my God, help me!
She told him she was happy.
She needs it more than she needs it.
It's a big exit!
Tom, I'm back.
You wanted to meet me?
That's not a mistake.
The airport is a long way from the city center.
You can turn off the radio now.
You can turn off the radio now.
You're a very nice man.
Ankara is in Turkey.
You're a very cute man.
I was in Boston a couple of times.
You're a very nice man.
