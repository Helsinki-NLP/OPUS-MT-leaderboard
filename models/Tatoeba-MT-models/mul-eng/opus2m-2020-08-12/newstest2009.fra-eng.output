At the end of the exchanges, the Prague Bascula exchange in the negative
After the fall of the morning morning, the Prague bourgeois rehabilitated its losses.
Transactions with ČEZ actions achieve almost half of daily exchanges.
Tuesday, from the start of the exchanges, Prague's bourgeois again with its guard drop, when it lost almost six percent.
This time, the down is due to the fall of actions at Wall Street.
The market reaction to the outcome of the vote of the House of American Representatives, which refused to adopt the US financial sector stabilisation plan, is also understandable to us.
Cut-off of actions in Asia
The Asian boroughs are experiencing a dramatic fall on Tuesday, even if the figures succeed in eliminating part of the losses during the day.
Hong Kong's Hong Kong bourgeois index loses four per cent during the exchanges, but later it loses part of the losses and reduces the decrease to almost 2.5 per cent.
The Hong Kong Stock Exchange Index Hong Seng China Enterprises following the move of Chinese shares lost 3.8 per cent, the markets are closed in Shanghai.
The actions of the Sydney Round were more than five per cent lost, but eventually the losses were reduced to 4.3 per cent.
According to its index, Taiwan's Bourgeois lost 3.6 per cent.
"The easing of the rescue action in the United States will affect the financial markets around the world," observed Joseph Yam, head of the Hong Kong Monetary Office.
Although Hong Kong is part of China, it has established its own monetary policy, i.e. independent of the Chinese central bank.
Interest rates in Hong Kong have the same level as in the United States.
According to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, US legislators should quickly resume negotiations and adopt the financial system support proposal.
On the other hand, it would be dangerous for other countries to be affected.
The blood stream of American actions
Monday, the House of U.S. representatives rejected the financial system support project, which would have to devote up to $700 billion (about 12 billion of Kč).
The legislators are thus calling for the support of President Bush's project.
According to Bush, the project should address the main causes of the financial crisis and help stabilize the whole economy.
American actions are taking place on Monday, a blood bath and the main action indicators are the biggest drop in the past 20 years.
The Dow Jones index was lost nearly seven per cent, having experienced a fall of such a disgrace for the last time in 1987.
The index was already lost during the vote, but when it appeared that the proposal was not adopted, it was free of charge.
Congress ceda: U.S. government can inject $700 billion into banks
The heads of the United States Congress and the government of President George W. Bush agreed on a broader form of financial assistance agreement in the US financial system.
It will be submitted to the vote at the beginning of next week.
American legislators have made a decisive turn in discussions on the adoption of a rescue plan in the form of a financial aid amounting to $700 billion (about 12 billion) granted to the US financial system.
Success is not so sure.
In fact, before being able to publish the final version of the law and submit it to the vote, Congressmen must complete a number of details of the agreement.
The support plan for the financial system will be considered on Monday at the House of Representatives.
It is said to the agency Reuters Barney Frank, chairman of the Board's banking and financial regulation committee.
According to sources, Wednesday should be the first to be held in the Senate.
According to economists, the announcement that the rescue plan will be adopted should be the first major psychological factor to weaken financial markets.
However, given the complexity of the mechanisms through which aid to markets can be effective, it will follow a "disillusionment".
Paulson: The plan must be effective
"We have made great progress.
We have settled our divergent views on the form that should have the package of measures to stabilize the market," according to the Blueberg Agency, Democrat Nancy Pelosi.
According to her, the final vote could be held on Sunday.
On Saturday evening, representatives of the legislators met with US Minister of Finance Henry Paulson to give the Government a final form.
It should acquire, to financial companies, real estate assets that lead to considerable losses and threaten the stability of the system as a whole.
"We are about to agree on a plan that will work and which must also be effective on the market.
We still need to continue this market recovery plan, but I think we are here," Paulson said.
A signal for Asian exchanges
The global financial crisis has significant impacts on the stock markets that fall.
According to the democratic senator Harry Reid, legislators make it possible for Congress to conclude a definitive agreement on Sunday.
They would therefore like to calm investors before the start of trade in Asian financial markets, which are located in the first time zone, where the decision of the Congress could have an impact on Monday's trade.
For the moment, however, it is impossible to specify with certainty when the two Houses of the American Congress will proceed to the vote, even if the negotiations are not likely to be blocked at the latest by such or such a problem.
The legislators hope it will be adopted in the days to come.
However, the law still has many changes.
The total amount allocated to the system shall be divided into two parts.
The first 350 billion dollars, as requested by President George Bush, must be made available as soon as possible.
However, if the Congress will have the impression that the programme does not fulfil its function, it has the possibility to block the grant of the remaining amount by two steps: first of all, the additional $100 billion, then, in order to end it, $350 billion.
Mr. Bush Salua made progress in the negotiations
While the President may vote in this decision, the Congress, to him, has the opportunity to bring it into the minority.
Despite these changes, the main idea of the programme, which was to obtain funds for the purchase of the bad estate securities, including the value of loss, was that hundreds of thousands of Americans were unable to pay their mortgages.
"All the work is done.
The House of Representatives should be able to proceed on Sunday to the vote of the law, and the Senate Monday," said Senator Judd Gregg.
American President George Bush himself enjoys progress in negotiations.
His spokesman Tony Fratto said that Mr. Bush was pleased with the progress made by the Saudis and appreciated "the shared effort to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy".
Delimitation of expensive parachutes
The President of the Senate's Senate's Chief Negotiator Christopher Dodd said that the legislators agreed on the responsibility of the financial programme, the protection of contributors to losses, the settlement agreement, and the time-action plan.
The new Act also provides for limiting these thresholds for directors of companies participating in the programme and establishes a committee which will ensure the supervision of the Fund.
The latter should be managed by the Ministry of Finance.
"We have worked very hard on the issue and have made important progress towards an agreement that will go and be effective for the market and for all Americans," said Paulson.
The plan also provides assistance for real estate owners, who have problems with payment.
The Government should negotiate new reports in the case of mortgages that it will buy, while reducing the monthly requirements of the debtor and allowing the latter to keep their homes.
Marek: Psychological help
According to Patria Finance Chief of Economics David Marek, the proposed plan is a good idea, but its implementation will be very difficult.
"And this is due to the fact that we are unaware of what the mechanism will be and the cost of getting assets into trouble.
This point will be determined to deal with the sharing of losses between the financial sector and the government," Marek said this week to the iHNed.cz server.
If the plan will be adopted now, or at the beginning of next week, it is not so important, according to Marek.
"It is much more important that Congressmen agree this week that they support this plan and that they will devote it as soon as possible.
This psychological significance of the agreement, providing for the adoption of the plan, is most important at this time," Marek stressed.
An intense struggle: MP3 players against mobiles.
We'll advise you how to choose.
While virtually all mobiles can read MP3 files, no MP3 player can call.
It seems clear that it is best to buy only one phone.
It does not prevent the existence of sufficient reasons for seeking an independent reader.
The choice depends entirely on the mode of use and requirements of the future owner.
It would be absurd to buy for the house a high-end phonograph to set up Maxim Turbulenc's new album.
On the other hand, such music products do not appear on vinyl discs, and from the point of view of quality, there is no objective reason for this to happen.
And if there's in your walls of pressed vinyl disks, with rock art, jazz or blues, you're probably dreaming at least of such a gramophone.
It is also music during the movements, i.e. compressed music, to say it in a simple way - music in MP3.
There are also categories based on price and quality.
For one thing, it may be unacceptable to spend eight thousand crowns for a reader, so that a Pink Floyd fan would have the wrong to support audiences bought for twenty crowns on the market.
There are two extremes, among which there is enough space for the whole world.
The choice is wide.
Battery life is also crucial
Some high-level music readers are capable of much more than a simple music reading, but this is of unknown features, of course, of most mobiles.
No current device is as universal as the phone.
Along with the first functions, telephone calls and text messages, it is able to read music and movies, to record them, it has a variable-quality camera and can, for example, until it is used for navigation.
And if you take it into account the smartphones and the communications, you'll have a small computer in your pocket.
Since no refrigerator knows how to grill the meat and no television will take photographs, we are actually looking at a miracle.
However, the universal character of the mobile is not inconsistencies.
The higher the number of functions you use is large, the more the interval between two recharges will be reduced.
And the reading of music is one of the most important energy havens.
There are few mobile phones that are able to read music for 10 to 12 hours, in most cases this number is very low.
In this regard, music readers (especially the most ruddy) are much more effective.
In the case of good-market mobiles, be aware that they will only play music for a few hours.
If, in addition, you are able to call from time to time, you will search for a second recharge for work - this is even valid for the most expensive devices.
This will not be a problem for MP3 readers, who are able, following a recharge, to continue operating for at least 9 hours, including less performance.
Another problem occurs when music is recorded on the mobile phone.
Unfortunately, a limited part of devices has a universal USB connection, so much more that not everyone can be directly connected to the computer without a special software.
Of course, you can record music directly on the memory card, but few card readers know how to take it without reducing it, given the minor dimensions of the memory cards used in mobile phones.
With regard to readers, you do not need any software except iPod.
It's enough to complete, through the USB connector, the music device from the computer.
Most mobiles and readers will create themselves a medium library classified according to the name of the interpreter, the title of the album, the style, or then after the user's judgment.
Some devices show only one index with a tree structure, such as Windows Explorer, others are capable of two (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smart phones with operating system).
Readers are easier to manipulate, mobiles have more know-how
In selecting a specific device, you are particularly interested in the life of the battery, the memory capacity, the quality and type of output of the device and, of course, the ease of the command.
If music is for you, essentially, a background noise and if in the day you are going to listen that for a limited period of time, for example by taking the tram, it's enough for you to read the MP3s.
Almost all mobile phones are capable today.
You are not even obliged to pay too much attention to the music formats that the mobile or reader is able to read.
Everyone gets to read the MP3s and the great majority of the music that will arrive until you have this format.
It is part of the most sophisticated formats, and besides it, the vast majority of the devices are also able to read WMA-format music.
The AAC (format used by Apple and its iPods) is less current than it does.
High-level mobiles also allow for, for example, online music purchases.
It is enough to visit the operator’s (or other supplier’s) website from the mobile phone and buy the song or album in question.
This service alone should be a convincing reason for seeking a musical cell phone.
The offer of operators is unfortunately poor and it is limited, in most cases, to fast-acting radio tubes.
Prices are no longer lower.
However, it is generally considered that this way of buying music (that is by GSM, Internet, Internet-free) will dominate the music industry in the future.
Most people always carry their mobile on their own.
Every time you want to hear something, you just have to get out of your pocket, while you forgot your MP3 player at home.
But it is also important if you have always on you listeners or a hand-free with connection.
If this is not the case, you can use the integrated inputs, which have practically all the mobiles, but a minimum MP3 players.
For many, the main advantage of music furniture is their price.
The lowest rates usually cost less than three thousand.
For a price of three four thousand crowns, a walkman can already be very convenient.
But in most cases you will be limited by the absence of exit for ordinary audiences.
The price of the best telephones and the best calls, also provided for ordinary audiences, does not exceed 15 miles.
The readers, on the other hand, have the advantage of having an easy command.
Surely anyone who comes to ensure the order of the most rude readers - who do not necessarily correspond to the least loved ones (see our choice).
A minimum of functions; and the similarity of the command with that of a cast post, which was used carefully in the past, or of a gramophone, is evident.
There is no risk of collision in the form of a mobile Internet that is blocked by hasard, followed by a huge data transmission factor.
The currently selected device
Even the most expensive mobiles (e.g. Vodafone 527) usually have a slot for interchangeable memory cards (type M2, microSD, and so on).
Even in view of the additional purchase of such a card, you will not exceed two thousand crowns.
But be careful.
Base models support in principle only cards with a maximum capacity of 2 GB.
Only the most expensive are even with 8 GB memory cards.
If you already have a mobile and you want to buy an MP3 player good market, take a Cowon, a Creative, a Sony, a Samsung, an Emgeton, or a well iriver.
Depending on the capacity (max. 2 GB), you must not spend more than 1 100 crowns.
If you are one of the most demanding auditors, choose the specialized walkman phones (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsung).
These devices are equipped with independent command buttons for MP3, and this is also the absence of the command from an independent MP3 player.
Sony Ericsson, whose mobiles in the walkman series have the same user menu as MP3 players sold separately, is the one that has gone the farthest in this area.
The same service, in the same price category, but with a memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and a higher life span (usually 15 hours, up to 35 hours) is ensured by a MP3 reader produced by one of the above mentioned brands.
A first virtual operator will win the Czech Republic this same year.
Maybe
The mobile market in Czechia is relatively advanced, and our operators offer practically the same services as their partners in Western Europe.
Nevertheless, we still lack something - a virtual operator, who would force classical operators to lower prices.
He may not be missing for a long time.
We have already mentioned, again and again, on Mobil.cz the fact that Czech operators are part of Europe's most dear ones.
The ČTU (The Czech Telecommunications Office), which reported that the price of a SMS was higher among us than in the rest of the Union, has also confirmed it.
Thus, since the last non-European Commission in the area of regulation of roaming charges, a paradoxical situation is likely to occur - the SMS sent abroad will be for some customers of Czech mobile operators less expensive than the country.
How is it possible for prices in Czechia to remain so high in comparison with Europe?
The answer is simple, there is no competition that would really want to get into the fight.
This may seem paradoxical, since we have even three mobile networks and a penetration that goes beyond 100%.
On the contrary, mobile operators like to complain that the Czech market is extremely competitive.
In this regard, Pavel Dvorák, President of the Czech Telecommunications Council (ČTÜ), who has stated several times that there was no room for another operator in Chequie, has been working with operators.
It is likely true that a classic operator with his own network does not appear to have much more chance (and he would now find it difficult to find the frequencies).
But there is another possibility - a virtual operator.
It is just the entry of virtual operators into the mobile market that has led to a considerable decline in prices, which should therefore also respond to classical operators.
However, even before the introduction of such issues as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile on the market, voices similar to those we hear today were allowed to be heard in Great Britain.
However, it appears that he remained there for such operators and that they could have a real success.
We are not obliged to go too far to find examples.
In February we informed you of the launch, in Poland, of the virtual mobileking operator.
In only six months, this operator has been able to win over 100 thousand customers and become the fifth operator of the country.
We add that behind the Mobilking there is the Penta financial group, which includes the U:fund in Czechia.
The advantage of virtual operators is the possibility of focusing on a much more specific target group.
In order to be effective, they need much less customers than a classic operator.
They are, in fact, excluding costs of construction, operation and entertainment from the mobile network, relatively high.
So in the world, virtual operators are described as low-cost operators - they offer calls and good-market SMS, which is often counterbalanced by a limited provision of services.
For example, Tesco Mobile offers SMS messages at least twice as expensive as its competitors in Great Britain.
But, as Mobilking's example shows in Poland, placing on an unusual target group can also be a good piece of advertising.
In fact, this operator specifically refers to men.
"The real men choose Mobileking - an operator that they can trust," said David Seibert, CEO of Mobile Entertainment Company, operating this virtual operator.
It is difficult to say, if such a concept could be possible to walk with us as well.
Miroslav Čepický, Vodafone's spokesman, in doubt: "The Czech market is relatively small for a segmentary approach, on which most virtual operators are based.
More than that, it is relatively satisfied with the point of view of the provision of services."
In Czechia, no chance, mobile operators say
However, it seems almost certain that if there is a virtual operator in Czechia, this will not be Mobilking.
"We are discussing the expansion of this project successfully, but in Chequia negotiations are not very encouraging.
The launch of Mobilking will instead take place in other countries in our area," Jana Studničková, spokesman for the Penta financial group, said in a telephone interview for Mobil.cz.
It thus indirectly confirmed that the operators in the Czech Republic were not, in any case, in favour of this idea.
On the contrary, they tried to do their best so that a potential competitor could not appear.
The GTS Novera group, which would thus launch a new step towards becoming a real Telefonika competitor in the field of business customers, does not hide its intention to launch a virtual mobile operator for a long time.
"We have much to be able to offer our customers not only fixed telecommunications services but also mobile ones.
And soon it'll be the best.
We have already made negotiations on this possibility several times with all Czech mobile operators.
With some, we have made progress in the negotiations," said the spokesman for the Paul Kaidl group.
So the future may be promising.
According to non-official information, it seems that we might be able to welcome the first virtual operator already at the end of the year.
But for the moment, its creation is accompanied by total silence.
"At this point, we do not think there is any place on the Czech market for a virtual operator as such.
The Czech market is comparable to other very specific ones.
For the moment, no complex and serious project in this area has contacted us," said Vlastimil Sršeń of the Department of Press of Telefonika O2 in his statement to Mobil.cz.
Other operators are also related to the specificity of the Czech market.
The T-Mobile spokesman Martina Kemrová says in a rare agreement with O2: "We have not registered for the viable and bilaterally advantageous project moment, which could serve as a basis."
And she adds: "It's practically excluded that a virtual operator appears on the T-Mobile network at the end of the year.
In order to operate within such a limited period of time, we should now have a concrete agreement."
Vodafone rather than focussed on meeting the requirements to obtain its own 3G licence.
Miroslav Čepicky says in this regard: "We are open to negotiations with potential virtual operators, especially in the area of shared costs and infrastructure.
That's what we think means most of our customers' views.
Vodafone's main strategy in this area is the discovery of a partner to set up a common network for a fast mobile internet."
The responsible authorities: in phase with operators
The start of mobile operators is easy to understand, the entry of another operator would mean an increase in competition, would lead to a lower price and therefore a lower benefit.
So what's the best thing to do to facilitate the advancement of such a competitor?
When it comes to their interests, operators know how to understand themselves as we fly. The Chinese accompanying the creation of the U:fund also testifies.
The biggest apparent pressure on the ČTU at the time of the U:fund was carried out by T-Mobile company.
It provides information available to the public from the CTU web pages.
Today, however, the U:fund is ready to serve as an argument so as not to accept a virtual operator.
Martina Kemrová noted on this subject: "The competition on the mobile market has been, moreover, recently expanded by the entry into the market of a fourth mobile operator.
Given the character of the mobile market in RT, it is clear that the entry of an additional player would subject him, and in particular his services, to high requirements."
However, given the attitude of mobile operators as shown here, the independence of the Czech regulatory bodies appears to be confusing.
However, this is not just the attitude of the CTU, which, unlike Britain and other developed countries, does not unfortunately have the power to intervene in economic competition in Chechnya.
It belongs exclusively to the Office for the Protection of Economic Competition (UOHS).
But the latter adopts, facing this problem, its typical position.
"The entry of a virtual operator into the mobile market would be possible following the conclusion of an agreement between a mobile operator and the virtual operator in question regarding the rental of the necessary infrastructure.
No such agreement has been concluded for the moment because the offer of potential interests has not given sufficient priority to the benefit of the class operators," Kristian Chalupa of the UOHS Department of External Relations explained in response to our question.
A statement thus made would not be surprised by the representatives of the operators.
But on the one hand, which must represent the interests of consumers and also take care of one another, as long as no one takes advantage of its position on the market, such a statement is more than misleading.
More than Kristián Chalupa adds: "In addition, where virtual operators are usually present, it can be noted that their entry into the market has contributed to a low price of mobile telephone services."
However, making pressure in the sense of fair functioning of the market and low prices does not appear to be part of the interests of the ÚOHS.
What is really shocking is the almost touching agreement of the three mobile operators, which stems from their reactions.
The question, if it's really a mess, is all of a sudden.
Similarly, a price of strictly identical essence to all service stations is certainly due to the hazard and hard fight against competition.
"The office has not, therefore, identified signs of anticompetitive behaviour, nor has it any reason to intervene in any way or in any other way.
None of the operators have a dominant position, therefore no corresponding responsibility for their behaviour on the market increases.
The tools needed to open the mobile market to virtual operators are probably missing even the telecom controller," Chaloupa stated in his statement.
The interpretation of the dominant position on the market is one of many points of dispute.
Of course, there is an analysis of the relevant markets developed by the CTU, which provides telecommunications, from the point of view of economic competition, one market.
None of the Czech operators have a dominant position on such a market.
However, some legal experts offer a different view of things: for the creation of a virtual operator to be possible, the consent of the network operator must be obtained at any time.
And the mobile operator has logically enough monopole on his network.
This is how he must play a dominant role in a certain segment of his activity.
However, even without this argument, it should be at least concerned that three mobile operators are acting in a similar way.
However, the complaints of many interested parties (including GTS Novera, mentioned above) show that they face similar constraints in negotiations with all operators.
Responsibilities on the ČTU are quite current in the communications, by which the ÚOHS washes the hands of the case.
We have already met this kind of attitude in several similar cases.
Unfortunately, there has been no success in modernising the Law on Telecommunications recently adopted an increase in the powers of the CTU in the field of economic competition in telecommunications, although many experts have promised to improve the situation.
This is what the representatives of the OOHS need to know very well, but their interests appear to be on the other side.
When no one looks, it can go
That said, the operation of a kind of virtual pseudo operators, several in the Czech mobile networks, remains undisputed.
It is companies that publish their own mobile phone service price list, but these are only partially published.
In most cases, it is the issue of firms dealing with multi-level marketing.
Private mobile telephone services are thus offered by Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and many others.
The price lists of these firms generally reach only elections.
The magic tour consists of the fact that the company does before the operator is a classic customer company, which orders a large number of SIM cards.
As an important customer, it receives special (and other) offers.
The problem is that the commercial conditions of all Czech mobile operators prohibit such a return.
"If this happened, it could be a breach of the contractual conditions that we will consider and which could result in an end to cooperation with the company in question," answered our question on this issue, Martina Kemrová.
However, it is quite unlikely that an outcome of such activity would not have been achieved until mobile operators were responsible.
In particular, in the case of the three companies mentioned above, thousands of customers may be involved.
No operator shall, however, object to such a procedure.
In fact, the activities of these firms result in non-exhaustive benefits and, at the same time, contrary to veritable virtual operators, they do not threaten them at all with their own official marketing.
Miroslav Čepický points out the possible problems: "The law allows such specifications, however, the services of these companies are only used by a percentage of non-reliable customers.
In addition, they are obliged to admit that the SIM card in their phone is not registered by their name, so they cannot fully make it available to ordinary customers of mobile operators."
But that is exactly what should seem strange to the CTU.
In addition, another issue is raised at the UOHS.
If operators are constantly moving their eyes to such a procedure, why do they block the creation of a virtual operator?
It is necessary to add that the OHS has relatively broad powers to carry out such activities, and if it does not wish to be satisfied with the operator's explanations, which claim there is no idea that this would happen, their contractual conditions prohibit it.
When We Are No Longer Country
As we have already mentioned several times, the entry of virtual operators into the mobile market has led to a considerable decline in the price of services.
In almost every country where virtual operators appeared, however, classical operators tried to prevent their creation.
The arguments used by these parties were practically the same - a very small market, too content, problems with quality services, etc.
However, it is precisely at this level that regulatory bodies have been involved in developing countries, not in the interests of mobile operators, but in their clients.
Both by formal measures and by informal pressure, they have completed the creation of a first virtual operator followed by others.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulatory bodies are dealing with this issue in the way of a hot soil pump that is depleted by the transfer of it to a nearby target.
Based on our experiences, we cannot escape the impression that confusion in their competences is more than beneficial in these cases.
But we don't miss it after the cognac.
If the coulse information is true and a virtual operator will soon appear with us, the Czech mobile market may be moving.
If one of the operators has accepted the creation of a virtual mobile operator, the UOHS can only be difficult to cope with the rejection (to discrimination) of other stakeholders.
And we may stop calling more than in the rest of Europe.
The new hymne check has four new versions.
Choose the best
Listen to the four achievements of the new version of the Czech national hymn.
On Sunday, on the day of the Czech Nationality Day, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek regularly presents the new records of my national humne kde doov (Where is my country?).
The hymn was reregistered by the Orchestra of the National Theatre under the direction of Jírí Bélohlávek.
We have four versions - with a solo song male or female, an interpretation with a heart and an instrumental version.
The song is secured by Katerín Knezínková et Adam Plachetka.
Otakar Jeremiaš and Jaroslav Krček are the authors of the Hymne Arrangements.
You can listen to the four new versions on the iHNed.cz server.
Bélohlävek considers the Czech national song as one of the most beautiful hymns.
As he had previously entrusted Český rzhlas (the Czech public radio), he chose to interpret solo versions of the singers with young and representative voices, which are marked and appreciated.
"From the beginning, I tried to make sure that the two singers, as well as the heart, had a good speech, so that we understand the words, that they sing simultaneously," he explained.
The Czech national hymn, the next year, is 175th anniversary.
The song Kde doov was first held in 1834 on the plates of Stavovské divadlo (the State Theatre) in Fidlovačka (Kermesse des savetiers), originally Czech piece by Josef Kajetán Tyl, accompanied by the music of František Škroup.
It has become popular and people have suddenly made it appropriate.
After the creation of Czechoslovakia in 1918, the first couple naturally became an integral part of the national hymn.
It will remain one of seven national symbols even after the establishment of the independent Czech Republic.
How the new hymne sound
The common transport (MHD) will introduce, Wednesday, the powder into their ticket system.
Wednesday, 1 October 2008, will be included in the history of Pražský Dovravní pondnik (the Prague Transport Agency) as the date when the first passengers will be mounted in the Metro, trams and buses, which, instead of having a paper ticket, will have an electronic coupon in their pocket.
At this time, this is available for nearly a hundred thousand people, owners of the Opencard Pocket Card.
Passengers can buy a 30-day or 90-day coupon (that will be valid from 1 January 2009) and both register it on the spot card in the information points and offices of the Dovravní businessnik (the Transport Agency), located at the Metro stations Museum, Móstek, Nádraží Holešovice, Andël, Roztyly, Letnány, Kobylisy, Rajská zahrada, Kacherov and Luka.
Since yesterday, there has also been the possibility of buying coupons online on the web pages of the Shipping Company: www.dpp.cz.
More than four hundred people benefited from the service during the morning.
Those who start using the online store can definitely forget the cookies in the metro stations, where they have so far had to be impatient in long distances in order to obtain paper tickets.
In fact, they will buy their coupon online and record it on their Opencard card in one of the thirteen Mästká knivna (municipal libraries).
"In these points of contact, there is a guide available to passengers with a trained staff, which will help those interested in buying online and will also record the couple they bought on their card," said project spokesman Martin Opatrný.
Along with libraries, it will also be possible to record electronic copies on Opencard in automatic distributors installed in several metro stations.
What do these distributors look like?
They are red, reminding machines to record tickets and passengers that have already been marked in Roztyly, Budějoviká, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská stations.
"Today, the city has five, but by the end of the year, it should have four-to- twenty," Opatrny added.
A car will check the coupon at the driver's place
Cars that will work from morning to morning are easy to use.
It's enough to enter the opencard card and the previously purchased coupon will register itself on the card.
Electronic coupons are valid from tomorrow not only in the capital but also in the city's surroundings.
Learn from the Periurban trains and bus lines 300-499, which mainly use residents of the central Bohem communities to access capital.
"In integrated trains in Pražská integrováná transporta (integrated transport from Prague), controllers are equipped with card readers, helping them to establish temporary and regional validity of the coupons," explained the control of the Fili Drápal tickets of the Ropid organization, which is responsible for the time of common freight transport.
Periurban buses are equipped with integrated card readers at the driver’s box.
It is therefore necessary not only to show the driver's seat card, but also to place the Opencard at the place indicated on the side of the box.
It is also the driver who controls the validity of registered coupons.
"Where the passenger needs to verify the validity of registered couples, there is nothing more simple than to ask the driver for this information," Drapal adds.
Passengers who do not take the Periurban buses and will not remember the date on which their partner's validity expires may re-unite automatic distributors, initially used to record the coupons on the map.
This is where, on the screen of the device, information on the validity of their document will be displayed.
The Sudanese claimed a referendum to the United States
In 1945 the Germans of the Soviet Union requested that Shumava be integrated into the United States.
This comes from a letter placed in the collections of the Jihočeská vedecká knivna (The Scientific Library of the South Boheme).
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, at least we want to live under the pattern of the United States of America.
In 1945, certain groups of the Suddeuts were deliberately addressed to the President of the United States with such a desire.
This comes from another letter preserved in a private archive, which is now deposited in the collections of the Jihočeská vedecká knyovna.
From the Germans of Český Krumlov the President of the United States writes that "shuumavská župa" (forest region south of Boheme) - annexed by Hitler under the Munich agreement - should be returned to Czechoslovakia.
"We have a clear understanding of the situation and want to be sure that the words proclaim that the American troops are coming on the German territory, not to oppressors and enemies, but to liberators," is written in the letter "People whose heart is the sort of Shumava".
Given that the relationship with Czechoslovakia is not supposed to be promising - knowing the Czech national character - but of brutality, openness, incompetence, oppression and service, the authors of the letter urge the US President to take into his hands the protection of Shumava for now and forever.
"We cannot believe that you will give this territory to a foreign State, which oppresses and destroys minorities and which has contributed nothing to the victory of the Allies without taking into account the opinion of the quarter million inhabitants," the letter says.
The supposed reason why authors cannot sign the letter is the fear of the desire for revenge by "cheque oppressors".
If the President of the United States doubted the opinion of the Germans of Shumava, he would have to arrange, according to the authors of the letter, a referendum in the region to determine whether his people wanted to be part of the United States, or to live under the U.S. patronage.
Although the text contained in the letter may, given the current knowledge of post-war history, appear somewhat naive, some survivors say it well illustrates the expectations of the Germans of the Southerners of the period.
While the Czech Germans had to at least intervene that the issue of their expulsion from the Republic would be raised, very few of them had such an opportunity.
Some expected the United States and Great Britain to obtain some kind of autonomy for the Soviets.
Others thought they would just stay in Czechoslovakia.
The famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, born in České Budějovice, confirmed it.
During the war, he was, as České Budějovice's Germany, engaged in the sea in the Baltic States.
At the end of the war, he was captured by the English and placed in the Holstein concentration camp, and dozens of Czech Germans came to see him to learn the Czech language.
"They believed that once they returned home, their check would be profitable," said Chalupa.
None of the Germans captured who lived in Czechoslovakia before the war, he said, did not appreciate that, following the Benez Decrees, he would be expelled from the Republic.
You don't think about it - your money!
An emotional campaign will attack drivers
The most expensive road safety action in Czech history.
One way to characterise the emotional media campaign is to launch, Wednesday, the Ministry of Transport.
Minister Aleš Rébiček's office believes it will discourage drivers of dangerous behaviour on the flight.
This 150 million campaign will appear on television, radio, cinema, on the Internet, but also on tracts.
It should discourage drivers from driving fast and alcohol on the flight.
But also remind them to take the centrifuge before starting.
In particular, it wants to touch the conscience of young drivers, fashions, pets, without forgetting professional drivers.
What's going to appear in the spots?
Especially personal stories that will attack emotions.
It also testifies to the slogan "sangling" of the entire campaign:
You don't think about it - your money!
The phrase "You don't think" is included in upper case on the registration plate.
Then, in a blood bottle, there's the phrase "You bastards."
What must be symbolized is that we can pay it from life a moment's attention.
The spots will "stop" the spectators until 2010.
The ministry has been inspired by similar campaigns in Anglo-Saxon countries, where images can be seen in combination with dramatic images of the victims of accidents.
He believes that this will lead to a decrease in the incidence of accidents and deaths on the Czech roads.
The spots were prepared by the Euro RSCG agency.
The Sugar and Foet Strategy Against Drivers
"What goes with drivers is the sugar and cheese system.
For them, sugar is represented by, for example, by winning time when they smell red fire.
It's the threat of an ammonia or an accident.
The risks must be recalled to drivers," says Martin Kořán, hospital transport psychologist Na Homolce.
That's how we need information campaigns in the press and, above all, negative advertising, he likes psychology.
Panels reporting the danger to drivers are, according to him, already less effective.
"When a static panel that protects against a danger is installed, it will probably soon merge with the environment and drivers will no longer notice it," Kořán reports.
Olmert would bring peace to almost all occupied territories
Ehud Olmert, the President of the Israeli Interim Government, made a statement in favour of the return of practically all the territories occupied in 1967, including the West Jordan, Jerusalem and the heights of the Golan, in exchange for peace with Palestine and Syria.
He made this statement in an interview published Monday by the daily Yedioth Ahronoth.
"We must conclude an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that it will be necessary to make almost all territories (worked), to want everyone," Olmert said every day.
"We will keep a certain percentage of the territory, but we will have to give Palestinians a similar percentage (from the Israeli territory), because without it, peace will not be done," he added.
He admits that the possible restoration would mean Jerusalem-Est.
"He who desires security in Jerusalem, and above all he who does not want tractors and bulldozers to break his feet, as this has happened to one of my best friends, will have to give up to the parts of Jerusalem," Olmert noted, referring to the two attacks in the city in July, when several people were killed and dozens of wounded.
According to the Prime Minister, it will be necessary to find "a special solution for the Temple Mount, the sacred and historical places" within the Old City.
"The one who wants to maintain Israeli sovereignty throughout the city will be forced to integrate 270 000 Arabs.
It won't go away," he then emphasized.
Retirement of Golan heights
Olmert also speaks in favour of Israel's withdrawal from the Golan Mountains, which he considers to be an indispensable condition for the conclusion of a peace agreement with Syria.
That would also require some efforts by Damascus.
"I do not propose to conclude peace with Syria only on the basis of a Golan retirement," he said.
"The Syrians know very well what they will have to give up in order to get the Golan.
They will have to give up their current relations with Iran; they will have to give up their relationship with Hezbollah (the Chinese movement); they will have to give up their constant support for Hamas (the Chinese movement), Al-Kaida (the terrorist network), and Jihad (the holy war) in Iraq," the Prime Minister explained.
Questions arising after the accident: Are the Stewards in the Car illegal?
The law ignores them; walking in a long distance car is forbidden
In the context of the tragic car accident of the Student Agency near Padoue, Italy, the question arises whether Stewards and passengers can move within the car.
"If the law was to be strictly and formal, the activity of a Steward is contrary to the road traffic law," said the spokesman of the Department of Transport Karel Hanselka.
The accident in question, during which a 22-year-old guest died, was apparently caused by the driver of a truck that crossed the road.
The young girl was at this point unfortunately seated next to the driver, on the most dangerous seat of the vehicle, although she had two other seats.
But the car can have an accident, it wants to freeze in a harsh way, also when the Steward uses coffee or distributes the newspapers.
What matters is whether the car is in line with its technical file equipped with locations or not.
If this space equipment is not initially approved, passengers must remain seated.
The long distance coaches Student Agency do not have any places to go; what has been confirmed in Aktualná.cz by the company director Radim Jançura.
"It is a question we have dealt with with the ministry and at first it prohibits the movement of passengers.
Then they canceled it and we found that passengers could go to the toilets during the journey on condition that they had their own seat," he explained his position.
The law ignores the Steward
"There is no single legal interpretation of the role of Stewart - no legal requirement is involved in this role.
On the other hand, no legal requirement no longer prohibits the carrier from offering services.
The Road Transport Act only knows the time limit for the vehicle reception; it does not define its rights and duties," adds Hanselka's spokesman with more ambiguity.
Josef Pokorny, director of the Department of Road Traffic, on the contrary, considers that the law is sufficiently problematic.
"All depends on the fact that the car has the right to offer pre-posts in its approval.
Everyone stay there," he said.
Cars are divided into urban areas, where there are low-speed parking spaces and limited maximum speed, interurbans with high-speed and high-speed and long-distance long-distance buses with the highest-distance and seating facilities equipped with safety belts.
Like in the plane, says an expert
Jaroslav Horín, expert at BESIP (Secure of Road Traffic) in transport safety, does not see the movement of steers on board as a major problem.
"In regular traffic there is no danger. The situation can be compared to that of service in aircraft.
Besides, it's not sure when a disturbance occurs and the air's host can be picked up."
"Now, in case the car was broke in a rough way, the laws of physics would obviously be valid.
In the same way as in a urban bus or tram.
The carrier must manage the safety of the Stewards by internal requirements," he said and also considers that from the point of view of the law, the problem is not resolved.
Jancúra is ready to delete these services
Student Agency is the only car carrier to offer Stewards services.
He's got two hundred.
Even after this accident, the Director does not consider them to be a risk meth.
"However, as long as I have the impression that it is a risk measure, I will remove it.
Passengers can receive their coffee and their magazine on board.
This would also reduce costs," he said.
Security concerns are the reason why Stewards are absent in their vehicles, the director of Asiana Alexei Litvine, who ensures, in comparison with SA, a very low number of lines.
"We don't have any hosts. We've been fighting since the beginning.
Soon or later it will end by a fatal accident," he said, a year ago, in Týden.cz.
An enormous tragedy has occurred
A young hotel in the Plzeň region, which has been working for society for two years, has died of an accident on the Naples line.
A Slovenian truck probably left the emergency stop band without using clining and blocked the road to the car.
The driver of this last attempt to avoid it by means of a dirty manoeuvre, but he violated it by his right hand.
Jancúra refuses to sell the two seats reserved for the home of the Stewards.
"In the case of long lines, it is not possible to book these places, they are blocked."
The company intends to complain against the driver of the truck.
For the destruction of the family of the young girl, the agency will not wait for the court's judgment, but with regard to financial compensation, it will also rely on the spouse.
A change in the law?
No view
An amendment of the law, which has been being drawn up for more than a year by a group of thirty experts from the Ministry of Transport, could provide clarifications on the movement of drivers on board the car.
"Or, she has not reached any conclusion on this point.
In fact, she is not too interested in buses, but rather to the system of points, the maximum speed on the road and the use of the laptop on the flight," said expert Horín.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activities of the Stewards as a major threat to the safety of passengers," concludes the Hanselka spokesman, stating that road safety control is under the authority of the police and the security office at work.
The hopes of the Düsseldorfis are based on Frankfurt.
The large words were not missing in the letter addressed by the WestLB Steering Committee to the domestic employees.
From a union of entities of the Düsseldorf financial institution with the Deka-Bank de Frankfurt, "the central financial market institution of the Parkasse financial group" could be, according to the public meeting on Monday.
The WestLB would bring a double "competence block" of sustainable productivity in such a case.
However, such a relationship could be the decisive cut to other concentrations in the banking sector of the Landers.
It looks what it looks like when a steering committee has to demonstrate its ability to act in difficult times.
Because WestLB, injured, is always under intense pressure.
This is not only the European Commission, but also the Federal Authority for the Supervision of Financial Services, which has only recently made it clear to the Government of North-Westphalia that time was involved in seeking a future solution.
However, it has been a long time - also on the side of Frankfurt - of a relationship between the Deka bank, who knew the customers of the Sparkasse by their investment funds, and the WestLB.
Some of the Deta-Bank Franz Waas's head made it clear when he presented the figures at the end of August that he saw no sense in the merger of the house of the Landstrasse Mainzer with a bank of Land, whether Helaba or WestLB.
However, the Deca Management Board, which is supported every half by the Lander banks and by savings fund groups, has been responsible for conducting talks with WestLB for joint commercial activities.
It could then be the debt of the financial market, or parts of it.
However, the speakers are only beginning, it is said in the financial place.
This is not the first time that the Deta-Bank, with its 3000 employees, has an account for one of the most important employees in Frankfurt's financial place, among other things when it comes to the consolidation of the savings fund sector.
In 2003 it was believed that the Deta-Bank could merge with the Bank of Rehenie Palatinat and Halbab.
However, nothing comes from this earthly hole.
However, the plans had been made public that the Government of Hesse had spoken against any participation of Hellaba in them.
As a result, the other two houses were no longer reunited.
The Bank of the Land of Rhenanie Palatinat was attached to the Bank of Bade-Wuttenberg in Stuttgart.
But there have always been new treaties on the regrouping of the Deka-Bank with banks in Länder.
Finally, Günther Merl, Chairman of the Steering Committee of Hellaba, was, however, against any commercial merger strategy with its bank.
Regardless of this, it appears that the integration of the different public sector institutions seems to be particularly urgent.
Now that the election to the Parliament of the State of Bavaria has passed, a BayernLB union with the Bank of the State of Bade-Wuttenberg could be concrete at first sight.
For Helaba, this is not particularly good news.
If the pressure to new mergers should increase, the potential partners will be less likely to escape it.
In the South, she would now be a junior partner, although she had so far been better opposed to the crisis than Munich and Stuttgart banks.
The grouping of Hesse-Thuringe savings and ventures, which has 85 percent of Helaba's capital, has, in turn, pulled a wire at the beginning of the year on every union with WestLB.
The NorthLB would remain in the cold.
However, such geo-strategic thinking reflects only one of the faces.
Another facet asks how the different commercial models of each of these banks can arise.
In June, Merl stated that the decisive issue, namely, by means of which commercial model of the future capacity of the Land banks should be ensured, had not been resolved until it was resolved by the German group of savings and operations.
In the end, a WestLb depression may have taken place, a depression which is obviously not desired here.
This is also what is asked in the letter of the Committee on the Rules of Procedure: in any case, a 'global solution' would be provided for the establishment.
How all of this will be put in the same panel with the union of certain entities with the Deta-Bank remains to be seen.
The second weekend of the beer festival is also known as the Italian weekend.
For Elena, it's the first time, for Luca the third or fourth time already.
But this time, Elena accompanys her as a little friend, and so nothing is the same, he says.
Behind them, near a tonne of five litres of beer from the Kaiser brand, there is a well-constructed barbu that shows about 200 visitors from the beer festival what deep sounds its king can produce.
Elena tap first Luca, then hug it.
From Bologna, they've come to Verone.
From there, from the road station near the new Porta station, four buses take off this evening at 23h45, 'Destinction Monaco, festa della birra', arrived at 6h30.
Three buses are reserved first for Italians, in one of the buses traveling exclusively from Brazil.
In a corner of the parking lot, the South Americans sing gold and already next to their dress, they have already celebrated the last night.
And also bridesmaids, explains Marco Guarda, it's not for the Italians.
The buses belong to Marco, which carries a long double handle of false furs and moonlights on large silver mountains.
For five years, they've been going to the beer party, already three rounds of nothing else than this year.
They leave at night, stay the day at the party, and return at 2230.
That night would involve unnecessary costs, explains Marco.
The 75-euro journey, including the welcome port with a Kaiser beer, was reinforced in accordance with the Bavarian Cleaning Act, the disease insurance and a German-speaking group member - Marco made a language course in Frankfurt.
And the buses are already on the road at night on the "Brennero" direction.
There's no beer, there's no beer yet.
Soon, everything gets quiet on the bus, the passengers sleep.
It's better this way, they'll still need their strength.
Holidays will take place in Bressanone and Holzkirchen, while a large number of other buses with Italian registration plates once again take a break before Munich on road 8.
When Marco's group finally arrives at six o'clock in the early morning as planned on the parking lot near Therèse, about 50 other buses from all over Europe are already there.
Elena, Luca and the others are together, Marco has a final speech, explains the attack plan.
First: it's covered with the small yellow casket.
It is written on the left 'Birth Festival', in Gothic, and on the side of Marco's travel agency's internet address `conscersivaggiado.it".
Second: 'When the doors of the head of the branch are open, we'll call Marco in the early morning.
'Run!' Run and book the places at the bottom of the tent.
'Go ahead, or we'll block it, and not all the yellow boxes on the same banks, you have to distribute them into the room!'
The hat, cry Marco, costs 8.25 euros.
And don't forget the sign!
Show the security officers that we behave well!
After you leave your places, they're part!'
Thirdly: 'In the evening, you came back here at ten and a half hours!' Understand?
And that's it, it's part of the beer party.
On the road, one of the new juicy caskets on trees to find the road, panels and even an electoral display of a large popular Bavarian party.
We have to be ready for the return.
It's the second weekend of the beer festival, known as the 'week-end of the Italians'.
There are no specific figures; there are 50,000 people on the way through the Alps and are buried in the beer kitchen, 10 percent of visitors would come from Italy this weekend.
The municipal police are strengthened by seven South Tyrol police officers, by Italian volunteers who support the Bavarian Red Cross, who carry out statistics on countries where Italians take the first place in front of the British (60 interventions) and Austrians (about 80) with nearly 200 medical interventions.
What is particularly appreciated by the Italians is the try of the Hofbräu Brasserie.
Nights of Insomnia for Hypo Real Estate shareholders
The German banking system was relatively stable, and the Federal Minister of Finance insisted only a few weeks ago.
What a chance the politician had to use the word 'relatively' and he thought that the German banking sector would not be separated from the crisis movements.
That's actually happening this weekend.
The financer of the Bavarian estate Hypo Real Estate (HRE), near DAX, receives from a German bank consortium a loan of a billion to protect from market turbulence.
One person in the confidence of the situation told Reuters Monday that aid appropriations are delivered up to EUR 35 billion.
Hypo Real State should now pay interest on the fraction to which it is entitled.
Money comes from both private banks and public law banks.
In the background, it's the Defa daughter company that supports the losses.
The state financer was, according to a newspaper article, very short-term funding for long-term projects for which he had borrowed money - which is no longer possible since the fact that the market was unfair.
In the first half of 2008, the bank's liquidity reserve had been reduced by 95 per cent to 2.37 million euros, and the net capital rate had also slightly decreased from 1.6 to 1.45 per cent.
The current and net benefits from financial transactions were, in relation to the same period, zero-to-zero, the benefits resulting from the allocation of fixed credit and securities as well as the realisation of provisions in credit operations were more than 70 per cent to 5 million euros.
And it is only thanks to the important benefits of the reimbursement of accounting costs from the restructuring of the former Defa Group, as well as the reimbursement of interest under the book of fiscal procedures and commercial purchases for Societies that the deficit of about 16 per cent has been moderated.
After its privatization in 1990, the former state financial institution had at first been miscellaneous about real estate industrial credits, which were then co-financed to the Aareal bank.
Since the funding of the classical state was not profitable enough, the Defa was then more committed to infrastructure projects and to the financing of joint projects between private and state investors (Privat-Public-Partnership, PPP) and internationally diversified.
On the value of the girl company, the Hypo Real Estate should be subjected to amortizations that should have an essential material effect on the calculation of the gains and losses of the group, which remain quite flat.
The fact is, the dividends have been amputated.
Already in 2007, they had been recruited to two thirds.
The Real Estate Hypo has been a very important state and infrastructure investor since the collapse of the Depfa.
It is stronger than other institutions that are dependent on refinancing on the interbank market because it has no customer deposit.
With the failure of the Lehman Brothers Investment Bank two weeks ago, the allocation of loans between banks was a significant new rate, which had accumulated their liquidity.
The Hypo Real Estate needs for a part - about 50 billion euros - of all the credits of the Defa in a short-term funding.
According to a Hypo Real State communication, the group's funding needs are covered by the medium-term credit and the firm's protection against the impact of international financial markets widely outside the current market status.
Other sources say that the refinancing would be ensured through the funds by the end of 2009.
The Chairman of the HRE Steering Committee, George Funke, explained that the Hypo Real Estate Group should no longer be involved in medium-term financial markets.
The Federal Bank and the Financial Services Surveillance Authority (Bafin) are beginning with the principle that the capacity of the Real Hypo group on the market is now ensured.
The bank's shareholders and creditors have nothing more to hope for.
However, in view of the dynamic and impotence of the crisis, there is no certainty.
Moreover, it is not unlikely that it will not be able to make use of funding throughout its scope.
But the opposite can no longer be separated.
Since the bank is still at the door of the insolvency at the end of the evening, it will not be able to provide the spirit at least provisionally.
The course of action rose from 75 per cent to 3.30 euros.
The courses of obligations, on the other hand, are particularly good.
While debt to the first head has been severely reduced, second-level loans are declining.
The most affected are the investment funds of the former Württemberg Hypo girl company and the well-known ones who have lived longer than 2009.
The obligations of the Hypo Real State bank seemed to be an alternative speculative investment, now their value should be considered to be dependent on the stability of the international banking system after the net collapse of the banking crisis and the crisis of the institution itself which led to the crisis in the establishment of the Defa bank.
While the less affected emission institutions, Governments and commercial banks are still ready to support the system, time-limits can be assumed.
Or it will happen what no one can expect at this time - that the financial crisis can be overcome in the next 15 months.
But in the face of renewed storms of partial nationalization, the probability of approaching certainty is now becoming a simple basis for hope.
This should be reserved at night for long-term creditors on the decision to decide whether they should separate from their commitments.
Short-term investors can always use this on which they have drawn up a contract to make a report of losses for the next few years on the tax on income from the capital of automatically acquired profits.
Sylvana and the secrets of the bottle in Bento
When Sylvana Hiltrop, 16 years old, has to be present for the first day at Tachibana High School, the girls start laughing: Germany is so "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana already knew this word thanks to the Mangas - in her new Exchange Log, she speaks from Japan.
"The first day of the race in Japan.
That's what I was excited about.
I was scared already to go to school.
I live in Tokyo's suburbs in the direction of Kawasaki and take the train 40 minutes to Tachibana High School.
I've got to find my way alone. I'm glad I haven't lost myself.
The start of the courses does not seem to be as strict as that of us in Basse-Saxe.
The students appeared after each other from eight hours until at least nine o'clock, a table tour begins with the professor, the "human room".
But before the course started, I had to introduce myself.
I am not of any kind to talk to people, especially to a class of 40 students.
As I had not yet completed school uniforms, I put an old pocket of my mother's home, as well as a shirt, blue-mountain shoes and black leather shoes.
In this case, I was introduced to the doll, and I tried to say the right thing: 'Sayonara Wo she Sylvana...' - I'm called Sylvana, I'm from Germany and my birthday is in a week.
At the time, I was very happy to have started learning the language two years ago.
The 31 girls in the class did all the low-mixes, smiles and signs, and I have always heard the word "Kawaii".
I already knew it through my hands.
It belongs to the vocabulary that is essential for the survival of Japanese bears and means "mignon, chau".
Then I'm quick to jump into my place.
The girl next to me made me a big ironic smile, and she thought it was an honor that the corresponding had to sit next to her.
The rest of the time was quite calm, but when the gong came back, I was tempted by the rules.
The world was talking to what was best, could laugh and asked many questions - in this case, it is quite difficult to understand English.
During the break, they all left their Bento.
My mother-in-law had also done this kind of Lunchbox - it's really something other than the poor Germans.
I had rice for aromatic herbs, small sauces, a condom and algae salad, fruits and a kind of meat surrounded by Tofu.
Most of the time, I have no idea what I'm eating right here in Japan.
Things have a unique appearance and a completely new taste.
What's sure is that everything's really good.
Well, except for the trusted paid money, brrrrrrrr!
The Bentos are not just lunchers in Japanese schools.
Sometimes a girl offers a Bento boy who she has prepared herself, and who is then particularly prepared - in the hope of making the boy know a little bit better during the break.
I've read it in my sleeves.
I'm curious to know if I can see it here too.
"Why Japan in particular?" my friends asked me when I told them I wanted to spend a year at school in Tokyo.
So I always answered:
"Because it's bothering me, what"
In the end, reading manganese is what I've preferred for years.
And in order to better understand the manga and culture that once existed, I also began to learn Japanese.
For me, it was very clear that I had to travel there one day.
Because I'm also weak for traditions, customs and customs.
And here, they're given a lot of importance.
On the other hand, Japan is the country of the latest technologies and trends - on the other hand, it is severe, disciplined and traditional.
And as everything is well organized, I've never felt lost here, even though Tokyo is the largest city I've ever seen."
The rats also have feelings
A rat or a cat was in danger, does that mean he feels too scared?
The neurophysicist Joseph LeDoux is convinced: many animals also have feelings.
But how can we make sure that he tries the same thing when he behaves the same way we do?
In the online magazine "Edge", contributions have been published for several years by prominent scientists.
SPIEGEL ONLINE presented in a series of articles of answers to the question "What do you think you can be true without being able to prove it?"
I believe that animals have feelings and other states of consciousness without me or anyone else who has so far been able to prove it as much as we can't prove that other human beings have a conscience.
But in this case, at least we can expect that all human brains present the same configuration.
As soon as we turn to other species and approach matters of consciousness or in general conscience, we will be confined to difficult areas because hardware does not match.
When a rat is in danger, he does the same thing as many other animals: he does death, was attacked or attacked.
Human beings behave in the same way, so some scientists deplore a comparable subjective life.
However, I don't believe it.
Two aspects of the structure of the brain make the transition of our subjective life to that of the hard animals.
One aspect is that the circuits associated almost always with human consciousness include the Frontier Frontier Cortex (because of its participation in short-term memory and management and executive functions).
This vast region is much more developed in human beings than in other primates and seems to be completely absent in other beings.
At least, therefore, for these aspects of our conscience which depends on the pre-frontal cortex, which includes our conscience and the ability to predict and decide, it is reasonable to assume that human beings differ even from other primates.
Another significant particularity may exist in the linguistic nature of the human being: a large part of his existence is related to language, which often means that his conscience depends on him.
In this case, animals could be excluded.
But even if conscience should not depend on language, it would surely influence it, so that the animal conscience, whatever the way it is produced, would probably differ much from most of our states of conscience.
This is why it is also difficult to determine what conscience can be like in other animals.
If this, in-house and subjective, is not to be measured or measured by the fact that this particular hardware is based on our own experience, then its observation poses serious problems.
Most of my developments refer to the content of life, but there is another aspect of conscience that should be more easily accessible scientifically.
Animal awareness processes could be considered without taking into account their content, and that is exactly what happened in short-term studies on the short-term memory of primates, especially with the example of visualization.
But in this approach followed by Christof Koch and Francis Crick, we focus more on the nerve correlations of conscience than on the causal mechanisms: both can be identical or not.
Interestingly, this approach also highlights the weight of the pre-frontal cortex in the performance of the visualization.
But what's the result of emotion?
I conclude that an emotional system such as that of fear is activated in a brain is aware of its own activity.
What we refer to as "fear" is the mental state in which we find ourselves when the activity of the defense system located in the brain (or its followers, such as the reactions of the body) falls from the living memory.
Thus observed, emotions are closely related to regions of the cortex that characterize primates and especially the Human.
Substiles of feeling, associated with our voluminous nature, come out because we can, with the help of words and grammar, differentiate and classify states to impose them on others than ourselves.
On the contrary, Antonio Damasio, for example, believes that feelings from primary activities are born in regions of Cortex's body and brain stem, as well as Jaak Pankseep's focus on the brain stem.
Since this network has not changed much in the course of human evolution, it could actually participate in all kinds of cross-sensitivity.
From a purely theoretical point of view, I can't contradict it, but I believe it's indisputable.
Pankseep argues that what appears as fear in men and rats is probably as sensitive as it is in both cases: how can we check whether rats and men feel the same thing when they behave similarly?
A coward was in danger, but what if he feels scared?
In my view, similar behaviors are not enough to prove identical vices.
Of course, the nerve comparison helps: rats and men have similar brain trunks, the opposite livers do not even have a brain.
But is the brain trunk the source of feelings?
And even if we could prove it for Man, how could we show it in rats?
I think rats and other mummies may even have feelings (who knows?).
But I wouldn't know how to prove it.
And since their feelings are probably quite different from ours (as human conscience is based on special circuits and language), I prefer to explore the emotional behavior rather than the emotional feelings of the rats.
In all cases, progress is on the nerve level as the same thing is done in rats and in humans.
As I don't explore language and conscience in rats or feelings, I don't know if they exist.
We could think of it as a short term, but I prefer to move forward rather than constantly taking me against a wall.
I'm actually a pragmatic emotional.
Platini, President of the EAFRD: a time of thanks for Poland and Ukraine
Deputy Prime Minister Ivan Wasjunik explained that preparations would soon be placed under the direct responsibility of the President and the Prime Minister.
"The Government considers the decision of the EAFRD in Bordeaux as evidence of confidence in Ukraine and its ability to organise, in collaboration with Poland, the European Championships," Wasjunik announced.
"But this is not an amnesty for our country.
Work has just begun, and there is still much to do in both countries."
In the construction or destruction calendar of the stadiums, streets, hotels and airports, the two hotels run after the deadlines.
The number of courses for the European Championship could possibly be reduced from eight to six.
"We can no longer waste time.
We have to work at the maximum speed," said the President of the Ukrainian League Grigory Surkis.
"The EAFRD has been constantly looking at us."
Another more radical measure was decided in Poland.
The management of the Polish Football League PZPN was suspended by the National Olympic Committee after numerous scandals and replaced by Robert Zawlocki, independent administrator.
The Commission met at the request of the Minister of Sport Miroslaw Drzewicki.
There would be "a real danger that PZPN would not be able to act in the rules," said Drzewicki of the Polish press agency PAP.
"We have made sure in a letter to the President of the EAFRD that the preparations for the 2012 European Championship did not suffer."
Several members of the First Division were already convicted in the previous season for the manipulation of mandatory delegation; in the end, the beginning of the League has even been cancelled in the last minute.
Dennis Quaid indicted against attack
She wanted to promote a new film, spoke of her private life in an interview - and now she was proud of her ex: the Hollywood star Meg Ryan raised her voice on her former adult Dennis Quaid.
The ecume - and anti-attack.
A war of late Roses for the former couple Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: seven years after their divorce, the two Hollywood players are engaged in a disgracing battle - on the face and side of the world.
The last week, Meg Ryan was in an interview for the American InStyle newspaper on the causes of marital failure: "Dennis has been to me for a long time unfaithful, and it was very painful."
She would have learned about the extent of fraud only after divorce.
The reason for this strike of thought lies in Ryan's press relations for his new film "The Women" - there is an adult story.
Dennis Quaid's reaction to his unfaithful husband's qualification is clear: this would be "Monstrueux", he said at "New York Daily News", 54 years old, that "Meg reexamines the history of our relationship and manipulal".
This would be more "repetitious", which "the pain and frustrations that lead to divorce for each child are relived in public" for their 16-year-old son Jack."
While Ryan has lived alone since divorce, Quaid has recovered and will soon become the father of Thursdays.
So it was her response to the flu: "In any case, my life continues.
I'm happy to have a wonderful family that's going better."
Air tickets and hotel prices are low
In the first half of 2008, hotels and hotels were less expensive than last year.
In Germany, according to a current study, flights would even be reduced to 50 per cent.
Flights and hotel nights would be beneficial - this is the result of a study by the US Express financial service provider and travel provider.
The company analysed its booking data in the first half of 2008 and established, after a price increase in the first quarter, a net decrease in profits in the second quarter.
After the prices on the hotel market have increased over the years, hotel nights have already decreased in many places.
From January to March, prices increased in 41 of the 48 European cities still under review by 6.9 per cent in comparison with 2007 in 41 of the 48 European cities under review.
From April to June, however, prices were 3.6 per cent lower than the previous year.
The trend was particularly clear in Paris and Rome, where passengers were to pay from 30 to 37 per cent less than a year earlier.
The causes of all of this were for American Express in the low dollar course that led to "the desire to travel down American tourists".
Financial sites such as Frankfurt or London would be even more affected by hotel prices than industrial sites such as Hanovre, Cologne or Stavanger.
In the Swedish city, hotel prices are rising by 26.3 per cent, the record in Europe.
As for the price of flights, the trend was on the rise in the first quarter:
Due to the increase in the price of kirosene, the economic class passengers paid an average of 7.1 per cent more than in 2007, long-acting flights, very fuel consumers, even increased to 29.2 per cent.
From April to June, prices of the economic class tickets fell by an average of 12.5 per cent compared to the previous quarter, in the business class and in the first class, however, the price variations were widely lower.
In Germany, prices have become even more important than in other European countries:
From January to March, prices increased by 11.9 per cent, in the second quarter, by 23.6 per cent.
German internal flights were even divided by two according to this study.
The reasons for this fall in prices would on the one hand be a flexible economic growth, explains the firm.
The application would fall from the ground in many segments of the air travel market.
On the other hand, there would be an increased pressure on competition by the "Open Steel" Treaty which liberalizes air traffic between the United States and Europe.
A sign of the situation is the removal by air carriers of non-retributable routes, as well as the high number of air companies that would have deposited the balance during the first half of 2008 - they were 24 companies only in Europe.
HSV a Gladbach 1:0
With a simple purpose and methods, the SV Hamburg becomes the first of the classification.
In Borussia, Luhukay has not always managed to find a staff member.
From Kristoffer Klein. Enlarge. Disaster landing for international player Marko Marin.
Gladbach's player will only get into the game later and his shot was wrong against the target.
His message was precisely expressed, it was from his lips in a persuasive way.
He knew he was right.
"We need this second goal," said Hermann Rieger in the color of Hamburg's airstrip.
There was no big thing going on in the clothes, the mid-term was over, and most of them were in their place.
Rieger has been HSV physiotherapist for nearly three decades, he has had a great reputation as well as the former protagonists.
And that's why his application was received at strategic sites.
The assistant coach Cornelius Jol obtained and raised the bridge to approve.
Cornelius is the brother of the coach of Hamburg Martin Jol.
What orders seem to have been similar: and how happy this is with this second purpose!
The application has failed.
"It wasn't very nice to see you today," later came Marcel Jansen.
Bastian Reinhard would have been "be more likely to be arrested" too.
This 1:0 (0:0 at mid-term), the Hamburg team has to hit the head of Mladen Petric (at the 11th minute); and the fact that the very weak gladbach players could not harm the weak Hamburg players.
"It was a victory hall," said Marin Jol.
The Hamburg SV will celebrate this Monday at 121 years of age.
Already on Saturday afternoon, supporters celebrated themselves, the blue sky above the air and the provisional classification tables on the giant screen that indicated their club as the first of the class.
That'll be a birthday without a real party.
"We know how to take it back," said Marcell Jansen.
There is no doubt that the intermediate outcome of the table reflects more than the unpredictable nature of the first League than its HSV governance.
The team with its late arrivals - the Brazilians Neves and Silva, the objective guard Petric as well as Jansen debused from the FC Bayern - is formed slowly, but it does not shine yet.
"We need more charm and more drab," Jol demanded.
After the vote
At Wall Street, the fear of traffic.
The first news of the failure of the rescue plan temporarily dropped the Dow Jones 700 points.
This was the biggest loss of points in the space of a day of history.
Later on, the Dow Jones was a bit of a hit.
By 2030, the world's largest bourgeoisie index was 10,579 points with a drop of 5 per cent.
The Nasdaq technology exchange index was 1548 points with a decrease of more than seven points.
The biggest losses of Dow Jones were this date American Express which lost almost 14 percent and the Bank of America with a loss of about 12 percent.
No title could further report benefits.
The Bank's Goldman Sachs' actions claimed a drop of almost 10 percent.
Just a few days ago, major investor Warren Buffet was associated with the company.
As part of the rescue plan, the means must be mobilized for the purchase of what is called broken hypothetical paper.
However, the amount should not be paid once but gradually.
On the other hand, the State should be able to recover options on the actions of the financial society that may be remedied relatively to the evolution of the course in order to reduce the burden on the Public Treasurer.
Courses of action inspired in the tournament in Europe and the United States
Billions of aid for banks in Europe and the United States do not concern investors.
The course of the action of the large German bank Hypo Real Estate will collapse and draw the Dax to the bottom.
The U.S. Dow Jones index is broken despite the rescue of the financial market provided by the State.
The German Index (Dax) has led to a profound deficit in the course of Hypo Real Estate and the Commercialbank.
In spite of the federal government's rescue operation and private banks, the Bank has been charged with a decrease of more than 20 per cent.
The Dax was completely scalded below the important psychological barrier of 6000 points and was costing 5,839 points with a 3.7 per cent deficit.
Around the world, stock markets have fallen to a low level.
In New York, Wall Street would open with sensitive losses.
Investors feared that the U.S. government's $700 billion savings plan could not be sufficient to re-establish financial markets.
The Dow Jones 10,809.25 points have been lost in the first hour of opening 334 points or 3.3 per cent.
The House of Representatives of the United States intended to vote on the rescue plan, and the vote at the Senate should follow on 1 October.

The multinational commercial and tourist community has further learned that the actions will not be sold to Thomas Cook.
The somber material influences the flight of space probes
For years, a mysterious phenomenon has left researchers in the perplexity: the shadow material influences the speed of space probes during what is called gravitational support manuals.
Experts fear that the general theory of relativity is not completely correct.
For nearly 18 years, the space probe "Ulysses" has been flying in space.
Due to soon frozen fuel pipelines, the cryogenic death is a threat.
Over the years, a mysterious phenomenon is the cause of development among researchers - the anomalies of gravitational support.
The gravitational support is a work of space probes, by which they obtain an additional element in the gravitational field of a heavenly body, for example the Earth.
Thus, probes can save a lot of fuel.
The American-European research probe Cassini-Huygens used this physical astute as well as the Ulysses solar probe.
This is what some researchers have wondered over the years: the flying objects do not always behave to 100 percent of the way we expect them under the gravitational laws.
Moreover, irregularities appear at the speed level.
The sounds become more unexpected or slower.
To date, physicists have not been able to explain this effect.
They baptized him in the anomaly of gravitational support.
Some experts feared that the theory of Albert Einstein's general relativity, which described the force of attraction for the fact of space debris, could not be entirely correct.
American physicist Stephen Adler of Princeton's Institute for Advanced Study always believes that Einstein does not lie and tries to explain the anomaly of gravitational support using what is called the black matter that astronomers have identified in the universe.
"The black matter could be responsible for this anomaly, which is also near the Earth," he wrote.
Space researchers know the existence of black matter only for about ten years.
It appears to have an attraction force which is observed on other heavenly bodies.
On the contrary, it is completely invisible, i.e. it does not send or reflect any electromagnetic radiation, especially no visible light.
According to scientists' calculations, the black matter would still be a good fifth of the entire mass of the universe.
Tourists removed from Egypt are free
After ten days at the hands of their rapists, the kidnapped tourists in Egypt should be released as well as confirmed by the Italian Minister for Foreign Affairs.
The Sudanese rapists had demanded a sum of several million euros.
During the previous release, six hostages would have been killed.
In the south of Egypt, five Germans were removed.
The ransom negotiations would be already under way.
The Germans are continuously in the kidnappers' collimator.
WELT ONLINE depends on the most important cases.
European tourists kidnapped in Sahara are apparently free.
This is what has been reported in concert on Egypt's state TV, Al-Arabija Arab TV channel and Italian media.
The Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini confirmed the release after the Italian television channel Sky TG 24 booklets: "Our citizens and other hostages have been released.
We're checking their health status," Frattini said.
The five Germans, the five Italians, and the Romanians as well as their eight Egyptian companions are well behaved and safe, announced Egyptian national television.
The 19 participants of the trip in the desert should already be on their way to Cairo.
The circumstances around a rifle prior to the release of hostages are still running low: thus, kidnappers would have been about to be put to death, according to an Egyptian security officer, before the Sudanese army killed six kidnappers without shouting.
"The problem was solved.
They agreed with a ransom," said the agent.
There was nothing left but collecting the hostages," when Sudanin, "this surprise" occurred.
Sudanese soldiers had attacked on this Sunday six rivals in the border area between the Sudan, Chad and Egypt, and had arrested two of them.
The buyers had asked Germany for a sum of EUR 6 million; the money had to be paid by the German woman of one of the hostages.
The daily "El Masri El Jom" said that, according to a German mediator, the release of hostages was delayed because kidnappers feared for their safety.
According to the article, rapists wanted to release female hostages after payment of the ransom.
The men had to be held until the rapists found a safe way to escape.
The German ambassador to Cairo refused to comment on this report.
A beautiful father's abuse that leads to suicide"
A court was informed that years of abuse suffered by her father-in-law led a woman to commit suicide.
Michael Trerise, 57nds, from Stithians, in the Cornowiles, was imprisoned for six years after having been admitted to eight prosecutors for inadvertent ways.
The High Court of Truro referred to his daughter, Stéphanie Randle, who was five to seven years old, regularly read.
Trerise wrote in a letter of confession: "I feel responsible for her death."
The court was informed that Melle Randle, aged 34, committed suicide at Mutley, Plymouth, on 1 April 2007.
When she was living in Coventry, Trerise had attracted her and banded her before she forced her into sexual acts, while her mother worked in the pub.
Trerise and his wife divorced in the 1980s, and he returned to live in the Cornowiles.
Her beautiful daughter goes to Plymouth.
However, the court was informed that Melle Randle, a volunteer resident of National Trust, had been subjected to abuse twice a week.
Prosecutor General Ramsey Quaife told the court that friends had told me that Melle Randle, who was a good winner and cyclist, seemed to have been "emotionally dead" since 2006 and "he had lost all hope of life."
In April 2007, his real father, Terrance Randle, found him dead in his apartment in Plymouth.
We think she committed suicide by sneezing with a plastic bag.
Mr. Randle faced his daughter's beautiful father who had otherwise, writing a letter of confession which ended with the words: "I attach him and his bandits to me on a regular basis."
"I didn't abuse her sexually.
"I feel responsible for her death."
Judge Christopher Elwen said to Trerise: "You are really weird as a fetishist, your victim must have been a terrorist, especially at the age of 7.
"This disgusting saga ended by the victim's suicide.
And what's even more surprising is that if she hadn't committed this act, her story would never have ended in court."
He added: "I stress in particular, as his father and mother describe him, the effects of your crime on Stéphanie for years.
"Without them, she would certainly be a happy, promising young woman today."
Offences for loss of official data.
The departmental officer of the Office of the Cabinet who had forgotten top-secret documents, in June on a train, will be convicted by the Office of the Secrets Act, on behalf of the BBC.
The man of the Ministry of Defence was moving when he forgot two highly classified documents on a Waterloo train.
The documents were passed in the hands of the BBC before they were delivered to the police.
This is the most serious condemnation of this act, without any insinuation of criminal intent.
The BBC correspondent, Frank Gardner, said that this episode had many Whitehall people.
"They would have thought that the case would remain between the walls of the Ministry of Defence and the Office," he said.
The salary which cannot be named shall be charged with breach of section 8.1 of the Act, i.e. the key to the protection of information.
The Crown Prosecution Service suggested that the Ministerial Officer be placed under the protection of the Metropolitan Police, taking into account the very sensitive nature of his work related to the Joint Committee on Secret Services.
The missing documents contained appreciation for Al-Qaeda as well as for the resources of the security forces in Iraq.
He was informed of the decision, Monday morning and then taken from him to a secret place.
Building companies face the B&B bill.
British construction companies could pay more than £80 million to cover the rescue of Bradford & Bingley Bank.
The Government has provided £14 billion to protect the deposits of 2.6 million Bradford & Bingleys.
The interest in this loan will be paid by all companies that collect savings, including 59 construction companies.
The Director General of Building Companies Association (BSA), Adrian Coles, stated that he is "increasing" to know that companies and their members will have to pay the cuts...
The £14 billion loan will be repaid when Bradford & Bingley's mortgages are broken.
But the interest that goes up at the same time will be charged every year to 700 financial companies that collect deposits.
The Financial Services Compensation Scheme confirmed to the BBC that the 59 building companies are included in this list.
It's disturbing to see that institutions that had a good attitude... now have to pay some of the bills of institutions that were much less prudent.
Adrian Coles, BSA
It is announced that each company should pay a proportion of the deposits it holds and that intermediate companies should pay about 18 per cent of the cost.
The treasurer estimates that the interest in the loan will rise to £450 million in 2009.
This means that companies will have to find £81 million to settle the interests of the first year.
Adrian Cole, Director-General of the Board of Commerce of Building Companies, told the BBC that this decision seemed unfair to him.
It is "frequency" to see that institutions that have had a good behaviour when they re-establish the real estate market must now pay for much less prudent institutions.
According to BSA, no company has been wrong since 1945, the date of the first year.
"We need to consider all aspects of this business over the next few weeks to assess the options to be taken to avoid companies in the building and their members pay this paid bill," said Mr. Cole.
Interests for 2009 cover seven months from the end of September of this year until the end of March.
In 2010, interest will need to be paid throughout the year, which could otherwise double.
As construction companies are non-shared organizations, their members end up paying the bill either by higher charges or by lower interest rates for savings accounts.
The milk increases to five pennies per litre.
The people of Jersey have to pay more for their milk
Jersey Dairy announced that she was going to increase the price of her milk, five pennies per litre, from Monday.
This is the second increase in the price resulting from a two-penny increase in February, followed by a research carried out by a consulting company.
The retail sellers must decide if they go to their tour, increase the price to consumers.
. Before the increase in February, the price of Jersey's milk had been varied for the last time, in 2002.
An ex-Pm from Bangladesh has been shown to refuse the bail
A court in Bangladesh rejected an appeal to former PM Sheikh Hasina, who was thus at risk of being arrested on his return to the country.
Her lawyers said that the court refused to give her bail because of her trial to get a man out of business, 50 million Taka ($729,0000) when she was PM.
This case is one of the many accusations addressed to him.
Khaleda Zia, Sheikh Hasina's remaining rival, was released in prison earlier this month.
Sheikh Hasina should have returned to Bangladesh a few weeks ago, but her party, the Awani League, demanded that the country's provisional military government give her its entire freedom first.
Correspondents stressed that the terms of her release were contradictory because if she was allowed to leave the country for medical reasons, she could not see why she could not stay free to return to Bangladesh.
Her lawyers announced that she would now appeal to the Supreme Court against the order of the Supreme Court.
"The Supreme Court rejected Sheikh Hasina's request saying that she did not need any protection because she was allowed to go abroad for medical reasons," said his lawyer Rafique-ul Huk.
"We will present an appeal against the Order of the Supreme Court"
Her lawyers argued that she needed this protection to return to the country in order to prepare the elections in December
Sheikh Hasina should return after 17 October, a former leader of the Awami party said.
It was held last year after the military internal government took power, but was released in June to take care of the foreign.
Sheikh Hasina like Zhaleda Zia, not the accusations they make.
Concerns about the Afghan antipolio campaign.
In Afghanistan, nearly 200,000 children have lost their recent anti-polo immune campaign, due to Taliban-related violence, the United Nations has declared.
The United Nations carried out a vaccination campaign in the six provinces last week.
However, it failed to contact the children in the dangerous areas of Helmand and Kandahar, located in the south.
A United Nations spokesman stated that this occurred despite the promises made by the Taliban not to attack or obstruct thousands of nurses during vaccinations.
BSkyB loses ITV's judicial battle
BSkyB lost its post-commissioning process, which would force BSkyB to reduce its participation in its ITV rival transmitter.
The Competition Appeals Tribunal ordered BSkyB to reduce its VAT shares from 17.9 per cent to less than 7.5 per cent.
The Commission stated that, in the past, the participation of MSkyB had prevented competition and had allowed it to influence ITV incorrectly.
BSkyB bought its shares in 2006 following an agreement to prevent NTL, now called Virgin Media, from buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Fair Trading Office reported that the purchase by BSkyB, of the ITV parties, had raised doubts about the effective independence of ITV, thereby encouraging the Competition Commission to investigate
Virgin's boss, Richard Branson, a group of consumers and Offcom regulators were all opposed to this purchase.
BSkyB reiterated that the force to reduce its share of ITV would not be reasonable and, on the contrary, it was excessive – especially since BSkyB had just given up its voting rights.
A new investigation into the case of U.S. prosecutors.
The U.S. Attorney General appointed a special prosecutor to verify the issue of the license of nine U.S. prosecutors in 2006.
Everything was made up of the case of the Inspector General of the Department of Justice, who criticised the actions of some ministerial officers.
The report was critical to the officers of the White House, the legislators and the former Prosecutor General, Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation is based on the subject of lawyers who claim that their licence is from political causes.
Special Prosecutor Nora Dannehy will now investigate whether the officers questioned during the investigation have lied to the investigators, thus obstructing justice.
"Serious allegations of potentially criminal conduct, not founded, have not been fully confirmed or resolved," said Inspector General Glenn Fine in his report.
The appointment of a special prosecutor able to force witnesses to deposit was one of its greatest recommendations.
The debate begins with the December 2006 radiation of nine U.S. prosecutors by the Department of Justice.
At the time, the Department had declared that the prosecutors were licensed for medical benefits.
However, it then emerged that licensed prosecutors were no longer criticized than their other colleagues, which encouraged some observers to assign political connotations to these licences.
Some of the prosecutors were accused of being close to the Republicans of the Congress, while others would have refused to investigate false accusations against the Democrats.
US prosecutors are investigating and continuing the judicial courts for the government.
It is true that they can be licensed at any time, but they cannot be granted for political reasons.
The Chief of the Department of Justice, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, has been accused of being involved in this licensing case, and he has finally resigned.
A number of ministerial officials in the Department of Justice have also given up their resignation.
The General Inspector General's report was very critical of Mr. Gonzales' role in this matter, stating that he would consider him "the first responsible" of these licences, and ended with "the abataquer" his role as leader," which succeeded significantly without being involved in this case.
Other ministerial officials, including former Bush co-worker Karl Rove, were criticized for failing to cooperate during the investigation.
The Pope of Meat Loaf must be honored.
The Rock star Meat Loaf, must be honored at Q Awards for his epic song Bat Out Of Hell.
The singer, who will receive an oscar during the ceremony in London next week, declared to be "honoured" to gain this recognition.
The nine-minute song and fifty-second was the title of the 1977 Meat Loaf album hit.
The award evening is presented by Coldplay, with this year, a limited selection of four categories.
Paul Rees, editor-in-chief of Q magazine, said: "There are songs that transcend things like time and kind, and Bat Out Of Hell is actually part of it.
The song, written by Jim Steinman, required a big voice like Meat Loaf.
It starts with an instrument section that lasts almost two minutes.
The song was marketed in the United Kingdom, as single in 1979, in the 15th place.
In addition, its album Bat Out of Hell has remained nine years in English classifications, and it has been sold to more than 40 million copies worldwide.
Meat Loaf- or Marvin Lee Aday, whose real name has suffered from health problems over the past few years, even undergoing surgery to improve her heart rate became irregular after she was on stage in 2003.
In 2007, she was forced by a strong length of time to cancel the concerts.
Then we find him in the vocal cords.
A Rue Sombre in the City, Often Forgotten, and Cant Soon for Sale.
New York has hundreds of adventures, boulevards, streets and other parallel roads, some famous, others only functional.
And even some veterranean taxes as well as local long-term residents are unable to give instructions to return to Extra Place, because they have never heard of them.
The street is located in the East Village and is located north of First Street- not confused with Second Street- between Bowery and Second Avenue.
With about 30 feet wide for 120 length, it looks like a pusyful allele rather than an active artery.
No panels indicate the street.
It is virtually impossible to find it on a standard Atlas.
However, this street has admirers.
For example, there is Avalon Bay, the newly built luxury buildings on First Street.
It would like to renovate Extra Place, and create a more fluid passage to shops and shops, which should open in new buildings.
Other admirers, including long-term neighbors, have declared to be charmed by this shortcut simply because it remains one of the last and oldest streets of the house yard.
But the City's Department of Conservation and Immobilier Development, which manages the street, has no interest in keeping it.
This month, at a meeting of neighboring committees, representatives of city agency and Avalon Bay made a proposal allowing the real estate builder to buy the street.
But the Committee prefers that the road remains in the hands of the city, and asked for a new proposal to be submitted next month, said Susan Stetzer, the local manager of Committee No.3.
"There are only a few spaces in the city, and we would like the city to keep Extra Place," she said.
"They could propose to return it to state and manage it, what Avalon could do, but we want to keep it public."
Avalon Bay announced several months ago that she wanted to repair the small street and install seats, some would also be used by a coffee to which the builder would give space.
The proposal for this potential acquisition was made public at the meeting this month.
Michele de Milly, Avalon Bay's spokesman, said that although the company wants to operate the street, this does not necessarily mean that it wants to be the owner.
"Avalon Bay's main interest is to watch this abandoned street, and make it public," she said, stressing that it was the city to suggest the sale."
Seth Donlin, a spokesman for the Property Conservation, confirmed that the city wanted to sell the street well, stressing further that the agency's mission was to develop property rather than manage it.
Compared to its more colorful neighbor, Bowery, Extra Place left a slight historical impression.
Some believe that Extra Place bears this name since 1802, when the inheritance of the great farm of many children by Philip Minthorne was divided, leaving behind this small village of land, which has remained abandoned.
The later entry of the CBGB, a Punk Rock monument closed in 2006, was reopened in Extra Place; the street is certainly more popular thanks to the photo coverage of the Ramones "Rocket to Russia" album.
"this place was great" said Danny Fields, the manager of the Ramones, who took the photo in November 1976.
She was full of railways, halls, bars, posters, sheets and strings."
Some residents, including bloggers who had already talked about developments towards the luxury of the East Village, opposed the idea of selling Extra Place, saying that this small property should remain public.
Others have declared Extra Place as a real rare - a virtually identical fragment in the city that should be put in peace.
Jeremiah Moss, who is leading a blog called Jeremiahah's Vanishing New York (subtitled "The Book of Contests: A Look Nostalgic Amement on A City in the Exptinction Process") relates the history of the City and Extra Place, published in 1952 in The New Yorker.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote: "Extra Place is a small, narrow-sac-sac, shaded day and night, and bordered by the doors of a wheeled iron warehouse and people, full of newspapers last week that surrounds the length of the gates."
There are few exceptions, the street is always the same.
A short rat in the back of the wheel, close to a door that was holding pockets at the CBGB, and now becomes the seat of a small dress store.
graffiti on the walls, a bottle of 22 empty ounces, is located next to newspapers that just come to be cast.
Some historians have stated that they only rarely think about Extra Place, and suggest its value.
Mr. Field, on his side, said that some undertook to consider the attractiveness of the street in his current state.
"The best years of my life," he said, "they are held in dark, wet and refreshing places."
The Bilingual Debate: Emersion in English
In this part of the Education Supervision programme, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the position of candidates on bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, former student in California, and former director of the Department of Education at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is the co-author of the book "not so good that you don't think about it. Why middle classes should be able to choose their school."
To attract the interests of Spanish voters is a complex business.
Barack Obama's proposals on education are an interesting example.
Mr. Obama's campaign emphasizes that "American and Latin American students are less likely to graduate than white students." This is a true fact.
In order to combat these differences, Mr. Obama's education programme is particularly supportive of both other subjects, "transitional bilingual education" for those who learn English.
However, the question for Obama is whether it wants to achieve bilingual education that defends instruction in language classes other than English, it will be of interest to eliminate differences.
Take, for example, Sixth Street Prep, an elementary school in the east of the Los Angeles county.
The students in this school are mostly Spanish, and from low income.
More than a third of the students, consisting of many new arrivals, study English.
Among CM1 students, 100 per cent of the 2008 state of maths was reviewed, at an expert level.
At the same time, almost 93% of students have studied English-languages-and-arts
This incredible success was achieved through another ingredient other than that advanced by Mr. Obama.
Sixth Street based on analysis, practice, constant capacity assessment and exemplary attitude.
In addition, and here's an example that Mr. Obama could copy, reports Linda Mikels, head of Six Street, this school installed the instruction of the English language "full immersion".
The total English-language immersion focuses on the almost constant use of English in the instruction.
Melle Mikels, unlike Bilingual Education, told me "We had a great success with a student who came from Mexico 12 months later, if you went out without her class, you would have no chance of identifying her."
"This march, notice it, "it's been going for us."
Mr. Obama should not take the example of Sixth Street Prep and repeat it in other schools composed of most Spanish students learning English.
The excellent results obtained by this school speak of themselves; but policies on education within its part (the National Education Associations have long supported bilingual education) and its enormous support for bilingual education, obscure the forecast of Mr. Obama's response.
Although it is in favour of the fact that immigrants are learning English, Mr. Obama recently considered this issue as insignificant, when he announced that we should all stop voting on the bill in English.
"On the contrary, he said, "You must make sure your child speaks Spanish."
If Mr. Obama really wants to eliminate the differences, then he should consider carefully the educational models that work, rather than deduce them or consider them as insignificant.
Cute Net of Petrole followed by New Concerns of the World of Economics
Petroleum prices fell on Monday, as people were afraid that the rescue plan for financial marches was unable to return life to the economy.
Gross oil operations fell from 7 per cent to $99.80. New York's Mercantile Bourgeois at the sale of this morning.
The prices have fallen more than $20 in the barrel since last Monday.
In the last two weeks, the market for raw materials has been dried up by Wall Street's financial gain, as well as by two Uragan forces in the Gulf of Mexico.
After it was discovered in July, an increase of $145.29 in the barrel fell to almost $90 in the barrel this month, before it was reimbursed in view of the profound uncertainty of financial markets.
This Monday, investors are again concerned, despite the agreement on the saving plan, the biggest of history, concluded this weekend by the leaders of Congress.
The new has been reduced by recent concerns that would make the crisis long-term.
In the last episode of this financial disaster," City Group will purchase the bank operations of the Wachovia Corporation, the government said this Monday.
At the same time, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments have nationalised the European financial conglomerate, Fortis.
The analysts of Barclays Capital said that this weekend's franetic negotiations, concluded with the rescue agreement, seem to have failed to relive the market."
As the economic situation deteriorates, demand for raw materials, including oil, should slow down.
"the perspective of global equity, interest rates and market exchanges has become uncertain" wrote Deutsche Bank analysts in a letter to their investors."
"we believe that the first matter will not escape from this infection.
"As far as the first matter is concerned, our most pressing concern is to understand how much the American virus would spread globally and particularly in China."
Bank analysts have reduced their expectations for the coming year, given the drop in oil consumption due to slowdown in economic growth, were therefore obliged to reduce 20 per cent, oil and gas prices forecast for 2009.
The Second Time Determining Festival for the Improvement of the Team's Record.
After spending the last eight months, more time than anyone in the uniform of Jets Shaun Ellis, the defender thought he had seen everything.
He looked at the second time when the Jets transformed a 0 to 0 into an explosion.
"I've never seen anything like this," said Ellis.
The second time began after the Jets and the Arizona Cardinals played themselves under cloud clouds.
Then the fourth back Brett Fabre managed to take a walk in Laveranues Coles with a touchdown of 12 yards, a pre-signor of a afternoon after which their relationship made a bond before.
Favre found Cole for two more touchdowns, the first when a corner back fell and the second, at 10 seconds of the mid-term.
"I'm not out of my area" Fabre said about all his trips to Cole.
"It's a mediocre player."
"We communicate very well, despite what people think."
While Favre and Coles were playing catch, the defense fought the fourth back of the Cardinals, Kurt Warner.
Darrelle Revis, back corner, intercepted a lost shot and made 32 yards up to the touchdown.
Eric Smith took another step and intercepted it.
Linebacker, David Bowens lets out the balloon because of Warner.
Last change, the loss of Bowens balloon, could well be the most charming event
The Cardinals took control of this possession for the last 10 seconds, and then the Jets recovered the balloon, Jay Feely put a 20 yard goal with a benefit from 34 to 0.
It was the best Jets could've picked up in a while.
"The train of Jets, Eric Mangini, to whom we were asked to describe this paper, said "the second time or the third time?"
When she was told that the two Jets left 21 points incontestable in the third time -- Mangini said: "I can tell you that I appreciated the second time more than the third time.
"Many points have been marked shortly."
Gbrssellassie is resting, beyond its global record.
Haile Gebrselasie, an Ethiopian, has again proved to be worthy of his title as the best runner of the century, after having beat his own world record to Berlin's marathon on Sunday, thus becoming the first to run 26.2 miles in less than 2 hours and 4 minutes.
With a victory at 2:03 :59 from a comfortable course on the board, Gebrsselassie fought for 27 seconds his record of 2:04:26 , argued last year in Berlin .
At 35 years of age, Gebrselasie won the 26th world record of his great career during which he won the world championship or the world record for any distance from the 1600 meters of the marathon.
In the last month, Gebrselasie had missed Beijing's Olympic Marathon, fearing that today's air pollution would not increase its asthma problems.
On the contrary, he promises to run to Berlin.
In almost perfect-time sunny conditions, 48 degrees to the start, 55 to the arrival-Gebrsselassie won Sunday, now an impressive average of one thousand in 4 minutes 43 seconds
The track runners such as Gebrselasie and Paul Tergat, both Kenyans, who became background runners, contributed to the reduction of the marathon record for more than two minutes in the last ten years, since 1998, when Brazilian Ronaldo da Costa won Berlin at 2:06:05 .
After Sunday's victory, Gebrselasie told the reporters that she had suffered seizures two weeks ago, and that she had not been trained for a week.
Clearly, his rest has allowed him to remain bright, but not rolled.
"I am so happy," he told the reporters.
"All was perfect.
I've returned last week, and today I've had doubts; but at last everything's gone for the best."
He was criticized - especially in Kenya, the African rival of Ethiopia - for having too much orchestrate his careers , avoiding the world stars of the marathon , taking into account books such as if they were in a track competition, and considering world records more than the sense of competition.
But this criticism does not reduce the size of the capabilities of Gibraltar as a fundamental runner.
Sunday Gebrselassia, preceded by four Kenyans, recorded a time of 1:02:04. on my way.
Two Kenyan elite runners, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, continued to challenge Gebrselassie after the file heads disappeared.
A little over three miles from the arrival, Gebrselasie made its final reassemble to discover Kwambai, which ends at 2:05:36 , improving its best personal record of five minutes.
Kamathis arrived the third time at 2:07:48.
In the female race, Irina Mikitenko, born in Kazakhstan, now a German citizen, finished a remarkable year of the seventh time of 2:19:19.
The English Paula Radcliffe holds the world record at 2:15:25.
The last spring, 36-year-old Mikitenko, surprised the whole world to win London Marathon at 2:24:14.
She can't participate in Beijing's games because of a two-to-two hypothetical, but she promises to win in Berlin, improving her third marathon, her personal record of almost five minutes.
It runs through a smart strategy, allowing the group of Ethiopian runners and canyons to take a good advantage, then more than 18 miles 1⁄2 after.
Askale Tafa Margasa of Ethiopia arrived at 2:21:31, while Helena Kiprop, Kenya, ended the third at 2:25:01.
In a City of Part, the Orgueil and the Trials of the Black Way
Hidden in the development of its vast park, just a few miles from the island, the brilliant and generous Orlando, is a quiet little town where the pride and complications of the African-American experience are born.
"Eatonville, the first completely black town to integrate, the home of Zora Neale Hurston's childhood, this description she gave in 1935, is no longer so simple to make our days." The city in five lakes, three short croquets, 300 fined skin, 300 good nests, full of goyaves, two schools and no prison."
She has now become a city of pilgrimage
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee came to Zora Festival each year to honor the most famous writer of the Harlem Renaissance in Houston.
And in various ways, the city she described has become a tourist because of its inclusion in Florida's tourist guide published by The Depression- era Federal Writers' Project- remains a part of it.
She is also independent, worthy, and private that she was not already in the 1930s, when Hurston said that the black rural population of Florida was often reluctant to share her real thoughts with the white man, who "We know so little, don't know what he's missing."
Although this is the year of the election of a black president, Senator Barack Obama, who has also called for an open dialogue on the subject of race, many here remain cautious about the foreign look.
"we are very careful about how to tell the story," Hortense Jones, 59 years old, always lived in the city and the oldest Parisian city.
"It must be consistent with reality.
Eatonville has long been defined as a triumphal and combat paradox.
It is both a historical model of black power taking as well as a community of nearly 2400 people where the rate of poverty is twice the national average.
This is a central point but also an example of South-South black culture - sometimes deep, sometimes accommodated - which reminds us of the birth of American slavery.
What would explain why residents are both proud and protective.
The interest in the image of Eatonville and Zora, which everybody here calls Hurston.
It presents its birthplace around the world through sincere books, full of dialects, such as "Mules and Men" (1935) and "Their Eyes Were Watching God" (1937).
Five paragraphs in the guide of Florida transformed this city, located just at the exit of Route 17, a road that passes through the centre of Florida, often forgotten, which falls into the chapter of black history and human drama.
Acutely such a large drop in life as in literature, Hurston led the readers to the property store of the first mayor of Eatonville, Joe Clarke, who was then divided into several private parties.
"passed the road on the left," she wrote, "you will find the modern public school marron and white, with its gardens and these well-preserved game areas that Howard Miller has always cared for, although he knows how to read and write.
She also mentioned Widow Dash's new husband and wrote that Lee Glenn" sells all kinds of drinks as well as everything that can be used for people passing by.
So, in spite of hundreds of words, Hurston associated Eatonville with a government car but also with literacy, rehabilitation, and sex.
Of course, Fodor wasn't like that.
It wasn't actually a portrait that everyone appreciated.
Zora well described the reality," said 90-year-old Ella Dinkins, one of Johnson's young daughters who murdered Horston, citing the colorless songs interpreted by men who praised their beauty."
She adds: "Some people didn't appreciate it."
We always remember Hurston as a living and eccentric person, who often returned after his family moved to Jacksonville, Fla.
Augustus Franklin, 77, recalls that Hurston came from a town without warning, along with a big Chevrolet, a cigarette in his mouth and wearing pants here, where even today, traditional customs are proud.
Many residents were fascinated, Mr. Franklin told me, while many were worried about her.
"The people were always happy to see Zora," he said.
But he adds, balanceing himself in his backyard of the patio that he gives on Lake Sabelia, where Horston was probably baptized, that "she never stayed too long."
At the death of Hurston in 1960, she was poor and her books were out of production.
Eatonville and the whole world seemed to have forgotten it.
Although she was a star of literature, a contemporary of Langston Hughes and the only black woman in the Barnard College of the 20s, she was buried in a grave anywhere in Fort Pierce, Fla, where she lived.
At Eatonville, no big memorial, no record for the big audience.
I don't think they understood the contribution or heritage it offered to the world " by Valérie Boyd, author of "Wrapped in Rainbows", a Houston biography published in 2003.
A crucial moment takes place in the 1980s.
Public officials from Orange County wanted to take a road to five streets in town, to replace Boulevard Kennedy, the main road on two roads in the community.
The development of Orlando has already moved Interstate 4 to the west corner of the city.
The proposal was made while Eatonville was right back from a difficult period of his history.
A forced integration, among other things, has ended the relatively idyllic isolation of the Community.
In the 1950s, the debate on the mix of races led to hatred at the gates of the community.
"At this time, a band of white youths came to launch oranges or objects against people sitting on the side," said Franklin.
"a lady is even dead."
They started a patch of their car."
In a 1955 letter addressed to The Orlando Sentinel, Hurston questioned the Supreme Court's request for forced integration, defining its decision in Brown v. Board of Education" rather than glorifying my race."
Residents now claim that the elimination of racial segregation in schools, although positive in some respects, has weakened Eatonville's cohesion and has weakened the confidence of young people.
"The black children had the habit of being pregnant - I remind them well - our master was conceived in the morning, and also at night," said N.Y. Nathiri, daughter of Ella Dinkins and director of the Health Watch of the Eatonville Community, a non-profit group.
This lasted until the teachers and students came from the same place.
"You didn't wear your white teacher because he's white-I mean there's a cultural demarcation line here," Melle Nathiri said.
Civil rights, on the other hand, have allowed space to be created for other Zora Neale Hurston- black writers, actors and artists who have gone beyond the damage, such as her, an army of a happy self-confidence and behavioral lines such as: "How can they be deprived of my company's pleasure?"
That's beyond me."
In 1975, writer Alice Walker returned to the anonymous tomb of Hurston and began to fight for his reputation.
Five years later, an abbreviated biography on Hurston by Robert E. Hemenway, a real best seller, re-enters it with American cannons.
The road project arrived just when Eatonville's most famous daughter found her attractive.
And this time, Hurston's old neighbors considered it a salvation.
The community started organizing a Houston festival to show the disastrous consequences of this road.
Hundreds of fans came to the opening of the festival two years later, and many came back in January to celebrate it.
After many years, the county rejected the road proposal.
"The five-way road fiasco, extremely fast, is a real civil pride," said Melle. Nathiri.
Melle Boyd summarized everything saying "Zora saved Eatonville."
The victory against the road project allowed him to change his own image.
Non-residents, such as Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who has been frequenting our church since 1993, began to come in large numbers, and residents began to reconsider the past.
Eatonville has been ranked historical city since 1998.
A mono-theme library (also known as Hurston) will be opened in 2006, on a magnificent Kennedy Boulevard, rehabilitated.
Today, Eatonville remains anomaly for Florida: at six miles from Orlando, it can at any time be seen as a rear street during a summer rainy day, small as it was when it was founded by 27 black families in the 1880s.
(90 per cent of blacks are accounted for today)
Foreigners who come to discover the story of Eatonville, his reason for being, are still treated with caution.
Most interviews have to be allowed, and some things - like the walls of the old Eatonville church, painted by the white man, depicting black men in the camps - must not be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, such as Melle Jones, a courageous teacher who has a low quality for the living red, are always afraid their island community is not well understood.
However, given the expansion of the Hurston festival, a certain level of local pride is emerging.
Young people in particular tend to consider Eatonville as Horston's whole race: beautiful, problemmatic and all, neither better nor worse, but also proud, creative, forest, folk and mixed as the other ethnic and racial groups in America.
It is good for sincere civil love to be heard in the voice of Mr. Franklin, Edwin Harvey, 18, who plans to return to Eatonville after college to work for the local government or the police forces, who need additional strength.
And even for the younger ones, such as Alondra and Alexia Kenon, 11-year-old Winter Park jewellery, they seem to have learned the exact description of Eatonville.
"Most of the people who go into this area will think: "Oh, this city has nothing compared to others" Alondra Kenon said after the last Sunday meal.
But if you stop and take the time to tell the story, it's a very beautiful city."
Here in New York, everyone's talking financially.
In spite of all this, nothing has changed.
If tourists in Manhattan kept away from the cinema and the giant TV screens in Times Square, they would not realize they were in the eyes of the Cyclone.
They would never think that in the glass and blue offices above their heads, bankers and fund managers who are monopolizing New York, have spent the worst "workday at the office" since the 1929 crack.
The bookers continue to sink on their trottoirs, with their carts and muffin plates for their morning meetings.
The Latinians are still training among residential buildings carrying, like women, a 50 luxury shirts hanging on a jig on their shoulders.
Office employees continue to make the rent to buy their morning sandwich for ambulances, and it is still impossible to find a taxi between 16h and 19h per week.
I didn't feel the crisis despite the completely pessimistic reports until this afternoon when I decided to open a new savings account.
Fortunately, I was planning to work late after noon, as I found out at my local JP Morgan Chase branch, about a dozen people doing the laundry.
Not in front of the caissettes, nor in order to withdraw from the species or make a payment, but in front of the customer service tip, where normal customers ordered their checks, the tourists asked for guidance for Macy store, and the new customers opened accounts.
Most of those in front of me, I would later learn from Starr, my "authorised personal banker", were all complaining for the same reason I did.
Not in the same way, because they had already withdrawn their savings from smaller banks, such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Staten Island.
They have withdrawn their money from so-called trophy savings accounts (such as a building company), credit associations, and the type of local savings deposit boxes and their branches that operate only in a state, which say to treat customers as their family.
In a recent year, 15 of these banks have failed.
In recent days, Washington Mutual, a 327-dollar capital bank has applied to the bankruptcy union, and while New Yorkers went home for the weekend, another bank, Wachovia, to savings accounts of $440 million, looked desperately for a buyer to save it.
The office and the store staff who are in front of me, frustrated by another potential defeat, have transferred their money to a bank that they seem to be reliable, that is, the one that makes the most of the rescue in Wall Street.
Some New Yorkers have become very familiar with the financial world in recent weeks.
"I heard a lady at my Chinese local supermarket, talking to Lehman Brothers' phone, the bank that failed, and her Major General Dick Full, with the same familiarity that she could have had to criticize a colleague.
And Lynn, the concierge in the uniform form of my property, changed the subject of our usual conversation about Brad and Angelina or the delivery of my fruit and vegetables shop.
She told me, following my visit to the bank. "I put all my savings in the monetary fund market.
"I've changed, I don't want to take risks."
Muslim graves buried while Austria oscillates to the right.
Heinz-Christian Strache, who left the right shoulder of the Austrian Freedom Party and, Filip Destarter of the right Belgian Vlaams Belang, took part in a demonstration to present the organization of " cities against Islam" in Antwerp on Thursday, 17 January 2008.
They carry road panels depicting red-ray masks.
The police accuse extreme extremists of having celebrated an Austrian Muslim cemetery, the weekend of the victory of extreme political parties Right to the general elections of the country.
More than 90 graves were seriously damaged at Traun's cemetery, near Linz, between Friday night and this morning; it is a police action organized.
The criminals painted on several graves, Jewish symbols such as the Star of David; the detectives believe that this could have been done to dispel the sense of hate of extremists against Muslim immigrants.
This incident could be in some way related to the elections.
A voice from the Islamic local community stated to be "deeply shocked" at the announcement of this phenomenon, which takes place just during the religious month of Ramadan that touches its end.
Austria is seriously considering finding its courage, following its oscillation to the right in the parliamentary elections yesterday.
The two extreme right parties that voted almost 30 percent of the votes, the Freedom Party and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, led an anti-immigrance campaign. Some of their slogans were considered to be the same as xenophobes, according to critics.
Heinz-Christian Strache, head of the Freedom Party who won more than 18 percent of the votes, took his campaign against the follard and burkas port, and even expressed his opposition to alha food.
During his final course in Vienna, he spoke of "a European fraternity" to avoid the amount of Islam.
The two parties are trying to prevent the construction of museums and mines, claiming they would be a political symbol of the Islamicization of Austria and Europe.
Surveys and analyses conducted just after the elections have defined the extreme right as the country's strongest political block, which is shown by the majority of young voters who have made the difference because they are concerned about their future in the European Union.
Gary Glitzer refused to travel abroad.
The courts banned the rock star glamour, Gary Glitter, accused of sexual abuse of children, expatriation in France and Spain.
The Magistrates imposed a six-month ban on Glitter, after he expressed his intention to return to Spain through France.
The Kent Police had issued this ban on travelling last Thursday after proving to the magistrates that Glitzer was guilty of sexual abuse against children.
Glitter, or his real name, Paul Gadd, was not present at the hearing of Ashford's limited court, but was also represented by his lawyer Corker Binning.
A court spokesman said "on Thursday 25 September at Ashford's court, Kent's police asked for an application to prevent Mr. Paul Gadd from traveling to France and Spain until 25 March.
"Paul Gadd wasn't present then."
Glitter, 64, informed the authorities that he wanted to go abroad, not to be registered on the list of sexual abuse charges.
He must inform the authorities if he wishes to go abroad for more than three days.
He must also inform the police, 7 days before his scheduled departure date.
If he does not communicate his movements to the authorities, he may be punished for up to five years of imprisonment.
Kent's police said it would not discuss any particular cases or potential Glitter movements in the county.
A spokesman from the Kent Police said "The Kent Police will do everything they need to protect our children as foreigners.
"we believe it is easier to monitor someone who lives in the United Kingdom because we have devices that can manage any potential risks, much more effectively.
"Protecting the people of Kent is the most expensive intention of the Kent Police, and we will closely monitor the behaviour of those who are accused of sexual abuse in the region, in order to minimize the potential risks for the public."
Glutter returned to the United Kingdom the last month after he had been in a Vietnamese prison for the abuse of two girls aged 10 and 11 respectively.
When he was released, Glitter took the plane for Bangkok where he would have to sail for a flight to London.
But he said he didn't feel well, and refused to leave for London.
The Thai authorities blocked him in passport control, and finally he left for Hong Kong.
The Chinese authorities refused his entry into their territory, so he was forced to leave Bangkok; the Thai police and immigration officers insisted that he return to England.
He finally arrived at Terminal 3 at Heathrow Airport on 22 August and stayed there while his lawyer, David Corker, went to Uxbridge, West London, for registration in the list of persons charged with sexual abuse, as Scotland Yard requires.
In the past, Glitter had already been punished for four months in the United Kingdom for holding child abuse images.
A source from the Ministry of the Interior stated that Jacqui Smith, the Minister of the Interior, was assured and happy to know that Glitter had been banned from moving in France and Spain.
"I photograph the master outside the scene to capture elements of his character" Günther Bauer - Photographer
No towels, no outer garments.
The essence of the great masters of flamenco, free of all tensions to obtain the desired aspect of man or woman.
On the one hand, the artist.
On the other hand, the person.
Inseparable except in the privacy, in these days unknown to the general public, where we discover intimate gestures and glances from artists who are not inclined to climb on stage.
The German Günther Bauer blends in "Flamenco - people" the theatre of some scenes with singers, dancers and guitarists with this least-known side of artists.
In this project, the photographer repeats the particular iconography of the flamenco under different English.
Even in the programming of the month of Flamande Photography, the exhibition "reviews the international importance of flamenco, the greatest daily", explains the creator, who explains that "Flamenco - people" "can be anyone but, after having seen the photos, the observer realizes that these are not typical images of artists on stage.
These people photographed "in the street" are artists capable of passing on scenes of passion, sadness, joy ... arresting the public.
To capture these artists' personality moments, there is no need to take photos on stage.
They have their own personality and character.
What I was interested was to create an intimate atmosphere that allows me to capture with the camera photo of the flamenco star personality moments."
With the "Chant popular des Mines" festival, Bauer started a long trip in 1997 to photograph the singers, guitarists or dancers with a camera camera.
These are pictures that, thanks to the choice of photo and material equipment, remember classical photography.
The implementation of different stylistic means breaks with the classic side of the image, giving it a touch of modernity, reflecting the perception of the flamenco according to Bauer: "A music with very traditional roots that evolves and dominates every day".
It is not about dance or song itself, but about the personality and character of the artist who captures the public with his art.
The search for essential and magic was the constant work presented here at the El Fotomata gallery.
The eyes of the flamenco such as Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo, among others, are part of the selection made from about sixty-ten photographers.
The project has become an anthology of flamenco, which will soon be published in a gallery portrait collection book.
The passion for Bauer's portraits led her to repeat the idea two years ago with the "SportART Project" (SportARTProject).
Although the concepts are different in "Flamenco - people", the photographer admits that he likes to photograph the portrait of people, to know them and to be able to enter their lives for a longer or less time.
I think the picture is the most difficult type in the picture.
You're facing people, people you don't know at times or who just leave you for a few minutes to make a photo.
Despite these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to make my ideas come true."
This collection of portraits of the current flamenco, called "Flamenco - people", is presented at the El Fotomata Gallery, located at number 20 of the street of the Mata (a parallel street to the Hercule People's Republic) which will be opened until 16 October next.
Vargas Llosa admits that the novel he wrote is "true audacity"
The novel takes place in places where no one knows and deals with unknown subjects, but once again Mario Vargas Llosa is very determined to advance the new project on which he is working, a novel that has for major character Roger Casemant, an Irish nationalist who has lived in Congo for 20 years and who has been through the Amazon.
The Nobel Prize in Literature admitted yesterday at Hay Festival Segovia that the novel that currently deals with it "is a real virtue" and that "all prove it shouldn't be written".
"If I were reasonable, I wouldn't do it, but I'm going to do it and I hope to finish it," he concluded in his speech at the exchange of ideas and thoughts that he'd seen in the city for four days when he saw hundreds of writers, historians and journalists and thousands of people.
The author of "The City and the Dogs" was the most expected person of the third edition of this festival and fulfilled his contract.
Vargas Llosa, who won the award of the Hay Festival to the majority of the participants' voices, made the concert hall in the Juan Bravo theatre.
The representative of the Festival, Félix Romeo, met up with a fascinating audience who had not seen the past hour during which Peruvian, with a prodigious memory and a large dose of humour, recalled the birth of his literary vocation, which was due to "his desire to read" and "to live new experiences"; how he wrote a "very technical way" through an intense work of documentation, correcting and rewriting part of the text to cope with "inspiration"; how Faulkner, Victor Hugo and Alexandre Dumas influenced his vocation and how his memories inspired his novels.
The Spanish-American novelist recognized that "there is no means" to measure and to know if books change life. "But I refuse to believe that literature is a pure pleasure, an epithemer experience," stressed Vargas Llosa, who said that it "has effects" and "and leads the least-like people," because the writers were asked "Don't let yourself go to the fraternity" and assume their vocation.
The worst time is when the Pozoblanco fair
The flagship party that ended the Pozoblanco fair tower races was suspended yesterday morning after the horse drivers checked that the air was improbable.
In this way, the organization committee, in agreement with Fermín Bohörquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonard Hernández, decided to suspend the celebration of the tour.
Bad weather was found on this stage, since at last two parties on three could not take place.
Saturday is the rain that prevented the celebration of the second scheduled tour of towers.
At the show there was José Luis Moreno, Curro Díaz and Juan Bautista, who had to face up to Castilblanco Air.
So only the party of the Friday took place
On Friday, the winner was Daniel Luque who cut three ears and was brought into triumph after making hand movements in front of the tower with taste and aesthetics.
At noon, too, Alejandro Talanante concluded on two banners planted on the back of the tower and a cut ear that the openings discovered cried more than his fight against the tower itself.
Even worse for El Juli, who has entered Los Llanos arenas without pain or glory.
When he fought with the second tower, after a much better fight, he became the target of most of the public.
Police control of a van in the province of Alava: two thousand kilos of hachisch found
Less than five o'clock in the morning.
Control of the movement of the police of Euskadi (Ertzaintza) at the border of the Commune d'Armiñón (Alava).
The police officers arrested two officers of a van and the two of them took off.
His charge, more than two tons of hachisch, is to stop them.
The police continued and arrested one of the two employees, a 28-year-old man, identified as A. A. J., according to information published by the Department of Internal Affairs of the Basque Government.
The individual arrested was accused of drug trafficking and falsification of documents.
The incident took place when several Alava Traffic Unit officials carried out vehicle control on N-1 at the border of the Arminjón Community.
They were about to stop a van for inspection when the driver failed to comply with orders, got very fast and the control started.
The police began their pursuit until the vehicle stopped two miles away on the ground, where the two employees were down to escape in a forested area.
The Basque police finally arrested one of the two employees and took the 2,178 kilograms of hamish they transported and found after inspecting the van, an Iveco Daily.
The rear part of the vehicle was loaded with hachisch balls. Then they moved to a police post for extensive inspection and drug abuse.
In addition, officials found that the registration plate had been "fashioned" because it did not match the written on the grey card of the supplynet, which was also due to the detention of a falsification of documents.
Ertzaintza continues its investigation to stop the other suspect, who has managed to find out and determine the origin of the drug seized.
The 28-year-old prisoner, A. A. J., has been detained for various purposes and will be judged within the following hours.
Actor Heather Locklear arrested for driving under the influence of a medicine
The actress Heather Locklear, the famous Amanda of the Melrose Place series, was arrested this weekend in Santa Barbara (California) for driving under the influence of a medicine.
A Witness tried to do it by trying to get out of his garage in Montecito, after a spokesman from the California police patrol sent him to the People magazine.
The witness explained that at 6:30 p.m., Locklear "was deeply supportive of the accelerator, making a lot of noise, trying to get out of the garage car, and walking behind several times, she was running on her sunglasses".
Not long afterward, the witness, who initially did not recognize the actress, saw Locklear stop in the middle of the car and got out of his vehicle.
This person, right now, called the emergency services because "she was worried about Locklear's life."
When the police patrol arrived, she found the actress sitting inside her vehicle, which partially blocked the road.
"It had desorbed air," that is why the agents led it to the drug and alcohol center to carry out a test.
According to a police spokesman, the actor became cooperative and alcohol abuse was eliminated from the start, although "according to the observation of police officers at first sight, we think Locklear was under the influence of a medicine".
Locklear was arrested suspected of being driving under the influence of a substance that was not specified and was uncared at 19.00 hours and was released a few hours later.
Two months ago, Locklear was out of Arizona's clinic where she was in to take care of a nervous depression.
Callazares asked the Andalusian Federation of the Union to assume its responsibilities in the case of Silva
The Secretary-General and Member of the Union, Gaspar Llamazares, said today that it is the regional federation to take a decision on the case of the former councillor of the Youth and Sports of the municipality of Seville, Francisco Manuel Silva, who resigned last week after being accused of ill-treatment to members of his family.
"In these cases, I am very federalist, and this will be the Andalusian organization that will assume its responsibilities," Llamazares said about the political party's behaviour that he should adopt within Séville's municipal council.
However, the Union's left-wing leader asked that investigations be "transparency" for the irregularities that Silva could have done: "The Union's left has always defended this kind of business because they have a maximum degree of transparency".
He also stressed that the political party has "very strict ethical codes for all officials".
Mayo's Blood, Garci's Dead Pair
In inspiration of the stories by Benito Pérez Galdós, José Luis Garci relives the famous Spanish battle against the French in "Mayo Blood", which is the most ambitious film of his film with nearly 15 million euro of budget.
The filmer tried to "scan out the many characters and illustrate the social analysis" that he always admired in the work of the famous novelist, he explained today during the film presentation, with Kim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría at the head of the long list of players.
The film lasts more than two and a half hours, "Mayo Blood" will be released in the next movierooms, which will then become a television series for Telemedrid for more than four hours.
The great admirer of Galdós' literature, José Luis Garci, is sure to have done this "a child's dream" through Esperanza Aguirre, who, three years ago, carried it out, turned a memorial film for the two hundred years of May 2, which he always accepted when the story was held in national historical facts.
The 15 million Euros provided by the Madrid Community constitute a "one chance" for Garci to reproduce with the appropriate decorations and clothing the environment of "a Spanish who has been deceived by the fight for independence, because the struggle for independence has led the people to rebellions under the reign of Ferdinand VII," he said.
But the cinematographer regrets that he did not receive funding such as for "Captain Alatriste" or "Goya's ghosts" - more than twice that obtained for "Mayo Blood" - because he could not turn some scenes written in a script signed by Horacio Valcárcel, with whom he worked during almost all his career.
The film "Return to Start" influenced his usual way of working, on the stage of actors, with whom he used to repeat before starting the tournament and to whom he did not throw, because it seemed to him "lowly" and he considered that "the role of the filmer is to go to the theater and cinema to keep him informed".
Many actors in "Sangre de Mayo" repeat before the camera, such as Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larrañaga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo.
Four times a candidate to Oscar (he won one), Garci considers that the three candidate films representing Spain this year at the Hollywood Academy, "Singre de Mayo", "Seven tables of French billard" and finally the winner, "The blind tournaments", are not representative of the young Spanish film, "who deserves to be better known", he said.
With this film Garci is not waiting for a price.
"At first you think you're working for Posterity, then you realize that you're working for prosperity, and now you're happy to make a more film," explains Garci after more than 30 years of career.
Isabelle Bayón puts in the skin of the savillary dancer Tortola Valencia
A sevillan dancer will also honor a sevillan dancer.
Carmen Tortola Valencia, daughter of a Catalan father (Florence Tortola Ferrer) and an Andalusian mother (Georina Valencia Valencia Valencia), is born in Triana district and will live in London with her family at the age of three.
It was a free and professional dancer of Oriental dances.
She had a passionate life, a pioneer of the woman's liberation, such as Isodora Duncan, Virginia Wolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was Buddhist and vegetarian and crying for the abolition of the course that prevented the free movement of women.
The life of this woman who marked the history of the dance in Europe of the inter-combatants, impressed Isabelle Bayón.
"I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and the last one offered me to interpret the heavy dancer Tortola Valencia and that seemed incredible to me."
According to the dancer, "we're not trying to tell her life but to translate her way of thinking.
His dance titles made me think about flamenco.
So "the dance of the papillon" made me think of a popular Cuban dance and "the dance of the snake" to some tangos.
His dance was sensual and they told me that my way of dancing was identical to the scene," she said.
The presentation was made through two significant contributions: that of Miguel Poveda who will sing Isabelle again in one of his shows, as he had done at "La doorta openta"; and that of Professor Matilda Coral, who was extremely interested in working with the student.
"Matilde transforms Tortola into a mature person.
I'm happy because she agreed to play a role in my work and that's my honor."
The scene was also presented thanks to the musical composition and the guitars of Jesús Torres y Paco Arriaga, the popular song by Michel Ortega, El Pulga y Moi de Morón; the percussion of El Pájaro, as well as the rape of Rafa El Viola and the collaboration of an actor, Juanfra Juárez, "which plays the role of the eternal partner of this kind of artist who was considered to be a Divas".
This work also relates in some way the life of this woman who has been exposed to places so far, especially for the time, such as India, the United States, or Russia, but also throughout Europe, as she usually lived in London.
"I wanted to remember it because I think it's these women who have a huge influence in their time and now nobody knows and appreciates her work," says Bayón.
The show will begin at 2030 on the Lope de Vega theatre
The publication of "A recently married poet's Journal" concludes the Triennat
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of the "Journal of a recently married poet" in Saint Stephen's church in New York, where Juan Ramón Jiménez married Zenobia in March 1916, is part of the activities planned by the Ministry of Culture of Andalousia to celebrate the "Treennat Zenobia and Juan Ramón " (2006-2008), organized to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the award of the Nobel Prize for Literature and their deaths.
Thus, the "Trennat Zenobia and Juan Ramón " will arrive at its end with the restoration of this work, with the International Congress that took place in New York, with the restoration of the Nobel Museum and with the traveling exhibition "Juan Ramón Jiménez: This people of light" which was opened in May last year and which, after traveling in the different Andalous provinces, will be in New York at the International Congress.
Similarly, the Andalousia Ministry of Culture bought eight hundred copies of the "Journal of a recently married poet", edited by Pedro Taberero and illustrated by Jacobo Pérez-Enciso, to continue the work of one of the most famous Andalusian poets.
America Please Less Without Paul Newman
"From time to time God created perfect humans
Paul Newman was part of it."
This phrase is from the actress Sally Field, who worked with him in "Abolition of Malice", and well illustrates the despair of American cinema, and of all America, facing the overwhelming idea that Newman is no longer of this world.
I'm sorry to get an Oscar
He hasn't been back since 2007.
Everyone knew he was sick.
That was a hard time for the whole world.
"Sometimes one feels more than any expression, and now I have lost a big friend," lamented Robert Redford, "my life and my country were better thanks to his existence."
No one was afraid of becoming ridiculous or exaggerating.
One of the fathers of cinema and patriotism died during a particularly dark period, where terrorists and bourgeois markets are afraid, the American estimate has fallen very low, desperately looking for reasons of dignity.
When times are so hard and there is no reason to live, there are no human beings left but admire and there is no need to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
It was an ideal of beauty and truth throughout the world.
He was the enemy of Richard Nixon and the defender of lost and won causes, such as the foundation for the anti-drug fight created in honour of his grandfather who died after a overdose and the creation of his own bio food brand.
This was a victory for a country that had been punished against a suicidal food culture.
This extensive wave of admiration led Hollywood to pay no attention to nationalities or passports.
The last James Bond, English Daniel Craig, found no James Bond dead before him.
Another Englishman, Miss Sam Mendes, said that working with Newman marked the top of his career.
The bad guy from Australia, Russell Crowe, was named Newman as his greatest inspiration.
"He placed the bar high," observed George Clooney, who might be the only one today who is trying to figure out the screen as Paul Newman did: by being very honest and having a serious private life and far from the goals.
This is not always easy or possible in today's media jungle.
But there's someone who's trying, and Paul Newman is an example.
After a divorce, he was married to Joanne Woodward for 50 years, to whom he was loyal even though he did not lack opportunities to be with him.
"But why should I eat a hamburger out of my house, if I have a biftock in my fridge?" he used to like it.
In heaven, he is proud to meet his daughters with his fans on earth, something that is not so common in America.
"Of all the great roles he has played, he has never been as proud as that of the devoted husband, the loving father, the caring father and philanthrophe," he says.
Madrid in the 2016 Olympics event
And yes, the dream of many of us is that Madrid can organize Olympic Games, after the failure in 2012, that could happen in 2016.
But I wonder if we're ready.
If we take the example of yesterday's race, we don't!
They call it the perfect course, but I think it was the best course I've ever attended.
If they had taken into account all the errors that occurred during the course, they would have been the subject of an Eliminative note.
But let's look at everything in detail and from the beginning.
Errors begin with the withdrawal of dosards, which forces you to move forward.
This is not bad, but if they can move you this would be better than they'd give you everything (including e-mail for courses).
And not at all.
They were just going down there to take the dosard (first error, move only for it) and (after a long delay) surprised!, there was only the size S for the maillet (second error, because I need a XL size)
In what world are we living?
Is it because of the crisis that they have decided to buy small-sized mellows with less fabric and less expensive cuts?
Well, this is nothing compared to what happened on the day of the race.
In addition to the fact that it has to go very quickly to remove the electronic plug, the waiting file is 15 minutes and, moreover, it has to leave its bag twice at the entrance.
The waiting lasted more than 35 minutes, which is understandable since 11,000 people are expected for these courses.
Since there was a long waiting file, the competitions started and we had not yet left our bag twice at the entrance, although one time the retirement was worse.
In addition, the rain accompanied the watch for more than 40 minutes during which rebels and bartenders took place.
I believe that about 500 people will have pneumonia tomorrow, and some people like me will not even be included in the classification with the right time, because of the noise they gave me who, I think, did not exactly mark the start.
Of course, if they asked me to quote a perfect example of course, that would not be particularly difficult for me.
So I think we can always dream of becoming the host city for the J.O. 2016.
Microsoft is looking for a recipient (virtual)
At the conference on MIT Emergency Technologies of Microsoft, a new system of recognition of image and human interaction was presented, a kind of artificial intelligence with little intelligence but capable of carrying out some basic tasks, such as calling a taxi (or in Microsoft's case a ship to move into the company's field) in response to what was asked of him during a conversation.
Thanks to a camera and a form recognition system and facial recognition, this "receptionist" can know how many people there are in place, which include - including remembering what jobs they occupy - and listening to and listening to the key words of their conversations.
But also group them by conversation groups
In the presentation video, the recipient detects a third person, but she understands that she is not part of the group that is talking to her and that she is not part of the company.
She asks him if she's here to visit someone and she tells him she'll answer him in a few moments.
All of this without a blue screen.
That's impressive.
But of course that represents the future.
Now the company has other things to focus on, for example on the next version of its operating system, Windows.
This week we talked about more than a change of strategy at Microsoft.
Windows 7 will be easier and it will no longer have associated programs.
Steve Ballmer discovered that if computers were sold with the essential instead of useless applications, they would be five times faster.
This is a discovery because Microsoft, version after version, has not stopped adding functions and "extras" to Windows.
The change of the strategy is welcome.
Microsoft is right, its operating system loses its importance but also its software.
When Google Chrome arrived on the network, I was one of those who joined the theory that Google Chrome was the first Google party to compete with Windows.
Many people have rightly stressed that an Internet browser is not an operating system.
The operating system will always be necessary because it is the necessary basis for the information material and software to be understood.
It plays the same role as your wife or your husband when you have to say something to your mother-in-law.
That's true.
It will never disappear but must see the "death" of the operating system not as an absolute truth but as a relative truth.
This week, Balmer confirmed this idea.
People pay less attention to the operating system but more to the Internet browser.
The computer is assigned only to turn Firefox, Explore or Chrome and every day people spend more time sailing on the Internet than crossing windows.
Who serves half of the applications provided with the system?
Who can at least.
And Windows 7 should contain fewer applications, much less Vista.
Less heavy, less covered months, less complex.
For the moment, Microsoft is more interested in starting its own online services to finally become an alternative to Google.
They desperately need it, in fact, and I'll show you an example.
The photo presented in this article was taken early this month in one of the rooms reserved for Microsoft employees in Redmond.
On the wine distributor, a display of their request to use their own search tool - "Your search. Our future."
In 2006, a study concluded that 66% of Microsoft employees used Google to search for information on the Internet.
Last week a delay occurred in the new version of Windows Mobile 7.
It will not leave at the beginning of 2009 but until the end of 2009 or see in 2010.
Microsoft will certainly try to launch at the same time Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7.
The phone, after all, looks more like a computer.
But the launch of Android is late and iPhone is already on the market, which will cost them.
Le Fabuleux Marcel
Pablo Picasso put it on the Cote d'Azur, Leonardo di Caprio took one into Edward Zwick ' s Blood Diamond, as well as Al Pacino into the Paris Ford Coppola ' s ' Parrain ' and became part of the association of muscle gays.
And if we were to count all its appearances, we could also mention this mustachu coast that raised weights in an ambulance.
It's not just a simple man's body mellow in cotton, mowing and without bruises.
The English call it 'tank' but the Brussels Fabuleux Marcel de Bruxelles distinguishes among all others.
First of all, by his flamming name - although known as Marcel ' - who has to see with the sport because he takes the name, according to legend, of the poet Marcel Cerdan, a lover of the singer Edith Piaf.
Marcel distinguishes others by his excellent coat, by his unisex cut, by his distinctive logo and by the small Belgian flag (recognisable punishment) that the most well-known bodymails have in the fold.
But be careful, because the Belgian brand does not produce only tanks tops.
But it also produces sweatshirts, retro boxes, catheme cardigans, cotton pants, babies, mini-shorts...
Traditionals designed for the comfort of clothes.
Even if it's harmful to wear them just like clothes.
They've got too much charm.
"I want to be a young mother; the candidate doesn't bother me"
His enormous similarity with his sister did not prevent him from developing his own personality.
Monica Cruz is small but full of vitality.
Currently, Cruz sisters take their new activity seriously in the fashion.
According to Monica, they are only beautiful and famous girls who claim their names.
She was present at the promotion of the Mango brand in Paris at her new social headquarters but also at the presentation of the most important prices of fashion than the Spanish home sponsors.
Monica's hot and scared.
Tell us what you're doing in Paris.
I have come to present my new collection that my sister Penelope and I have created for Mango for the new summer season, but also to attend the second edition of Mango Fashion Awards and the dinner of the Opera in the honor of Valentino.
A very intense day, but, at the same time, exciting, waiting for us.
On what basis is your new collection created for Mango for this fourth season?
The 50s and 60s film inspires us and inspires us a lot for our collections.
I love to dance in town and watch women to see how they are dressed, how they combine their clothes, I do it often.
Dancer, actress and designer, you're a very polyvalent woman, aren't you?
I believe that, but in the end, everything is together and these activities have many things in common.
Since I was very young, I liked clothes; I wanted to go to my grandmother to look at my aunt's closets and see her clothes.
It was great, almost better than going to the attraction park.
Then, when I became a dancer, I always tried to take care of my way of getting dressed.
The dancers love to be well dressed for courses and tests, to look in the mirror and feel good.
And in the role of an actress, when you wear your clothes is right now that you really put yourself in the person's skin.
At least it's all connected.
You haven't been there for 30 years. Has that been hard for you?
Not at all.
I feel better than I've ever been, I've been happy for 30 years.
I find that the woman is older, has more experience and lives with less problems.
The biological clock doesn't scare me.
I've done everything I wanted to do since I was young and this has given me a lot of inner happiness.
So you think you're gonna be mom?
Of course, I want to become a mother because my body asks for it and, more importantly, I want to be a young mother; I don't want to lose it.
As far as the candidate is concerned, I don't worry.
What I'm going to do is give my son a lot of joy and raise him with a lot of love.
We're going to the movie, you're waiting for the different movies you've turned last year to go out.
It's true. I'm so excited they're coming out.
I am a woman out of the theater, very patient and worried, I would like to have everything now but of course this is not possible.
I hate to see 'The Last Hour' and 'In Search of the tomb of Christ'.
To see what you're thinking...
A few days ago, you started on the passerale with Naomi Campbell, didn't you?
Don't say that!
I'm not up on the ladder to make the mangoin.
Simply, Naomi Campbell has called me, I know her from time to time, to invite me to participate in London to a challenge of charity for her association in support of women and the clothes we show - I showed two clothes from our collection created for Mango - were sold in cash to collect money for Naomi's NGO.
The people Naomi is a person in the heart of the tent.
They say so many things about her, I know her, many things are not true.
Moreover, that's how good Naomi is to me.
She asked me to stand up for a reason so noble, but if she asked me to do the drill, I would have done it at the same time.
The important thing is to make life better for women in the third world.
Alcohol recidivists on flight will have to install the 'alcolock' system.
The Minister of the Interior wants that the driver who has had more than three administrative penalties for alcohol should install in his vehicle a system that prevents the vehicle from operating in a state of emergency or if he does not breathe.
The initiative has already been announced in the last month of June and now appears in the State Minister's report in which this initiative is considered to be a pilot project that will last for a year.
His goal is to reintegrate the driver by offering him road retraining courses.
The Minister of State for Road Safety but also the Directorate-General for Road Safety and the Institute of Technology for the Safety of Vehicles will participate in this initiative.
According to statistics, between 30% and 75% of car drivers arrested for driving more than once in a state of emergency are driving.
Alcohol would avoid this because it is a white system on the vehicle that measures the alcohol rate in the trailer and prevents the vehicle from starting if the driver does not breathe before; or when the driver's alcohol rate is higher than the authorised one.
Its cost is over EUR 1,000 and is in charge of the driver.
In this regard, a study conducted in the United States in 2007 showed that vehicles equipped with this device were reduced to 65 per cent of the offences during the first year of installation.
And in Spain it is estimated that this could save 115 people every year.
This measure is considered to be administrative sanctions for two reasons: to face these behaviours before they become criminal offences.
And facilitate its implementation, as legal reform may be done by ordinary means, but criminal reform requires an organic law reform.
The device is not yet available on the Spanish market in no commercial form, although some industrial vehicles and functions already have an experimental title.
In the morning, the Congress of Members will vote on an initiative by the Spanish socialist party that proposes to install this system in school buses as it was done in France.
Mexico without 'peep-toes'
At 7:40 p.m., the scheduled official hour, the plane of the Spanish Air Force in which the Asturias were travelling landed in the presidential Hungarian airport Benito Juárez of Mexico DF.
The sun was about to fall, but its rays were still obliged to put their hands in the guideway so that they could see the royal couple coming down from the plane.
At the foot of the stairs, the Spanish ambassador and other authorities were present.
A few hours ago I asked the taxi driver if he was aware that the Spanish Princes were visiting the city to finish their official trip.
- Oh, very well, since we can't go to the airport to take customers at this hour... are you here or...?
- No, no, sir, I'm Spanish, but I've lived here thinking for two years.
- Oh, very well...
But the Mexican press knows very well who are the Princes of Asturias and knows the importance of the trip.
They are several waiting in the airport hangar near the red tape and a military range of 27 marine soldiers.
The Prince is smiling and dressed in sea blue, the Princess, when she has hair in the wind, is very dressed and does not wear her usual 'peep-toes'; perhaps they had told her that a prayer was threatening.
They have a brief stop with photographers before they pass into the hall where the official court is waiting for them.
At the hotel door where they live, one of the four largest hotels in the city, a regular Mexican television journalist awaits them.
The most prestigious price of the fashion
There must be no more suitable place in the world to present a fashion price than Paris and there must be no designer living more extraordinary and good living than Valentino.
Mango has just presented the second edition of the Button Mango Fashion Awards to strengthen the international image of the new fashion talents.
The winner will be rewarded by a EUR 300,000 price.
Yesterday Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first edition, looked at her models in Mango wine at 54 Boulevard Haussmann in Paris and she almost cried.
Of course it is the second largest market store in Europe that has just been opened with 1.335 square meters of surface.
The first shop is in London.
The events, as well as the wish to thank Stylist Valentino, the chairman of the competition jury, made us find ourselves in a luxurious dinner at the opera Garnier de Paris.
With the extraordinarily close table of the Chagals family, the presidential table prepared by Mango seemed even more spectacular.
Having grown up on the heart and doing against evil good heart, due to the recent death of her brother, Nati wore Mango's clothes and some pairs of ELAH, who cut her breath, and arms, hands down with her son Luis - a nice man almost two meters high - she accompanied Valentino to his dinner prepared for her honor.
Andik, Mango's owner, a man's galant, and Rotchil's Baron have spent the night without clothes because they've prepared them for two ladies.
Monica Cruz, who was present at the store with a pants and shirt - from her own collection - and who for dinner had metemorphosed herself by wearing a long and black dress, got away during the night visit of the opera, accompanied by Goya Toledo, showed us the repeat room of the ballets and reminded us of the good old time, took one of the bars and managed a large dance.
Inês Sastre is not left for the visit of the palace's dependencies, but she showed us on her mobile phone her son's photos.
The next morning, we had the pleasure of seeing Olivier Martínez – another nice man who moves on a motorcycle – and John Travolta, who arrived at the intercontinental hotel in Paris, with his shoulders, his servants and asking for the front door, that there were no fans in his room.
Stars under the star sky of Paris.
Oh, it's life.
1001, anti-stress number
There are only 1,000 but 1001 ways to forget the chaos and frenzy of everyday life.
And to cover everything, they are all listed in a book that will bring relief to the librarians on September 30.
The morning morning awakens us almost every morning at 7:00, but it is even worse when we think of the rhythm of activity that imposes on us the present life.
The office is synonymous of tension and the computer of pain twice.
Stress represents the evil of the 20th century.
But there are no two ways to combat daily fatigue and the problems associated with the world of work.
But 1001, one more or one less.
In addition to Yoga positions, classic massage or 'spa' treatments, Susannah Marriott gathers in the pages of a book any 'menu' of methods adapted to the taste and time of each.
The anti-stress work is entitled ' 1001 ways to relax ' and will arrive directly at the libraries of editors Pearson Alhambra and DK.
If someone believes that it is impossible to find peace in places such as work or through personal relationships, this 'manual' tends to be such a belief.
In addition, this manual offers other methods such as contact with nature or 100% natural products that help you relax.
If the adrenaline is not short in your veins to restore balance of your body and if the stress becomes a problem, it is time to sit in the couch, shut your mind down and focus on reading.
Speak in & Sleep
Some kids talk during the night.
I don't report to those who wake up very excited by telling us something that happened the day before, but to children who speak during their sleep.
The first time this happens may surprise you, but it doesn't really matter.
It's a blessed alternative to sleep called sleepyloquie.
It's pretty common, especially in children and adolescents.
There's probably more than one talking during the night.
This phenomenon may appear very sporadic (once in life, for example, associated with a severe fever episode), or more periodically (every day, once a week, once a month...), the day after the child is no longer remembered.
There is no single cause that determines its appearance
They are often related to other changes in sleep such as sleeping, night earthquakes, nightlife (lower bed napi) or sleepbulism, but this is not always the case.
As we have already said before, they can also be associated with very strong fevers, stressful or overexcited situations.
Anyway, it's a study phenomenon.
The intensity with which it is produced is also very variable.
He may speak with a small voice, with isolated words, with murals or otherwise with crises, flowers, long speeches ...
In the event that somniloquiry becomes very common, it would be fair to observe the child and consult a specialist, to check if there is a problem that causes much concern and to get an explanation.
We said that it is a blessed alternative, so there is no treatment, unless it is related to another somnolence that can be treated (for example, if it is related to a somnolence or stress apnea).
What we can do is take into account a number of very simple preventive measures such as:
Try not to scare the child before going to sleep.
Therefore, seek quiet games and avoid TV programs or series that are more or less violent.
With very nervous children and those who have to quit, relaxation techniques can be used to help them calm down inside.
This will allow the child to have a more sensitive sleep.
Since dreams appear to be trying to stay calm.
Remember that they are harmless to the child and that the next day he will no longer remember what happened.
Practical Tips
Don't wake him up.
It's useless because he's unconscious and you'll wake him up.
Even if he's talking, he's hurt and he's resting.
Remember, if you experience anxiety several times, it is recommended to consult a doctor or to check what causes so much anxiety in the child.
If you understand what he says (which is not normal), do not try to question him for information.
You won't get anything, because sleeping, he's not aware of being able to organize his thoughts.
In addition, you will hear what he says, but you will not miss what he is dreaming about, at the same time pay attention to how you interpret the information and the conclusions you draw.
Never tell the child you can ask him during the night to know his secrets.
Not even a pleasure.
This causes a lot of anxiety.
In conclusion, don't worry, it's nothing bad, it's an episode that lasts only a few minutes.
Illusion... end.
Illaeusern finally found the way of victory on his ground after a long period of diet.
Without a big match, the Young and Blacks created the largest number of opportunities and succeeded in transforming them into one for the win of the match.
The rhythm was not very supported during this meeting where attackers had been wrong to express themselves.
After a first attempt by Captain Kauffmann who was working on a long shot, Illhaeusern was going to take the climb and turn around Funderflick away, then with Hirn above, Roman of the foot or yet Diebold came to cathode the defense of Dannemarie.
In front, a block was made in the middle of the ground and the Rihai was just left at the point of the attack.
The start of the second half-time was to be decisive with the first two signs of Rihai and Temporal for Denmark, and immediately after the opening of the score for the Illhousians by Marais, well placed to take a ball back on a first attempt by Diebold (53e).
But the Butter Illhousiens will not be able to be happy for a long time and will be forced to rehabilitate the wearers a dozen minutes later and thus leave their crews in a numerical minimum.
But Dannemarie will not be able to take advantage of it and will not pose major problems to an Illhosian Eleven who just collected a bit to "compared" his defense, banned in all the last seconds of the game where, after a big cafouflage, the ball went very close to the crosswalk.
Sarkozy to meet the angry fishermen
Before calling to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will make a trip by Britain.
In the face of the strong demonstration of fishermen who strongly disturbed the access of several bridges and norms, the President of the Republic decided to go to the port of Guilvinec in Finistre to meet their representatives.
They promised to welcome him "in a constructive spirit" and hope he "will come with concrete proposals".
A presidential visit which falls at the same time as the general meeting of the "crisis committee" created by Breton fishermen to obtain measures to deal with fuel prices, which has reached a record of more than EUR 1.14 per litre per litre.
According to Elysée David Martinin's spokesman, the president "will discuss with them solutions that can be imagined to help their businesses find competitiveness and to ensure the conditions of employment and compensation for seafarers".
Nicolas Sarkozy is expected to stand firm by the fishermen.
On Tuesday morning, they carried out rescue operations in Morbihan and Calvados, which took place about 10 km away.
The happy port of Quiberon was also blocked, but links to Belle Island were not stopped.
A filter barrier has been launched on the nearby island of Quiberon.
The mariners have already shown their determination on Monday to burn, from the well, pneups and pallets in front of the warehouses of Brest's ports, and Lorient, while demonstrations took place in Concarneau or Saint-Brieuc.
The movement spread to other ports of the Atlantic and Manche, such as the Sables of Olonne, in Vendée, where the chalutians remained at quai, or at Havre, where twenty ships blocked the movements of trade vessels.
The fishermen of La Turballe and the Croisic, in Loire-Atlantic, stopped in the evening the blockade of the important total refinery of Donges.
Those of Boulogne-sur-Mer decided to wait for the Wednesday meeting to be held in the ministry to decide on possible actions.
In Guilvinec, the "crisis committee" must decide on Tuesday on the follow-up to the movement and its full participation in the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
However, some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by national fisheries committee officials who have not supported their movement.
"The famine will continue" because "fishers won't leave anything" and "they don't want to move to Paris," said Liliane Cariou, president of the Lorient Fisheries Committee.
Professional fishermen, who do not pay gas taxes, are currently suffering about 50 cents per litre, but they believe that a ship's profitability threshold is only reached with a fuel of less than €0.30 per litre.
Paul Newman the Magnificent
The outstanding interpreter of "Butch Cassidy and Kid" died from cancer at the age of 83 in his home of Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford or yet Sam Mendes welcomed the legend of the film and the committed actor, Paul Newman, who died at the age of 83.
Embrate maintains its delivery forecasts in 2008
The Brazilian aircrafter has delivered a table of 215 aircraft this year despite the threats of recession that are on the world economy.
The fourth World Aeronautics Builder, Embraer, maintains its delivery forecasts for 2008 with 215 delivered devices, reaffirmed Fredrico Fleury Curado, his president.
In the first half, the pilot delivered 97 planes.
The Brazilian manufacturer hopes a lot of Chinese market, including for its range planes ranging from 30 to 120 seats.
Today, Embraer delivered 41 devices to Chinese customers in eight years.
AIG would consider paying more than 15% of its assets
The American International Group, which the American monetary authorities have invested in, intends to pay more than 15 per cent of its assets in order to reimburse it for the $85 billion advanced, according to the Dominal Edition of the Financial Times.
AIG is ready to study the sale of most of its activities beyond its international life insurance and its activities in the United States, as the journal quotes from close sources of the case.
The Board of Directors of the AIG met in the evening to consider any assignments, according to the FT.
No confirmation could be obtained with AIG.
The assets that AIG intends to separate include its International Lease Financial Corp., its 59 per cent participation in the Transatlantic Holdings reconsurer, as well as its real estate portfolio and its private equity investments, add the FT.
No definitive decision was taken on these concessions, followed by the FT.
AIG must quickly make liquidity payments in order to repay the loan of 85 billion which has made it possible for the Federal Reserve to see the US authorities take 80 per cent of its capital, double the current shareholdings.
Analysis Paris Session History Morning Meeting History Morning Meeting
The New York Bourgeois has been accused of a historic fall on Monday after the resignation of the House of Representatives of the Banking Plan Paulson: the Dow Jones lost 6.98 per cent, or a loss of 800 points, and the Nasdaq 9.14 per cent.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) has raised 777.68 points to 1O.365.45 points.
In terms of points, the most severe fall in its history (684.81 points) had previously been recorded on 17 September 2001, the date on which the exchange was resumed after the terrorist attacks of 11 September.
The Nasdaq, technologically dominant, dropped 199.61 points to 1,983,73 and the Standard & Poor's 500 8.81% extension index (i.e. 106.85 points), to 1,106,55 points, according to the final closing figures.
Already depressed at the beginning of the meeting, Wall Street became focused after the unexpected rejection by the House of Representatives of the Banks Rescue Plan, which should allow for some stability on the markets.
By 228 votes to 205, the representatives rejected the Secretary of the Treasurer Henry Paulson's request.
Nearly two thirds of the Republicans rejected its plan.
"It's a bad signal sent to the market, which sees the Congress unable to adopt a plan," said Lindsey Piegza, FTN Financial.
"It shows where the market was on this plan," she added, fearing that a project adopted several days would not be "too late".
"If the project is really fatal... then the deal will be quickly passed on to the Fed (the Central Bank of America, ndlr) and other central banks to manage the crisis, which would increase the credit conditions," said Brian Bethune, head of the global economy.
And further stressing the sense of urgency, "every day that brings the fall of a financial institution" to the United States, she stressed Piegza.
Following the failure of Washington Mutual vendredi, the authorities organized the capture of Wachovia’s bank activities by its Citigroup rival.
In Europe, the crisis has rapidly accelerated, leading to emergency intervention for banks in the United Kingdom, Benelux, Iceland and Germany, a sign that markets face "not only an American crisis but a global crisis," added the Financial FTN analyst.
The mandatory market is very high.
The value of the 10-year-old Treasurer's profit was 3,632 per cent, compared with 3,827 per cent on Friday evening, and from 30 to 4,161 per cent, compared with 4,357 per cent on the watch.
Obama, winner of the first TV series
In the first Friday debate between the two candidates at the Blanche House, another to learn who, from John McCain or Barack Obama, carried it.
Not surprisingly, the Republican and democratic campaign QGs announced their own victory in this television doodle that would have been followed by a third of the American families.
Political analyst David Gergen believes that John McCain's performance, although honorable, has not been "bright enough" to allow him to throw himself down in the presidential polls for five weeks.
The Gallup Institute, whose survey of Sadi's opinion gives five points to Obama (49% to 44% in McCain), considers that it is the democracy that has taken its lead in the game.
Of the independable electors, who are the accountants, Obama has won 39% of the candidates, while 25% of them are awarded the victory in McCain, according to a CBS survey.
Obama should be able to confirm his progress on Thursday with the welcome performance of his co-lister, Joseph Biden, during his first and only public debate with his rival, Sarah Palin.
"That would be an error of the underestimator.
She has good instincts," however Bill Clinton prevented this weekend.
The Septuagint McCain has not stopped putting forward its indisputable experience in foreign policy, while emphasizing his opponent's "failure" on these issues that were at the heart of this first face-to-face.
" Senator Obama doesn't seem to understand that..." he accused several times.
"I do not believe that Senator Obama has the experience and knowledge necessary to be president," he also said.
An attack angle marked yesterday in public television advertising.
Obama stressed to him that he was the future.
Without self-defense, it shows itself conciliatory and precise.
It has put forward its ability to make good decisions, and to restore the image of the United States in the world.
"McCain doesn't always understand, while Obama, if," he said, this weekend, a democratic spot that appealed to the Republican that he had not taken all the measure of the impact of the crisis on "The American of the Street."
"During the four and twenty ten minutes of the debate, John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing about you, announced Obama yesterday, before 20,000 people assembled for an electoral meeting in North Carolina under a fighting rain.
He did not even say the words "mean class" or "workers". The financial gap clearly benefits Obama, which is considered by the Americans as the most important to save the economy on the basis of the principle.
"The next week could be a decisive turn," he thought yesterday was the influential democratic senator Charles Schumer.
Democratic representative Rahm Emanuel, an elder from Clinton administration, compared Obama's "good economic instincts" to Bill Clinton's during the 1998 financial crisis.
For the democratic candidate, the current debuckle "is the final eight years of a bad economic policy implemented by George Bush and supported by Senator McCain".
Reaffirming that even if 95 per cent of US taxes were to be reduced despite Wall Street's surpluses, the Illinois Senator also noted that the country's potential energy independence by promoting renewable energy was its first priority, with the establishment of a health insurance system.
McCain, he wanted to build a park of 45 nuclear power stations by 2030.
However, the two candidates ignored the issues relating to the financial savings plan of $700 billion (470 billion) adopted by the Congress last night and extremely unaccompanied.
In Minsk, "Did you notice there was a choice, you?"
Young people and oppositioners appeared on Sunday evening at the main place of the Belarusian capital in order to reject the results of the legislation.
Several hundred of Béloruses met on Sunday at the closure of the voting offices at Minsk's central place to protest against the fraudulent nature of the legislation.
While no results had yet been announced, many young people had come to express their opposition to the authority of President Alexandre Loukachenko: "the dictator, the resignation".
Some have not even voted, "That's good, because they'll do what they want from my voice," said one youth.
They do not believe that the regime that has made a good impression on foreign observers in order to regain language with the European Union is ready to make a democratic turn.
The sanctions, including the ban on visas for 40 Belarusian leaders and the gel of certain assets, could be lifted if these elections were considered by observers themselves.
They didn't do it because of the opposition.
"We have been held apart from electoral committees and our observers have not been able to participate in the demolition," said Iuri Potemkine, the Union spokesman for the Democratic Forces, a heterogeneous group of 12 parties.
"It is a cosmetic change, highlighted by Alexandre Millinkievitch, former candidate for opposition to the 2006 presidential and head of the European movement file, because the important thing is that we have the votes, and we have the executive power.
If opposition Members enter Parliament, they would have been appointed, not elected.
But their entry into Parliament can mean space for television, meetings in regions and legislative proposals."
The opposition must therefore be involved in the political game because dialogue with the European Union must be started.
Because if our economy, which is heavily affected by Russia, is faced with a crisis, and we are not reforming ourselves, we are at risk of becoming a protector of Russia.
But we want to be independent."
The opposition is afraid that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe that followed the electoral process does not recognize the validity of the investigation.
She stressed that the participation figures seemed too high, and that the generalization of the vote by anticipation (26 per cent of the voters in Minsk) opened the voice to all manipulations.
"Have you noticed that there was an election, you? asks social-democrat Alexander Kozoulin, one of the last two political prisoners released in August of this year.
There was no one in the voting offices.
And there will be at least five Members of the opposition to Parliament, those who deserve the best of their power."
The silence of the night fell on the place of October.
On television, President Loukachenko and members of the Central Electoral Commission are pleased with their success.
The interview - Of blood became safe
Hema-Québec celebrated his 10th anniversary, and his President, Dr. Francine Décary, had reason to rejoice because Hema-Québec became one of the world's most secure and effective blood providers.
And above all, he acknowledged the public's confidence that had been severely exploited by the blood scandal contaminated in the 1980s and 1990s.
As we know, national blood reserves managed by the Canadian Red Cross Transfusion Service have been contaminated by the virus of acquired immunodeficiency (VIH) and hepatitis C virus during the 1980s.
In view of this drama and the horror of the public, in February 1994, the Government of Canada set up a public investigation, chaired by Judge Horace Krever, an investigation aimed at giving light to the circumstances leading to such a tragedy and making recommendations so that such a disaster no longer occurs.
While Judge Krever was late to deposit his report, some provinces therefore set up a committee aimed at planning a new blood management system in Canada.
In Quebec, the Gélineau Committee fulfilled this mandate.
Following the Gélineau and Krever reports, two suppliers were created in Canada: Hema-Quebec to serve Quebec and the Canadian Blood Society to provide all other provinces and two territories.
"In 1998, when Hema-Québec began its activities, although 38 per cent of the people still had confidence in the Quebec blood system, Dr. Décary recalls.
The situation was discouraging.
In an effort to improve the safety of blood products and work on the ground during the years that followed, we regained public confidence," she said before she said with pride that at the beginning of 2008, almost 94 per cent of the Cuban population now had confidence in Hema-Quebec.
However, Dr. Décary keeps in mind that "trust is something extremely fragile".
Since its creation on 28 September 1998, Hema-Québec has applied the precautionary principle.
At this time, a new variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease was being used in Europe to exclude many cases of the human form of public cow disease, which has been very strong since its foundation in 1998.
"And we didn't even know if this disease could be transmitted by blood.
We therefore supported one of the main recommendations of the Krever and Gélineau reports, which, when we do not know it and that a serious disease can cause it, in the event of Creutzfeldt-Jakob's disease, which is characterized by a degeneration of the brain that leads inevitably to death, exclusion measures are introduced.
In April 1999, therefore, the blood of people who had lived for more than a month in the United Kingdom has been refused since 1980.
And a few years ago, he was shown beyond any doubt that this disease is transmitted by blood.
This episode has thus shown us that the precautionary principle that has been applied has meaning."
In 1999 a much more sensitive testing technique for HIV appeared on the market: nuclear acid tests (TAN) that allow the presence of the virus directly in the blood of the donors and not the antibodies against the virus, on which the tests were used until then.
TANs have been able to accelerate the customs period, which extends between the time when the person has been infected and the time when the first viruses can be detected in the blood by our techniques, explains the specialist.
This period could be reduced to less than one week.
This has significantly reduced the risk of some donors being infected without knowledge and cannot be detected.
These improvements have led to a significant reduction in the risk of contracting AIDS through blood transfusions.
Today, a person of 12 million is at risk of receiving HIV-infected blood.
"In other words, this means that 12 million blood products should be distributed before someone is infected with HIV.
As Hema-Québec distributes between 400,000 and 500,000 blood products each year, it will take more than 24 years before a case of HIV transmission by a blood product occurs.
I think it can be easy today to accept or prescribe a blood transfusion to cover health," says Hema-Quebec's head.
"Our challenge for the next decade is to maintain the safety of our products.
We never know which pathogen will emerge in the system.
Not later than last year, the Chikungunya virus appeared on the island of the Réunion, which was transmitted by an insect into the blood by means of the West Nile virus.
Hema-Québec also has to provide sufficient supplies to be kept under constant surveillance," continues Dr. Décary, before he highlights that in addition to security supplies.
"The needs are increasing because the population is old.
Anticancer treatments are more aggressive, patients often need a red blood cell or platelet transplant.
The ageing of the population also has an impact on the network of blood donors, which includes only 3% of Quebecans eligible for blood."
However, any person in health who is 18 years of age and who is more responsive to the eligibility criteria can be given blood every 56 days, six times a year.
On average, 14% of those offering their blood are not accepted, because they are infected with AIDS or malaria, for example, and if they have traveled to a country where malaria is endemic, they will be excluded for a year.
"With these 3%, we are able to maintain an inventory that meets the needs of hospitals.
The losses are very rare.
But members of this network need to be renewed as they grow older and can no longer give their blood.
But it is difficult to convince people to give their blood, but especially to hold them and encourage them to become regular donors.
Today's life is so bleak, we rarely find time to spend an hour giving of his blood," laments Francine Décary.
With an annual budget of $297 million, Hema-Québec provides not only blood products but also human tissues, including bone cracks, heart valves, eye globes and skin that is almost exclusively used for large fuels.
These tissues are analysed, processed and frozen before being deposited in Hema-Quebec, which also manages the only public blood bank in Quebec.
The ombiliary cord, which was considered nambas as a biomedical waste, is resistant to rich blood in dry cells that can be used to treat serious diseases such as leukemia.
"We celebrated, a few weeks ago, the banking of our thousandth blood samples of cordon and it is planned to take over more than a thousand a year.
It should be proposed for seizures at the beginning of next year," states Dr. Décary, who described this treatment program as very popular.
"Many mothers are discouraged from having access to it," because Hema-Quebec does not have the means to propose this complex and cost-effective program in all hospitals in Quebec.
Soccer - The Half-End Impact
The Montreal Impact has been qualified for the semi-final round of the first USL series elimination series, thanks to a 3-1 (4-3 in total) victory at the expenses of the Seattle Sounders yesterday, during the second and decisive match of the final quarter series at the total goals, in the Saputo Stadium.
The field environment Antonio Ribeiro marked the decisive goal at the 90th minute of the game.
After a first half without purpose on the one hand as on the other, the field environment of David Testo and Rocco Plantentino marked the other fields of demonstration training.
Roger Levescu was the only one to play Matt Jordan for the Sounders.
Recall that during the first game of the series to go back, Friday, the Impact had a 2-1 defect in Starfire Complex, Tukila, in Seattle.
The impact will be measured at the Whitecaps of Vancouver in half-final.
On Saturday evening in Minnesota, Thunder has raised a 3-1 deficit in the return match to import it 4-3, but the Whitecaps have also access to the semi-final round 5-4 to the total objectives.
The Impact should face the Whitecaps Friday and Sunday, but the details of the series will be confirmed today.
A Letter - Kovalev's Victory Butt
The third Canadian number is ready to start the season.
The unit composed of Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanetec and Andrei Kostitsyn encouraged the attack in a 3-2 Canadian race race against the Florida Panthers last night at the Bell Centre.
Kostitsyn, the first star of the meeting, marked a goal, Plekanec collected two aids, and Kovalev picked up a passage in this prize, the fourth of the Tricolore in six preparatory matches.
Kovalev gave the victory by marking the only purpose of the shooting.
"I'm not ready yet, Russia has prevented.
I need another match to feel comfortable."
"He tried too much in the first period, noted Guy Carbonneau.
But I think he appreciated the end of the match.
He's had a nice ovation."
Charest on the North
The Prime Minister does not exclude the holding of elections before the end of the year
Shortly after the general council of the Liberal Party ended, Jean Charest met yesterday in Jean-Talon, Quebec, where the new Minister of Health, Yves Bolduc (left), tried to elect himself on the occasion of the partial election today.
"Reinforcing the limits of our last large North border" is the long-term ambition that Jean Charest presented with visual force still remaining in the large lines, at the end of the general council of the Liberal Party of Quebec, Levis yesterday.
After him, during his speech, a kind of Moulin was designed for images.
On three large screens, they were turned into a hole with spectacular glass of hydroelectric bars, mining operation, from Quebec seen by "Google Maps", cards, etc.
Large means such as during the electoral period.
On a press basis, the prime minister refused to state that he would deplore the elections, even though he noted that his time was very busy.
The "North Plan" is the fourth bread of a "vision" that the prime minister claims to have for Quebec, the "new economic space", which includes an agreement on working hand with France, an agreement between Canada and Europe and agreements with Ontario.
The opening of the North - the northern territory in the 49th parallel - has often been mentioned in the first Minister's speeches recently.
However, the prime minister was eager to explain why the North was "a great pleasure to the potential", but he did not give up time, investment amounts, or specific priorities in future projects.
All but a few of the advantages of what could be further developed: hydroelectricity, forestry, but especially the mining sector, driven by the growth of emerging countries and the reconstruction of public infrastructure.
The North contains "nicel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and even diamond", according to Mr. Charest's number.
This "field twice as large as France", "is with us, it's in Quebec.
Not only is it with us, but it is with us," he insisted, as well as to show that he was requesting a national founding myth.
Québec built a great deal in its relationship with the North, he stressed: the road towards gold in Abitibi, the Quebecian engineering, the Bay James.
"It's for us, it's for our future," he added, after having taken a theoretical break to count the huge card behind him.
The North, 70 per cent of the Quebec territory, including a portion of Labrador which Quebec has always claimed, has specified the prime minister at the press point.
"It is a traditional position that all governments have repeated.
There is a border line on which there has been no agreement for a long time, and when the opportunity arises, I repeat this position on behalf of the Government," he said.
In the meantime, "with climate change, we need to rethink our view of the North," he said, speaking of the North-West Pass, which will open all year due to the source of ice.
In this new geopolitical context, the prime minister considers that the occupation of the territory is a duty.
And the inhabitants of the territory, the First Nations and the Inuits?
The Prime Minister said that the Government of Quebec would be very careful about them and that the project would benefit them, including young people.
Two former ministers from two different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (formerly Pequiste Member of Ungava), have already begun consultations with 30 communities.
An interministerial committee chaired by Benoît Pelletier and in which Julie Boulet (Transport and Natural Resources) had an important place in its work.
The prime minister does not exclude a big meeting, "not necessarily a summit", but a time when "a common vision will be given".
The development of the North would also be in line with the principles of sustainable development.
The North Plan will be "coherent, orderly and respectful of the environment", he promised.
Jean Charest described this "vision" as continuing with the first liberal minister who preceded it.
"As the liberals before us, we have thought differently to transform the challenges into new opportunities for growth and development."
This was also one of the recurring topics at the end of the week, which was started on Friday by a big cocktail to highlight the 50th anniversary of Jean Lesage's arrival at the party's head.
One of the resolutions adopted proposes rebaptizing the Beauharnois Centre in Barrage Adélard-Godbout.
"From Godbout, who created Hydro-Québec, in Lesage, who made the Peace Revolution and Nationalization of Hydroelectricity in Bourassa, who made the Bay James, our part has forgotten the future," said Jean Charest.
In a press release, he called for another reference, conservative there, John Diefenbaker's "Roads to the North" program, the first minister from 1957 to 1963.
In addressing Eastmain1a-Ruper's hydroelectric barrier project, Mr. Charest stressed that his service was planned for 2012.
"It's still between us, but I'm going to be there," he told his soldiers, raising them to cry for food.
In fact, the prime minister, who said in April that there would be no elections in 2008 and no doubt in 2009, did not differ in the possibility of launching a self-examination test, which the law permits.
He stressed, however, that his time was fulfilled, including by a mission from the Federation Council in China and a Québec-New York summit.
At the end of the week, the General Council provided the Liberal Leader with a platform containing nationalist resolutions, including "constitutional aspirations" which were passed as a letter to the post: the PLQ called for recognition of the "specificity of Quebec" in the Constitution.
He also wanted Quebec to appoint members of the Canadian Radio and Telecommunications Council and that they had a veto right to decisions taken in Quebec.
On the side of the opposition, large lines of the North Plan were welcomed with scepticism.
The pequiste chief, Pauline Marois, drew attention to the North Quebec Development Policy launched by the Landry Government in 2001.
According to it, the liberal government, when it came to power in 2003, refused to apply it.
If he had done so, "we would be more advanced today" commented Mrs. Marois next to her candidate in Jean-Talon (srutin who is present today), Françoise Mercure.
ADQ said to support the adoption of a North Plan by the government.
"But what we want is that this isn't just a show," commented leader Sébastien Proulx, replacing Mario Dumont, who is returning from vacation today.
Letter - A Dedicated Country
It was Mr. Vic Toews, former Minister of Justice (an irony) in Harper's office, who was allowed the last summer to say of Louise Arbour that she was a "honest" for Canada.
So commend this woman who has fought an intense fight for justice and who deserves all our admiration as long as the prime minister's visit to Stephen Harper himself.
We are facing a government that is the only one, among all the Western countries involved, that has not returned its infected native to the Guantánamo concentration camp.
A government that does not take into account the fact that Omar Khadr was a youth at the time of the facts that were being challenged.
The only government that, despite Canada's signature of the Geneva Convention, rewords its word and lets a child soldier grow into inhumane conditions.
The only one who is referred to a parody of justice to assess the guilt of the accused.
Let us recall that UNICEF, the International Amnesty and the Canadian Bar Association, in particular, complain about Omar Khadr's repatriation in order to benefit from a fair process in Canada.
It is the same government that closes its eyes to torture: it does not matter whether a young adult is now mentally destroyed, no doubt never after so many years of exaggeration.
We are not aware of this yet, but we are now assisting in an insatiable erosion of our rights, our freedom and our "democratic" word that Harper does not stop burning and that sounds like he believes in his mouth.
The time has come when there is no morality: we can harm, torture, arbitraryly imprison a Canadian citizen according to the good will of a head of government until now (that it will be after 14 October...).
Many voters believe that they will find salvation in a party that curses the Vertu, the Law and the Order: they do not see that this government has given up on what it has done to our country's reputation and dignity.
The shame, Mr. Toews, she's here in this resignation, and no more.
Free Opinion - The discourses of the Barrick Gold
In its September 17th edition, Le Debor published a letter from Mr. Patrick J. Garver, Vice-President of the Canadian Miner Barrick Gold.
Following an orwelling logic, he claims that the largest company in the world has attempted to spread out six million against three authors and a small publishing house with no purpose in order to launch a "transparent public debate".
If it is true that the judges are independent and impartial, this is not the truth they judge, especially in the case of prosecutions in defence, but the law.
Not surprisingly, this fundamental difference is completely hidden by Mr. Garver.
Why, for Barrick Gold, the best way to conduct a public debate would it be to lead to destruction by anyone who dares to support a position contrary to the Senate?
In view of the outcome of the process, the authors and editor of the book Black Canada will have to spend considerable amounts to prepare their defence and fight against an army of lawyers supported by nearly mineless pockets.
The tactic, in these inequitable struggles, is also often to destroy the defenders in order to impose a rule on the friendly who will make the opposition more difficult for anyone to think about again on the matter.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, it is in front of the public opinion that he should have presented his view of the facts.
Contrary to what is happening in many countries where Barrick Gold is working, discussions in Canada are usually conducted by exchange of ideas and not by matracies.
It was therefore sufficient for the mine to open its books, records and to establish a genuine debate through newspapers, media, publications and funding of independent research teams that could shed light on the issue.
But Barrick Gold does not seem to rely on public opinion and rejects petitions and letters of support to the authors of Black Canada.
Perhaps Mr. Garver could explain how he could at the same time ask for a "public" debate while ignoring the opinions of the same public?
In the Vice-President's world, it seems that this term refers only to lawyers who are heavily paid and not all Canadians; that is a rather narrow view of the concept.
In democracy, even tractors have the right to speak.
What you don't understand - or you don't want to understand - Barrick Gold, is that the public supports the authors and editors of Black Canada doing it first because it rejects the brutal manner of mining.
This publication is ready to hear and judge Barrick, but on the basis of civilised exchanges of arguments, and not in the context of what many consider to be a wave of persecution (in the "public debate", Barrick Gold has also submitted a standstill in the place of the authors of Black Canada who intend to stop the use of this term...).
In addition to Mr. Garver's surreal speech, Barrick Gold's follow-up is a direct attack on the freedom of university research and the search for truth, essential to all democratic society.
It is not, in short, the right to refer to credible sources and to the debate on facts and interpretations, which are the same basis for intellectual work.
If it is impossible to study and discuss issues that may be passed on to the world's rich businesses in a country like Canada, despite repeated persecution, who can?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, it could do so by following the scientific standards used by the authors of Black Canada.
She has a right to respond.
The university environment, which we belong to, has long known to manage debates and disputes and resolve conflicts.
Barrick Gold's delayed follow-up clearly shows that, contrary to what she claims, she has no desire for a transparent debate.
It is a loss for the university world, as well as for public debate in Canada, and it is time for governments to put in place devices that limit this type of abuse.
Wall Street rescue operation - Democrats and Republicans understand
The Bush administration and the heads of the Congress, both Republicans and Democrats, have finally reached an agreement yesterday on the largest economic recovery plan since the Great Depression of the 30s.
The new version of the US $700 billion plan to bridge the financial crisis that has been rocking Wall Street for months must still be buried in the two rooms of the Congress.
In particular, it provides: better control by the choices of its application, new mechanisms to ensure the return of public funds committed, new provisions to contain the number of households taken for failure to pay, as well as a right to review salaries paid to the managers of the secured enterprises.
US Secretary of Treasury, Henry Paulson, President of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, and the Republican representative at the negotiating table, Senator Judd Gregg, announced the good news a few minutes later tonight at the end of a two-day negotiations.
"We have made great progress towards an agreement that will be effective on markets," said the representative of the Bush administration, Henry Paulson.
"All has been done to open up the real economy and the ordinary Americans of the crisis in Wall Street," explained the democracy.
"This is the fundamental point: if we don't do this, the traumatism, chaos and disturbances on the daily life of the Americans will be enormous," said the Republican Judd Gregg.
The negotiations had turned to sprint in the last hours for fear of the impact that would cause a new mistake on investors' mood.
The time limit that was agreed was the opening of the markets this morning.
As part of the negotiations later, the two candidates at the US presidential election proved rather favourable to the agreement, however, without having to express their satisfaction that they were obliged to reach that end.
The Democratic Senator Barack Obama has been awarded the addition of certain provisions to the agreement, including those aimed at allowing owners to retain their home and the payroll of the heads of companies that have been rescued by the State.
"When the contributors are asked to take extraordinary measures because of the responsibilities of some, there is nothing to be happy about.
But these measures are necessary," he commented on American television waves.
Asked about another chain to know if he would vote for the proposed plan, his Republican opponent, John McCain, replied: "I would like to see the details, but I hope so."
"The big lines I've read [show] that this is something that we all have to dig up and with which we can move forward.
The option of doing nothing is simply not acceptable," he said.
The plan of 700 billion is designed to buy with the money of taxpayers the suspicious, risk-active and irresponsible credit of the US financial institutions.
It occurs after 14 months of a crisis resulting from the excavation of an real estate bull that first led to the collapse of mortgage credits (substances) before it extends to other more complex forms of credit securities (PCAA) and to the collapse of banks and financial institutions.
It is a group of republican elites who had taken over the first draft agreement last week.
It is believed that this gap has emerged since Democrats agreed that some "toxic" assets of companies in difficulty are only guaranteed by the government, rather than by purchases.
In order to round up the English for the world at Congress, a provision was also added that if the government had to take up losses for five years with this programme, it could set up new taxes to help it recover.
The new plan provides for the payment of a first cut of 250 billion which may be added to 100 other billion if the President considers it necessary.
The payment of 350 other billion should be terminated by another vote of the Congress.
In exchange for his assistance, Washington will receive participation in the secure companies that will benefit from dividends in case of benefit and that he will be able to repay when the tournament is over.
The federal government will have the opportunity to delay the acquisition procedures for housing related to real estate loans concerned by this plan, as well as to set limits on remuneration and start-up payments paid to the managers of the companies concerned.
The architects of the plan would like to see him vote in the House of Representatives today, and in the Wednesday Senate.
Despite all their efforts, it is not yet certain that their plan will have green fire.
In fact, votes continued to rise against this project yesterday, both in the Republican and democratic camps.
"Of course, Washington doesn't understand you," said the Republican Scott Garrett, member of the House's Finance Commission.
"Yes, we have a serious financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
But not the one who is to benefit from contributors."
An animator of a small group at Congress named "the cause of the sceptics", Democrat Brad Sherman presents things differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
"Four hundred outstanding economic teachers, three of whom Nobel Prizes, wrote to us: we are asked at Congress not to press and carefully consider how to take it," he said yesterday.
At the same time, in Europe, there was a new evidence of the global nature of the crisis.
At the end of an emergency meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalisation of the Fortis banking group for EUR 11.2 billion (16.3 billion).
The intervention of the Governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg was made necessary after the French bank BNP Paribas informed that it had refused to buy its competitor in full shipping since it had lost EUR 2 billion (2.9 billion) in the crisis of ventured loans in the United States.
Fortis employs 85 000 people and is part of the twenty largest European banks and the ten largest insurance companies.
"This is not money lost, the Dutch Minister of Finance Wouter Bos said yesterday.
In exchange, there is a right to vote in the bank and influence.
It's just something that espionagers and households now appreciate that times are uncertain."
Meanwhile, on the other hand, the British Government seemed to be able to nationalize another bank that was damaged by the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the Government would take into account the total current loans at Bradford and Bringley Bank, of which over 41 billion (75.5 billion) of real estate loans.
The Spanish bank Santander announced yesterday that it was she who would buy the subsidiaries and accounts from the British bank.
Bradford and Bringley would be the second bank, after the Northern Rock, that the British Government should nationalize since the beginning of this financial crisis.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of an icon engaged
His beauty in the eyes of gold has long been his map all over, some will say his weakness.
Was he released from the Narcissian mirror, the American actor in the charmer's smile?
Yes and no.
Its power, sensitivity and talent that flowed from source will also have been removed from the register of power which is children of the true sacred monsters.
But what a great runner!
Paul Newman, who disappeared on Friday, at 83 years of age, from lung cancer in his joint of Connecticut, remains one of the last icons of American cinema for the last few years.
Less monumental than Brando, who had been a sort of rival to the screen for a long time, more prudent in his game, certainly more fragile, but also advocates freedom and the eclination of dramatic conventions.
The mixed blood often makes wonderful children.
He was born in Ohio in 1925, from a German Jewish father and a Hungarian mother of origin.
Of these European roots is one of the glorious faces of the American dream.
Without self-delegated, last quality brand.
Because it is designed by a country that is proud of its own manpower, the fighter of the Pacific war, who, at the beginning of the 50s, studied drama art in Yale and then attended the Actor's Studio in New York, before playing in the theater, on television, near the cinema.
The same man who was military for civil rights was also the car pilot who was second-class at 24 hours of Mans in 1979, twice a symbol, a member of a model couple formed since 1958 with actress Joanne Woodward.
They also disappear with him the shadow areas of this secret, discreet, engaged, allergic star of the show-business, which we won't really have seen all the enigma.
An honest man, in the most noble sense of the term.
Paul Newman's disappearance sought out the audience at the cinemas this weekend, while his great role was on the black screen of memories.
More than a half century of a seventh American art in permanent change is coming through it.
Looking back at the love-boy of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969), the young man who rejected his gay husband (Elizabeth Taylor) in La Chatte on a hot-cracked tennis match by Tennessee Williams in 1958.
Closer to us (1990), his sensitive Mr. Bridge was mentioned, troubled by an old marriage that did not fulfill all his promises.
So many other Paul Newmans have been in history.
This criminal, tortured, violent boxer in Somebody Up There Likes Me (Marked by Hate), by Robert Wise, a role for James Dean, who returned after his death, who really launched Newman in 1956.
This sympathy in the brightest The Sting (L'Arnaque), Oscar of the Best Film in 1973.
Player of bitter billard and winner in the magnificent The Hustler of Robert Rosen (1961), he will recover his personality on the return in The Color of Money of Martin Scorse, which he won in 1987 his only Oscar on nine nominations.
This face through the ages, it was him.
He's still there.
The times are baffling through its course.
Young people are especially familiar with it through George Roy Hill's most cultural Slap Shot (1977), in Reggie Dunlop, the coach of a little orthodox ice hockey team.
His fans found him in 1994 in The Hudsucker Proxy of the Coen brothers.
With the last role of the Irish mafia in the Road to Loss of Sam Mendes in 2003, the hole was blocked.
In the face of several legends of the film that were quite early in the afternoon, Newman will remain in silence for a long time, while accusing Hollywood, his gold, his fixeds and his concessions.
French filmer Bertrand Tavernier would consider it, not humourless, "as a challenge living in "the underplaying" judging its excessively supported benefits.
The profession has not always been tended for the beauty of Paul Newman to which the roles of all the cooks in the pool long ago.
However, it often plays younger than marginals: nervous, alcoholic, healthy or desperate, whose perfect treatments reflect the fruits and the revolutions.
As a realiser, Newman reveals unknown faces of his true public sensitivity.
His Rachel, Rachel, in 1968 (after the Canadian novel Margaret Laurence), with her husband, Joanne Woodward, played the key role, drew a female portrait of melancholy.
He who lost his son Scott by overdose gave him his film Harry and Son in 1984, worked with courage and sadness.
Among the men's rain that moved yesterday on Newman, his great partner and former arms partner Robert Redford (they had played together in The Sting and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) said, very appealing: "His presence has made my life and this country better."
Generosity, love of existence are vibrating treatments of the missing actor.
In addition to its legendary career, there is also a large military force for civil rights, ecology, independent film, a contestant of Hollywood's derivatives.
We'll have seen its benign throne on vineyards, sauces, biscuits and other foods, judging the process of bad tastes, whatever gag at the start.
However, the benefits of these sales were paid to its Children's Fund in difficulty.
Newman, instead of sitting on his myth, will be committed to the end.
He left to his five daughters a letter containing these words: "Always and until the end, your father was incredibly grateful for his good star.
It was a privilege to be there."
And it's a privilege for us to follow the course of an American artist if he's bright and generous.
Model citizens, in sum and above.
What could Zuschlag &amp; make in their factory of invoices?
Next, on 8 October, hearings on the current criminal procedure will be launched against János Zuschlag and its complications.
Politicians and their complexities are accused of fraud, in the form of criminal organization, permanently and regularly, resulting in particularly significant damage. Other prosecution leaders have been held against them, such as false and false use.
According to the park, the money from subsidies was spent for personal purposes, while the benefits were justified by false invoices.
The money of the State and municipalities, about 65 million HUF in total, went from part to part in the events of the Fiatal Balldal movement and on the other hand, in the pocket of some people.
Their method, also made public by the authorities responsible for the investigation, was to touch the money of the grants received by issuing cost invoices which were not provided and thus did not meet their commitments.
According to the case-law, a large part of the invoices were false.
For the latter, they were looking for invoices at the Jozsefváros market, while they were making the boxes in Kiskunhalas.
For the names of companies that were going to be included on the invoices, it was decided, inter alia, during the North Balaton Lake Tours conducted by István Lados, at the request of János Zuschlag.
According to the latter's deposit, he had to look for pensions and restaurants.
For its personal consumption, he asked for a bill on the model of which they were carrying out the other invoices they were going to introduce, among other things, to the Ministry of Youth and Sports, the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labour, as well as the Municipality of the Capital for Grants.
Most of the invoices were created by István Lados and by his complex András Óri, who, according to our information, worked mainly to edit the files needed for the grant.
During a "reperative circuit", one of Lados' choices was a bistro.
According to the two invoices issued by Zuschlag in 2003, this place provided for the restoration of a group of 90 people, members of the Biztos Pont Egyesület Association.
However, according to the manager's report, it would have been impossible for as many people as possible to take care of this place at the same time.
In the same way, in the summer of 2002, the invoice set out on the name of the Jobb Jötőret Foundation, which will then carry the name of Egypt to Harmadik Évezredért, was miscellaneous.
A pension, located in Badacsonytomaj, actually had only three rooms, and a maximum of ten people could spend the night there. However, the invoice referred to hundreds of clients.
The issueers of invoices to the debating image are also in excess when they mentioned the Pigal Kft company, also belonging to the Horeca sector. In their accounting, neither Jobb Jövőret nor the Hoppa were present, according to the information given in the park.
Győző Farkas, the company manager, told hvg.hu that when the park called him and showed him the facts, he then said that he was wrong.
"Our company's name and tax number were placed in a bad place on the cover."
He added: "In addition to the form, the fact that, according to the invoice, hundreds of people had lived there, did not sink no more, as this facility only has 11 rooms, which are not so comfortable.
Moreover, the invoice also mentions meals, and our restaurant has been closed for a long time."
Green invoice issuers are no longer informed of the travel agencies in Budapest, making part of their choice, but only of travel abroad. Thus, of course, they indicated housing in Hungary on specific invoices to be settled, which will also be contrary to the Agency's accounting practices.
Moreover, as it appears during the investigation, they also added VAT on these documents, while the benefits for travel activities, whose destination is outside the European Union, are invoiced without VAT.
Also, the VAT rate of the four invoices set out in the name of the Hotel Revfülöp at the order of Jobb Jötőret was incorrect, as the company’s benefits did not support a 25% VAT as indicated, but a 15% VAT. Moreover, the hotel employees only issue printed invoices, while the false were written in hand.
The survey in the park reveals that "emissioners" also made errors by referring to road freight transport, that the invoice company could not exercise, since its profile was the investment council.
In addition, it is also for various forms, such as types of incorrect invoices and false caches, that invoices issued at the Order of Egypt at Harmadik Évesredert Alapitvány, of XXI. Századi Culturalis Egyesület and Biztos Pont have proved false.
As in the case of Ravenna Bt. or Konfehertó’s sports stadium, which is not the authors of the invoices issued on their behalf.
The counterfeiters were no longer paying attention to the fact that the HIB Kft company, established in Nyiregyháza, was liquidated at the time (in 2001) the Fiatal Városert Egyesület group was intended to take a meal with them. That is why the company liquidator did not issue this invoice.
Delegated factors
Another category of invoice issuers is that of those who were actually aware that they were asked to issue fictitious invoices.
The Esély Budapesttér Alapitvány Foundation, at the request of the Fiatal Balodal Group - Ifü Socialisták, has established an invoice under the order of the Egytt Foundation in Harmadik Évezredért, for a sum of four million HUFs.
According to the case-law, the manager of the company Collab Kft. was brought up to issue false invoices by one of the accused, Ludovic Györfi.
Also, he cooperated with Zuschlags, Biogate Kft., which is currently under liquidation and which in 2003, issued invoices under the foundation Jobb Jötőret Alapitvány, Atlasz Egyesület and Vörösfenyő Egyesület, for about five million HUFs, but after which no performance was actually provided.
No financial movement was made, no more, since the invoices issued were subsequently cancelled, but the agencies were very careful not to mention it in their accounting.
The following category of invoice companies is that of companies directly related to the accused.
Thus, the administrative delegate of the director-general of Delta Trió Kft, dealing with the trade in fuel and motor vehicles, whose social headquarters was in Budapest, but where it was available, it was Ivan Kubatov.
In October, November and December 2005, the company issued several invoices on the sale of IT equipment for an amount of approximately 18 million HUF.
According to the investigation, these equipment would have been purchased by the Cash Investment Ltd. company of Kiskunhalas, which has been liquidated since 14 September 2005.
The director of this company was a Romanian man, to whom Ivan Kubatov would also have obtained documents relating to the company between 2002 and 2005.
According to what we know, Kubatov has acknowledged during the investigation that he has issued invoices in the order of Atlasz, Hoppa and Egyyutt in Harmadik Évesredert Alapatvány, and that he has challenged their counter-value.
It is precisely at the request of Ivan Kubatov that Romanian couples created Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Ltd. and Jos-Investment Bt.
In fact, none of these companies were working, which explains to the accused that they did not receive work.
At the request of Master Zsolt Sainte and editor of the company's foundation documents, he has established invoices on their behalf, in the order of associations relating to Zuschlag, such as Atlasz and Y-Generáção.
Kubatov gave to agencies, 15 invoices in total, issued by Cash Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade companies for a value of 14.2 million HUF.
The park thought that 10 per cent of the figures indicated and VAT went to Kubatov's pocket.
Man has even used Szi-Beri Bt. to establish fictitious invoices that have been used in the application for Bzitos Pont's grant.
In January 2006, the Association Y-Generazione et Sövetė a Modern Magyarországér submitted a grant application to the socialist party's public utility agency, Táncsics Mihály Alapitvány (TMA).
They received this grant for a double amount of 500,000 HUF, but these amounts were not used for the purposes indicated in the application.
To avoid this, five fictitious invoices received from the company Works Team Kft. were presented to the TMA.
In addition, these were found during the search at the office of Arpád Kemexei, Ministry of Education.
In the hearing, some of the accused will relate to the method of manufacturing invoices, as she had done before the park before.
What could be really interesting would be that the main defendant, János Zuschlag himself, decided to take the lead throughout the story.
To date, his eyes are not very detailed, and although he has promised several times to tell the smallest details, he has not yet done so.
The question is whether it is in its interest, or if so, socialists would have concluded an agreement that, in exchange for the reimbursement of a large part of the 50 million HUF, Zusi would only bear the hat.
Today, the last one is likely to be raised, as requests for his residence placement under surveillance, on the basis of an allegation of his detention conditions, continue to fall into the ear of a deaf person.
While those who have caused much more serious damage, and the perpetrators of non-reparable economic crimes, freely or at least, are waiting for their own home for the end of the procedure.
Surgeon Psychology: Why spend more money?
In sales to customers, buyers tend to spend more and overestimate goods.
Researchers in neurology and economy at the University of New York have succeeded in updating the neurological and economic bases of this well-known and apparently irrational behavior.
According to their study published in Science magazine, human beings do not want to be distanced from this type of competition, such as a sale at eBay auctions, and that is why they prefer to pay too high a price.
These research have tried to draw up a neurological scheme of this kind of "play" by means of sales to experimental endings.
One of the groups of volunteers played in the lobby while the other group was involved in a sale of toys, while the researchers were analysing the active brain areas of experimental subjects by means of a functional magnetic resonance process (IRMf).
In the two games, participants could win money, but during the sale of coins whose essential element is the surrogate of a third, the whole under the cerebral throne, called striatum, was placed in intensive motion at the loss of the party.
This part of the brain, along with several other functions, plays a role in the "auto-stimulation" mechanism of the nervous system.
That is why, according to researchers, the amount of prices is explained by the flight before the violent response of the stratatum.
In support of their theories, the economists of this research group continued financial surveillance analyses.
In these cases, three groups faced a partner, in different circumstances.
They simply informed the control group of the actual value of the product concerned, and thus carried out their implementation.
To another group, they promised that if they had, in addition, obtained from the party, they would receive $15 additional, in return.
While the third group received these $15 before the end, the members of the group also lost this money, if they lost the end.
The difference between these two groups is that the emphasis was placed on one on the victory, and the other on the wrong.
By thus demonstrating the neurologists' hypothesis, members of the team of players "against failure" were prepared for higher tasks than those carried out by the control group and the "for victory".
"These results cannot be demonstrated by any existing economic theory.
In fact, each of them explained the phenomena found in sales to the finals only by the pleasure of winning and the paramedics in front of the risk.
Only neurological imaging methods have helped to eliminate the contradiction between the two theories by launching, now, on a third explanation." - Andrew Schutter, professor of the University of New York economic sciences.
Hepatitis: When should we consult a doctor?
In the world, about half a billion people suffer chronic hepatitis B or C, while in Hungary, chronic liver disease is mentioned among the first causes of death.
Hundreds of thousands of patients carry hepatitis virus in Hungary, but only seven miles follow treatment. This is because patients often do not know that they are carrying the virus.
Hepatitis is a generic name given to liver infections and caused by various viruses.
There are many similarities between their symptoms. Fever inflammation and youth are characteristic, but pathogen agents and infectious diseases differ from one another.
Hepatitis viruses, according to pathogens, are primarily spread in two forms: hepatitis A and E through the digestive tube (e.g. food or contaminated water), hepatitis B, C, D and other viruses by blood and organic fluids (sem, vaginal secretion, salt).
For travellers, it is recommended that vaccines be made against viruses A and B. There is no vaccine against C.
The symptoms of hepatitis A appear two to three weeks after consumption of contaminated foods, usually accompanied by poor general state, weakness, stomach pain and nausea.
Then it develops on the skin and on the white of the eye a visible young person, the cells become clearer and the urine takes a more active color. The healing can take two to three weeks.
Throughout the world, each year, one million people die of the most serious form of this pathology, such as cancer or liver cirrhosis caused by hepatitis B.
The main reason for this is that according to estimates, only one tenth of the patients receive medical treatment.
Hepatitis C may also have serious consequences: if it is not treated, it may lead to cirrhosis or liver cancer.
Most of the patients are not aware of the virus, because pathogen gene suddenly destroys liver cells. In many cases, the first symptoms appear only after 20 to 30 years.
Therefore, early prevention is very important, as well as regular testing tests.
Pollution is much higher than average among a population of three groups: people who have had a blood transfusion before 1991, drug consumers and tattoos.
Currently, there are 200 million patients with chronic type C hepatitis in the world.
Since the disease can be detected by a laboratory routine examination, it is recommended to consult your doctor treating symptoms of unknown origin.
The disease can be healed if it is detected in time. The virus can be eradicated from the organism, thus risk of disappearing infection and the development of cancer is prevented.
September 30th is the World Day of Hepatitis, organized for the first time in 2004 by the world's four-wheel disease agencies.
Its objective is to draw attention to chronic liver surgery, caused by viruses, the causes of its development and the importance of early diagnosis of the disease.
Does one who believes in God feel less pain?
According to recent research, religious belief would work as a sort of analgesic, which would already have contributed to more sustainable deaths of Catholic martyrs.
The British daily Telegraph published an article that researchers at Oxford University have made an interesting experience by analysing the extent to which belief in God could influence tolerance to the pain of human beings.
As part of this experience for the least unusual, 12 Catholic believers and so many atheists were subjected to electrochocks, each observing a painting representing the Virgin Mary.
As a result, Catholics have been able to exclude a large part of suffering.
Thanks to a human brain palpation technique, Catholics have also been able to activate part of their brains responsible for controlling pain.
This analysis is the first of a series of experiences involving academics, scholars, philosophers and theologians from different sectors of the university.
More specifically, the experience is carried out in the following way: an instrument that emits ethanol and distributes electrochocs is fixed on the left hand of the test subject.
The researchers asked participants of the experience to look in two supported ways, one being the Virgin Mary painted by Sasoferrato in the 17th century and the other, the Women painted by Leonard de Vinci in the 15th century.
Researchers at the beginning of this experience hoped that the view of the Virgin Mary would raise a kind of faith among believers, while the choice of Da Vinci's painting, not very different from that of the first, would have a frightening effect.
Experimental subjects spent half an hour in an IRM scanner, and during this time, 20 electrochocs were received in four successive parts, although they were both religious painting or the most general theme.
Catholics said that in the eyes of the Virgin Mary, they felt like "safe", like someone who "cares" and they were "slow, and peace invaded them".
In view of the religious thematic painting, they reported 12 per cent of pain less than when they were looking at Leonard's work.
Psychologist Miguel Farias, who himself took part in the experience, believes that the same effects can be achieved with any other strong image in the atoms, provided that the appropriate photo is found.
"We should find an image to which they respond very positively, such as a mother or father," said the psychologist.
Tom Wright, an English bishop, welcomed the results of these research.
"The practice of faith should change and in many cases, indeed change our personality," Wright added.
After these excellent results, is there any more than the question of what would be the effect on the regulation of subject pain if it were shown to believers a Madonna painted by Leonard or a painter of the same calibre?
Would the view of a better quality Virgin Mary produce better results?
You're what you reveal about you
On the occasion of its tenth anniversary, Google says that it can be found at the bottom of people's pockets under the same title as the sky above their heads. He knows where they took their vacations, which specialists they consult and which are their centres of interest.
This is not enough, however, according to Eric Schmidt, who is one of the influential people of society.
While with regard to sceptics establishing a parallel with Orwell's horror vision, they just don't see the importance of web 2.0.
Eric Schmidt stated, there was not enough, in the Financial Times, that Google's main ambition is to collect more information about its users. This is necessary for Google's founders to be able to meet their initial goal, which was as follows: "Let's collect in a system all the world's information!".
According to Google’s manager, after ten years of global chambling work, they are not always able to process all the information at the start of their goals.
On the question: what will it be in five years ? Schmidt replied that he would like Google to answer questions like "What could I do tomorrow?" or "What is the job that would be best for me?" However, the software will not be able to answer this kind of question, simply for the first time, until the day they know enough about users.
It is not perfectly clear for all Internet users that the words used during Internet research, the IP address of the computer that starts the search and the pages that are then consulted by interested people are accurately reproduced.
Through the Personalized Search program launched two years ago, users can, for example, store their own research history and can consult what they have looked for. In the long term, recommendations, programs based on the same logic will be able to provide much more personalized responses, and we will submit products and services based on our previous statements and our registered preferences.
What happens if someone uses my data against me, if he sees what my work is? ask users, who are concerned about Google's information monopoly.
In most cases it is the potential power represented by the society that can cause fear, and this is not the answer, the fear of punishment, the desire for freedom or possibly the rebellion against power that can arise in the Internet.
However, it is confirmed that the terms sought are not only recorded, but in justified cases, they are transmitted to a third party, and in such a legal case, nothing protects the personal rights of Internet users.
The most recent example is probably the coordinated action against Brazilian pedophiles, during which Google sent to the Brazilian government the information it had collected on the public page called Orkut, thus allowing for identification.
The social networks of the person's rights have been able to send a suspension of settlement in later times, when Google, whose arms are below with the EFF legal protection body, has proved his right to the FBI. According to the judgment, in the future, Google will not always be obliged to disclose information on the secret request of the FBI, of any kind.
(At the same time, the federal government has successfully obtained some 50,000 web addresses and 1,000 research terms that it has won in relation to the strengthening of the Child Protection Act, voted several years ago. However, in the end, it has failed to search for lists of search lists of private users, neither the entire list of websites and keywords of these two months.)
Google’s judgment is therefore quite contradictory: it is punished by those who fear the transmission of their personal data, because they think that their intimate sphere and their private domain suffer when they start using Google services. Consequently, they are attacked in the spirit of rebellion against the proud multinational societies of their conservative image.
During this time, the American geek culture and its "savages" combining the passions, activists and excited users of the computer that appear in many countries see in Google the next generation of big companies, the "Branched Corporation", in contrast to its rival, Microsoft, which is categorized as the world's emaciator because of Windows, and this, even if they both fight for the same purpose.
This may be explained by the fact that Google, unlike Microsoft, does not ask its users for identification code, does not ask for money for its applications. The documentation code and the package of programs, which is constantly updated, has a much more accessible, younger and cooler effect, in the face of the practice of the official software genre.
The reason may also be that the geeks see the problem relationship between human rights and the Internet, and what the web 2.0, the most proclaimed keyword in recent years, is just behind it.
In fact, web 2.0 is only about collaboration, the fact that we deliberately leave behind the tracks behind us, and that we serve as channels of communication made available to us, and while the size of these changes one by one, the essential remains the same: we are exposed.
A young person, in general, can have a profile on several public pages, from Facebook to Xanga, and can even link them to other services, such as Twitter or last.fm, listening to his musical habits. Then he can link them to a tracking system such as FriendFed or Blip.fm. These young people can also have blogs, in which they automatically appear their latest photo gallerys that they store on Flickr or Picasa.
While we can get to know many examples, such as that of the little friend who can easily understand the photo of the morning, taken by the circle of common friends with whom his unfaithful friend had spent the evening, or the company that licensed one of his employees, nothing but for the sincere opinions he wrote on his blog about top management, we can be on one thing: the term of private life is to fully reconsider our days.
The person who lives an online life is what he shows himself, and it is also possible to define the principle behind the behavior of young people today.
He wants to hide something, or at least he wants to try to turn Google's monopoly, he can do it (starting with Scroogle, for example, using Google's research system, but at the same time he doesn't deliberately leave any traces).
The number of people who do not deliberately register on public pages so that they are not able to find them is no less. Google's online services, through text processing to image processing, can be replaced by alternative versions, which are not linked to huge server parks and which do not constitute our best profile, which have existed up to this day.
Public opinion is waiting, without really hiding it, when Google will develop its true nature.
The company, with its current value of $156 billion, is worth more than IBM ($140 billion), Intel ($124 billion) or Coca-Cola ($110 billion). Advertising areas AdWords/AdSense threaten the number of advertising agencies' business, while the benefits introduced at an even more important rate give rise to serious migrations not only to Microsoft but also to many other information programs.
However, critical observers find, on the other hand, discrepancies with disturbing effects: for example, the company's top management group rejected, in its entirety, employees' protests, after it doubled the price of the parent of the company and after the company had judged too highly the multi-day restoration, it took no time. However, it seems to be a distraction from the fact that in 2006, Google had already obtained before the Chinese government and according to the terms of their agreement, the company has detected all the results that are detrimental to the good taste and the interests of the Chinese regime.
According to one of the company's internal rules, new services are only announced when they can be used. What is more, in the next few months and next years, they will make the world move on new points. While some think that Google's project of scanning and archiving books and magazines takes such important dimensions that the company will not be able to meet the Supreme Court of the United States, others are alarming at its health system, as in this case, we can build a complete medical benefit from our previous analysis, our medical and our problems.
The fact that Google sets up a genetic database can give a good first material to the next generation of science-fiction authors. The famous Cory Doctorow novel, written with half-tonnes orwellings, describes the future in which a man could be approached in a fascinating way than through Google's data.
Two minors helped eliminate the traces of Ozd's double homicide
"The police called two minors to question them in the case of Ozd's double homicide. According to the underlying suspects, they helped to eliminate the traces of crime," said the spokesman of the department of Borsod.
Young people have recognized the facts they are being criticized. At the same time, they are accused of complicity.
The two minors, who, according to information from MTI (Hungroese Telegrafic Agency) are young girls, are free to defend themselves.
The complexity of death can train a detention that can take up to 5 years.
The suspect of Ozd's double homicide, a young man of the 23-year-old dog, was placed in temporary detention on Sunday.
The charges against him are multiple homicides, committed with premeditation and interest.
During the investigation, it was found that a 23-year-old man had to pay a large sum of money to a 53-year-old man.
The suspect didn't want to settle his debt, and that's why he attracted his creditor, recently Wednesday, to an Ozd site where he killed him, as well as the 9-year-old little girl of this man.
According to information from the IMI, the young man has preceded his crime. The weapon he was going to commit is evidence.
The police examine the weapon and the circumstances of its use with the help of specialists.
The Warsaw Borough makes a proposal for the breaking of the Prague Borough
The Warsaw Stock Exchange has proposed two hundred million euros, about five billion Czech Crowns, for 100% of the Prague Stock Exchange Stock Exchange package.
Ludwik Sobolewski, president of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed this proposal made by the Poles despite the fact that the Czechs had previously excluded the Warsaw Stock Exchange from the new potential owners of the Prague Stock Exchange circle.
The reason for this exclusion is that the Warsaw Stock Exchange is in the hands of the State.
99 per cent of the actions are in the hands of the Polish State, who wants to separate more than 60 per cent of its actions in a few months of activity.
According to the Czech economic day E15, the Polish proposal is the highest bid that has so far been made for the capture of the Prague bourgeois.
According to the Czech press, the Vienna borough, the Nasdaq transatlantic borough, the New York Stock Exchange, the London and Deutsche Börse borough have made an offer up to this day.
Petr Koblic, the director of the Prague Tour, said last week that the Warsaw Tour would be the newest owner, and did not exclude the fact that this could lead to the disappearance of the Prague Tour in the future.
The value of the Prague scholarship is estimated between 5 and 10 billion Czech crowns by market specialists.
On the basis of an agreement between shareholders, some 90% of the paper would be sold.
The most important owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is the Patria Finance investment bank, with about 25 per cent participation, followed by 14.7 per cent of the Ceská Sporitelna bank and Tiger Holding Four S.a.r.l. with 13.5 per cent.
The financial crisis of the European press
In their comments on Tuesday devoted to the international financial crisis, increasing daily, the European press's leading newspapers are already referring to a "second September 11th".
"The global financial disaster, we owe it to the President of the United States" - accused the daily of Rome, La Repubblica. "The President has not even been able to block a bill with his own party behind him, improvised to the streets, with a view to bringing relief to a desperate situation..."
Instead of a new Pearl Harbour, like billionaire Warren Buffett, it is more appropriate to talk about a second September 11th.
A part of the Madrid press also sees the airstrip in Washington.
According to the daily El Mundo, these are the shortcomings of the political leadership there that led the global economy to collapse.
The risk of the collapse of the US financial system is increasing daily, and the world will then pay the high price.
Bush's plan was far from perfect, but after the Congress's vote, it was a real danger that Washington does not propose a political tool to deal with the crisis.
The world economy lies in empty, just when in the history of capitalism one of the greatest transformations takes place.
We cannot ignore the longer-term threat - it highlights the Days-Anzeiger of Geneva.
Some states can still have a savings fund for their own financial institutions, and with the money of their contributors, they can save them from failure.
Of course, if there are more banks such as dominos, then neither financial means nor new improvisations will be sufficient.
In the long run, we need the states of the European Union to do little about their national egoism and to centralize control over the divided financial markets.
No matter what Monday, the poor financial institutions received more than 100 billion euros - reminded the next day, Der Standard, which adds that fears that European taxpayers will also have to put their hands into the pocket, very deep, similar to Americans in order to remedy the crisis, become more and more realistic.
So far, the EU has not really been involved in the crisis, which, as a tsunami, across, partly, is the old continent.
The "saviours" should not then charge EUR 100 billion, however, if they noted that it would be reasonable to touch taxpayers' money with a view to preventing more damage.
The smart car imitates the bourdon flight
What method would be better to develop technologies that are capable of avoiding an obstacle if it is not the imitation of an existing barrier detector?
For example, one of the bees.
In the surprising project presented at CEATEC, which took place in Japan, the bourgeoisie gave the strategic idea of starting with Nissan engineers to inspire them in the way they should design the next generation of obstacles detectors.
In collaboration with the University of Tokyo, Nissan built a small robot car, a bio-robotized control system of type BR23C, which has equipped the quality of bees, the ultimate goal is to encourage the development of a system capable of avoiding all obstacles.
In its flights, each bee is its own space, oval form, which, in fact, looks much like our secure protection coke - explained, at the exhibition Kazuhiro Doi, director of the research and development department and technological public relations of the brand.
The eye to facets of the bee plays a major role, since it is able to see in all directions, in a 300 degree angle.
In order to imitate the functions of the eye to facets, engineers approached the idea of the laser telemeter.
This identifies the obstacles in an angle of 180 degrees and at a distance of 2 metres before the BR23C, it assesses the distances and sends a signal to the on-board microprocessor, which transforms it into a continuous avoidance.
The perception of the obstacle takes place in a second fraction. Then, the mini robot, imitating the movements of the bee, immediately changes the direction of its wheels by turning it into an angle enough to avoid collision.
Unlike any existing system, this avoidance is carried out in an intensive manner.
"If it wasn't, the mini robot could not respond enough quickly to avoid the obstacle," explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Laboratory and the robotic car project.
It must act in an intensive and instantaneous way, as this technology corresponds to the most vulnerable and internal layer of protection, a layer where collition is considered inevitable for the moment.
All this process must reflect on what the bee does to avoid other bees.
The process must take place in an eye-clin.
Unlike bees, the difference cannot go up, down or diagonally, it can be only two dimensions, and only in the direction in which the wheels can turn.
In this way, instead of the infinite combinations that possess the bees to avoid other bees, in our case, it was only possible to use rotational movement, acceleration and slowing down as manoeuvres available to the mini robot
The BR23C uses Lithium polymer batteries which are smaller and whose energy concentration is higher, making them longer lives than in the Lithium-ion version.
According to Andoh, it is an instinctive intelligent reaction that is primary, not data processing, and even less storage capacity.
This mechanism must only deal with a few signs coming in second, and respond to them.
It is not necessary to store and react with intuitive logic based on the data of previous works. In this way, it uses only a few dozen kilobytes of continuous memory.
We don't need to remember a giant octets capacity or even mega octets.
This is the first step towards the design of a technology for immediate avoidance. According to Nissan's estimates, this system will enter the cars manufactured in series in the next ten years.
Another application could be its incorporation into the GPS satellite navigation system so that it can guide the driver to its destination by avoiding obstacles on its way.
We even gave a name to the baby out of price
The written version of the US$700 billion economic rescue plan, aimed at acquiring banks' suspicious credit, and using it several times, is ready.
In the first round, half of this amount will be spent.
Reuters announces that during the new debate extending until midnight, on Saturday, the local time of the East Coast, the leaders of the Congress agreed on existing disputes for days and days around the rescue plan of a total amount of $700 billion.
"We have taken a serious step forward," said Nancy Pelosi, the democratic president of the United States House of Representatives, after which he is no longer more than making paper agreements.
The compromise, based on the plan, is supported by the two presidential candidates Barack Obama and John McCain.
The US Secretary of Treasury, Henry Paulson, commented on the results of the commitment that the programme will work and will be effective, but other measures must still be implemented. According to Pelosi, there is no question here about the rescue of Wall Street, but to turn the economy around in the other way.
The written version of the plan was made public before the opening of Asian markets, on Sunday evening at 20 a.m., at Washington's local time (i.e. Monday at 2 p.m., according to Central European local time), but did not cause a spectacular amount in the rounds.
Monday, the House of Representatives will be the first to vote on the proposal for a law in response to the 2008 Emergency Economic Stabilization Act. It will then be held in the hands of the Senate.
On Saturday evening, President George W. Bush spoke to Pelosi, then the White House also welcomed the new agreement.
"We are satisfied with the progress we have made this night, and we strongly appreciate the efforts of the two parties to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy," said Tony Fratto, the spokesman for the White House.
In addition, the different programme of the initial proposal made by Bush administration, which she mentioned, should be spent at least $700 billion on one occasion, for the recovery of securities.
The first 250 billion will be delivered immediately after the adoption of the Congress Act, probably Monday. The first sum will serve the Secretary of the Treasury to buy suspicious bank credit, while the use of the additional $100 billion will be left to the President's discretion.
The programme will be supervised by an independent agency, in which the President of the Federal Reserve will also participate.
The expenditure of the second half of 700 billion is dependent on a new Decree of the Congress.
Under the law, the Treasury secretariat will be able to set up a combined strategy: it will at the same time be able to buy suspicious credit, securities on suspicious mortgages and mortgages, as well as other types of "toxic credit".
The competent authorities of the Department stated that the kidnappings may take place in the context of a sale to the closes, but also directly.
The rule allows the companies concerned to participate in an insurance programme, where the Treasury secretariat ensures the tools of concern, for which companies will have paid a premium equivalent to the expected damage.
Henry Paulson stated that the law provides the necessary tools in order to devote $700 billion to the urgent needs of the financial system, to the wide range of suspicious credit, their insurance, or to avoid the risk of seeing the system resulting from the collapse of one or more important financial institutions.
"We shall take the necessary provisions, to be ready for the application of the law, as soon as it is signed," he added.
On the other hand, bank managers who are in bad positions and who are waiting for State aid can expect their early paybacks, called just a foreign-Atlantic parachutist, to be hit by the government.
Moreover, the limitations depend on the way the Treasury secretariat offers its assistance to the company.
The principle of platooning means that if the Treasury secretariat collects in the course of a sale to the cashiers, they will take up a surcharge on the gold parachut, unless the decretion bank president is part of the retirement.
Immediately after the loss of doubt, the Government will act aggressively to ensure that the amount paid to the leaders is not excessive.
In order for the image to be complete, it must even be added that the existing expensive parachutes have not been modified. The ceiling is only about the new contracts, which is to motivate participation in the plan.
This is the first time in the history of the United States that legal ceilings will be in force on the appointment of general directors - the President of the Commission commented on the financial benefits of the House of Deputies, Democrat Barney Frank.
In addition, the State seeks a right to purchase shares in banks taking part in the plan. In this way, the risk of taxpayers is reduced, as they can even be obtained in the business as soon as the economy and the saved banks return on their feet.
The draft law states that within the next five years, the President must introduce to the Congress a proposal which will establish how losses will be repaid to taxpayers from the financial sector.
On both sides, there was obviously those who expressed their doubts about this plan.
It is not because of what American citizens have given us, this does not protect the taxpayers' dollars - said the Republican Member of California, Darrell Issa.
His Democratic colleague at Ohio, Mary Kaptur, believes that they are the same as those in charge of Wall Street's collapse.

Internal industrial sales prices have only increased to a lesser extent: 0.1 per cent, compared with the previous month.
Internal sales prices in the transformation industry have increased only by 0.1 per cent compared to July.
In August 2008, the most significant price increase was observed in the leather and leather manufacturing sector (2.8 per cent), with first place the manufacture of bags and centrifuges with a monthly increase of 4.6 per cent, then the production of shoes with 2.5 per cent monthly increase.
The higher price levels of primary plastic and chemical materials resulted in a significant monthly increase in prices in the manufacturing sector of chemicals (1.6 per cent).
A deflation has resulted in oil transformation sectors (1.4 per cent), the production of machinery and electrical equipment (0.9 per cent), as well as a minimum increase in wood processing (0.1 per cent).
The prices of paper production, publishing and printing activities have not changed.
The other sectors of the transformation industry recorded an increase of 0.2 per cent and 0.9 per cent.
In the sectors of electricity, gas, steam and water supply, representing an important weight in national industrial operation, prices increased by 0.3 per cent in August, mainly due to the impact of the increase in gas prices established by the authorities since 1 July.
In a 12-month comparison, taking into account the internal sales of the transformation sectors, these are the prices of the oil processing sector which have seen the most significant increase (32.4 per cent).
In the manufacturing sector of metallurgy, prices increased by 13.2 per cent, while prices increased by 11 per cent in the important field of food, drink and tobacco production.
Price reductions took place in textile and textile production sectors (2.5 per cent), as well as in the manufacture of electrical machinery and equipment (0.3 per cent).
In other sectors of the transformation industry, prices rose between 0.6 per cent and 9.1 per cent.
In the entire transformation industry, prices increased by 10.2 per cent during the past year.
The prices of electricity, gas, steam and water supply sectors exceeded 18.7 per cent of the previous year.
Among the intra-Community trade groups and according to sectoral competences, in August, these are the profit-producing sectors on investment which have shown a most significant monthly price rise (0.7 per cent).
In the consumer goods production sectors, prices increased by 0.3 per cent, while the energy and materials sectors for further transformation were not known to change compared to the previous month.
In August 2008, compared to the same month of the previous year, the most significant increase in energy and materials production sectors was observed for further transformation (16.8 per cent).
In the consumer goods production sectors, inflation of 6.8 per cent was measured, while in the profit-producing sectors, a reduction of 1.4 per cent was measured.
The export sales prices of the industrial sector in HUF increased by 1.1 per cent in August compared to the previous month, while they fell by 3.9 per cent over 12 months.

The next year, will you still need visas to go to the United States?
Kinga Göncz believes there is a good chance that the American-Hungarian visa exemption agreement will enter into force on 12 January, which is what the Minister for Foreign Affairs said in Chicago before the heads of the local Hungarian community.
She said, "Now everything depends on the time when other Atlantic electronic input and control systems will be put into service."
Again and again, she drew attention to the fact that in the new system, there will be no entry visas, but tourists will have to register before the start.
The head of Hungarian diplomacy will be in negotiations today in Washington.
He will meet with the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Condoleezza Rice, to whom he will present the decoration of the Cross of Commander with the Star of the Right of the Republic of Hungary, and will have a interview with foreign policy advisers of candidates to the presidency, the Barack Obama Democrat and the Republican John McCain.
Barack Obama and McCain support both banks' rescue plan
On Sunday, Barack Obama as well as John McCain, the candidates for the presidentship of the two large American parties, supported the US Government's $700 billion rescue plan. However, there are politicians who demand the resignation of the US Secretary of the Treasury.
Following the marathon negotiations that lasted for days and days, representatives of Congress and the Administration finally announced on Thursday that they had concluded principle agreements on bank savings.
This funding plan, aimed at the collapse of the Wall Street crisis and the paralysed credit market, became the central issue of the presidential campaign.
Obama and McCain present themselves, each as more suitable than the other, to lead the country out of the economic crisis.
According to the most recent surveys, with economic issues being put forward, Obama has once again managed to make some progress. McCain's progress, obtained with Sarah Palin's appointment as a co-lister right after the Republican convention, has come to an end.
At a campaign meeting held in Detroit on Sunday, Obama expressed his hope that the Congress would soon vote on the rescue plan of 700 billion.
He stressed that the proposal contained consumer protection passes as well as its support.
"It is now necessary to act, with responsibility (...) at risk of your work, your economies, industrial sectors as a whole and the stability of the entire economy," he said in front of a crowd of 35,000 people.
He did not fail to qualify for McCain's surplus economic ideas.
In an interview at the ABC channel, McCain said: "We're all going to have a bad time to study it... but nothing is possible."
The Republican Senator said that the proposal mentioned the establishment of a Treasury Control Commission and the imposition of the fines of senior managers, and that he was personally very attached to these points.
Obama told CBS that McCain had no role in the negotiations, while he was in daily contact with the Secretary of the Treasury.
Nancy Pelosi, President of the House of Representatives, said on Sunday that there is a real hope that the House will vote on the bill on Monday.
The German-language press review
The field of right is intact, it is only in the heart of the party that the electors have become more aware - it is also mentioned by Der Spiegel, the low score of the CSU in the Bavarian country.
Haider is ready to rule Austria, to prevent the coalition of red and black.
Mirror (spigel.de)
In the online edition of the German left-wing information magazine, Franz Walter analyzes the causes of the dramatic failure of the CSU in his article entitled "The Revolution in Bavaria Destroys His Fathers".
According to this recognized policy, the CSU erosion began well before the sad duo Beckstein-Huber took over his functions.
The socialists of Christians have transformed Bavire for decades and now, these are the same modern citizens who turn to them.
This change of time is at the same time the problem of all Christian democracy, and so is Angela Mercer.
For the CSU, the failure has not really been a surprise, but on Sunday, a process that was likely to occur just ten years ago: the indisputable hegemony of the national party has been over.
Ten years ago, in 1998, the CSU met with 47.7 per cent, and this for the first time since the 50 years, with a score below the 50 per cent level.
This was repeated three years ago at the elections of the Bundestag in 2005, i.e. at the time of the so-called Stoiber.
The cause can be imposed on modernization "for the sake of its parents", placed in the region consistent with the CSU.
This was 40 years ago when sociologists announced this but they were strongly mistaken about the rhythm. However, in the secularization, the results of education and the establishment of Germans in the north and east of the Bavarian region could not, in full development, remain unaffected by the faithfulness of the CSU electors.
Modernization will coincide with increased opportunities, and the consequences of such a policy are also visible.
The field of right is intact, which is only within the party that the voters have become more aware, more critical and more conscious.
It is also surprising that during the last few weeks, this is just the groups of classical citizens who have been far away from the CSU, such as independents, artists, ban holders and higher students.
In these groups, support for CSU has decreased by 40 per cent.
The Press (diepresse.com)
In its article entitled "Who? With whom? The Presidents of the Party are on the reservation to the issues of coalition," the Austrian Conservative daily is concerned with the situation of the confused internal policy that has been established after the Austrian elections.
The Austrian Socialists of SPÖ wish to discuss with ODP conservatives.
The OVP prohibits SPÖ from dealing with its internal affairs.
The BZÖ populist party is open for negotiations. Greens don't want to agree on the coalition yet.
The elections were held, now all around the coalition; when public television discussions were held, party leaders had to let their cards in.
Werner Faymann, the president of the SPÖ, confirmed that he would like to discuss with the ODP.
The SPÖ wants to show that cooperation between the two parties is actually possible - that is what exists in some regions and in socialist partnership.
The question that he would imagine would be a coalition with Wilhelm Moreer, the current president of the OVP, as vice- chancellor, remains open on Faymann's side.
As he mentioned it, Schüssel-Molterer's orientation was, in any case, rejected.
A duplicate of this combination is out of question.
Multer has responded with caution to red proposals.
As he has already said, a collaboration will certainly be frustrating if Faymann is trying to get involved in the internal affairs of the OVP.
In its part, the choice of opposition or entry into the coalition is currently an open issue. These points must be discussed within the CFSP.
Jörg Haider, president of BZÖ, is again open to all proposals.
"To avoid the coalition of red and black, we are ready to assume government responsibilities," Said Haider.
Járóka said: The vicious circle of poverty and segregation must be broken
Today, in Paris, the European Summit for Equal Opportunities, which is France, has begun as a representative of the current Presidency of the European Union.
In its message presented before the plenary, as one of the main speakers for expert consultation, Lívia Járóka, Euro-president Fidesz People's Party European, drew attention to segregation in education, as it is a violation of the law most affecting Roma children and therefore one of the main threats to their success in life.
On behalf of the French Presidency, this high-level conference was opened by Xavier Bertrand, French Minister for Labour and Social Affairs and, on the other hand, by Vladimir Spidla, European Commissioner for Labour, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.
Among the people invited to participate in the consultation are European social partners, as well as the most prominent representatives of European legal protection and civil bodies in the area of equal opportunities.
According to the press office of Mr. Fidesz Parti Populaire, Járóka said that the Roma disappeared from the labour market because of their low qualifications.
"A growing majority of young Roma do not have secondary degrees, and as a result of an elementary quality education, only a small part has the opportunity to get a higher degree."
Járóka also stressed the fact that education as an essential right of human beings plays a key role when other fundamental rights must be stressed.
Investment in early education for Roma children means strengthening the economy of the European Union's member countries.
According to the Eurodeputate, it is necessary to raise awareness of these reports in a widest circle, as well as between Roma and non-Romans.
In fact, as soon as a Roma child starts school, he increases his chances of becoming a productive member of the labour market; by taxes paid from his income and consumption, he participates in the State budget.
"From their nationality of the European Union, Roma must be guaranteed their right to quality education and protected from low-quality and sectoral education," noted Lívia Járóka.
According to the honourable Member, the European Union's cooperation towards an objective and action is necessary for the immediate acceleration of the school disintegration process and for this, respect for existing anti-discrimination directives and in preparation is essential.
"It is necessary to break the vital cycle of poverty, segregation and unemployment. The opportunities provided by democracy to Roma children must be given, so that they can participate as full-time citizens in the future of Europe," Járóka demanded.
On behalf of the European Year for Equal Opportunities for All, the goal of the European Equal Opportunities Summit, which has been held every year since the Berlin Summit last year, is to ensure a unique platform to support measures taken to promote equal opportunities and combat discrimination at European level and at Member States level.
CSU: thanks for a transition period
It is in October that the decision will be taken on the fate of the duo dehu Huber-Beckstein
Despite this electoral failure, the heads have not yet fallen, and the discussion on personal issues at the meetings of the Bavarian CSU has been updated.
The president of the party, Erwin Hube and the head of the regional government, Günther Beckstein, can still keep their place.
The fate of the tandem, having lost a 17 per cent disaster vote, will be on the agenda of the special party convention, held on the last weekend of October.
The members of this highly criticised couple, however, felt that they did not hold their seat especially.
As a result, they have worked to upset the angry members of the group and the base, which one day after the "Bavarous Tsunami" called for personal consequences for the loss of the absolute majority.
Five years ago - it's true, still under the direction of Edmund Stoiber, at the top of his career - the socio-Christian union won 60.7 percent, while today, one year after the putsch against Stoiber, there is only 43.4 percent of their strength.
For 46 years, the CSU was the only sovereign of Bavaria giving 18 per cent of German GDP.
However, conservationists are still very much in this southern region, which is key to the Hungarian economy. In the future, they will be committed to the coalition.
As one of the first signs of an internal reorganization of the party, the vice-president and Federal Minister of Agriculture Horst Seehofer, presented as the possible successor of Huber, also received a place in this modest group of recognition, which began discussions with FDP Liberals, as well as with the Free Elections, formed along the lines of right, on any coalition of the Munich government.
A foreign line of destination was that with the help of the list of Free Elections, among the legislation Gabriele Pauli, whose action against Stroiber used the possibility of potsch perpetuated by Duo Huber-Beckstein, to treat the very ambitious municipal political woman without housing.
Now, the CSU leaders are putting their energy together to stabilize, somehow or otherwise, Beckstein.
In this transition, Stoiber, who has so far taken the seats in the colleges, will also have an active role. The former Head of the Regional Government and former President of the CSU, appointed on 28 September as the most ambitious day of his political career.
On Monday, Huber sent a few comments to the CDU. According to him, they would have deserved much more support from the party.
Other CSU politicians interpreted the defect as a warning for the CDU and also for Angela Merkel.
Following the Bundestag elections, which will take place in September 2009, Merkel will be able to become chancellor only if they return on foot somehow or otherwise, with a common force, the CSU, having played an important role in the 2005 national success.
According to Merkel, which is hard to hide its disappointment caused by the fisco, the loss of land of the CSU will not adversely affect the great coalition of Berlin.
This is relative, however, because it will not be easier to manage the injured CSU, and the crisis of socio-democrats will always last.
Since 1946, SPD has achieved its worst results with 18.6 per cent in Bavaria.
Lukasenko - six rivers : 110 - 0
No opposition member came to the Belarusian Parliament after Sunday's elections.
According to the Russian observers, this is explained by a country led by Alexander Lukashenko, which ensures prosperity and stability, while according to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), this is explained by the illegality of voting.
The OSCE, sending 450 observers from 43 countries, does not recognise the elections.
Although the legislation of 110 people in this country of 10 million inhabitants has been very opposed for decades, before yesterday's elections, the opposition joining its forces on behalf of the Union Democratic Forces (ODSZ) would seriously hope that Lukashenko, renewing his presidential mandate for the fourth time during the suspicious elections, on the traces of the amendment of the Constitution in 2006, would "allow" this time the presence of some opposition MPs to Parliament.
In this way, ODSZ has given up its original home york.
The fact that Belarus, depending more economically on Russia, would want to improve its relations with the EU, where because of the qualified Belarusian anti-democratic policy order, Lukashenko and several high-placed politicians did not receive a visa for entry was one of the expectations of the opposition. Belarus had to take credit for the reduction of Russian natural gas imports increasingly expensive and thus contributed to the transition of Beltransgaz, owner of gas pipelines across the country, to the Russians.
The fact that the OSCE, in its assessment of the campaign, focused on positive changes rather than on shortcomings, such as the prohibition of submitting for a third of the candidates to the opposition, referred to a prior delay.
However, Monday's OSCE communication was already in response to the campaign, during which the main number of opposition candidates could not appear in the media, and in particular the fact that the opposition could not be presented at the time of voting.
Despite this opposition, there is still a palpable improvement in the political regime: political prisoners have regained their freedom, and Minsk is ready for small confrontations with Moscow, always refusing to recognize the South Ossetia and the separate Abazzia of Georgia. However, Russia with which Belarus is a confederation of paper, considers the two independent territories for a month.
"We have taken two steps forward, and one step back, but most importantly, the dialogue has been started between Belarus and the EU," said Alexandre Millinkevitch in our journal.
According to the candidate for opposition to the 2006 presidential elections, it is desirable that this remains so, although "the power in this Parliament which has no weight is afraid to make it even one opposition".
The opposition does not provide for protests in view of the results, but rather seeks to bring about its message on the need for economic reforms to voters.
"Of course, we have a lot of concerns about this: we have to print our opponents' newspapers in Russia, the local authorities are putting us in the streets for what's happening, but I can also see that they are more and more supportive of the elections, even in the circle of older people," Milinkevich said, referring to the fact that in the current system of Lukaschenko, which considers social security as its main result, the bed of the most officially supported retirements is no longer considered appropriate.
"Because of the perception of the country and the rise of the commercial deficit, the collapse of social security, 'about the silence of a cemetery', it is no longer a matter of time" - he says.
In contrast to the opposition policy, Russian observers qualified for democratic elections.
Sergei Lebedev, head of the mission of the Community of Independent States, told the Russian press agency Ria Novosti: "People do not believe in words but in acts."
Brunetta: "From today, a little breakfast before work."
Never, in the history of the Chigi Palace, there were no turning doors for the entry and exit of employees.
But from now on, this new measure is in force against the small malindies, against whom it points and then drinks coffee at the bar during working hours.
The anti-fraud news was presented today by the Minister of Public Administration, Renato Brunetta, and the Secretary-General of the President of the Council, Mauro Masi.
"Brunetta's turn-to-doors are a tool for better working, with more productivity, more presence and more services," said the Minister.
Now a new season of responsibility and transparency begins.
"It's reformism" is also highlighted by Brunetta.
The installation in all the institutions of the President of the Council is complete with the Chigi Palace.
According to Masi, "the choice of turning doors is even important from a symbolic point of view.
No resistance of employees has been recorded, the Secretary-General says: "It is a process shared by employees, and we have all worked together".
In short, more breakfast during working hours; more coffee or growing.
Brunetta's promise, which suggests smiling, "a good cappuccino at 7:00 in the morning is an excellent and healthy resolution".
At a conference at the Higher School of Public Administration
in Rome, the communiqué minister said that "in three months, the absence of public employees' disease has reduced by 50%, or more than 60,000 workers in one year".
And he adds that it is necessary to make it more effective, the Public Administration.
Italy, "including wage dynamics - explains the Minister - these 8-10 years have doubled compared to the private sector, and also inflation rates.
At the same time, thousands of public employees are united in protesting the standards of the Brunetta Decree applying to the Codacons.
" while the Minister of the Public Service is currently raising data on the decline in unemployment at work due to disease, the association of consumers - the people of "active workers" continues to increase.
In Italy, thousands of employees from the proper and productive Public Administration met to declare war against the illegal standards contained in the decree.
In particular, the Tar is opposed to the exclusion of additional allowances in cases of service sickness; the extension of the hours of the household stay of the sick worker, during which visits of control are carried out, as well as other aspects contained in the new provisions of the Minister.
Accidents at work, Napolitano: "Crucial Prevention"
In Italy, there are 2,500 accidents at work, 3 deaths and 27 persons permanently disabled.
In 2007, Inail's data confirmed that white deaths were about 1,200.
Numbers that testify to the severity of the phenomenon that remains one of the main causes of death, and cause almost twice as many deaths as homicides.
To draw attention to the institutions, social forces and media on this dramatic aspect, Anmil is now celebrated today in all Italian provinces on the 58th National Day of Victims of Labour Accidents, institutionalized on the second Sunday of October.
"The disturbing data transmitted by Anmil, as well as the tragic events of these last days, confirm the importance of prevention at work," said the President of the Republic, Giorgio Napolitano, when sending a message to the President of Anmil, the National Association of Mutilated and Disabled Workers, Pietro Mercandelli.
The Head of State expresses its sincere appreciation for the continued association effort in order to prevent jobs, protect workers from accidents, help the families of victims and awareness of public opinion"
"Of course, the whole world has hit the point to end such tragedies that, by their size, the media cllamor and the participation of public opinion, although the daily reality presents us with dramatic and even repeated cases in their dynamics.
Napolitano does not hide "there is certainly a resource problem: it is essential to invest in education and information"
The many initiatives promoted in the school sector are particularly important for a more direct awareness-raising of young people entering the world of work.
It is our duty to pay attention to this phenomenon, not to assess the alarm on social seriousness, to apply and improve legislative standards.
On the other hand, the President of the Gianfranco Fini House stressed how "this phenomenon of white death is an absolute social emergency, which violates the conscience of each of us, and imposes on all institutions a concrete effort to put an end to it quickly."
The data on accidents at work seem to indicate a slight positive trend, but this does not prevent the number of white deaths being even impressive" later highlighted the President of Anmil Pietro Mercandelli.
"We do not want this "dangerous tendency" to actually translate into less attention, because it is just when attention relaxes, the tragedy happens.
"We believe that in general, it is not enough to counter the phenomenon of accidents and the contrast can be achieved through multiple actions."
"We have stressed Mercandelli - more controls and inspections are needed, as well as more important interventions on the training of workers, and this from school."
He added: "It is necessary to make further efforts with regard to the communication and awareness of public opinion.
"But above all, there is a greater sense of responsibility for employers in the face of a phenomenon that represents a social emergency."
"Mercandelli then declared "the progressive deterioration of the security conditions of the compensation provided for the victims of work" and "the result of assistance to which the system has been based in recent years."
"The aim, therefore, is to give the worker the insurance guarantee – it has been added – so that the fate of the person who has an accident does not depend on spontaneousism or the extension of the legislator"
Mp3 reader points from the finger, they risk hearing.
Listen to music with full volume for a longer period using portable music devices such as Mp3 players can cause permanent injuries to the audience.
That is what the European Commission, which, in a communication published in Brussels, quotes the Scientific Committee's opinion on the unprecedented and recent health risks (Csseri) of the EU, which is now published.
"of this scientific report - we see in the note - there are only 5-10% of those who, for a period of at least 5 years, listen to music with full volume using portable music devices, for more than an hour per week, risk permanent loss of hearing capacity."
"I am concerned that a large number of young people who often use portable music devices and mobile phones in full volume can unwittingly damage their hearing in an irreparable way," says Meglena Kuneva.
"Scientific data - continued by responsible Ue - is a clear risk and we must respond quickly.
What matters most is to raise consumer awareness and make this information public.
We must also review existing control systems in the light of scientific opinion so that they are fully effective and can follow new technologies."
Brussels asked the Independent Scientific Committee to consider the problem, given the intensive use of portable music devices and the increase in the number of young people exposed to noise generated by them.
"Scientists-conclusions the Ue-executive confirmation that there are good reasons for concern and that the European Commission will now consider with Member States and other interested parties what measures may be taken to better protect children and adolescents against exposure to noise from portable music devices and similar devices.
There is already a European safety standard that limits the level of noise from music devices to 100Db, but concerns increase as to the hearing damage that could result from excessive exposure to such noise sources.
It is possible to limit these data by using solutions such as reducing levels and duration of exposure to noise.
The Scientific Committee notes that users of portable music devices, who listen to full volume music (more than 89 decibels) for 5 hours per week, are exceeding the current limits for the maximum level of noise allowed on the workplace.
Those who listen to music under such conditions during extended periods are at risk of permanent loss of hearing capacity after 5 years.
This is of interest to 5-10% of users of these devices, and their number can be quantified to about 2.5 and 10 million people in the U.S.
Rome, Germany has ordered the Commission to act on the future of capital.
Today we start today, we end up in March, we're going to get our money out of June.
Here is the calendar set by the Chapter for the work of the "Commission for the Future of Rome Capitale", which took place this morning at the new headquarters behind the Thermes de Caracalla.
In six months, President Antonio Marzano and 49 other Commission components will implement the guidelines for Rome.
In March when they have completed, the Committee and the Council will assess the analyses and projects, in order to present in June, the Strategic Plan for Rome with the " official stamp " of the Chapter and its mayor Gianni Alemanno.
"The Commission is absolutely independent; all political, social and cultural ideas are represented there - it has to highlight Germany - it will have to propose development ideas for Rome which will be used by political decision-makers, which remain the Committee and the Council.
No superposition of roles, but only the desire to have a corner where to develop a great project for Rome.
In March, it will finish its work and then disappear, because this experience must have a precise time.
In June the mayor will present us the strategic plan for the future work of the Commission for Rome Capital. "
For those who accuse the Commission of being useless, since its views will not be binding, Germany replied: "All depends on the work that the Commission will be able to do, as well as on the quality of its proposals.
If the quality is, as in France thanks to the Italian Commission, as in Rome, I am aware of it, its contribution will be fundamental.
Too often policy is equipped by day-to-day management and time-consuming emergencies.
On the contrary, we want to see ahead and further, towards a deeper perspective, working seriously towards the development of Rome and its future."
In addition, the mayor of Rome insists that "this Commission is not a useless body or bureaucratic body: it is absolutely free, and it will not cost one euro to the Roma citizens, and it will serve to study and participate in the best understandings expressed by the capital.
For Germanyno, in fact, "there is a lack of strategic reference, no firm or real estate, in order to allow our city to improve, what it absolutely needs, while considering its future now as a united spirit."
A future that, according to Rome's capital, "will not be limited to the ordinary community borders but will look further" not only at the perspective of the future metropolitan city and its legal status of capital, but also "with regard to the role that Rome can and must have as capital of Europe and the Mediterranean".
Obama, the first American president, that's why.
"Barack Obama will be the second US anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who, by his decisions, destroyed the US economy and had reports (as he still has today as a private citizen) with the Islamic enemy."
Attacks against Obama increase as the election date draws closer.
A lady from Miami wrote on a website: "This person is full of ambition".
Obama is really excited: he thinks he will win the highest role of a nation that counts in everything, two governors and five black senators!"
In fact, it is attacks that do not say much; these are of course racist nature attacks, and do not answer the question of all voters: will he be a good president? We also have investigations, which all say that Obama will win and with good advantage.
In this case, it's still someone who talks to the heart and not to the brain.
A newspaper from Mississippi, in the interiors of the southern United States, wrote an article: once in the voting room, we know who the American patriot will vote.
That's where an aspect of American mentality emerges until the end.
"Tell me what you want, we'll see ourselves putting the cross, on Obama or on McCain.
There are even those who swear: if Obama wins, we will leave the United States.
Things that have never been discovered so far, to such an extent that the success of the black candidate seems almost certain.
In spite of all these reasons, the winning card for Democrats is George Bush.
A request was made to 1500 people: what were the errors made by Bush during his mandate? 89 percent replied: Iraq.
America changes.
In Vietnam, this nation lost 50 miles of soldiers and was sent to it by foot to the parties.
In Iraq, 4500 soldiers have lost their lives, and Americans have not been forced to make the valls.
Nevertheless, Iraq has been, for the most part, the point of weakness of Bush.
Whoever takes George W's place will have a huge task to do.
U.S.A., the economic downturn makes itself felt even among journalists: in the press, it's the time of the deletions. And many people claim the Internet, this "killer" of the paper.
Five hundred American journalists were interviewed by the PEW Research Center on the status of their profession and mental control for the future.
And well, almost all journalists are pessimists today about their future.
However, they have not stated publicly to the parties to the information, less concerned about credibility.
They don't feel isolated like others.
The problem with American journalists is money, the money.
The 2008 crisis for these journalists is a devastating economic model crisis.
In addition, the removals made in the newsroom, in the room where editors work at the newspaper collection, are a major problem.
This is a problem that has to be solved, according to the journalists interviewed, if traditional journalism is to be understood by the general public, it does not reduce accordingly.
An obvious but complex pessimism envelopes American journalism.
Six out of ten senior executives and press journalists are convinced that journalists at the national level are following a wrong path.
Locally, the executive group is 65 per cent.
Printed publication against broadcast.
Journalists don't mind seeing where the web is going.
The largest publishing houses were handed over to the Internet, perceived by many as "the killer" of the paper.
The "economic pressure" felt by journalists is increasing to 79%.
The 500 journalists interviewed allowed themselves to turn to technology, hoping that it would "do something good" for their journalism.
Today, the biggest increase in American journalism lies between those who run the newsrooms - that is, the directors - and the reporters who work for them.
56% of managers at the national level are convinced that reporters share their values, while at the local level, this percentage falls to 23%.
For some, this is linked to "work safety".
Directors who are thinking of losing their jobs in the space of 3 years are 47 per cent at the national level.
With regard to journalists, we're going to 30%.
"Sure work" at the staff level (no editors, etc.) in America is always on the agenda.
Only 13 per cent of journalists work under contract.
In a nation such as the U.S., with 300 million inhabitants and thousands of journalists, magazines, radio, television and the Internet, employers often offer what they want, and this quickly becomes a question of taking or leaving.
Directors receive almost always large salaries, while the editor can earn $10 billion per month, in addition to retirement and insurance payments.
With regard to holidays, logic becomes complicated: x days after the first year, x days after the third, up to 15 days in all, passed a number of years.
But, according to their findings, American journalists are often "bad" during the year.
It's the climate's fault.
UNIPOL: TRIBUNAL ROME, DANilo Coppola REST AND GROTTAFERRATA.
The President of the Second Criminal Section of the Court of Rome, Carmelo Rinado, decided to reject the property agent's court, Danilo Coppola, who had requested permission to leave his city, Grottaferrata, for a residence in Rome.
. Coppola is investigated for banking under the Unipol-Bnl scale instruction.
During the trial in his charge last week, he had obtained the release of his home country into compulsory residence in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, asked that the real estate agent be able to cross the street from the province city to a apartment in the capital.
According to the court, such movements (which pm did not grant) would have an impact on his company and have access to the evidence that accused him.
The elites are in danger.
The phenomenon had already appeared a few days ago, with the vote of the House of Representatives, contrary to the $700 billion savings plan approved by the White House: a significant number of Americans were, and it is even more interested in punishing Wall Street than in saving the American economy.
And it is well the New York Times yesterday that confirms us that the current crisis divides the Republican Party, even more divided between its safe East Coast, moderate, favourable to federal institutions and the business community, and its new soul, on the contrary, conservative, hostile to "those of Washington" and the world of finance, which is particularly powerful in the Central and South states.
The soul, just as it is, feels despotic with the vote I'm talking to you at the beginning.
However, what has just been mentioned is just an example of the changes, major changes, such as the threat of the current economic land: not only in the United States, but in all the West, and may be only here.
In the United States as in Europe, the crisis seems to speed up the phenomena that have been covered for some time, so that in the new climate they are solidified and revealed.
The first of these phenomena is the renewal, the extraordinary relief of the double category of the sovereign State, in relation to a kind of economic renationalization.
The crisis is, in fact, a crisis of banking and financial institutions which, of course, have close relations with the outside world, but which, above all, are largely involved in the balance of people and families living in one country, in one state.
This immediately creates a political problem for which the Government is responsible: how to respond to the difficulties and protests of people and families who are also an electorate.
In short, the crisis appears globally but politically, it is almost national.
Political internationalisation seems to be really out of play or well, it has nothing to say: the clear evidence is provided by the European Union which, shared as a common practice, between the various interests and between the various national strategies, does not reach a common political line.
Thus, it is from the Government of each State that all expect interventions, rescue and relief plans, new rules, and, above all, a commitment to credit: when it comes to a difficult period, there is only enough financial resources to try to relocate things.
They also have the necessary means and the legitimacy to use them: two resources of an invaluable value, elements that no international market or organization will ever have in a similar way.
This new phase of the state-of-the-art crisis remains in perfect harmony with the increasing importance that the most recent economic developments in the economy tend to target a sufficiently related factor: territoriality.
. Paradoxically, while we were convinced that we were now entering the realm of the network, of more sophisticated technology, of non-material, that globalized finance was now intended to dominate the world, we realized at once that our future would otherwise be able to manage its accounts more and more with such things as water, crops, oil.
Things that can be transported from one place to another of the earth, but which are absolutely related to a circumscribed area, to one territory.
So, who is sovereign, he certainly has more cards than he who is not, i.e. one who has the inability to live in a place without cultivation, without oil and without water.
I am now coming to the second news which, however, provides for a fracture.
Who says Territory, State, Government, inevitably states politics, and therefore Leadership.
In this regard, the economic crisis seems to produce two convergence phenomena.
On the one hand, the awareness of the objective need for authoritarian leadership, the search for a person who can handle the situation.
On the other hand, a wave of discretion for existing leaders, economic species which have become inadequate and full of shadow areas.
In addition, something more profound, in some sense, even worrying: a discount, a suffering, an inappropriate image, a sense of distance that tends to involve the whole class of directors in a growing number of Western countries.
This further increases the conviction of different classes, before actions are the same ideas of social elites until now, how they listen and be, their culture in the complex acceptance of the term, having the same time, and being increasingly foreign to the opinions of the majority.
in short, The demand for leadership, underground food, a powerful and ramified movement of delegation of the ruling classes and traditional political orders, which is reflected in the improvised electoral "rebellions" or, in recent recent changes of collective moods, from the conservative ascension in Austria to the fall of workers in Great Britain, to the rebellion of American congressmen against Bush (and it might well be that the rule of law in Italy has not been achieved by hazard).
We have the impression that traditional elites, their parties, their programmes, but also their rituals, their journals, their intellectual credentials, their format, would have more and more difficulty than today, to understand and thus represent the deep layers of Western societies, and that the economic crisis is strengthening, increasing and potentially affecting.
In view of all of this, speaking of a current "mass rebellion" on the agenda seems to be quite exhilarating.
But we say well, keeping your eyes open, that's not unreasonable.
The supercolle to walk on the walls.
Win the laws of gravity through a super hill and, in the future, walk on the pairs like Spiderman.
This is the goal of various American research centres, and today a team of four institutions has almost succeeded.
With an adhesive measuring up to five inches [2.5 cm] in length, researchers were able to keep a body of 100 kilograms on a vertical wall.
The Study- The American magazine Science published the findings of some researchers at Dayton University, Akron, Georgia Institute of Technology and Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material, invented by the research team, is an evolution of those we know who use a particular carbon structure called nano carbon tubes.
"The principle of collage can be imagined as a series of tubes designed as a spaghetti pill." Explain zhong Lin Wang of Georgia Institute of Technology of Atlanta.
Scientists have been inspired by geckos' feet, covered with microscopic dust that enables the animal to ensure a perfectly adhesion.
Tests on various materials, such as glass, Teflon and glass paper, have shown that the new adhesive is ten times more powerful than the feet of these reptiles, and at the same time that it "can easily be separated from the pair," explains Liming Dai, researcher at the University of Dayton Engineering University.
MARCHER ON THE MURS?""This material could be used as temporary adhesive" adds Liming Dai.
Could it be to walk on the pairs like Spiderman? Maybe yes, but researchers think of a much less fascinating use such as the connection between electronic devices, since the nano tubes of carbon are heat and electricity drivers.
Other applications could concern aerospace engineering.
For now, not super hero.
AUTE RESEARCH - The University of Berkeley, California, is also involved in the search for a new adhesion.
In an article in the American Chemical Society magazine, California researchers presented an adhesive of microfibre like hair, which automatically cleans dust during movement on a surface to ensure perfect and constant adherence.
Medicines: Never with fruit juices.
Attention to the smell of popplemous, orange and pummel.
These beverages, consumed mainly in the summer because they are depleting and rich in vitamins, if associated with certain vital medicines, altering or reducing absorption according to the case, their effectiveness, with even serious health consequences.
David Nailey, professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, recalls the risks of fruit juices that they are, whether in butter or in cash, if associated with ingestion of certain medicines; during the 236th National Meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia, he launched a new alarm: it is sufficient to reduce the absorption of certain live medicines by reducing their beneficial effects and risking patient health.
The papplemous juse has already been strongly criticised because it has been held responsible for increasing the effects of certain antiarrhythmic, antibiotics, anxiolytics, stemnal and neurological medications up to toxic levels.
MEDIUMMENTS A RISQUE - It is the Italian Agency for Medicinal Products itself, which has given the news in a two-year information bulletin, warning doctors and patients not to underestimate the risk of this mixture and to be aware of what is being taken if medicines such as Diazepam or Methhadone are taken.
PACKAGE LEAFLET- According to experts, even orange and powder juice contains substances that inhibit medicines.
Long is the list of active principles inhibited by Pamplemousse and other jus.
From there, Michele Carruba, director of the Department of Public Pharmacology at Milan University, called: "These findings are generally reported immediately to the various national and international drug agencies that will be required to change the informational notes of the medicines.
It is always necessary to read the medicinal product illustrations, and if something is not clear, it is not to be impressed, but to be clearly addressed to the doctor or pharmacist" stressed the expert to the Ansa Agency.
The Nobel of the economy in Paul Krugman.
The Nobel Prize for the Economy was awarded to the American Paul Krugman for his research on trade models and on the location of economic activities.
Krugman, 55 years old, is a neo-Chinese student at Princeton University and is also a well-known editorialist at the New York Times.
Krugman is one of the biggest critics of the Bush administration's economic and foreign policy solutions.
A few months after the September 2001 attacks, during the days of Enron's failure, Krugman had written in an article published on the New York Times that the second event would have been more decisive than the first, with consequences on the history of the United States.
A forecast that devastates many polynomials, which has been renegotiated to the economist for years, but which has now become accurate.
"I'm surprised and even a little shocked about the speed with which the memory of scandals such as Enron or Worldcom's collapse has disappeared from public attention," Krugman said at the end of 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, of the European Central Bank Executive Committee, Krugman is a "great-value economist", but also a very aggressive-style publisher, particularly critical of the over-liberalism of Bush administration.
Open Office, here is the third edition of the "anti-Micro" package
This is the day of the release of OpenOffice.org.2.0, the open source of personal productivity that aims to reach more and more users, from house to house, professionals to public administration, offering a free alternative to the most famous Microsoft Office.
Following a work of nearly a year, carried out by voluntary developers, monitored by SUN Microsystem, the new Open Office package is shown to the public with various news: the welcome screen, and the revised and less austerity interface, more importantly, such as the compatibility born for the Apple Mac OS X operating system, and support for the new ODF format (Open Document Format) 1.2, the latest standard ISO version.
Open Office paid particular attention to the interaction with Office 2007, and it is possible to open documents with the new Microsoft extension (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx.)
Also interesting, some features specific to some modules, such as one that allows for reducing the size of PowerPoint presentations, are useful for example, for sending them by email, or for importing PDF files into the graphical development module, keeping the original aspect of the page.
Always on this front, it is possible to create documents "PDF hybrids" that combine the typical graphics of the Adobe format with the elements of a spreadsheet or a text developer.
The collaboration between several people is an element that has had several improvements within the application: in the calculation sheet, different users can intervene, avoiding conflicts over changes, in the development of texts, as each contributor is assigned a color of comments for better recognition in the revision phase.
Some companies are even working to carry out some of the OpenOffice functions on the Web (on the cloud, on the cloud), and in the coming weeks, they should issue the final result.
The Italian version is downloadable at http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html and is added to the English version that has been on the mirror since Friday.
In addition to Windows and Mac OS, the track is as usual as it is available in addition, for the Linux operating system.
On request, the installation CD can be sent home or to the workplace.
And if the theme of freeness can be a means of spreading it in the homes, it is just in business, that Open Office then presents the major challenge, which can already be based on various projects in public administration and schools.
Without account of the realities that provide training, consultation and assistance, ideal for small and medium-sized enterprises, which could also open up business prospects.
Open Office consists of five main modules: Write, for the video writing equivalent to Word ; Calc, is the calculation sheet that aims to replace Excel; Print, for powerful point presentations;Dbase, such as famous access, is the program that allows you to work on the databases; finally Drwa is the graphical module.
Target for 2008, reaching 5 million downloads, and considering that today we have nearly 3 million and 600 million, it is likely that with the release of the new version, we can even exceed the expected number.
Kohl too, it's positive, it's the fourth case of doping.
A new case of positiveity in the last Tour de France: it is the author of the Gerolsteiner team, Bernhard Kohl, third-qualified, and winner of the best rapper's maillet.
This is the daily website The Team reports the news.
At 26 years of age, Kohl is the fourth positive cyclist in Cera, the third generation Age, after the Italians Ricardo Rico and Leonardo Piepoli, and German Stefan Schumacher, also Gerolsteiner.
The blood tests performed on Kohl's tests are part of those carried out in recent weeks by the laboratories of Lausanne and Chatenay-Malabry.
If the anti-analysis confirms the positiveity of Cera, the Austrian will lose its third place in the Tour and will have to wait for two years of elimination.
The new positiveity of Kohl in the third generation era was confirmed by the head of the French anti-doping agency, Pierre Bordy, who communicated to the Associated Press, had notified the positive to the Austrian authorities.
The 26-year-old Austrian placed on the podium behind the Spanish Carlos Sastre and the American Cadel Evans, thus reminiscent of the best rapper.
Immigrate: NEW YORK TIMES wondering if ITALIE IS RACIST?
Italy "as Emigrants Countries has recently become a privileged destination for immigrants" welcomed with a sense of urgency.
Would this turn the beautiful country into a nation of racists? That's what New York Times is asking about, which has spent a long time discussing the subject of racism in Italy, in the case of young Abdul William Guibre, who was originally from Burkina Faso, killed last month in Milan for stealing a box of biscuits.
This case highlights what New York Times defines as "the paradox of the North": the Nordic regions are both those where it is registered" more integration and more work," but also "an anti-immigrant sense of the country's strongest and most important support to the North League"
In order to confirm the growing tension between Italians and immigrants, NYT also referred to the outbreaks of intolerance by Milan, Parme, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
Not just.
Even the new legislation required by the Law to freeze immigration and facilitate the expulsion of clandestine people is cited as evidence of climate change in Italy.
The Pope and the President of the Republic stressed the trend: "Georgia Napolitano, when he met Benoít XVI in Quirinal, asked what the State and the Church were working together to overcome racism."
Students who are victims of expensive rents, up to 900 euros per room.
The student rental market did not know about the crisis
According to the last survey of Sunia, the tenant union, renting a simple room can cost a student up to 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples, 600 in Rome.
"The phenomenon has now reached very serious aspects of the exclusion of all categories of young people, of the right to study because of the very high global costs that families of origin must support - explain to the head of the study office of Sunia, Laura Mariani - in these cities, the strong demand for students has so distorted the market that a generalised increase process has begun for residents.
In most cases, rental offers include a series of violations: free, unregistered type contracts, no rent limit, sub-locations.
For Sunia, extraordinary interventions through the revision of tax tax are necessary to reduce prices.
Reading the survey in detail, we see that Milan, for a bed in the Brianza area, needs about 450 euros; for a simple room, we go from 650 euros (Bande Black zone), to an average value of 800 (Lambiate, Udine, and Fiera) to a maximum of 900 euros (Vittoria zone)
In Florence, an average bed, 350/400 euros, a room is approximately 700 euros.
In Bologna, where students focus on the nearby areas of the University, they need €250/280 for a double bed, and from 370 to 500 for a simple room.
In Rome, in the vicinity of the central universities (San Lorenzo, Piazza Bologna), about 600 euros are required for a simple, 450 for a double bed.
Lower values (550 euros for a simple) for the nearby areas of other universities (Ostiense and Cinecittà).
It can only be saved if it is distanced from the peripheral areas: 300 euros for a bed, and 450 for a simple area in Predestina, Centocelle or similar.
In Naples, 300/400 euros are needed for a single bed, with higher prices in Policlinico, Vomero, and Colli Aminei.
A Bari, for bed, has to be EUR 250/350, at least 350 for a simple one.
In smaller cities, prices are lower in absolute terms, but they are of major importance in the citadine economy.
Finally, cities such as Perugia, where rentals are often taken by extra-Community students, have a further anomaly: the rental requested for foreign students is 25/30 per cent higher than that applied to Italians.
Old Adieu film Paradiso, the cities are the historical rooms.
The historical cinema rooms are firmly in favour of Multiplex.
"A city without cinema rooms is a blind city, it's like a face without eyes"
The image offered by the filmmaker Giuseppe Tornatore, well illustrates what is happening in the great Italian urban centres, but also in the provincial cities,
The marginalization process of cinemas, with the birth in the periphery of large halls, and the death of mono rooms in the central areas of cities, is one of the greatest events that we see as inevitable and unconstitutional; it also has all the features of a real cultural crime.
To disappear, these are often historical and memorable places, "it's like one of my friends would disappear, someone we know, with which we shared a lot of road and emotion" observes the filmer at the Nuovo film Paradiseo, which offers to Tornatore 20 years ago, the first Oscar as well as the Grand Prix of the Cannes jury, and who reported the poetry of a provincial hall, and the nostalgia of a way to live the film can be lost forever.
The figures provided by Anec, the main trader association, mean that in the last five years, 316 films of traditional type have been closed, and these are the rooms of the main cities that paid the costs: 10 less in Florence, 9 less in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 less in Turin, 5 less in Palermo.
Among the most affected regions by closure, Emilie Romaine is headed by 82 cinemas mono rooms lost, followed by Toscane (44) and Lombardie (41).
The evidence confirming that the first responsible for their disappearance is the advance of multiplex, because it is well the three most recent Italian regions that have recorded the most recent multi-sale cinemas: 195 screens in Lombardia over the last five years, 81 in Toscane and Emilia-Romegne.
"Italian exploitation has developed irradiatedly," observes Paolo Protti, president of the Anec, "it is useful to build new structures, but it should also ensure the survival of those who already exist, because when a close room in a city, these frequencies are not necessarily all ready to go to multiplex.
Without talking about the lack of credit for traders, the former debt of the State is about EUR 10 million.
It is a shame that, from a ethical and moral point of view, the Government does not respect existing laws.
To support the sector, it would take between 16 and 18 million euros per year.
We note the case of Bologna, the first Italian city that, concerned about these closures, decided to resolve the situation through the signing of a protocol between Marie and Anec, the first of this kind in Italy, in order to defend and promote the cinemas mono rooms of the historical and peripheral centres.
Among the regulations provided, there are tax facilities for managers and benefits for the public in terms of mobility: spectators can enter the restricted traffic area and have special rates for stations and in some parking areas.
"It's an initiative that I am asking for," notes Giuseppe Tornatore, "and I hope that other cities will follow the example of Bologna setting up other measures.
However, it is clear that, in order to counter the superpower of multiplexes, traditional rooms also need to improve the quality of sound and image, as today's public is more demanding.
The defense of traditional film is a theme that has always been important to me: the closure of the Bagheria Supercinema, the place of my childhood and adolescence, was the essence that convinced me to make "New Paradise cinema" which I had thought for 10 years.
I've lived in Rome for 25 years, and when I've gone to the Rialto, or the Quirinal of National Via, now closed, where I've lived so much of my shared emotions, I turn from the other side so I don't see the dark panels by dust.
Links between politics and 'dragheta', major arrest of Gioia Tauro.
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro was willing to unify the choice of Marie to the interests of the Piromalli clan."
Serious accusations are launched by the judges of the Calabre Anti-Fraud Directorate, against the mayor and vice-chief of Gioia Tauro, Giorgio Dal Torrione, and Rosario Schiavione, and the mayor of Rosarno Carlo Martelli, arrested this morning for external competition for massive association.
The manats are also for Gioacchino Piromalli, the former mediator between the clan and the public administration, and his little son, lawyer, homonymous of the forest, already convicted of association of mafia-type offenders, as well as paying 10 million euros.
"a challenge to legal and moral regulations, and especially good sense," the prosecutors wrote, and the two local administrations expressed their willingness to pay consultations at Master Piromelli.
"If it had been granted to the court - writing the judges - to enter the office of the mayors to facilitate the possibility, already considered, control and orientation of the public administration"
The president of the Calabrias Regional Committee Agazio Loiero, is only covering "collusions between local committees and organised crime" in his region: "There are places where massive intensity is stronger than in others where collusion is almost inevitable.
But there are also many politicians who resist pressure from the dragongheta, heroes who are honest."
This morning's arrests follow the last July, followed by the police announced that they had disabled the Piromalli clan.
Since the end of April, Gioia Tauro's municipal council had been dissolved; already in 1991, and always due to conditions of organized crime and local administration, local politicians had been decapitated from their role in administering the City.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, chief of the UDC at the time of the resolution, was appointed head of a coalition of right-wing centres after the May 2006 ballot.
He creates the scandal when the prefecture orders the dissolution of the municipal council.
He accused the Deputy Minister of the Interior of the time, Marco Minniti, who accused him of manipulating everything on a political issue, but in view of the application for imprisonment signed this morning, the judges explained that the Priomamelli clan had even managed to request the change in the A3 project.
Among the interventions ordered against Dal Torrione, the pms are emerging "the availability of a man of business, representing a more well-known group, close to the Piromalli, uniformizing the public administration's choices to the interests of the clan.
When the energy is born of cows, now the bigs start.
This is a depleted vision that covers more than 70 per cent of the planet's surface and now the world's major energy companies are discovering it.
Vagues, currents, mares, here are the new renewable sources on which the hills like Chevron have put their eyes, and now they are trying to put their hands on it.
The possibility of energy from sea movements has been studied for hundreds of years, and in the 1970s, in conjunction with the first oil crisis, research has intensified.
When the oil price fell in 1980, the idea of exploiting marine energy was put aside, but now environmental authorities and the new increase in oil are making a major contribution to the sector.
The London World Energy Council (WEC) estimated that in 2007, 15 per cent of global electricity demand could be covered by marine oil operating systems.
This amount would be twice what nuclear power stations produce.
And besides, there would be currents and marinas..
The attack Colosseus.
The first marine energy undertaking was the Enersis, which signed an agreement to build an installation in North Portugal in 2005.
When the agreement was announced, it would have been said a real revolutionary step.
Two years ago, more and more candidates from these companies have always been involved in traditional energy.
"Chevron is currently studying ocean energy technologies," said the spokesman for a company associated with the U.S. oil bridge, the economic day Wall Street Journal, and she assesses the possibilities of working with us."
Cooperation on the subject, with regard to obtaining a permit issued by the American Energy Commission, is necessary to take place on a project to operate marine energy in Alaska.
This is a very interesting signal, especially if it is considered that just in Alaska, the US continue to extract oil, and recently President Bush has set up a project for new excavations.
In addition to Chevron, there are Verdant Power Inc. of New York and Ocean Power of New Jersey, which travel the way of energy coming from the sea, and our investments to this day, although their details are unknown, indicate a growing interest among observers.
Technology to put in place.
The experts are still talking about technology at its beginnings, partly because marine energy does not undermine fear of the ecological impact.
At present, systems such as those in Portugal, or some in Scotland, are small and do not seem to create a major problem in the ecosystem.
In order to produce large-scale energy, however, technologies must be used with a higher ecological impact.
"And the choices are different: Ocean Power, for example, uses a system of mutual bonding.
The motion of the valves, which moves the bows up and down, is transformed into a hydraulic pressure of the pistons and cylinders inside the floaters.
The pressure causes a turbine to turn around, feeding a generator.
The energy is sent to the river through cables under the sea.
At the same time, we have four systems of this kind in the project phase, pending a single federal approval and a part of energy could serve as a military installation.
By contrast, Power is already producing energy for a commercial centre and parking using six turbines under the East River in New York.
The movement of water during the marches turns the bubbles of the turbines, creating a rotary movement that feeds a generator.
Verding announced that there was a long list of customers waiting for the necessary power-powering authorisations.
After the vagabonds, the marinas.
A particular interest, they say to the Institute for the Research of Energy, which is now worthy of the potential of marinas.
Although it is an intermittent phenomenon, marriage is more predictable of wind, sun, or waves, and therefore more reliable as a source of energy.
And it's just on the energy of marinas that states such as New York, Maine and Alaska, with others, have invested 7 million and half a million dollars in 2008 and provides for investments up to 35 million in 2009.
