Tom reads for his daughter.
My computer is worth it.
The smoke was revealed.
Tom's been working at the hospital.
I remember.
Keep reading.
Keep going.
_Tile set:
Sit down.
Tom doesn't know anything about Mary.
Ask someone.
Look closer.
Shut up.
We're still the best.
Let's fight again.
It worked.
A song:
Let's go.
Obviously, Tom's sad.
Tom gave me a smile.
Tomorrow's gonna be tough.
Tom was inspired.
Let's go.
Tom doesn't want them to see how he speaks to you.
They're all out.
It's your turn.
I still think you lied to me.
I just want to say I'm sorry.
Be careful.
He's lost.
Make the car harder.
I don't want to go to school.
Be positive:
Hold on.
You're so short.
I quit my job.
Sit here.
How long have you been here?
Tom was on his way.
_Other Organiser
They got it.
Tom's gone.
My mom's home.
BEWARE:
Thank you.
Stay calm.
Take a step back.
Of course.
How beautiful!
Do you think I should do that?
It's incredible!
No one knows.
Write your hands.
How's your text?
It was a good fire.
Tom didn't get in the details.
Be careful.
Please stop.
Tom was falling.
They laughed.
Take care of this.
Tom took care of it.
They didn't.
I can't stand to think about it.
Come on in time.
Are you ready to go this year?
Enter:
Let's go to it a little bit.
That airline is only carrying out cargo operations.
Tom broke up.
So where are you from?
Tom told me that he didn't learn French at the university.
Sit down.
Look at this:
Get out of here.
Is there anyone at home?
I'm sorry I'm so late.
I hit Tommy's face with violence.
I don't agree.
Keep going.
Look at Tom.
Tom did it by hand.
All day long it takes me to sleep.
Find Tommy.
Tom took Mary home with his car.
Women change the world.
A little higher, please.
Tell him I'm asleep.
Tom married a girl from Boston.
They all laughed.
He's afraid of the dark.
I'm not so sure yet.
Fill out the bag with water.
I don't know if Tom's hungry or not.
Let it go.
Something's smaller.
Please finish.
It was a mystery.
That's what I asked for.
It won't change anything.
I don't understand that at all.
Keep running.
Consider this.
What a pleasure.
Tom had to ask Mary for help.
Continue searching.
Keep working:
Can you tell me who's coming tonight?
Zoom out.
Just sit down.
Be content:
I don't know why Tom didn't come, and I don't want to ask him.
I remember.
Let me read it.
Keep focus:
I'm sorry.
Be careful.
Let's see what this is.
It helps.
Wait here:
Stop reading.
I don't know if Tom's hungry or not.
I believe you will succeed.
It's near us.
One day you will understand:
Look at it.
How interesting!
Calm down, please.
What books does Tom read?
I have two brothers and three sisters.
There are three-way campsites in this area.
Tom doesn't have time to talk to you now.
Tom's got to go to school early.
Keep trying.
What a mess!
Change the sizes.
I'm sorry.
He's really good at talking.
So, please.
It's your turn.
Find it.
You tried.
Keep fighting.
Would you listen to me anyway?
Eat slowly.
I'm not a doctor.
It's a bird.
We've gathered.
Take everything.
Let's go.
You tried.
Let me say:
It's on the table.
Tom is proud of his new car.
The list is already in use.
Don't say anything.
Look under PUBLICATIONS:
How could you not know?
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
What a surprise!
They've got it.
Keep working.
Tom was pushing.
I wanted to read that book all the time.
So do I.
They all laughed.
"Burj-Ghalif," I'm now called the world's tallest skyscrapers.
What did you want to talk to Tommy about?
Let us see.
That was amazing.
He's walking.
Let's go back to the deal.
It's raining.
Get out of here.
Let it go.
Try again.
I'll give you five minutes to solve this problem.
What are you standing for?
Let's move a little bit.
I didn't even think Tom liked you.
When are you doing the shopping?
They won.
My mother's home.
Tom died as a result of a stupid accident.
Things changed.
I refused.
When are you doing your shopping?
Tom's down.
How does this work?
Let's do it.
Let's get rid of the tests.
Follow him.
Tom wrote it three weeks ago.
Be patient:
Let's do that.
That's not important.
I've been at home for a week.
I started living alone.
Let's do this again.
Look at me.
What are you talking about?
Tom wondered if it was worth discussing this with Mary.
Tom doesn't give a sign.
Be ready.
Tomorrow's gonna be tough.
Tom was laughing.
Time's running.
We've forgotten.
Now I need to see Tommy.
That's "bad."
They started a few hours ago.
Eat something.
He was weakened by a loss of blood.
Don't blow it.
Be careful:
Let's try this.
Is there a man at home?
Be careful:
Keep working.
Don't wait for us.
Stop playing.
Follow him:
I'm trying.
Tommy needs something.
Replace it.
When do you do the shopping?
Come on.
Come on.
Stop:
What a mess!
Look again.
Who should give it?
Come on, let's go.
Stay there.
I talked to Tommy last night.
Keep trying.
Can you stop shouting?
Don't read.
They're full.
They're counting.
Tom doesn't care how he's dressed.
I'm sorry.
We were honest.
Tom and Mary walked in a human direction.
I can't be late.
We're alive.
We work together.
Take it easy.
That's business.
Let me rest my work.
Let's go.
Keep going.
Keep the following in mind:
Consider again:
We've forgotten.
We got nothing.
From the beginning, girls.
I'm not a teacher.
Tom didn't say much, which is a bad sign.
One day you will find out:
In those days people lived there.
Let's finish.
Tom was upset.
No, no, no!
It's going to be dark.
It's clear.
Tell me.
Look around you.
Let's talk about it.
Tom's here to help us.
My eyes went out.
Take it back.
I'll get them.
Start again:
Keep moving.
Tom closes his eyes and turns out he's asleep.
Write this down.
Protect yourself.
It's enough to apologize.
Everything's important.
Be sure:
Wait a minute.
Wait for us:
I'm sorry.
They're all excited.
Let's not talk about it for a long time. Let's go to work.
Tom laughed.
He cleaned it with soap.
This morning the temperature dropped from zero.
Did you think I forgot that?
Take care of yourself.
Stay calm.
They waited.
Tell everyone.
What do you want to ask?
What do you suggest I do?
My sister Rí:
We're learning on the basis of experience.
Tom showed Mary the paper.
Look out.
They stopped.
Start writing.
Check it out.
Put it down.
They're walking.
Just tell me why you're here.
For more information, see chapter 8 of this book, What Does the Bible Really Teach?, published by Jehovah’s Witnesses
Tom's gone.
Cut it off.
This is my choice.
Tom's reading French better than I am.
Show me:
Tommy's back.
Take this back.
Tom was fighting.
Tom agrees.
Consider:
It'll be easy to get.
I'm on my way.
Tom's gone home.
Is anyone hurt?
One call.
Tom doesn't wear a mark.
Sing with me.
Ask Tom.
I'll say.
No one answered.
It's not bad.
Think about it.
Do you really want to know the truth?
Tom's never been to my house.
Let's go first.
That's enough.
You have the right to have your opinion.
It's very fun.
All right.
Keep working:
I'll keep it.
Of course I can, even if I don't speak Shanhaeran.
I did it inside.
Let's see how this will help.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.
Be fair.
When did you tell me?
Be wise:
Tom's a very selfish person.
Tom agreed.
We didn't get it.
There's a senior in the audience.
I'll watch TV.
Wait for me next to the car.
Tom tried to speak French to the seller.
Even if it gets so we notice it, it won't bother us.
Let's ask Tommy.
Ask Tom.
What a tragedy!
You know I'm in love with Mary.
I don't agree.
I want to promise to be perfect.
Let's go.
Stay away.
Listen.
You think it's a chimrutu?
Tell me.
What's your name?
We remember.
As fast as I could, I could catch my friend.
We'll have fun.
Tom doesn't give a sign.
Calm down.
I was waiting.
Something changed.
Tom's in a hurry.
We were waiting.
Oh, my God.
They all knew.
Think about it.
This card has five boxes.
I'm against it.
Tom asked us to be patient.
I thought he didn't have the right to do it.
Tom laughed.
Don't pay attention to Tom.
It won't change anything.
No one has expressed a wish.
I have to do something about it.
Just go in.
Look at them.
Many workers were missing.
Keep looking.
They were pushing.
Keep working.
Can you speak French?
Consider the following:
I don't face it anymore.
There's something to eat:
Three months before the university ended, Tom died.
Tom was born.
Tom and Mary ate in silence.
Welcome home:
Have fun.
Join us.
Tom's doing better than Mary.
Texvey's right.
Be true to yourself.
Let's start again.
They all laughed.
I wanted to know how this happened.
Keep it:
Let's tell you why we're here.
In any case, thank you.
Yes:
Tom's with his mother.
Stay away.
They didn't.
He was hurrying home.
Don't worry.
You can't do that without me.
Please, sir.
I'm worth more.
Give it to me.
Keep going, please.
You were supposed to wait.
Let's go.
It helps.
Now I need to see Tommy.
Remember him.
It's a good situation today.
Do you know the name of Tommy?
Don't cry.
Please sing.
Don't do this.
I don't know yet. Is he there or not?
You're so short.
Tom didn't know.
No one came.
Why are you standing?
Oh, no.
Tom answered.
Stay here.
Tom called his neighbors.
Let's go.
We'll see you at school.
Grab him.
There's only Tom and Mary in the room.
My brother.
Find this.
Let's get out of here.
Keep moving.
Click on it.
Come on.
The next green concerns are angry.
Keep them.
I see.
Have fun.
What are they waiting for?
Thank you.
What's the job?
Let's go tomorrow.
Stay here.
That's what I'm asking for.
There's a bad dog coming from it.
We're trying.
Tom can go to the club any minute to hear how Mary sings.
Tom liked Australia.
Let's take the means.
The tree is green.
Don't worry.
Read this.
Be satisfied.
That was unknown.
Here I am.
Stay awake.
I think I left something in the audience.
One day you'll understand:
Here's what I asked.
I'm in trouble.
It works.
Be careful.
You know Tommy's name?
Tom was crying.
Stay here.
The flowers are smiling.
That's enough.
Put me in the paper.
What happened?
The house is small.
Do you love your mother?
Come on in.
Tom wants a new car.
Abbreviation:
Someone broke up.
We got it.
Start song:
Answer me.
It worked.
We forgot:
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Take a step back.
Stop, please.
What's the difference?
A language is never Greek.
They got it.
Listen.
Tom's back in the room.
I still think you lied to me.
Keep working:
No problem.
Buy this.
Tom was underage.
There are kids playing in Agg.
Think about it again.
When are you doing your shopping?
Don't do that.
There are no prints on it.
Why are we running?
You shall put on the breastplate of judgment.
They all laughed.
Let's talk about how this works.
Tom fought.
They're looking at us.
We made a promise.
It happened.
Sit here.
Calm down.
Tom asked me to go with the movie studio Mary.
Let's get ready.
Tell me what you're looking for, and I'll help you find it.
And what?
Good morning, Tom:
Be sure.
Years passed.
Get dressed.
Tom forgot.
I like it here.
If the aspirin is going to weaken my head, I'll cut a few ribs instead of this dangerous drug.
Tom really respects you.
I said some things I didn't want to say.
Look here.
Welcome to the World!
I've never eaten the meat of horses.
Let's not talk long and go to work.
Would you like to see what's new?
We survived.
A Takachi:
Let's do it.
They're confused.
Tom and I are going together.
Let's get married to me.
It's good to go home as soon as possible.
They say Tom Jackson is one of Boston's best lawyers.
C_enter:
Endgame speed
They like it.
That's just what you think.
Katsana's full of water.
You're the leader.
Tom asked us to be patient.
Health food is important for health, health, and results, for the best results.
Hold on.
He believed in the truth.
Tom looked at it.
Sampien, please.
Stay here.
I don't think I'm deeply involved.
Don't get up:
They all prayed.
They all started laughing.
Tom's warm.
There's no one here.
Aragair.
Good morning, Tom:
Sleep, please.
Be honest.
We'll see where the work is.
I'll tell Tommy.
Do the writing.
Write this down.
That's where I went.
Keep it:
I live in Heaven.
I'll drive.
Take these back.
You know.
Don't blow it.
You don't do anything but eat.
Don't do that, Tom.
Find them.
Look at them.
They were working.
He married last year.
Tom moved his blog to my side.
Stand still.
Let's do everything.
This is my choice.
Tom's gone.
Let's tell you why we're here.
You're running.
So that's another case.
Please sing.
You've been here all night?
You're doing great. You're going back.
It's time.
Toulian:
I doubt that's what happened.
Tell me what I'm looking for, and I'll help you find it.
Stay away.
Keep them:
No one pays attention:
Stay away.
Redeals left:
Can I get you a minute?
Have fun with me.
Tom had often heard of Mary, but he hasn't met her yet.
Wait a minute.
Let Tommy go.
Let's go, Tommy.
Let's go.
Crayons don't have teeth.
He doesn't know.
Let's go.
Tom heard.
Tom wanted to sleep long, but he couldn't.
It's too late.
Start here:
It's enough to laugh.
Be loving.
Be ready.
Tom was a ghost.
Tom pushed it.
How many years have you lived here?
Does it look like he's animist?
Can you speak French?
Keep it down.
I thought Mary still loves me.
Stay here.
That's really impressive.
I don't know.
He ran for us.
Try again.
I've been thinking a lot.
I understand.
Morrair Tome.
Thank you.
Take him.
Stop.
Don't cry.
Start typing:
Everyone's work, whether it's literature, music, painting, architecture or anything else, is always his face.
A song.
Everything changed.
Tell Alex.
There are always differences:
You were supposed to wait.
Don't do this.
I got out of work.
What are you trying to do?
Stay here.
It helped.
Where are you from?
Keep trying:
I've got you.
That's enough competition.
I got it wrong.
Let's go.
Tom can go to the club at any moment to listen to Mary's song.
It's too bad.
Get that.
We don't need Tom.
I've finished my homework when you counted me.
Do I have plans for the Earth?
I don't care.
Keep going.
How amazing!
Prepare:
Tom's upset.
What's your favorite bird?
Tom's a very pretty man.
Call us.
What do you say about going to a woman?
Remember this.
These are not mine.
We lost.
Take me.
Let me guess.
He was jealous.
That's interesting.
Who died?
Stay here.
It's easy to say, but it's not easy to do.
Look at Tommy.
Put it down.
Longitude:
I'll try it again.
Tom's gone.
We forgot.
Tom has to thank me.
I'll be right back.
Take care of yourself.
Come on, please.
Be loving:
A bottle.
Be patient.
They're all alive.
Speak for yourself.
He tried:
Gather yourself together.
Speak for yourself.
It's a gift.
Who knows?
Put it here:
I love you more than anything.
I'm fine.
Do you have any more details on the map?
I got a message from Tom.
Tom looked into Mary's eyes.
Tom paid.
Tom doesn't know anything about Mary.
The food's cold.
I want Tom killed.
Tom's dead.
Please indicate the conditions of use of this information.
Be reasonable.
After you.
I just miss them.
What's Tom reading?
Let's see first.
Stand still.
I can do the math.
A boxer:
Protect yourself.
You've been patient.
Everyone's dreaming.
Thank you.
Tommy's year at the hospital.
Keep talking.
I forgot.
Let me say:
What did you want to talk to Tommy about?
Find this.
Take a little bit of it.
Finish this.
No answer was given.
Is there any details about Ellie?
Tom is much stronger today.
Fire.
Excuse me, can I leave a message?
Take me.
Please, come and give me a hand.
It'll be great.
I'm drinking.
You're welcome.
It can't be remembered.
Keep reading.
Even if he doesn't come, we have to start.
Don't stand up.
Tom was kidding.
Tom can't accept your gifts.
First Tom hated Boston.
It's criminal.
Everything changed.
Tom heard what his name was called.
Stay away.
Tom's dead.
You're against her.
Tom looked at his watch.
Speak up.
Ask different people.
The tree is burning.
Let him open it.
Tom doesn't have time to talk to you now.
Be respectful:
Stop arguing.
I can't let you do this.
Please, remember my name.
Gather yourselves together:
I want to see that girl.
Are you going to do something right now?
Seventy-eight years is the normal life span.
Let me go.
Let me guess.
Go home.
Sit down.
Please stay.
Don't move.
Is there a man at home?
What did you want to talk to Tommy about?
Use caution.
Speak up.
Well, I'll see you.
Tell Tom.
Did I leave something open?
Tom knows.
The sound came.
You can't do it without me.
It's enough to blow up.
Tell them all.
Speak clearly.
Answer me.
When did you tell me?
Would it be normal if I was sitting here?
Keep writing.
Tom thought he was an expert.
I'm sorry.
Note:
Keep trying.
Come back soon.
I'm sorry.
There's a sign.
My stomach's dry.
I left Tommy open.
I see.
That's right.
I'm drinking tea too.
Tom stood there waiting for him to walk through the whole street.
I just want to be safe to apologize.
Calm down.
I don't remember what I ate last night.
Find it.
Tell Tommy about it.
You think I should do it?
Tom ran away.
Put the fire down.
They're under arrest.
Tom's driving his new car.
Change sign [c]
Time's up.
Tom wanted to go to Mary's night, but unfortunately he had other things to do.
Let's do this again.
Keep smiling.
I can always sleep wherever I am.
How deep is it?
Let's start now.
Tom laughed.
Tom laughed.
I woke up.
Let him go.
Let's get a little closer.
Let's open it.
It's enough to apologize.
Do I have any?
Take a look at the following:
Tom's out.
Tom won.
Tom replied.
Stay positive.
We hope to take time.
Tom advised Mary to go as soon as possible.
Stay focused.
Tom's gonna die again.
Keep fighting.
That's right.
Remember that.
Listen carefully.
Help:
You're too many words.
Don't come in.
Let's do it again.
Tom worked in the hospital.
Tom wrote a very detailed report.
These details will not be published.
They're all hungry.
Welcome to Wikipedia
Does anyone know if the restaurant's open or not?
The woman's in the room.
Take him.
Tom's trying to quit smoking.
Keep running.
He wants to drink some tea.
Wait, please.
Help me.
Are you doing something right now?
What?
I love to grieve, and I know that most people try to avoid any kind of pain, but I think it's wrong.
Move:
I have to translate the predictions.
How dangerous!
They all waited.
What a day!
A bottle.
I'll stay.
It's an argument about mangroves.
It worked.
Be creative.
Consider the following.
Keep moving.
What a coincidence!
I admitted.
You have to sign this.
Be careful:
First row:
I don't care what you do with it.
Let's think about it a little bit.
Why didn't you write me?
Listen.
They're all stressed out.
Get out of here:
Tom has a very creative spirit.
Stay here.
Do you have any idea about this plan?
Ask different people.
Tom's down.
Hello, Tom.
I'm sorry.
Be Vigilant:
I didn't even think Tom liked you.
I love you.
You're on your own.
I need that soap.
We apologize.
Make sure you weigh it back.
They laughed.
Let's draw it together for my mother.
Come on, please.
I've got two bad guys.
Don't say anything.
Please, stop.
What a tragedy:
We'll have a good time in Boston.
I lost.
He was running.
We understand.
Do you really want to know the truth?
Be careful.
Don't sing.
You're kidding me.
No one died.
Tom helped.
Take this back.
Hit him.
Italo Calvino returned to Italy when he was a child.
What do you suggest I do?
Get in touch with Tommy.
Start:
Don't move.
What will one finally help or not?
Do you speak French?
Let him go.
Log here:
Have you ever been to America?
Wait a minute.
Tom ran up.
Note:
Don't go after the mutt's down.
Tom volunteered to do it.
Why did you stop me?
It's an old name.
I know.
Don't sing.
I don't know anything about this.
I'm tired.
Thank you.
He rushed.
Follow me.
Good evening:
What's wrong with me?
Calm down.
Oh, my God.
Look at this.
Tom said I'd call for a few minutes.
No one of my friends drinks.
Stand by:
Don't budge.
I don't have time to talk to you anymore.
I can't stop thinking about what happened.
Here's Ray:
Tom cried.
Let's talk.
Tom said.
Don't worry.
You're not.
Go ahead.
Chris is very attractive and rich, but not very modest.
Have a good dream.
Consider the following.
What a coincidence!
Don't say anything.
Come on.

How old are you?
Tom was saved.
I love the Aquitaine language.
Tom's gone.

Let's go.
They're excited.

It really hurt him, and sometimes he didn't want to talk about something, and I think it'll take a long time until he gets back to normal.
Stay calm.
I don't speak Japanese.

Be respectful.
Tom says there's no problem.

I'm doing my class.
Stop laughing.
I don't imagine such a life.
Stand here.
Thank you for coming to everybody.
Tom was listening.

No one's listening.
Tom's driving.
They got it.
Let's do this again.
- Thank you.
What?
Stay calm.
It's not interesting how valuable it is, and I'll still buy it.
Everything's changed.

There's a bad dog coming from here.
Would you excuse me?
Tom's not stupid.
Let's talk about how this works.
Tom wasn't happy to see Aunt Mary.
I'm drinking too.
Try again.
I agree.
Go on, please.
Please, listen.
I refused.
Shut up.
It works.
How many of you are there?
Look closer.
Tom needs to know what the bans are on.
She looks happy here.
The man who's sitting there is a famous singer.
Let's see.
I can't confirm the proposal.
I find it very easy to talk to Tommy.
Someone called.
Everything's broken.
It's a horse.
I know Jimmy from childhood.
You have to sign this.
I thought he was coming.
Tom lied.
He's here.
He's coming like this.
Why should we give it to you?
Look out.
Tom said he'd help me.
Stop voting.
I'm sorry.
Left-click.
Look.
On one side:
Really?
Why are they so bad about us?
Stop burning.
Keep moving.
I don't like silence.
Be careful.
You don't get this good.
Be careful.
Come on.
Let's say something.
Wait a minute.
Tom wants a new car.
Your heart will soon accept one.
Tom saw Mary this week.
Silence, please.
There's a man working on the farm.
Bring me the paper.
