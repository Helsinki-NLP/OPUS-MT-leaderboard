The size of the elephant surprised the boy.
If they make a contract, we're safe.
If you invited him, he might come.
Is that yours, Tom?
How can I reach the airport?
Not everyone can understand that.
It's much easier to identify and tag the mistakes of others than to recognize our own.
He helped me clean up the mess.
Everyone likes him.
You better not stay out for too long.
Isn't that a boy's name?
Wait for your sister.

That's too expensive!
More and more people have a computer at home.
Tom never listens to anyone.
Okay, I'll do it again.
No one's visiting me anymore.
He's all but trusted.
He was absorbed by the reading.

I feel much safer now.
Shall I wait?
What's your favorite local restaurant?
I'm in China for less than a month.

Why are you always cold?
That's exactly what I wanted.
We all dreamed of you.
The mirror is broken.
I've never caught Tom.
Tom thinks it's a mistake.

That girl wants a good ride!
She'll take care of everything for us.
