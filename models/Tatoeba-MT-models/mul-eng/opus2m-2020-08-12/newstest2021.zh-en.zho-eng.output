Newwara's review: The return of aboriginal workers to the village ' s life force-new network
The village is alive. It's the key.
Where's the guy?
The excellent return of agricultural groups is a vital force.
The New York Times, Business, Work.
The New York Society became powered on July 26, entitled: The return of noble agricultural workers to the village's life force.
This year, 34-year-old blacksmiths in the village of Kisangji-mingo, leaving thousands of jobs in Beijing in 2010.
After a few years of closure, the income of his Portuguese farm year, which he now operates, now exceeds the millions of dollars, has become a small- named leader and has been elected to the two "Committee" branches in the village.
In recent years, a series of agricultural policies, such as rural revitalization, have been encouraged by a growing number of well-being farmers who have chosen to return to their businesses, such as wheat and wheat.
My country's Ministry of the West Population, the Ministry of Labour, the University of the Great Lakes, led by the initiative to implement the "best agricultural return project", only in 2019, a record of over 8,000 rural parties from the departments of the affected best agricultural works, the training reserve capacity of the village, and the rest of the 2 million development parties provided strong assurances for the fight against poverty and the implementation of the rural revitalization strategy.
Little sick. It's key to the old man.
Since the opening of the reform, a large number of young people in our rural communities have been able to work outside the labour force, some of which have created their own businesses by cutting down.
However, objectively also resulted in a different degree of "vacuumization" in rural areas, particularly rural grass-roots organizations, the registration of the Ministry of Rural Affairs and the presence of all party members of "a low" characteristics, that is, ageing, low-schooling, low-ranking, low-favoured, low-powered, low-powered and low-powered and low-skilled community organizations.
If the elements such as rurals have always moved to the city, the village has been in the state of "lost" "blood" for a long time and is alive as an empty word.
To attract those who are able, consciously and willing to be drawn back by farmers who are willing to work for domestic services, lead them to become leaders of the mining business, from the medium-sized development of party members, the Ministry of Rural Affairs, and to a full range of ground-based forces, which is a solution to the problems of rural party members and grassroots organizations.
Good farmers are coming back and they're gonna have to stay and do it.
In recent years, the Quartet has been building on the basis of strict selection standards of farmers, establishing best-earned jobs, providing services, training skills, selecting system mechanisms such as capacity-building, security, life-saving, and real-life skills, and the success of official entrepreneurship.
This year is the year of the determination of the hard-to-response harvesters, which is a key factor in the success of the fight against poverty and in the wake of the return to the village.
The Government of each Party would like to place great importance on this group of farmers who, through the integrated measures, have been able to make them able to stay and fight and carry out unhindered task forces and live forces to provide strong organizational safeguards and human resources for rural poor health and development.
As a result of the epidemic, this year's university graduates are a special event, and on the night of 11 July, billibilities will be played directly on a special line for graduates, the old, the old, the old, the old, the young, and the young, and it is not easy to wait for the musicians to sing and bless for their graduation.
The famous Superintendent SealWu also brought up a "garden", which was a very popular song of his creation based on Russ's same-named collection of lyrics.
Because of their relationship with the vaccines, a number of graduates were unable to meet the location and gave the school evidence, they transferred it online.
Data show that over 2.5 hours of singing is now more than 35 million.
" Follow your own heart, take the opportunity, no matter what consequences, and sometimes there will be unexpected receipts. "
Although it's a graduation song, many songs don't have to be performed.
"Everyone's youth is so full of beauty and regret, but it's worth the effort to walk away."
Beijing's natural environment continues to thrive, attracting more than 500 other wildlife cities in the new network.

The capital's natural environment continues to thrive.
Beijing animals have reached over 500 species.
The report (The Kingdom of Beijing) reported that in recent years, the species and number of wild animals have continued to increase as a result of the continued improvement of the natural environment in the capital.
At present, more than 500 species of farmed game animals in Beijing have been found to be protected at national level, including dogs, black and white, as well as at national level.
Whether it is one of the two types of urban forests, or the small dome between buildings, it is not only natural for the people of the capital but also appealing to wild animals to " settle in the city " .
During the summer season, a group of geothermals were found in the natural protection areas of the mountain country in the mountains of the north-western part of the region.
One of them was playing in the mountains, and two dogs were fighting each other.
Back in the first place, a wild bull's "snake" is not living on its own. The head of the Natural Protection Region Department at the national level of the mountains was introduced by the end of 2019 in a total of over 6200 square kilometres in the blue Sea, where there are 178 wild animals at the national level and 178 wild animals at the national level, including wild animals, and nearly one third of all species of wild animals can be seen here.
"In the mountains, wild animals are the real 'owner', and our staff fill it with only 'protection' of people. "
In order to understand the situation of wildlife plants in the protected area, there are more than 30 professional patrols every day, followed by a thorough investigation of the protection route along Article 16 and a "circuit circle" per month, with almost one whole day running throughout the protection area.
" In the course of the inspection, it is not necessary to check the biodiversity records and also to check the installation of human embryos, the rescue of injured wild animals, and the installation of outer outer space cameras, etc. "
The natural protection area at the national level of the Sunshine has now installed more than 200 outer cameras to record the living conditions of wild animals in the wilderness.
As biodiversity in the area of protection has grown in recent years, more and more wild animals have emerged from their heads, and cats, bears, and cats have become "permanent" as they have become "permanent in Benin", and national levels of animal protection.
The Director-General for Forestry and Forestry Protection of the Beijing Forestry Department announced that there had been an increase of over 500 species since 1994 and that there had been an ongoing increase in the number of wild species and numbers in Beijing in recent years.
The presence of wild animals in the city has become more and more common and has been closely associated with urban warming in recent years.
In particular, a new round of forest-based greening construction, which began in 2018, has been proposed to re-establish the ecological environment of the city, to enhance the ecological function of the forest-based soil, highlighting the concept of "near natural".
Planned efforts to achieve interaction with the surrounding landscape and to facilitate the "nursing of wild animals" of species are also the sources of honey for animals and food plants.
I'm committed to helping computers and our communications around the world.
There are many ways to do this, and I like to focus on helping computers to talk about what they see and understand.
In view of this situation, a modern computer can tell you, there's a woman, there's a dog.
It can tell you, the woman's smiling.
It can even tell you, this dog is so cute.
I'm dealing with this question, thinking how humans understand and interact with the world.
Those thoughts, memories and stories in such a situation, may draw attention to mankind.
Interlinkages related to the situation.
Perhaps you've seen such a dog before, or you've spent some time running on such sands, and more and more waking up in memories and ideas of the past vacation, when you went to the sea, when you and the other dogs, ran away.
One of my guiding principles is to help the computer understand what it is, what it is, what it is, what we believe and how we feel, so we're able to start developing computer technology, in a complementary way with our experience.
So, deep down this thing, I started working to help computers produce stories like humans, from image sequences.
So one day, when I'm working on the computer, I'm gonna ask her how she feels about Australia.
It looked at the picture. It saw a tree.
It doesn't know what the doll is, but the computer says it thinks it looks like it's an interesting animal.
And then I shared with the computer a series of images about the house's destruction.
The computer looked at a picture, and it said, "This is a wonderful vision!
It's freezing my back.
The computer saw a horrible, life-changing event and thought it was a positive thing.
I realize that computer recognizes red and red comparisons, and I think that's something that deserves positive evaluation.
Part of the reason is because most of the computer I enter is positive images.
That's because when people talk about their own experiences, they tend to share positive images.
When was the last time you saw yourself at the funeral?
I realize that in the process of improving human skill, it is a mission assignment, data collection, computer understanding, creating huge gaps, gaps and blind spots.
At the same time, I'm going to be coded for different preferences.
Predictions reflect a limited perspective, from a data collection -- from which they reflect the same human beings, such as vision and dot impressions.
I recall the development of that technology, which made me get to my place that day -- the first color image is a collating on a white woman's skin, which means that color pictures are different to black faces.
And the same difference, that stupid point, continued to bring in the '90s.
Even today, the same blind spot still exists in the Department's identification technology applications, how to identify different people's faces.
In today's study, I think of the most advanced technology that tends to impose our ideas on a data collection and a problem.
And so we're creating more blind points and prejudices, which will be further increased when we use human wisdom.
Then I realized that we had to think, we're creating technology today, how to be seen after five to ten years.
In human interaction with the environment, people use time to solve problems, so progress is slow.
Human wisdom is developing at a speed that is hard to believe.
That means it's really important, and now we need to think about it carefully -- what our blind points and prejudices mean to the future, and how these prejudices affect the technology we're creating now, and discuss today's technology.
CEO and scientists, they've been able to measure their ideas, about future people's intellectual development.
Stephen Hawkin warned: " Human wisdom will cause human death. "
This is an existing risk, and we as civil society; one of the greatest risks to be faced.
"I don't understand why people don't care more about human intelligence."
But these ideas -- just part of the story.
That math, model, the basic component of these people's intelligence, we can both get and use.
We have an open source code tool for the public to learn computers, and at the same time make our own contribution.
Besides, we can share our experiences.
We can share it in technology and it's our relationship, and how it makes us feel.
We can talk about what we love.
We can communicate with the future, which may be more useful in terms of technology, or as time goes by, more problems may arise.
If we all focus on opening up discussions about human wisdom, looking forward to the future, it will help create a normal dialogue and awareness about human wisdom, what can it become? And everything we need to do is to achieve our best results.
We've seen and understood this in the technology we've been using today.
We're using smart phones, digital assistants and automatic smokers.
Are they evil?
Maybe sometimes.
Are they useful?
Yes, they are.
They're not exactly the same.
That's where you've seen the future.
The future will continue from our present creation and creation.
We started the Domingo bone effects, which opened the way for progress in human intelligence.
In our time, we've built human intelligence tomorrow.
Let's get tired of building up real technology to bring the past world back to life.
When people find it difficult to communicate, science helps them share their experiences.
It's based on online video technology, which can be used on the car's auto-circuit.
Science is based on the understanding of images, which can develop to help people see technology, help them to better have a vision of the world.
We've also seen science and how it leads to some problems.
We have technology today to analyze our physical characteristics — such as our skin color or facial features to determine whether we are criminals or terrorists.
We have the technology to process data, to process data on sex or race, to determine whether we can get credit.
All we can see right now is that it's just a human intelligence process.
Because where we are now, it's a moment of change.
This means that what we do now will affect future developments, and extend to the future world.
If we hope for human wisdom to help us improve the way that humans are made, we need to define strategies and objectives, and quickly open the way.
What I want to see is the development direction that fit human culture and the environment.
Science skills help us deal with psychosocial diseases or other disabilities, make them like everyone, make life as challenging.
The operation of science doesn't measure your characteristics or skin color.
I'm concerned today about tomorrow and after ten years of science.
Human wisdom can be seen in many different ways.
But in this case, it doesn't have any purpose, no one's driving.
It's a car we can drive together.
We choose when to speed up and when to slow down.
We choose whether or not we need to change.
We choose what kind of people's work will be.
There'll be a wide range of competitions.
It'll turn into a lot of different things.
Now depends on what we need to know in order to ensure that the results of human wisdom are better for all mankind.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Black land "type" from the modernization of agriculture - New York
September 26th: Black land " from "Agricultural modernization"
In the summer, two airfields of applied pesticides emerged from the second operating site of the fifth management area of the friendly farm and formed two white lines, and several large-scale outdoors were awakened in the green fields using "the first day" of the green field.
The headquarters of this operation insisted that this aircraft could one day carry more than 6,000 landfills of pesticides, which are about 8 times as efficient as no human machinery and hundreds of times as human works.
This farm is located in the heart of our first cousins in Heron-Hungary Province, in the province of Paz, where, from the last "Hungary" to the current "London" voice, traditional Chinese farms and farms have been transformed on this black soil.
In addition to aircraft, satellites are also used for modernized agricultural production in friendly farms.
On the one hand, they use satellite remote sensing technology to achieve rationalization, reduce agricultural inputs and reduce pollution; on the other hand, satellite navigation technologies can improve standardized operating levels among agricultural fields.
During this year's water production, the plant has expanded its operating range from 3,000 tons last year to 30,000 tons.
This technology order is more efficient to grow and maximize the use of sun and soil resources and can save up to 16 per cent of the labour costs.
The farm tried to inform the production of new technologies, such as intelligence, and formed the largest agricultural machinery group in the country from the ground to the sky.
According to statistics, at present, farmers currently have a total holding of 4.9% (per cent), with an integrated mechanization rate of up to 99.8 per cent.
Agricultural operations achieve 100 per cent of GPS satellite navigation, 100 per cent of dry land intensively, and 100 per cent of dry land-based Tamil vehicles.
" Green agriculture, smart agriculture, digital agriculture is a modernized route of exploration. "
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Agricultural modernization is key to scientific progress.
A model of modernized "farm" agriculture, represented in the agricultural sector, has been developed in the recent years by Montenegro, which has led to the creation of a system of modern agricultural industries that is guided by modern agriculture.
There is a farm farm of 350,000 square miles [350,000 sq km] in the area of a friend park.
This focused on the introduction of more than 140 agricultural machinery for more than a year.
These tools and farms have proved our agricultural modernization process.
The small village of Zhao has been transferred directly to New York City.
E-mail dated 26 July, New York Society entitled: Small houses for everyone — — Andy-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-

On 25 July, more than 4 p.m., the bride wears a pair of shoes full of shoes, from the front door to the back of the house, and the wife's cousin comes home busy collecting things.
"I've got a call from the Ministry of Rural Affairs to move, and I've been working in the field."
He moved more than 60 yards away from the water, and he looked up and looked at it with a good look, "He also had drugs yesterday and whatever tools he had collected."
"No one wants to be buried in the house, but the house is for everyone. "
In order to cope with the continued high water pressure and the potential drop in water from the lake, the joint city of Anguilla was ready to launch a flood of water from the Ouija board of the Ouija board on 26 days.
The bridge is located in the coast of Bachsey, near the coastal lake.
Several thousand villagers involved in the complex and three river villages need to be transferred.
As at 1625 hours, my country's fifth-largest lake lake water remains at 13.2 m high and over-guaranteed by 0.7 m.
The kitchens of the house are clean and are kept on the table with a table of fresh South Korean food, a refrigerator with milk and some food.
"I don't want to move. The water of the river is still looking good."
The weekend says that there's a flat in the house, and some big things don't want to be left out for a while.
"Precisely collect valuable items, such as fridges and TVs can be placed in a temporary location of neighbors or relatives."
The lord of the village has been firmly committed to the idea of a treasure.
The Queen is responsible for the transfer of 13 villagers, one by one, and one by one informs them of the establishment programme for each individual.
The most recent location of the House of Commons is a two-kilometre skiing school.
In addition to large quantities, there are more than 1,000 petals and some new items in the home that make up two mouthpieces.
"The food's ready to go to the cousin's house. The house can't move."
The couple had a deal and raised their beds under a new bed about half a mile away.
At 6:00 a.m., the Grand Duchess started driving three vehicles to his neighbor's house and continued to collect at home on Sundays.
At 11:00 a.m., my wife and I looked in front of the house once and picked up the electricity and ready to take a seat.
"I wish the water would come back early."
You're welcome.
On 26 July, at 9 a.m., the journalists saw the location of the Ouija board and prepared preparations prior to the eruption.
There's a lot of young people on the New York Internet following the Colin's small team.
On 11 July, the Young People's Movement "a Young People's Initiative " was officially launched in the south of the South Sea.
The movement's lead team is on the follow-up section and the support of the Lingala small-scale cross-border stage, while Linden and the gardening points appreciate different features, while the hard core of the "butcher" power-sucking device makes the program "burn" more powerful.
In the first place, 11 sports youth and young people were also concerned at the "strong conflict" "strongly opposed" "strong"" "strong" race, while outside the audience.
Of which, "Fortified Conflict" comes from the first A-Sporter Jovin, who openly challenged the so-called "Breed Men" in the race before the competition, and the outdoor conditions of the popular should go to the show and even release the phrase "Don't waste your tears."
The young men and movement leaders on the first floor were in a flurry of air.
And "strongly opposed" is more like a fight against the gods who are honored by the same powerful spirit of power as the "King of the Great."
And their identity also began to disappear, and they were healthy and healthy actors, and they were disbanded by the White Army, and three military commanders were captured.
At the beginning of the competition, the two young men were trying to get out as fast as they could, and on the roof they were constantly fighting against the presence of the public.
In a tense situation, the follow-up section as one of the Young People's Movement Teams is also in a serious battle.
In a brief review, he was also very careful to encourage a young person who lost his game to help each point of error in the recovery process.
And it's a typical attack on the Young People's Fund, and she doesn't hide her appreciation for young people who are online.
It is much more satisfying to learn about the daily training of young people who are overloaded by the movement.
The same is true of Linden and Kwana, who are the champions of the movement, one of whom is " the prophet of the Gods " , and one of them is " the mad girls who are scattered around with a smile. "
In addition, Gigging and Ginger made a lot of jokes as a sports assistant, as well as youth around the movement.
The Fire of the Church of the South of France: the volunteer in the area recognized the fires, the balance of time and good speech - in the new network
On 26 July, the new Internet e-mail media reported that on 18 July France's religious history building in South France, known as St. Peter and the St. Paul's Church, was severely damaged in a fire accident and that the storm was completely destroyed.
On the 26th of the day, the local prosecutor declared that a district volunteer responsible for the protection of the church had been charged with the crime as "the destruction of the fire".
He has admitted that he himself has a fire in the church.
It is reported that local prosecutor Senas stated that this 39-year-old volunteer from Rwanda recognized three points of fire in his own church at night.
This man's lawyer said that the fireman had done this a long time ago.
He entered France a few years ago through a way of escape and was detained in the church in this concentration camp.
The prosecutor noted that he had recently tried to update the visa and was in contact with the Police Department for dialogue on this matter.
But the church remains unafraid of the fact that it is very good at the same time, with a smile, but without words, it will destroy the church that he loved so much.
On the day of the fire on 18 July, the volunteer had been released from the police investigation because he had been described as a problem of logic and had been questioned by the police.
A plan to rescue firemen at the scene.
In the middle of the 25-night period, the person was again informed of the fact that the professional engineer of the Paris Central Police Chamber had obtained new evidence.
This time, the man recognized his self-defense.
It is reported that if a crime of intentional destruction is established, suspects may face 10 years ' imprisonment and a fine of EUR 150,000.
It is reported that this fire caused serious damage to Saint Pierre and the Holy Paul's church, and that there was a complete destruction of the church's roofs and a severe damage to the colour glass windows behind it.
France's Chief Building for the Protection of France's History, Brune, believes that it is estimated that the work of the Church of the South would be resumed for at least three years.
Comprehensive information: United States unilateralism destroyed relations between two countries.
E-mail New York City 26 July Integrated Newspapers on New York: 24 July morning, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China informed the United States Embassy that China had decided to abolish the establishment and operation of the United States General Council and to request a specific request for the General Council to cease all operations and activities.
It was held that the unilateral measures taken by the United States caused serious disturbance to relations between the two Central States and that China responded to the United States without justification and that countermeasures were appropriate and necessary.
The head of the China Research Centre of the Institute of International Studies at the University of Chile said that the unilateral measures of the United States destroyed the bridge between the two peoples of Central America and caused the crisis between two major countries.
China informed the United States that the closure of its headquarters was contrary to United States unilateral measures and was in line with diplomatic practice.
Professor of the University of Argentina, the Director of the Athenian Research Centre, Patrio Justo, considered that the above-mentioned decision was the right and necessary countermeasures for the United States, not for the general public.
The United States tried to bring the United States' attention to its failure to cover its new epidemics through pressure from China.
The President of the Innovation Research Centre in Chiquia, Indonesia, said that the United States had taken a challenging diplomatic approach to the two countries of Central America and had faced serious challenges.
China informed the United States that the closure of its headquarters in the United States was normal countermeasures, in accordance with diplomatic practice, which reflected China ' s strong principle of maintaining its own interests and reflected a useful detail of China ' s diplomatic mission.
Frances Semmmundza, co-rapporteur of Tanzania, said that the above-mentioned decision was the right and necessary response to the United States' challenge.
The Central American relationship needs to be restored to normal, and the United States should take the initiative to improve its relations with China and stop interference with China ' s internal affairs.
The United States should focus on how to achieve economic and political success with China and how to benefit both peoples and the international community as a whole.
The Executive Director of the Arab-China Association of Friends of China at Headquarters in the Sudan said that the restrictive measures imposed by China were justified and necessary to respond to the United States in a fair and necessary manner, in accordance with the basic norms of international law and international relations and in accordance with diplomatic practices.
The former United States has requested the closure of the China General Council in Houston of a serious violation of the basic norms of international law and international relations.
It is hoped that the United States will abolish this earlier decision and create the necessary conditions for the normal restoration of relations between the two countries.
Singapore's " joint early newspaper" has expressed its opinion that the United States' greater strategic intention is to surround China and prevent China from continuing to rise.
Faced with United States tensions, while China was reluctant to see the continued deterioration of Central America, it had to take countermeasures.

On July 26th, the newsmagazine newspaper of New York City learned from the Broad Sea Police Department that the United States Customs, the public sector, had recently broken down a special group of private-sector oil companies, which initially verified the group's total private- oil consumption of about 120,000 tonnes since 2019, with an estimated 8 billion dollars in cash and about $240 million in tax evasion.
The Police of the Far East and the Customs Private Service have gradually clarified the group ' s staff breakdown and organizational structure.
On 8 July, the sea police, customs, the public security sector carried out a unified network operation, such as in the state of the state, as well as in the coastal area, where 4 ships were suspected of being stolen, 4700 tons of oil were collected in the case ships and oil warehouses, respectively, and frozen a number of financial accounts.
It was understood that this joint operation had launched eight helicopters, two helicopters, a number of action teams engaged in combating the whole chain of events such as the invasion of the sea, the illegal operation of land, and 35 major suspects had all arrived at the case.
The case is now being further settled.
The relevant authorities of the FARDC indicated that the future would continue to be a high-pressure situation, combating all types of criminal offences committed by the sea and maintaining good maritime order in the area of jurisdiction.
"Hanna" is the land of the United States, or it's a river storm and a new network in the mountains.
On 26 July, an integrated external media report from the Central Internet says that at 25 a.m. on the local level, the "Hanna "land of Texas, U.S.A., will bring heavy rains to the state, floods and floods, and may also lead to life-threatening mountains.
According to the National Wind Centre, it is expected that the "Hanna" wind will cause floods and floods across the southern and north-eastern regions of the state, floods or floods, as well as volcanic eruptions that threaten life.
It is reported that the most serious impact of the "Hanna" storm is the southernmost region of Kojoscristi to the edge of the Grand Canal, while the Giant Mountains are likely to explode.
"Any wind is a big challenge, says Abbott, governor of the state. "
There are 32 mines in the state because of the storm in the disaster.
This population of over 320,000 cities in Kojoscristi has been closed to libraries and museums and the population is seriously awaiting.
Abbott also said that while the state was experiencing a new epidemic, it could no longer cause more damage to the state.
It is reported that the amount of water falling in the southern part of the state is expected to reach between 6 and 12 pounds during the 26-night period and that there will also be 3-5 pounds of rainfall in the northern part of Texas and in the coastal areas of Louisiana.
Because of the effects of global warming, "Hanna" was formed earlier in the Atlantic Ocean.
In general, the first Atlantic wind cycle usually takes place until mid-August.
Poland will withdraw from Europe the Treaty on the Prevention of Violence against Women
The Ministry of Justice of Poland stated that the next week Poland would take steps to withdraw from Europe a treaty against violence against women.
The Secretary-General of the Government of the right of Poland stated that the Treaty required school teachers to exercise their rights to the school ' s parents.
The Minister of Justice of Poland, Mr. Güblo, will hold a press conference on the question that his leadership in the Ministry of Justice will propose to the Ministry of Labour and Family a request to start withdrawing from the treaty.
The treaty is also known as the Istanbul Convention.
He said, "This treaty includes some elements that we consider to be harmful psychotropic. "
The law of Poland ' s administration has a close relationship with the judiciary and its executive union partners with the Roman Catholic Church to promote a sustained social agenda.
During this month's successful follow-up campaign, the President of Poland, Doda, made the right to hate homosexuality one of the main issues.
On Friday, hundreds of thousands of Polish people (most of them women) were protesting against the withdrawal of the Convention in Warsaw and some other cities.
In a protest march held in Warsaw, Lempat, one of the protesters, said, "The purpose of the treaty is to legitimize domestic violence".
Some of the protesters stood up and wrote "the law and justice parties are the Hell of Women".
The Law and the Justice Party have long complained about the Istanbul Convention.
The Government of the former Central Bank of Poland ratified the Convention in 2015.
The Law and the Government of the Justice Party stated that the Treaty did not respect religion and demanded that the social policy of free movement be taught in schools.
However, as yet, the Party has not decided to withdraw the Convention.

According to the Brazilian media, Bosonaro reported on the day that he announced the results of the virus testing, went to the capital of Brazil, and met with a member of the National Assembly.
In the past, Bosonaro has been away from the office of President.
On 7 June, Bosnia and Herzegovina announced in its joint media show that he had been exposed to the results of his six-day new HIV tests and two tests had been conducted on 14 and 21 days and that he had been exposed to them.
"The Green Way" is the New York Internet.
The Government of the People ' s Republic of Zheu Province of New York on 26 July (Hungary and White) has recently made it clear that the Government of the People ' s Republic of China ' s Army will give priority to individuals or their children who are highlighted in this anti-fraumatic disaster relief mission, in accordance with the terms and conditions, and that they will be subjected to physical inspection, political-nuclear-democratic examinations.
" After registering young people, we shall give priority to the military after verification of the youth community, the Ministry of Armed Forces and the search for soldiers in the area of the Sun. "
The Deputy Minister for the Armed Forces of the Nine-Minister for Human Rights of the City of Nicaea said that they had been affected by disasters and that they had been focusing on three days of youth testing.
The nine-major district of the city should be a university graduate at the age of 22, whose mother was a community staff member, the father was a retired army officer from a department of air forces, and the parents who had been competing for ten days had been protecting the value of a flood line.
"These days, in the press, I want to be like them. "
The week's competition said that he had from childhood a dream from the military, and he was more determined on this occasion to join the military.
The nine cities also called for the voluntary participation of young people in patrols, the maintenance of values, the nature of the local people's troops, and their confidence in the military.
According to the 9th Committee of the Government of the Armed Forces of the People of the City of Nicaea, it is hoped that, through a priority-setting approach, it would encourage more appropriate youth to participate in the mission glory and the good social environment of military glory.
According to the overcrowded news, Gryvori believes that Viet Nam has made a significant contribution to the development of Astana for 25 years.
Viet Nam is not only an Austrian responsible person but also an Austrian fireman.
In Grivori, the Russian Federation and the Economic Union of Aeronautics believed that Viet Nam contributed to enhancing its status and to the spread of its images abroad.
He stressed that "Asia should therefore be grateful to Viet Nam."
Gryvori indicated that the analysis had been approved of the peace initiatives proposed by Viet Nam.
Viet Nam is willing to share experiences with ASEAN countries and to propose constructive peace measures on issues facing the Asia-Pacific region, including the East Sea issue.
With regard to the cooperation between Viet Nam and Russia under the ASEAN framework, Grievor believes that Viet Nam supports Russia ' s cooperation with IAEA and helps Russia to benefit from this cooperation framework.
The AEEC and Viet Nam, including Russia, were able to enter into the OSCE market after the signing of a trade agreement.
It recommended that the European Economic Union and the Asian States, as a whole, extend the free trade zone of the European Union and its partner countries to create a platform for economic and security stability.
At the same time, Gryvori believed that Russia, Viet Nam and Astana were moving in the direction and will achieve their objectives.
From now until the end of 2020, the Northern Hemisphere will have the necessary conditions, in particular in infrastructure, human resources and land, in order to encourage foreign flows, in particular with value chains and forwarding technologies.
In addition, the Ministry of Northern Hemisphere will arrange for a good transfer to the Prime Minister of the Government ' s decision to issue proposals for the construction of infrastructure and operational projects in the Trans-Korean Industrial Area and to ratify the addition of the two industrial and urban-service areas of the Province to the overall plan for the development of the South-West Industrial Area by 2020.
At the same time, the Northern Province is working to speed up the progress of projects, especially in the rich and rich states of the United Kingdom, with the establishment of a land fund for competition.
During the year 2020, the North-West Department of Trade has established industrial areas and industrial group planning projects to integrate provincial planning.
The Northern Province determined that the development of industrial areas should be integrated into national security, protection of the environment, ensuring food security and contributing to the balanced development of the industry; that they have comprehensive electricity, water, transport and telecommunications infrastructure, and that they combine with urban construction, trade services, labour housing and health, and other social infrastructures such as education.
In industrial areas, the Ministry of Northern Ireland has been calling for high-tech and clean technology investment projects in the fields of electricity, electronics, telecommunications, sophisticated machinery and industrial support.
In the industrial field, the province called for small-scale investment projects in the field of production and use of land-based labour, in particular agricultural products and food processing.
In the future, the Northern Hemisphere will strive to accelerate its investment in infrastructure for logistics centres in the north-east of the city and to develop synergy with industrial garden groups to improve goods, cash flows and to help reduce production costs, increase the value of goods, optimise supply chains and develop multimodal communications, thus creating attractiveness for investors to invest in the province.
Update the Russian armed helicopter card-52M for the first time in the year 52M-New York
On 25 July, according to the Russian Ministry of Defence ' s plan, the Russian armed helicopter (hereinafter referred to as " armed forces) upgrade version of K-52M will complete the conversion of clothes and plant in the first month of December of this year, which will have a greater impact on the detection, communication and weaponization of the aircraft.
According to the Russian News News News News Day, military-52M is called "super-level short-pound", and its development contract was signed by the Russian military and military units last April, and the first two upgrades are currently underway in the construction of a "progress" space group's long-standing helicopter plant, which will be replaced by its national test and improvement of recovery by October 2022.
The Russian expert who was aware of the above-mentioned upgrades introduced the "precipitation" of the "super-Special Shorts" — the official list of VU-52 in November 2011 that revealed some weaknesses in the use of the aircraft, which was then redesigned for "supplying board".
It was reported that, compared to KA-52, KA-52M would take part in non- weightless new protective materials, its flight crew would be strengthened and equipped with new equipment against missile attacks, thereby increasing the probability of survival of war; a larger generator to be equipped for more complex mechanically equipped electronic equipment power; an electrical system upgrade to detect and detect more remote war destinations; a new light multi-purpose missile with major attacks on armoured vehicles and shell-mixed land defence operations, which would raise about 1 times the same type of missiles that are directly used by the current armed forces; and their weapons and communications equipment would be used to maximize the use of m-28NM armed helicopters for attackable air targets to make the relevant maintenance easier and economics.
In addition, Ka-52M will have advanced electronic control systems, weapons control systems and navigation equipment.
The Russian expert also stated that it was of concern that K-52M would be equipped with communications equipment connected with non-peoples, thus obtaining information about the presence of non-humans in the atmosphere, such as on the screen of the helicopter.
According to the plan, the C-52M pilots can direct control the unmanned aircraft associated with them and thus increase their ability to control the situation in the war zone and to control remote missiles.
According to the Russian media, the Deputy Minister for Defence of the Russian Federation, Kryvoruchko, said last December that the Ministry of Defence was planning to purchase 110 more direct military cass-52M by 2027.
The new Decree stipulates that the Campania district must be covered from the day-to-day in public places, with a maximum of EUR 1000 fines for the offender.
On 1 June local time, Rome, the capital of Italy, was reopened.
It has been reported that, under the latest promulgation law issued by the Government of the region, the population of the province of Campania has gathered all public transport tools, as well as access to shops, restaurants, supermarkets and camps, and that public places must be provided in accordance with the protection requirements.
In violation of that provision, a maximum of EUR 1000 fines may be imposed.
At the same time, the Act provides that all passengers entering the Campania area must be separated from non-Schengen countries.
The Government of the region will authorize health institutions to coordinate specific hotel arrangements and to separate persons with disabilities.
The Act entered into force on 25 July.
Within an hour, three customers entering the supermarket were punished.
Since this year the North River has filled the river with organic water, 175 million square meters of new Internet.
Newspapers from the OWN Water Office on 26 July revealed that since this year, the OWN has been fully utilised in the use of freshwater and local water reservoirs, which continue to flow to the Ouija board, the Danube, which has been carrying out ecological supplements for 28 rivers and the White Seas, such as the Mayan River, and has completed a total of 175 million cubic metres of the river's ecological water.
The North-West Province is busy taking advantage of the time available to increase the flow of water from the South Sea to the Danube River, the Sauna River and the San Juan River.
At the same time, 9 large central reservoirs such as East-West Army, and the White Sea to the Sun River, such as the Blue River, were used to implement ecological supplements, consisting of a total of more than 90 square kilometres of water.
In order to do ecologically complementary work, the Office of the Water Office of the North African Republic carried out an active water supply survey of river flows, organized the strengthening and clean operation of the river, streamlined enforcement measures, and enhanced monitoring control.
By conducting inspection and focusing visits, timely solutions to all types of issues ensure that water supply is orderly.
According to the director-in-Office of the North-Westphalia, a series of implementations of the river basins have effectively restored the ecological environment of the river basin of the North-West River and have contributed to the recovery and conservation of groundwater by coastal waters, and has greatly improved the living environment and the economic development of the coastal population, which has played a significant role in the achievement of the river management objectives of "water clear, coastal, riverbed and coastal areas" protection.
You should all know what I'm about to say.
I believe that inequality can lead to social division and corruption before the Great Revolution of France.
The difference is that we can now find evidence that we can understand the effects of inequality by comparison with society and by different levels of society.
I'll show you some data and explain why those data are really connected.
But first, let's see how hard our lives are.
I wanted to start my talk with one.
This picture shows our average life compared to the ratio of total national income -- the latter is the country's average wealth.
You can see those countries on the right, such as Norway and the United States, their wealth is Israel, Greece and Portugal twice those on the left.
But this has not affected the average life of their citizens.
No signs of interconnectedness.
But if we get to know the inside of society, they all have a big difference in health.
This picture shows that it's still alive.
These are the little towns of England and Wales -- the poorest on the right, the richest on the left.
There's a big difference between the poor and the others.
Even those who were just under the roof, their health situation was worse than those who were at the back.
So income in our society means a lot, but there's no difference between different societies.
That conflicting explanation is, in our society, we see the relative income or the social status, the identity -- the relationship between us and the small gap between people and people.
When you have that idea, you should immediately think, "What if the space-extreme conference is going to happen? What if it's going to reduce the gap? How would it be to expand or reduce the income gap?
That's what I'll tell you right away.
I didn't use any assumptions.
My data from the United Nations — as well as from the World Bank — are the income gap between these rich and developed countries.
The way we use it, it's easy to understand, and you can download it, is 20 per cent of each country's previous income gap and 20 per cent of it.
You can see that both countries on the left are equivalent — Japan, Finland, Norway, Sweden — their previous wealth of about 20 per cent is about 3.5 to 4 times as high as theirs.
But on another side of the inequality -- Britain, Portugal, the United States, Singapore -- income gap is about to double.
In this way, our country's inequality (British) is twice the same success of some other democratic markets.
I'll show you what this has to do with our society.
We have collected data on issues arising from internal social disparities, such as at the social level, more universal.
Internationally comparable data include average life expectancy, children ' s mathematical and linguistic achievements, infant mortality rate, suicide rate, prison population percentage, early pregnancy rate, mutual trust rate, pregnancy, mental illness — all of which are consistent with the standard classifications of drugs and alcohol — and social mobility.
We put all of these into one factor.
They're all authorized.
The share of one country is the average of these factors.
You can see that these numbers are relative to the inequality I've just shown, and I'm going to repeat these data.
The more unequal countries appear on various social issues.
The connection is very strong.
But if you look at the same health and social issues compared to the per capita income and total national income indicators, then you'll never find anything, no longer relevant.
We have a little concern that people might think that we are choosing a specific issue to join our theory and then we have published a paper on the child welfare index of the United Nations Children's Fund in the British Medical Journal.
It contains 40 different parts, from the others' conclusions.
It includes whether children can communicate with their parents, whether they have books at home, how much immunization rates are available, and whether schools are exposed to fraud.
They're all in.
This is the relationship between the index and the same level of inequality.
In an increasingly unequal society, children's performances are worse.
Relationships with them are clear.
But once again, if you look at the child's well-being and the relationship with human income, you won't get anything.
All the data I'm showing you right now is the same thing.
Our society's average benefits are no longer dependent on national income and economic growth.
They are very important in poorer countries, but not so for rich developed countries.
And the difference between us and our position is now very important.
Next, I'll show you some sections of our index.
It's an indicator of mutual trust.
That means that most people agree on the percentage of people who can be trusted.
This is from the World Values Survey.
You can see, on the other hand, about 15 percent of people feel they can trust others.
But in a more equal society, this proportion has increased to 60% or 65%.
There is a very similar relationship between the participation of communities or the assessment of social capital.
I mean, we repeated this job twice.
The first target is those rich developed countries, which we then replaced the test target, and the 50 countries in the United States repeated this test -- the same question: are those countries that are more unequal in their assessment?
This is the relationship between trust and inequality between the federal government in a general social survey.
A very similar distribution point is distributed within the same level of confidence.
The same thing's going on.
Basically, we found that almost all the factors related to mutual trust reflected in international investigations are also reflected in 50 states that we have investigated separately.
That's not a coincidence.
This is a mental illness.
The World Health Organization uses the same method of experimentation to collect data that enables us to compare the rate of mental illness of each society.
It's an arbitrary proportion of mental illness populations last year.
Its scope is from 8 per cent to 24 per cent -- this indicates that the proportion of other societies suffering from mental illness is 3 times the same.
Likewise, these are closely related to inequality.
This is a crime rate.
Red point shows the United States, the blue triangle depicts Canada's provinces.
But look at their number difference.
The homicide rate is from 15 million to 150.
This is the rate of prison inmates.
This is a 10-fold gap, and the index function will expand this gap.
But the number of prisoners changed from 40 to 400.
Crime is not the main reason for this relationship.
In some places, crime can explain some of the reasons.
But more is a severe trial, or a more urgent trial.
The more society is unequal, the more inclined it is to preserve the death penalty.
This is a high school situation for children.
Similarly, there's a lot of space.
If we discuss social selections, we'll find this gap very serious.
This picture is social mobility.
It's actually based on income.
Basically, it's what it's looking for: is there a rich father with a rich child, a poor father with a poor child, or is there any relationship between these two?
On the other hand, Father's income is more important — for example, Britain, the United States.
And in North Europe, Dad's income isn't that important.
There's more social movement.
As we used to say -- I know there's a lot of Americans here -- if the Americans want to achieve their "American dream," they should go to Denmark.
(Laughter) (Applause) I've already shown it here using the crossword marking.
I can show you some other issues.
Those problems are more common at the bottom level of the social scale.
But there is a problem of poverty-freeness, which appears to be worse in non-equality countries -- not only a little bad, but almost 2 times 10 times anything.
Think about the cost. The cost of human resources.
I'd like to go back to this picture that I showed you earlier.
First, by means of a duplicate map, we find those worse countries, whatever, seem to be the more unequal countries, but those good ones seem to be North Europe and Japan.
So what we see is the relationship between general social disorder and inequality.
It's not just a matter of two things, it's almost everything.
In this picture, another important point I wanted to point out is, if you look at the bottom, Switzerland and Japan, they're all very different.
The status of women, as they stand for small families, in two extremes in developed countries.
But another important difference is how they achieve greater equality.
Sweden has a huge difference in income, but it uses tax revenue, national benefits, generous relief, etc. to reduce the gap.
Japan is very different.
First, Japan's pay gap is smaller than before.
It's getting lower.
It's less of a favor.
And in a study of the United States, we found a clear comparison.
Some states are good at redistribution, while others are good because of the low income gap before tax.
So we're going to conclude how it's not important to achieve greater equality, it's important to achieve this equality.
I'm not talking about full equality, I'm saying that there really is a democracy in rich markets.
With regard to this picture, another interesting thing is that not only the poor are affected by inequality.
John Dorn seems to have some reason: " No one is an island. "
Through a series of studies, we can compare the behaviour of each social class to that of different countries on an equal scale or multiple or less.
This is just an example.
This is the infant mortality rate.
According to the United Kingdom's general socio-economic classification record, some Swedishs have been highly sympathetic about the death of many children.
It's a class of times that don't fit on the basis of the father's position, so single mother becomes a group of data.
But we're looking at what's called "Societal low-level", that's a manual job without technology.
Among other things, technical manual work is needed, and higher non- manual work has always been higher than professional work — doctors, lawyers, managers of large companies.
Here we can see Sweden doing better than Britain, doing better in every social class.
The biggest difference is now at the bottom of society.
But even on the edge, living in a more equal society has some advantages.
We showed five different data groups including education results from the United States and the international and health situation.
In general, it seems that more equal society is the most obvious difference in the social dimension, but there are also some advantages at the social level.
I should explain what's going on.
I believe that I have an impact on social psychology by showing and discussing inequality.
More is concern for superiority and self-esteem, being valued and invisible, being respected and humiliated.
Of course, those feelings caused by the competition for identity have contributed to the progress of social consumerism.
But it also led to uncertainty about the status.
We're more concerned about how others judge and look at us, whether we appear attractive, smart, or something like that.
The social value assessment has increased the fear of evaluation of these social values.
Interestingly, similar work in the field of social psychology is being done in the same way: some people have access to 208 different studies; in the study volunteers were invited to a mental testing centre and then tested their pressure hormones and their response when they carry out pressure missions.
In this observation, scientists are interested in what kind of pressure can be most powerful in the body's skin, the most important level of stress hormone.
As a result, those tasks, including threats of social evaluation — which threaten self-esteem and social status — can be evaluated by others.
These pressures have a very special effect on physiology.
We've already accepted criticism.
Of course, some people don't like this, others find this very interesting.
But I should still tell you that when people criticize us for choosing our data, we never did.
We have an unconditional provision that if our data source contains data from the observed countries, we will include it in analysis.
Our data source decided whether the data was valid, not us.
Otherwise, there will be a difference.
What about other countries?
In the periodical review of academia, 200 studies were related to health and income equality.
It's not limited to these countries, hiding a simple proof.
The same country, the same way of measuring inequality, the same question one by one.
Why don't we control other factors?
I've shown everyone the entire national income that didn't have any impact.
Of course, others have used more complex methods in documentation to exclude poverty, education, etc.
How's the relationship?
The relevance itself cannot prove the causal link.
We've spent a lot of time.
In fact, people have a good understanding of the causes of our results.
The biggest change in our understanding of the long-term driving factors of health in developed countries is the impact of long-term pressure from society on immunity and the effects of the cardiovascular system.
Or, for example, violence in countries that are less unequal is becoming more and more common because people are very sensitive to themselves.
I mean, in order to solve this problem, we should solve a series of problems after tax and before tax.
We should limit income to the culture of the prize income of the gate.
I think we need to do everything we can to get our leaders to take responsibility for the staff.
I'd like to conclude that we can improve our real quality of life by reducing our income gap.
If that's the case, we'll find out that we've just solved the social health problem of society as a whole, that's really great.
Thank you.

In the past two weeks, Spain's new outbreaks of tuberculosis have increased significantly, and thousands of new cases have occurred in many days.
Between Saturday (25 July), the Government of England decided to temporaryize Spain from 26 o'clock in the local time, remove it from the list of safe travel and leave Spain for 14 days.
The decision to listen to British tourists who are lying in Spain expressed surprise and concern, even anger, because news such as it is coming from the news cannot be handled by anyone.
It has been reported that the British Ministry of Transport (Grant Shapps) is currently on vacation in Spain.
Prior to the release of segregation measures, Norway has also announced that it will take 10 days for people who return from Spain to live in Norway.
France and Belgium recommended that their residents abandon the plan for the former Barcelona and the surrounding region.
Seafarers in these areas are sick and cannot maintain social distance between people and the police are required to take measures to reduce the number of seafarers.
The tourism industry is an important pillar industry in Spain.
Spain: It's safe here.
With regard to the decision taken by the British, the Spanish Ministry of Foreign Affairs indicated that the State was controlled by vaccination.
The Spanish Minister for Foreign Affairs (Arancha Gonzalez Laya) emphasized to the media: " Spain is safe and not only for Spanish people but also for tourists. "
The Government of Spain will attempt to convince the Government of England to exclude the Balearic Islands from the Canary Islands.
The reason is that these two tourist destinations are far lower than British territory.
In order to prevent the spread of vaccines, the "abstaining order" has also been reopened in the Catalan region of Spain.
The tourism industry is an important pillar industry in Spain, while Spain is one of the most popular holiday resorts in Britain.
This decision from Britain is expected to have a significant impact on the tourism industry in Spain.

Midsummer: Beijing's temporary high-temperature cold, open rain mode-new
On 26 July, New York City was the first day of this year's "Middle".
The 26-year-old wind blew into the air against the wind and spread into the high cold in Beijing, and a new cycle of rainfall would continue for several days.
The Beijing Meteorological Station is released on 11 a.m. and 26 a.m. with dispersible rainfall (with low-minor power), at a maximum temperature of only 27 °C; at night there are small to medium-distance rains (with low-minor power), and at least 23 °C.
On the 24-25th day before, Beijing's entire city was in a high-green warning, with the highest temperature in the vast region around 37°C and a high temperature of more than 40°C.
The summer is the hottest day of one year, the hottest day of the year, the hottest day of the year, the hottest day, the hottest day of the year, and the Chinese people say "heat" here.
When they entered, the house was full of holes, and the city had the word "a two-sided wall."
According to the current forecast, the future three days will be raining in Beijing.
The weather sector suggested that the public should be able to minimize mountain areas and prevent natural disasters.
It is understood that this year's "Middle" has 20 days, from 26 July to 14 August.
When you enter the middle of the room, you'll feel tired and you won't want to eat.
Food can be picked from the menu, with a clean solution, a healthy diet, and food from the stomach, such as pain and pain, which can contribute to the promotion of food and the removal of the heat.
The driver may fire the FAA emergency order to check out the 2000 POS-New York network.
The U.S. Federal Aviation Agency (FAA) issued an emergency call for an emergency response order on 24 days to carry out an emergency check on approximately 2000 air-conditioning and 737 Classic passenger types registered in the United States, which may result from the failure of the above-mentioned client's air-conditioning system to stop in the engine.
According to the Federal Aviation Agency, 4 737 NG and 737 Classic passenger suspension reports were received so far, and an urgent check was requested to continue to suspend 7-day and above and to re-enter the flight to date less than 11 passengers.
The Federal Aviation Agency warned that if all of the two engines were to be turned back to their 5th level, they could die at the start of the operation, resulting in the total loss of power and failure to reboot the engine.
This air traffic control body ordered that the key element should be replaced once it has been discovered that the aircraft operator has been found to be contaminated and that it must be re-entered before the client is re-initiated.
In response later that day, the pollutant responded to the fact that the new vaccine epidemic caused a decrease in demand and that several clients were stored or used as " easier to stop the disease " .
At the same time, Po voice said that it had been recommended that the air operator check-in orders should be provided with assistance in the area of repair and replacement.
The U.S.A. reported that the United States major airline operators often fly on several flights within a day, but after the outbreak of the new epidemic, large numbers of protesters stopped. As the demand for travel is growing, some customers re-enter.
The Federal Aviation Agency did not issue four details of the air traffic stop report.
One of the events was disclosed 24 days later by the Alaska Air Force.
In his statement, the airline operator said that one of the following customers flew from Westward, Washington, U.S.A., to Ostia, Xassa, on July 15 and that a driver was suddenly fired and that the customer was finally hit by an emergency at Ossing Airport.
The Alaska Air Force said that it had changed the driver of the client and had checked the driver of six of its clients in accordance with the instructions of the Federal Aviation Agency.
The United States Air Force, the Joint Air Force and the South-West Air Force, said on 24 days, that no fire-fighting engine fires had occurred at the rear of the flag.
Four clients will be inspected under the U.S. Air Force flag, and 28 customers under the United States Air Force flag will be under the Check.
DAA said that 20 clients would check out the flag but did not indicate whether the engine fires had occurred.
Several media reports that the Federal Aviation Agency's emergency call was another shock to the pulse.
A total of 346 deaths were reported in October 2018 and March 2019, respectively, by 737 MAX clients from Indonesia and Ethiopia, respectively.
This series of clients subsequently stopped global flights, owned in January this year and resumed production in May.
In June, Mr. Steve Dixon, Director of the Federal Aviation Agency, acknowledged that according to the 737MAX client, the Federal Aviation Agency "has been wrong about the control of the noise".
"Shut up! Teachers" The next week, "Shut up."
And there's a new imaginative line.
An interactive knowledge-sharing program, "Teaching on the top of the line! Good teacher", will be released on July 20th in the South Sea.
It is understood that the programme will create a new full-time school for young people, and a number of well-known and talented teachers will stand up and challenge the production of interesting knowledge.
In contrast to the deep impressions in the hearts of the former teacher groups, "The teacher is well-founded" is a group of value-added and knowledge-based representatives.
They're either like young students of the sciences or a bunch of bunches, and they're going to be able to live with all the power of "study."
In the programme, these excellent young people's knowledge as "knowledge-sharing agent" will challenge interesting knowledge courses.
They need to demonstrate through positive knowledge that shows the most interesting part of their studies to attract the audience.
In addition, the "inquiry mission" site, which is composed of all age groups, presents a variety of issues, increases the difficulty of teaching "knowledge-sharing officers" and increases the scope of the program.
It has been revealed that this "knowledge-sharing officer" has a high-level academic teacher at the University of People's People's China for all eternity, who is conducting a study of the names of students and of good young teachers such as the king of history who have had decades of experience, who will display in an unexpected way the "hard nuclear" knowledge of various sciences in the public at large.
In addition, the program invited Professor of Economics Zhao Zhao to "initiate knowledge" as a program "initiator", joint "introduction" to "Injury and dreaming", to talk to the audience, and to make "open classes for all young people".
Director, Department of Government of Hong Kong District: The situation is severe, full of resistance to new networks in Hong Kong.
On 26 July, the Director of the Hong Kong Government Division of the Hong Kong Region said on 26 July that the situation of new lung cancer in Hong Kong continued to be serious, and that, if the vaccine was reversed, the Government would take more stringent control measures to further restrict the business of the farm and reduce the presence of civilians.
However, the Government of the region at this stage does not intend to impose "a residence order" or "a ban" on citizens.
The day of the construction of the church, a website entitled "Constitution Serious, Totally Invasive," was published.
He said that this epidemic had been the worst for half a year and that it would be very critical for two weeks in the future to work towards preventing the spread of the virus in the community.
Apart from the necessary measures taken by the Government of the Special Territory, self-regulation and co-operation of citizens are also essential.
He called on the civilian population to stay at home as much as possible and to reduce social communication and out-of-court use.
Citizens should take measures to protect themselves and others in line with the mandatory measures taken to cover their mouthpieces, focusing on personal and environmental health and work-related washouts, and should be more likely to stop unnecessary association or association of friends or to reduce to the city.
He expressed his deep concern about the change in vaccines in Hong Kong and the support of the Government of the Special Territory for the prevention of vaccines, and actively responded to the latest requests of the Administrator to assist in increasing the inspection capacity and the transformation of the Asia International Hospital for the work of the like " Side Hospital".
The build-up report indicates that the Government has conducted a comprehensive inspection of the free virus for specific high-risk groups, such as Anjactorium, Disability Hospital and Rehabilitation Officers, Food Office staff, Train Drivers and Physical Managers, involving over 400,000 people.
He was very concerned about the cases of infection in the Anjat Building, and the Government of the Territory had arranged for a specific temporary clinic for friends of Anjat Hall.

Regular party history, New China's "food products" in New China's "New Internet."

In recent years, the NEPAD has noted that " the history of the Chinese Communist Party in China, New China, with a view to bringing more than 1 billion people and more than 9,000,000 parties, particularly at all levels, to learn a great deal about the history of the Chinese Communist Party, the history of China. "
A serious study of party history, a new Chinese history, is an unforgettable experience of the Department of Party Affairs, keeping in mind the necessary lessons about mission, taking care of rich food, raising the family’s needs and making the long journeys of the new generation.
A history of the New China Party, which records the hard fight and the litigation of the Chinese Communist Party since its birth, shows the belief and loyalty of the Communist Party in the use of life and blood, and has always maintained its original and its original origin and destination.
History is the best textbook, and for party members, history, new China is the most popular chapter in this textbook.
Every party member's department needs to be constantly strengthened in its historical context, moving towards the future history of the past, establishing a new agenda for the new mission, taking a "cash" of the era, and taking a long path for moderns.
In the spirit of history, in the history of the student party, in the new history of China, the original mission was to be performed.
The history of the party, the new Chinese history, is filled with the constant initial mission of the Chinese Communist Party and the strong faith of stone. It is evident that the Community party has always had a natural feeling with the people.
Far from knowing the history of the party, the important events of the new Chinese history, the important meeting, the important person, not only is a hazy heart attack, a mindless prayer, but more than a mindful reading of the mind within the mind of the mind and understanding of the original faith.
With respect to the Department of the Party, the desire to continue to give priority to the life of the party, always moving ahead in this color, will be found in the history of the party, in the new Chinese history, the origins of which we have come out, the first priority, the awareness and firm position, and the strength of the country as a national hero, to ensure that the revolution is transferred from the blood and life of the Red Mounts before the revolution.
In the history of the academic party, in the new Chinese history, there was a high spirit of respect.
Since the formation of the Chinese Communist Party, a series of great spirits such as the "two-star" spirit of spaceships have been created.
These great, historic spirits have provided strong spirit to our party on its front road to fight all kinds of risk challenges, which are free of fighting, indiscriminately, and inexhaustible, precious spirit.
In the history of the Party, China's history is the process of putting these spirits together and self-sustaining, self-evidently proud spirit of the revolution, maintaining the community party's spiritual garden, achieving a solid foundation of dreaming, and bringing these spirits down and down and down and producing a new era of light.
Reading the history itself, in the history of the student parties, the new Chinese history has been preserved.
With regard to the Department of Party Affairs, there has never been any history, which could bring more serious warnings than the history of the party.
In the history of the party, in the new Chinese history, we can both see the faith of an old revolutionary who is committed to his own faith, not only in the face of great events to achieve a set goal, but also in some people who are motivated by the idea of faith, go to the deep lessons of the revolution, and show and warn us never to stop with determination and will, never to give up, always having a strong spirit of struggle, constant commitment, and rehabilitate law.
In order to be truly a strong believer in communism, loyal practitioners need to think about "beast," serious "pollution" infection, the history of the party, and the new Chinese history should be a self-examination by every party member, warning of my own base.
In the history of the student party, the new Chinese history of courage re-enacted.
The recent JPA noted: " Learning Party History, National History, is the maintenance and development of China ' s special socialism and the continued promotion of the necessary lessons for parties and countries to progress. "
Looking back to history, asking for the first time, to continue glory and to go to the future.
Each Party's Department should keep the history of the study party, the new Chinese history as a lifelong pursuit, the continued direction of life in the study, the courage of history at its various places of work, and the responsibilities and active activity as an active part of it.
Consisting that the progress of the former revolutionist is a reference and direction, that the political colors of the Communist Party continue to shine, that the struggle continues only in Korea, that is to be fought with a spirit of struggle and that is more dangerous than ever before, and that it is written in a series of resurrections by the People of China.

On July 26th of the New York Bank, "Ninth River Rissa, winds from the sky. "
The uniquely rich, rich and rich-grandmothered bluefin tuna has grown into a richly rich and now has a "Economic, green development" concept, which has been called "Syllian" and has been pursued by "Goldenian" dream.
It's a river's "Silver" dream.
"The Rain River under the sky, the Rain River, is 397 miles [397 km] away from the "Mother River" on one side.
However, as industrialization progresses, urbanization is rapidly underway, the development of river lakes using and managing imbalances, super-marking pollution, land-building, water pollution, water scarcity, water surpluses, environmental degradation and ecological degradation.
Now, Ninsha is contributing to a variety of ecological reforms and is trying to clean up the rivers of the Red Sea.
The water's coming down from the source.
In the Ninsha Bank, locally through the "promoting + cleaning + strict" approach, the whole area of industrial soil pollution has been concentrated on, the total level A of the urban water treatment plant's emissions are achieved, the urban build-up is essentially eliminated, and the third Chinese wastewater model city has been declared successful.
In addition, in 2017, the Ninth-Ninish regime was fully operational and now has reached the fifth-level river basin control system of the district village, which has become the norm.
The 64-year-old samurai lived in a village near the river, where he saw the change in the river: "The former part of the water smells and there is no taste after it was harvested. "
Sociologists say that the ecological environment has improved and his life is much more comfortable, and now he and his family are walking along the river and feeling the cold weather.
The "dark land" of the Sasha.
Birds, trees, rivers, rivers... the beauty of the "Sao-Sao-Sao-Sao-Sao-Sao-Tao" in the Rainbow Park in the Ninsha Bank.
The rivers flow into the river, along the road form riverbeds, lake basins and many droughts, play an important role in the rational use of water resources and the ecological balance of water resources, while also becoming an important international guide for migration.
Since 2009, the Ninsha-related sector has invested around 345 million people in the project's funding for the project for the protection of the well-being of the project. Currently, the area of the Bank is covered by 1.9 million hectares, 78.5 per cent of the well-being protection rate, with natural lakes, 200 national swimming pools, 5 national swimming pools, 1 national urban swimming pools, 6 municipal swimming pools and 8 municipal parks.
The Deputy Director of Banking Protection Centre told reporters that the protection of cattle has increased biodiversity and is particularly evident in the species of birds, "the remains are a dangerous species, with more than 20,000 people in the world, with more than 2,000 fishing areas. "
At the same time, in accordance with the Ninsha Act, the Red Line between 500 metres of the region was established for the protection of the two coastal banks of the Gulf River. In addition to public projects, no unit and individual must develop and operate within the protection area.
The Vice-President of the Centre for Water Services of the Bank of the City of Banking presents a few examples of the courage to build, through the management of pollution sources, integrated river ecosystems and the final wetlands, such as, as today's summer 9, 100 per cent of the water quality has reached the standard of category IV, "water has now been clear and the fish has flowed and the flowers have been grown. "
"Drinking Water" of the Pewish people.
The city of Ninsha Bank had a name for "Shuang": the only city in the town of Zhaoju is "to keep drinking water."
Since 2010, the city of Banking has faced the issue of a continuing high-speed water shortage, which has been an experience for many high-level residents of the region in recent decades, but in many large water sources it is too limited to be able to cope with the situation in the area of large-scale groundwater overwhelmed areas, and water shortages have become a problem in the banks.
The improvement in the quality of water is beneficial, and the use of clean water is a good way to solve the problems of drinking water for local residents.
The Vice-President of the Banking City Water Agency made it clear that, in order to improve the production of water requirements for the inhabitants of Bangui, Ninsha started a water project on the west bank of the City of Bangui and replaced the original groundwater.
"On 29 December 2019, the Water Agency officially transferred water to the three districts of the city of Bangui, and in 2020, the town of Mining and the inhabitants of the Grand Canal also drank water. "
It is clear that the banking sector will take full account of the changes in the integration of rural drinking water and urban water supply into the region, " next step we will integrate rural water distribution into the West Bank's water supply projects, which are expected to be fundamentally integrated into the banking region at the end of this year " .

The Louis family: John Lewis is a fighter for "the weakest."
A member of the United States Congress, John Lewis, was remembered as "the weakest fighter" at his follow-up meeting on Saturday (25 July).
The public follow-up meeting of Louis began on Saturday in the state of Alabama.
There were two follow-up meetings on the first day.
At a public meeting at the University of Troy, Alabama, on Saturday, five of Louis' brothers and a cousin spoke of him as a loving, fearless man with a family.
Henry "Grant" Lewis, the youngest brother of Louis, said at the meeting: "He's dead to help others."
Samuel Lewis said his mother warned John "Don't worry, don't worry."
He added that John had not heard from his mother, saying: "We all know that John will be in trouble, and he'll always be in trouble, but that's because he's stuck in the right thing, that's a good trouble."
The sister of Louis reminded the people at the meeting that John's most famous argument was to create a "good problem" and that it was not to prevent the incident from occurring just for justice.
John had been applied for at Troy University in the city of Troy, Alabama, where he was born, but at the time he refused his entry.
This young man, John Lewis, who preached on his farm with dogs, eventually received religious and philosophical education at Fisk University.
Many years later, the University of Troy granted Dr. Louis honor.
Doug Jones, Member of the National Assembly from Alabama, said that the current protesters "are at peace and non-violent protests", as Louis did in the civil rights movement.
Jones said: "Even the President of Tranquo has beaten a shipman and made all the protesters violent, but he's wrong.
The protesters are lovers, and they want the United States to move towards a more equal country."
A series of six-day events to commemorate Louis will be held this week at the funeral in Georgia.
On Saturday, Isis' tree was stopped at public monumental events at the University of Troy, and people showed respect for this civil rights movement in the first place.
On Saturday evening, a private ceremony was held in a small church in Selma, Alabama, followed by a public commemoration.
The remains of Louis will be passed on to Edmund Pettus Bridge, Selma.
In 1965, he and his group of demonstrators requested black ballots were tortured by the police in the state of Alabama before this bridge, and the police also presented the demonstrators with a complaint against the demonstrators.
Louis was almost killed at the time.
This day is called "Saturday of Blood."
The remains of Louis will be transported to the capital of Montgomery, Alabama.
Steven Reed, mayor of the city, encouraged people on the human race and ended this last time with Louis.
At the same time, officials called for public participation in activities and maintained social distance.
Kay Ivey, Head of State of the state of Alabama, ordered half of the flag to be dropped on Saturday and Sunday.
In the near future of the Memorial, the remains of Louis will be separated from the Assembly Hall of the state of Alabama in the city of Montgomery, the Assembly Hall of the state of Georgia in Atlanta, and the United States Congress in Washington, Washington, U.S.A., to commemorate the public.
The President of the United States Parliament, Nancy Pelosi (Nancy Pelosi) and Mitch McConnell (Mitch McConnell), and most of the members of the Senate, declared that they could be honored at the summit this week and Tuesday to the United States.
As a result of the outbreak of anti-emergency vaccines, the public activities of Louis will be held outside the home.
I'm going to go out and look for an opinion on the New York Network.
On 26 July, the New York Society encouraged residents to do physical inspection and early detection; prohibit the sale of alcoholic beverages to minors; establish a network game health review system; use units to have specialized and functional health managers prior to the publication of "Intra-Economic Health Regulations (Requirement for Comments)" which would include their own "health law".
In order to encourage urbanization to do physical and early detection of problems, the above-mentioned submissions suggest that the health sector should develop a basic health inspection directory based on factors such as age and career.
Health inspection costs within the basic directory of health inspection projects are paid by the Social Health Insurance Integrated Fund in accordance with each year's standards.
It is clear from the request that the unit should reasonably adjust human resources, arrange time for staff to work, impose more severe staff burden on mental and physical work, implement a rotational system to avoid excessive physical or physical damage to the health of workers, while strictly implementing the staff leave system.
In addition, staff units are required to have specialized and functional health managers and regularly organize staff health checks.
With regard to the physical health of minors, it is proposed that comments should be made on the prohibition of the sale of alcoholic beverages to minors, while restrictions on the sale of alcoholic beverages should be imposed on their places of sale, which would be adjusted by the market surveillance management authority for violations.
In addition to the "abstaining of alcohol " , minors also need to " move too many " .
In accordance with the request for an opinion, the school will schedule more than an hour each day for family sports activities.
For network games, public and cultural telecommunications sports, network control, health care should be improved by Internet services service health management systems, network health review systems to promote good communication between youth and culture in order to promote the development of youth health.
In addition, a request for an opinion was made that patients should be admitted to public places and that medical institutions should not disclose the private penalty of 20,000 dollars without agreeing to reveal the patient.
It is worth noting that, in addition to the physical health of the population, comments should be requested that, prior to the development of urban space planning and construction, industrial garden planning and construction, resource development, use and environmental protection, biomedicine industry development, normative documentation and approval of major construction projects and major public services projects, public policy should be assessed on the impact of public health implementation.
Without an assessment or an assessment, it would have a serious adverse impact on public health or the health of the urban population, and it would not be possible to establish or approve the implementation.

In recent years, the JAPC has highlighted the need to strengthen party leadership, promote the expansion of party organizations to the most basic levels, provide strong guarantees for urban community governance.
Consisting that party-building is guided and that the leadership of the party is implemented in all aspects of the area of grass-roots governance is a key requirement for good environmental governance.
The promotion of grassroots governance and the strengthening of party leadership, the creation of fighting tanks, red-red forces, the promotion of political advantages for parties, the organization of advantages and the people's efforts to turn them into governance advantages, the transfer of Party power and the claim to "the final mile" by the strength of the Party.
Focus on filling in the spirit and strengthening the political orientation.
The strengthening of political guidelines for biogeographical governance must be well implemented.
In order to develop a deeper understanding of Chinese special socio-socialism as the primary mission of the new generation of China, to build "Impartialism, Memorative Mission" as a party's permanent curriculum and final class, to strengthen its reading of the original language principles, by thematic training, by disseminating training, by sharing experiences, by organizing large workshops, and by continuing to promote the innovative and armed spirit of the party, to further strengthen "four awareness", "four self-reliances", to "two" better perform its responsibilities.
By means of a learning process that combines the lines with the lines, the wide range of learning channels leads to the actual integration of learning into the daily and to the regularization of education into the field of grassroots organizations and members of the Party.
Focusing on practices and focusing on key issues in the decentralization of grassroots governance, focussing on the concerns of the public, the concerns of the people, the concerns of good intentions, the politicism and capacity.
Get regular promotions, make fighters.
WFP is both an important component of the GGG system and an important component of its governance capacity.
Promoting the normalization of WFP and the entry into force of the regulations governing the work of the Department of the Party ' s offices, leading to the weakening and deterioration of the Organization of the Party, through the establishment of the following mobile mechanisms, the establishment of new offices, the establishment of a standardized and weak distribution, the establishment of a sound decision-making mechanism, the establishment of a multi-service mechanism, the establishment of a framework, the completion of a short table, and development.
In rural areas, strengthening the standardization of rural party organizations, the implementation of the system of standardized construction standards in the field of party offices, the form of normative organization, learning activities, management mechanisms, effective promotion of "third session", thematic party activities such as day-to-day activities.
In the city, attention is paid to street communities, explore forms of the establishment of innovation offices and combine areas of weakness, "pity" "pity", "pity" "pity", and actively build the Union of Urban Parties to achieve effective coverage of the work of the parties.
At the same time, the establishment of a system of sound grass-roots governance mechanisms, a comprehensive system of public affairs, a common practice, a common approach, emergency co-operation, difficult co-operation, a decision-making mechanism led by the Al-Qaida Party Organization, a process of interconnecting the public service mechanisms of the Party ' s departments, a combination of public services, a strengthening of the public's awareness, happiness, dignity, self-esteem, and a more warmer climate of grass-roots governance.
It's an initial role. It's a red force.
The Ministry of District Party personnel is the cornerstone of Al-Qaida governance.
Enhancing the capacity of grassroots governance, focusing on enhancing the governance capacity of the Ministry of the Interior Party staff, and focusing on the role of the model role of "red cells" in grassroots governance and the combination of red strengths among the service community.
In order to improve governance capacity as a necessary training for the Ministry of the Interior Party, to further strengthen thinking skills, professional training, practice skills, and to develop a spirit of urgency in the critical task force in this position and to contribute to the modernization of national governance systems and governance capacities.
In order to carry out a wide range of " community breakdown, reporting to " party members" activities, through participation in thematic party day activities, linking difficult groups, identifying service projects, identifying micro-wills, making reasonable recommendations, and taking part in community building, management and services, which enable party members to play a role in community governance.
In order to play a full role in rural non-permanent actors, the creation of a team such as the establishment of non-permanent parties and the creation of a team of non-permanent parties will lead to the active participation of large-scale grassroots parties in activities such as poverty eradication, eco-building, confidence-building, tourism and the prevention of smoking, and better integration of red force into civil service.
The ground is solid.
The Al-Qaida party organization is the base of government headquarters.
The only way to build a party's leadership as a key means of promoting innovative development of grass-roots governance is to keep close party relationships closer together, to increase people's well-being, to promote grass-roots governance, to get rid of the grass-roots organizations, to get up, to get up, to promote grass-roots governance.

It's possible to hide the sheep in the repatriated New York.
On 25 July, New York City's National Parking Authority (Kinkin), an electric journalist, was informed of the five-way protection stations available at the Cacili Authority of the three-sourced National Parking Authority, which had been monitored for the past time, showing that sheep hideouts from the coastal coastal areas of the Pacific Ocean are continuing to close their flocks and start returning home with their young chicks.
The monitoring scene near the five-way protection station shows that on 25 July, about 40 male goats were led by 3 male sheep and 3 female sheep were kept in hiding only 3002 kilometres through the dark road, and the five-wheeled sheep had begun to return.
In recent years, experts have analysed that one quarter to five percent of the total number of flocks of sheep kept in the herd.
The Deputy Research Institute of the North-West Institute of Biobiological Studies in the Western Hemisphere, China, also reported: "The number of young sheep in the groups will be lower, even if there are no young ones. "
According to the statistics of the Corsieri Management Service of the Director of the three-sourced National Parking Authority, the total annual increase in the number of flocks is due to the number of herds and the number of herds in 2019 is 4860, and the number of sheep is 338 more than in 2018.
In fact, it was stated: "It is expected that this year's return will end in early September and that the number of shepherds will continue to increase. "
Protection of animals at the national level.
At the end of May each year, from the three sources of the Blue Sea, the West Bank and the New Alpine Mountains were to travel to the coastal shores of the Pacific Ocean.
Our National Shepherd Protection Expert, a researcher at the Institute of Animal Health (Northern American Institute for Animal Hazardous Studies), said: "The flocks of sheep will return to their pasture after the end of the breeding season, and the land will continue to take young chicks back to their pasture. The herd of cattle who first left the farm will grow larger, but then the sheep will return to their own pasture on the basis of different geographical groups and different roads."
In order to ensure the safe return of the flocks of shepherds, the journalists learned that the Office of the Director of the Forestry Administration of the former three-year-old National Park has arranged for staff to continue video monitoring and field patrols in the main areas of return.
If a group of shepherds were found trying to cross the road, the patrols would conduct temporary traffic control at the first time and ensure that they were safe through wild animals through the route, as far as possible in their return journey.
So, how should I end up in everyday life?
The experts suggest that it is best not to walk or work during the winter as far as summer is concerned, since the sun is the strongest and the possibility of drought is high.
If it is necessary to leave at this time, it is necessary to work for protection, such as tow, towels, towels, towels, to wear sunglasses, and to avoid injury.
Clothing is the most selectable of colors, soybeans, oranges, oranges, and low-quality clothing, so that it cannot be heated when it comes out of large quantities.
At high temperatures, sufficient water is prepared to be used, and do not wait until it is too late, because once it is felt that the body is running out of water, it is controlled at 150 to 200 millimetres per drink, and it is not to drink cold water.
Based on a low temperature, general staff drink 1.5 to 2 per day, high temperature workers and 3 to 5 per day.
More than once, it is appropriate to supplement some wells and fill the gaps that have been lost as a result of them.
In addition, it is easy for summerers to feel tired, and teasing water is an excellent source of refreshment.
High levels of water in the summer can be used to supplement water; milk products can both fill water and meet the physical needs of the new fruit, such as wheat, barley, sigua and sugar.
In addition, groups working in the high-temperature environment should be adequately supplemented by products containing lead and other elements.
It's a short night of summer, warm weather, human beings' new appearance, and consumption, and it's easy to feel tired.
Enough sleep can give both the brain and the body the rest of the system, benefiting from work and learning, as well as preventive measures.
The expert said that the best time for bed was 22 to 23 hours and that the best time for bed was 5.30 to 6.30 hours.
When sleeping, be careful not to sit under the air and the air, so as to avoid airborne diseases and heat.
Experts suggest that groups of people who are out-of-house activities or perform high-heat operations may be accompanied by dozens of wells of water, human teeth, steaming water or gas wells, or placed on a nearby workplace, at all times in order to prevent floods from occurring.
I hope everyone can take some time to think about a very simple fact that, so far, most of our knowledge of the universe has come from light.
We stand on the earth looking forward to the night sky, and we can see the stars of the sky with our physical eyes.
The sun is so powerful that it's so bright.
We can see the light coming back from the moonball.
From the time we know the universe, through light, we're looking forward to it.
With the help of modern spaceships, we have been able to collect unheard-of-the-fly universe images -- this series of images can have been traced to a huge explosion.
But the universe is not a mystery, because the universe is not really silent.
I want to tell everyone that the universe has its own partner, and the universe itself is constantly playing because space can move like a wave.
So when something important happens, it can send a series of voices to the universe.
Now, we'd like to be able to give this amazing visual work on the universe to sound.
Although we've never heard a voice from outer space, we should be able to increase the volume over the next few years, hear what happened there.
With regard to the capture of the voices of the universe, this great goal, we focus our attention on the dark cloud and the future it shows, because when the clouds can blow up, like a wave of lightning, they send a very special sound, and I am very happy to play some of the sounds that we predict.
One day we may see a shadow, a cloud may remain visible in a very bright background, but it is not yet observed.
Although black holes can't be seen, they can be heard, it's because they hit the air like a wave.
This idea that the universe can sound the same way from Albert Einstein, is actually from him.
Einstein realized that if the universe was empty, if the universe was empty, it would look like this photo, except those on top of the relief lines.
But if we break free in the universe, even if we don't have these auxiliary lines, we're going to draw these lines because we're gonna find out what we're going to do next to the motion, the direction that doesn't happen through the universe.
Einstein also realized that this is the most important part of "material" -- if you put energy and matter into the universe, the universe will collapse.
That's what Einstein's vast scope is.
Even the path of light will be broken.
When it gets bigger, it turns around the orbit of the sun's movement, like the earth's orbit around the sun, and the moon's orbit around the earth.
It's the natural line of music in the universe.
But Einstein didn't realize that if you pushed the sun into a six-kilometre-like ball -- that is, if you cut the Earth's equivalent to a million-dollar object into a six-kilometre ball -- you're going to make a hole, and this object's density is so high that if light is too close, it won't be able to escape -- there's a big black hole in the universe,
But Einstein has always considered black hole to be just a mathematical point.
He doesn't believe that there really is a dark hole.
He believed that nature would prevent the formation of black holes to protect us.
After decades, people began using the word "black hole" and realized that the black hole was a real existence -- in fact, they were some of the great-quality stars at the end of their lives that happened after a catastrophic earthquake.
Our sun will not turn into a cloud.
It's not really big enough.
But if we've done some thinking experiments -- Einstein really likes to do this -- we can imagine pushing the sun's back within six miles, and then putting a small planet around it, for example, on a 30 km distance away from the sun.
The earth sheds its own light, because the sun no longer sees us, we have no other source of light -- so our little planet has its own light.
You'll find out that you can even place the earth on the streets outside 30 kilometers away and let it run smoothly.
This black hole, it's actually just about Domanhaton.
Before it destroys the earth, it may be crashing into Hudson Street.
But basically that's what we're talking about.
What we're talking about is one thing that's being pushed down to half of Manhattan.
So we move this planet to a place close to the black hole - 30 kilometers away - we notice it runs along the perfect path of the black hole.
There's some announcements that black holes will destroy everything in the universe, but you really have to leave as soon as you get really out.
But it's impressive that from our point of view, we can always see the planet.
It can't hide behind a dark hole.
Some of the light from the earth fell into the dark, but some of it was broken into the dark.
So you can't hide anything behind a black hole.
If it's the horrors of space boroughs in Karachiga, and you're fighting the Zionists, don't hide behind the black hole.
They can see you.
Our sun will not shrink into a cloud; its quality is not large enough, but there are tens of thousands of clouds in our galaxy.
If one of them's in the bank system, it looks like it's gonna be like this.
We'll see a shadow of a dark cloud on the billions of stars in the bank system and on the bright rays of stars.
If we turn to this dark hole, we'll see the light going around the black hole, and even when we start entering this shadow, we'll never feel some big changes are going on.
If we try to start the rocket and get out of there, it won't work, because we can't run away, nor can the light run away.
Although black hole looks black from the outside, it's not like inside because all of the planets' light lines can fall together with us.
And even so, because of the relatively low time effect, our time seems to have changed compared to the time of the bank system, which seems to be as if the external system is accelerating, before we're destroyed by our own dark waves.
It's like a physical experience of death, you see the bright end of the path, but it's a perfect experience of death.
You didn't tell anyone you saw the light on the street.
So far, we've never seen such a shadow left behind, but it can be heard, even if they can't be seen.
Just imagine, in a real universe theory -- the two of them have existed together for a long time.
Maybe they were stars before, then they cut down two black holes -- each quality is 10 times the sun.
Now we're pushing them within 60 miles.
They can rotate hundreds of times per second.
At the end of life, they're close to each other with light.
In a few seconds, they'll be able to cross thousands of miles.
When the clouds and the universe are attacked, they're forced into space and spread.
These motions are broadcast rapidly in space.
This computer simulation was completed by the relatively small group of Goudads of the National Aviation Space Agency.
The solution was almost 30 years ago.
It's one of many teams.
It shows two black holes around each other, these are the lines in the picture.
As you can see -- maybe there's some ammo -- you can see it fired by red balls, these are exciting waves.
They're actually in the universe, and these sounds will spread rapidly out of these clouds, until these two clouds are integrated into one unit into a peaceful circle of clouds.
If you stand close enough, your ears will come together with these space pressures and radiation.
You can really hear these sounds.
Of course, you wouldn't help to find out what happened, too, your head was pressed and flat, so you probably couldn't understand what happened.
But I'd like to play the sound we predicted for you.
It's my team's research results -- a relatively simple calculation model.
Imagine a smaller quality of black hole falling into a larger quality of black hole.
The sound you heard comes from a small-quality black hole in the process of approaching the high-quality black hole in space.
If they're far away, they'll sound very small.
But a loud voice becomes like a wave of motion, hitting space, moving space like a wave.
We can predict what this voice will turn into.
We know that in the process of falling down, small-quality black holes will be faster and the sound that is sent will be more bright.
Finally, we'll hear the little black hole completely down into the big black hole.
I never thought this voice was that loud.
When I hear it at home, I feel that there's something that doesn't give me strength.
Sounds like, uh, uh, uh...
That's another sound that we're modeled by our research team.
I'm not going to show you a picture here, because the black hole won't leave any useful clues, and the real space won't show you those fake lines.
But if you hear this voice when you're lying in the universe, I suggest you run fast.
(Laughter) It'd be better if we could get away from this voice.
These two black holes are moving.
Two black holes are approaching each other.
In this case, they're all very proud.
Then they'll be integrated into one.
The sound of the bell is a sign of black hole integration -- when it's done, the sound of the bell will be sounded.
That's what we're going to do about what we're going to see.
Luckily, we're very safe in the capital.
I suspect two black holes in some part of the universe have been integrated together.
The same suspect is that the space around us can also feel these over a million light years, or from a million years ago, they're spreading rapidly and finally meeting us.
But these sounds are too small for us to hear.
Some of the world's experiments need a lot of blood to build together -- there's an experience called LIGO -- it's going to be able to detect a distance of less than one atomic nuclear range every four miles away.
It's a very complex experiment, its flexibility will not be exceeded in the next few years -- it'll be used to test space motion.
Another research project on the universe was to be launched in the next decade, called Lisa.
Lisa's gonna be able to see a cloud of super-quality -- those qualities are the sun's millions of times even hundreds of millions of times.
In a picture that we're looking forward to moving away from Ha' al-Qaida, we've seen these two stars.
Looks like they're stuck together.
Their center may have a high-quality super-black hole, respectively.
But they're not stopping, they're actually being integrated.
These two black holes will be hit, their integration will last for billions of years.
So gathering their voices has gone beyond our human senses.
But Lisa can see that the last phase of the super-high quality cloud that occurred earlier, which was 15 minutes before their integration.
This discovery is not only limited to a cloud, it can also be used to detect any major disturbance in the universe -- of which the greatest disturbance is the number of "the great explosion of the universe."
When this word was created, some people would say, "Oh, who would believe in the great explosion of the universe?"
This film that I made in a friend of Proton Studios shows the scene of a major explosion from the outside.
We would not really want to be like this; we want to be inside the universe, because there is no such thing as the universe.
So imagine you're in a big explosion.
There's nowhere in the universe. The universe is all around you.
It's been 1400 million years, and it's still ringing around us.
The stars gradually form a number of stars in a planet, and at least one such planet exists, and it is in harmony with life.
Here, we're crazy about building experiments, computing, writing computer code.
Just imagine, a billion years ago, two black holes broke.
This voice's been in the air all the time.
We're not even here.
It's getting closer - 40,000 years ago, we're still painting on the wall of the cave.
If the sound we're going to get is a huge explosion, it sounds like this.
Seriously, it's loud.
It's a white voice, a confused voice.
But it's nowhere around us, unless it's in the universe, some other processes are reversed.
If we can detect these sounds, it'll be like a normal music to our ears, because this quiet response comes from the universe that we're created, from the universe that we long for.
So in the next few years, we'll be able to increase the volume of these concerts a little bit, let the universe present to us in the form of sound.
But if we can detect the earliest gaps, it will also make us more understanding the major explosions, enable us to track down some of the most difficult, and even more complex issues.
If we're going to play the universe, we can know that there's been a big explosion in the past, and we can even hear its complex sound, but is our big explosion the only major explosion in the universe?
I mean, we wouldn't stop asking if there had been a similar explosion before?
What about the future?
I would like to say that if we raise the meaning of this issue to this level of rethinking promoted by TED, at least in the last minute, we can ask some questions, those that we may never answer.
But we don't want to stop asking: Will our universe not be just a part of a bigger story?
Or say we're not just a part of the universe -- each part has experienced its own huge explosion -- maybe some of them are just a bunch of dark holes, some of them aren't -- maybe there's a conscious life, some aren't there -- they're not our past, they're not our future, they're somehow connected to us?
So we can't stand to assume that if there's a multi-square universe, there's life in other parts of this multisquare universe?
This is our life in the universe.
Is there any other life in the multi-world that they wouldn't even assume of our existence, thinking of their own origin?
If that's the case, I can imagine they're like us, they're computing, they're building computers, they're building experiments, they're trying to detect those tiny sounds that come from their origins, and they're suspicious of anyone else there.
Thank you, everyone.
(Applause)
Engagement of professional art in the movement of goods in the market - New York
During the season of the school "Schooling" season, the weekend begins with a hard-to-do art event under a difficult line.
However, it is not in the American Museum or in the school garden but in public space in the capital city of Korea and will continue to be open to the public free until 23 August.
Newspapers learned that this 2020-year-old art exhibition was collected from the Central American University, the Chinese Media University and 57 young artists from the Gypsy American University of China, 50/group works, from 2nd level to 6th level, and the full use of large-scale art exhibitions on the inside of the building, with the highest level of exposure to the art of the graduation season.
The significance of this exhibition was particularly evident under the circumstances.
The President of the United States of Korea made a statement: " We choose to take back the space under the line for the "Tomorrow" graduation, and we want more young people to see their own research and understanding of the world and to enhance their artistic capacity for social and psychological healing. "
She revealed that this reference work had been collected to the graduates of several universities of art and had been selected from among them as an appropriate display of commercial space, from traditional paintings, sculptures, to new media devices, interactives, VRs, volume and wealth for the most important years.
Among them, Liquor, in "The First War of 2020", expressed his feelings in this context through the creative language of mechanical and manual mix; he studied "Sound Money" by means of works created in the South Pacific boundages, "crediting" and "businessing" topics; the appearance of "cooking wood" and "cooking" is often accompanied by animals, from which young artists can see the understanding of human relations; and the work of fishing "Creation" is a gift" that reminds young people of growing up, "when a day comes, they will remember that simple and true."
In a small number of self-exploited graduates, there are the honours of a master of astronomy at the University of Zing.
"I arrived in Beijing on 7 July, when I was actually a little concerned about vaccination, and three days ago I conducted a nuclear test with alcohol and testing reports. "
His work" was more complex than the structure of the bridge yesterday, and he had to be a relative.
At the same time, he also had the task of helping fellow students to repair damages.
"To show up at 4:00 a.m. and then make repairs, time is hard, forgets and works together, and some regret. "
He hoped that as the vaccine became more stable, his fellow students would come to Beijing to see his work.
(Laughter)
Early that morning, 65-year-old Bosonaro posted a photo on TTTute, on which he wore motion shoes, without wearing glasses, sitting in front of a table with breakfast, smiling face to face, with a big finger on his finger, and carrying a box of antioxidants.
He wrote in his introduction: "Good morning, everyone!
However, Bosonaro did not specify when this new virus transmission test was carried out.
On 5 July, Bosonaro experienced new lung cancer, six days of exposure to the results of the virus testing, and seven days of direct television he declared himself infected with new lung cancer.
On 14 and 21 days, Bosonaro conducted two tests of new vaccines, resulting in continued blindness.
During the period of separation, Bosonaro demonstrated through social media direct exposure to the use of chlorophylls, and said that chlorophyll was good for new vaccines and that after their use it was good for them to recover from chlorophylls and that the Brazilian medical authorities claimed to use new chlorophytosanitary vaccines.
According to Brazil media reports, there are still five ministers and 10 government ministers in Brazil who have been infected with new vaccines.
It's a small plane crashing up to four people on the plane -- a new network in Switzerland.
On 26 July, according to the EU Internet, the local time was announced to the media on 25 July by the Swiss police, and a small plane was destroyed on 25 July in the Swiss Alps.
Two Swiss and two Austrians were in the middle of the accident.
It was reported that a small aircraft destroyed more than 3,000 metres of the sea near Mount Al-Qaeda, in the state of Wallis, Switzerland, while rescuers confirmed that after the accident, four of the passengers were injured.
The State police in Vale indicated that the observer had called the police at 12.25 p.m. and that he had seen a small plane fall from the sky.
A few minutes later, the police were informed that the airport had fired.
After the police had received reports, fire police officers, medical personnel and rescue personnel were promptly coordinated and the helicopter was loaded with emergency relief.
After the rescuers arrived at the airport, four of the rescuers found themselves in full trouble.
The police verified that the victims of the accident included two Swiss persons aged 50 and 66 and two Austrians aged 46 and 50.
The police indicated that the police are currently working with the Swiss Transport Safety Investigation Committee to investigate the causes of the accident.
A new network in the 33 districts of the U.S.
On 26 July, the new Central Network reconnaissances the power of the news media from the city's water station, which lasts 24 hours, 33 districts, 16 of which have been hit by heavy rains.
The heavy rains were due to heavy rains in the middle of 71 small rivers, and two flood warnings had been issued in advance.
According to the city water stations, monitoring is under surveillance, from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. in most areas, from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. in most areas, and from 10 p.m. to 6 p.m. in the area.
There were a total of 33 districts, including the village, the capital, the state, 16 districts, the capital, and the village. The largest day the rain falls is in the village of Mount Cinn, which is 197.5 mm.
There are between 1 and 7 metres of water running from 71 rivers, such as the South American River, and the highest water is not over-protected.
It is expected that from 8 a.m. to 27 p.m., there may be a different degree of water flow in most regions, and that individual small rivers may occur in excess of the surface water.
At the same time, locals will be concerned about the long-distance and the potential floods of transit.
CBA welcomed the first audience after the race, and wanted to see what new networks are in the season.

On 31 July, the show included staff members moving on the island, doctors, teachers, public security personnel, and groups of people who contributed more to society during the period of vaccination, which was officially launched after the CBA season.
Infected by the vaccine, the CBA began its fight on 20 June, about five months after the interruption of the CBA.
Although there were few audiences on the 26th afternoon of the show, it was evident that there were people in the mood, while there were people in silence.
The players at the top were relatively obese, and the lower part was also opposed to the hall, which had not been seen in a long time.
At the end of the season, if the ball players want to see the show, they'll take care of it below.
This open-to-vote market is a diamond sports centre in the Isle of Yai Island, which is sold on the full-time line for real-time purchases, under the system of real-time registrations, all of which are 12 years old, and which has a certificate of nuclear acid testing within 48 hours.
It's a $50,000 prize for the "pre-warming first" show in the New Internet.
On 26 July, the North Sea newspaper (Linger) announced that the Nursing Market had made a significant contribution to the warning of the tsunami and that it had paid him $50,000.

New drug development at the University of Australia is intended for the treatment of new strains.
Researchers at the University of Monash, Australia, were developing a new drug to prevent heart disease and middle-air diseases, and hoped that such drugs could be used for the treatment of blood clots caused by new vaccines.
Researchers found that one of the blood vessels would speed up blood clotting before or during surgery.
As a result, they developed a drug that could temporarily harden the blood vessels so as to avoid blood clots and prevent heart and heart disease.
Researchers have indicated that such drugs can only inhibit the blood clotting effect when a heart attack or a heart attack occurs.
Since studies have shown that similar blood clots are one of the main causes of the deaths of new patients, researchers hope that such medicines can be used in the future for treatment of such patients.
At present, the drug has had a good effect in animal modeling, and researchers are preparing to perform human-beding tests at the next stage.
Before the day of the study, it was published in the journal "Science and Translation Medicine" in the United States.
He became a CBA reconnaissance to allow the public to see the scene, and the first audience to enter.
On that day, in the second phase (CBA) of the Chinese Men's Championships in the 2019-2020 season in the Isle of Sang-Sang-Sang-Westphalia (CBA), medical personnel, teachers and public-security warlords saw the entry from the relevant process, including nuclear testing, to the front of the Heiding Army's fight against the Xang-West.

New Hammer, New Hammer, New Hammer, New York City.
More than 6000 square feet [48 sq m] per square metre, a series of sequences, such as a color "to the sun", followed by the movement of the sun, the sun re-reflects the sun to a temperature of over 200 metres above the center and achieves electricity.
On the 25th day of the day of the news, the project was opened in the town of Ikong-Mahumi, New Hammer.
"The so-called hot-to-petroleum electricity is to focus the sun on the radiation from the surface of the sun into the heat of the absorbing heat and then turn it into energy through traditional power generation technologies. "
The Deputy Director-General for Central and Central Tehamian limited power companies has submitted that their design principles are similar to that of the sun used in rural areas of the North-West China.
The radio station opened construction in October 2017, reached and networked at 6600 square metres last year, with a total planned installation of 14,500 fixed days.
" In comparison with traditional solar technology, its maximum advantage is to store the collected heat and to generate electricity at night. "
It was bold to say that the project ' s 13-hour storage system could keep the CDM stable and not be affected by changes in light; it could also take place in a fast-track network.
After the project has been fully developed, it can achieve an annual output of 198 million tonnes, which can save over 60,000 tons of carbon dioxide per year, reducing more than 60 tons of carbon dioxide, more than 60 tons of carbon dioxide, about 20 tons of carbon dioxide, more than 15 million tons of carbon dioxide, and supplying local sources of clean energy.
In addition, there is another silver "to the East Bank" in the mining industry in the city of Hammy.
The Humphrey Sun power stations consisting of more than 2,300 litres of solar power stations, and 714 installed electric equipment, similar to the orbit of the sun, will always keep the sun and the sun on its 90th horizon.
" We use two-way tracking technologies to keep electricity efficiency in accordance with the high-level adjustment of the sun by combining control. "
The station's long-term dream was that, under good weather conditions, the more traditional electricity generation technology could increase by around 20 per cent.
In the first half of this year, the power station has reached over 7 million electricity levels and has been complemented by local electricity requirements.
The city's lighting industry is currently the largest size of the new unit, the largest of which is the most complete type of lighting industry model area, together with 38 projects in light emitting electricity, totaling 820,000.
In the first half of this year, electricity production increased by over 11 million and increased by 6 per cent over the same period as 2019.
Hammy is one of the best regions of China ' s solar resource conditions.
The average annual solar radiation is more than 6200 meters per square metre, which is approximately 3200 hours per day.
In recent years, the city's highly developed light industry has been "to the West Bank".
The solar power output of 250 billion units has been built, which has increased by over 14 billion in the first half of the year, compared with about 14 per cent of the growth.
Currently, over 330 stations in New York and the Internet have more than 1,000,000.
It is expected that this year, light emitting electricity will reach 150 million degrees and that the standard will be replaced by more than 60 million tons.
The police are still working on the New York Network.
On July 26th of New York City, the following day, "A student of a university went missing after a tour of Green Heagle trees" was interviewed by netizens.
On 26 June, the Ministry of Public Security of the Hasimongo People ' s Republic of China reported that a student at a University of Nuningi was still in a state of disengagement, and several police were on the inside of a site and were actively looking for work.
On 10 July 2020, the Security Council of the City of Hessey received a notice at the top of the report that a student of the University of Nunyin was riding Z164 vehicles from Ninkin to Germ on 5 July, and asked for help in searching for a telephone service at the South-West River-West Water Protection Station, Ningle Soondaj City.
According to a survey by the City of Germ City Security Board, a man entered the province of Günther on 6 July 1954 and arrived at the city of Germ on 4 a.m.
On that day, at 8 p.m., the missing persons had been able to ride out of the train some time by train from the G109 National Park in the city of Germ, and at 12 p.m. they had been able to reach the police station in Casizon, where the train driver had returned alone, leaving at least 7 p.m. to the clean water zone near the Daj protection station in the region until 9 p.m.
In further investigations, the police found something that had happened at 1707 hours on 13 July through the Jingi checkpoint.
The Chungjii checkpoint is an inspection station established in the city of the City of the Secrecy, in the south of the city of Germa, where the inspection station is unable to determine its personal and vehicle information, and the police can only search on the road and coordinate the search of the checkpoints on the side of the Cichec if they find something, and immediately contact the city's Public Security Agency.
According to the latest situation, on 26 July at 1 p.m., the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for the Development of Crimea (UNHCR) took relief equipment, went to the Entrepreneurship Protection Station along the narrow road, to search the Sundaja Protection Station, and actively contacted the Four-Square Police, the West Bank Police, the South Korean Police, and work together to pursue rescue work.
The local police wanted to find out something early about the missing persons, such as the relevant guidelines, and provide them with time-bound information to the law enforcement and the law enforcement officers in South China.
At the same time, the experts indicated that visitors had to be regular, rational, civilized while out-of-home activities, always keeping alerts on the road, risking access to unattended areas, meeting emergencies and reporting on time.
The U.S. media has opened a new network of truth in the capital of Houston, China.
2020-07-26 14:40:44 Source: Central Network Author: Judiciary Editor: Judiciary: Judiciary
The U.S. media has opened up the truth that China has shut down in Houston.
On 24 days, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China informed the United States Embassy that China had decided to abolish the establishment and operation of the United States General Council and to request that it cease all operations and activities as a countermeasure for the United States of America to immediately shut down the General Assembly Hall in Houston on 21 May.
The U.S. Government is concerned about this behaviour and its political motivation has been challenged by foreign media and scholars.
Why did the Chinese ask for the closure of the capital?
Many external media claim that it is still unclear why the United States would elect China's capital in Houston, but for the purpose of this movement, the external media has stated directly: for the general election.
The U.S. television news network (CNN)23 reported that the United States demanded that China shut down its campaign in Houston General Assembly.
The article states that the United States Government ' s response to the disaster of new immunization has resulted in a lower rate of support for President Tranpu before the General elections.
The White House officials claim in private that the strong strategy for China is to save Tranup's support rate and also to shift the responsibility for the failure of the White House.
The article considers that the Chinese General Assembly in Houston is a "political drive" chosen by the United States and a very cautious " goal," and the US Government has chosen it "to develop a strong attitude and avoid the risk of major conflicts".
The British Broadcasting Company (BBC) also believes that while the U.S. economy is at the time of the U.S. elections, while the United States economy has been severely affected by the epidemic, Tranup believes that 'the Chinese card' has political advantages'.
The current situation is "an upward trend and a relative struggle", which, to some extent, has been driven by the United States Government ' s internal considerations, only to increase tension between the United States.
The U.S. Broadcasting Company (CBS) reported that Tranup's future was under pressure because of the outbreak of the epidemic and that he had been charged with continuing to blame China for the epidemic.
The United States has almost every day a new action aimed at the so-called "China Exploitation of the United States".
"It's very important to build two countries in Houston. "
The United States commented that the United States had requested China to close its headquarters in Houston to increase the tension between the two largest economies in the world.
In addition to the impact of diplomacy on China ' s citizens in South America, the challenge of access to consular services is also faced by citizens of the United States seeking visas and other services.
One business group in Houston regretted the United States ' request to close China to the Houston General Assembly and said that the General Assembly had played an important role in the establishment of trade, investment and cultural links in both countries.
The United States believes that this reflects the importance of China ' s economy.
The U.S. Foreign Policy Web site believes that this movement is part of a series of challenging initiatives that will only undermine the relationship between the United States.
The Road Society appealed to Professor Johnson Polak of East Asia of the U.S. University of Chicubrukins, who, since the establishment of a comprehensive diplomatic relationship between the two countries of the United States in 1979, did not want any action to be taken against the United States of America's headquarters in Houston.
Hong Kong " South-West News " reports that the US movement has not existed in the more than 40-year diplomatic relations between two Central American countries.
Analysts believe that this movement could cause lasting damage.
China's capital in Houston was built in 1979, the first capital of China, which was established in the United States.
Currently, China has a embassy and five headquarters in the United States.

Some journalists asked: According to the media, terrorist organizations associated with China had interrupted an British company's network system, launched attacks on British technology companies with patented data and penetrated into the EU's national government network.
The speaker stated that the Government of China was a strong defender of network security and consistently opposed and combated any form of network assault and network crime.
There should be sufficient evidence to be found in the case of investigations and definitive network incidents that cannot be suspected without evidence.
The speaker said that a series of events, such as the former "The Gates ", have proved that the United States has been carrying out its most global network-wide secretion.
Peace and stability in the space of the Network are in common interest in all countries.
The speaker noted that China ' s achievements in scientific innovation were not stolen, not stolen, but made it hard to fight through its own strength.
In 2019, China submitted approximately 5.9% of its applications through the "Credentials Cooperation Treaty" (PCT) and an annual growth rate of 10.6 per cent became the largest country in the submission of international patent applications.
China has become a major power for innovation and intellectual property.
In the first half of the first half of the year, the Chinese People ' s Bank has shown that new loans for agriculture and microenterprises increased throughout the year by over 2019.

According to him, from 25 July to 24 July, 22 new cases of new lung cancer in the city of Urumese (of which 5 of them were transfused as non-communicable infections) and 38 new cases of non-communicable infections were reported.
As at 2430 hours on 25 July, there were 135 cases of infectious diseases in the city of Urumese, 147 cases of non-communicable infections.
The additional 25-day non-communicable infections are also mainly identified through the free testing of nuclear acid throughout the city.
On 26 July, the Director of the Urumazi City Health Commission said that most of the areas of work on the free testing of nuclear acid throughout the city of Urumati had been essentially completed.
He also said that from experience in other parts of the country, there were many factors that affected the results of the testing of nuclear acids, such as the flexibility of testing agents, the time of infection and the time of removal of the test personnel, the comparability of the test subjects when taking samples (probably resulting in the absence of the label) and the level of professional training of the test personnel.
For various reasons, a nuclear test would also result in false results.
The so-called falsity means that the tested person is indeed infected, but the results of the test are
In addition, there is a need for two nuclear tests to be excluded for cases of infectious diseases and suspected cases of such diseases.
For individuals at high risk of infection, it is also necessary to exclude two nuclear acid tests if there is an outbreak of fever and respiratory symptoms.
He stated that, in view of the above situation, for the physical health of the entire population of the city, the city of Urumazi would have begun to conduct two free testing of carbon dioxide for mountain areas, such as the Saf Al-Bak region, while conducting "Research forpossessment".
It has been reported that the mountain range, Sa al-Bak district, is a high risk zone.
"The hotest international film series on the sea through unusual industrial confidence-in-new network.
2020-07-26 06:52:39 Source: Text-to-speech Reporter: King-in-Chief Editor: King-in-Chief
The "hot" on the line, the international film series over the sea, through unusual industrial confidence.
The present report (Chief of the Prime Journal) yesterday opened a large screen for the twenty-third International Film Festival, which was held in the context of the 2020 International Films Forum, in the context of strict vaccination measures.
As the first international film show to be held since the continued proliferation of global vaccines and the normalization of my country ' s vaccine control, this year's international film festival was significant.
On the basis of regularization of vaccine control, the international film series on the sea is a credible and more determined declaration — our faith in the fight against vaccines has not changed, the belief in the people's day has not changed, the global video creation centre has been built, and the belief in "the culture of the sea" cards has not changed.
The annual International Film Festival on the Upper Sea was once again released and began to be an innovative and growing trend.
It is therefore necessary to take steps to meet the high-quality development services of the industry in order to meet the public's spiritual needs.
This year's more like it.
In order to appreciate the difficult situation of vaccine control, the International Film Series on the Sea requires serious prevention measures to be implemented in detail; on the other hand, it is a combination of wisdom for China's film creation and a vision of video-visiting needs, opening up on-line and multi-table activities.
On the first day of the opening, from the below-line picture to the industrial forum, the relevant activities of the film series were strictly implemented by the relevant vaccine policy.
The Forum's activities are controlled within 50 persons, each video segregation station, with a high rate of 30 per cent.
As the film group committee has held, however, "the safety and physical health of the population is the first one " .
It's very simple under the line. "It's hot."
In order to follow the initiative "The People of the City, the People of the City as People" as a public day, the International Film Programme of the Upper Sea is innovative and is being translated into "the exhibition", "the participation of the Great Teachers", and meet the various needs of the audience this year.
On the first day of the opening, the official partners of the film show filming videos and the first half-year-old filming, according to a series of "one-way" videos " , returned to the film.
In the evening, the Golden Open Forum was also in the central video and in the study of powerful countries, including App, and the cross-platform on several platforms, allowing hundreds of people to go out and to pay attention to the latest trends in Chinese film.
At the opening forum yesterday, members of the Central Radio General Television Group, the Deputy Director-General, spoke openly and announced the opening of this film show, the Committee of the Marines, the Minister of the Ministry of Public Affairs, and the Deputy Mayor, attended.
Vaccination expert Fuchi: Careful on the development of vaccines early in 2021
The above statement was made at a video conference organized by the International Capital Fund on 25 February.
He recalled that it is not yet clear how new vaccines will develop during winter and what the final impact of vaccination will be," and that the only way to end all of this is that we all choose to be part of the problem."
According to U.S. University of Johns Hopkins, as of 25 hours, the new U.S. emergency cases have reached 417,6 million and 14.6 million people have died.
Fuchi stated that some regions in the United States are currently struggling with anti-immunition.
Despite differences in field conditions, there is a need for targeted response programmes, but diversification strategies do not mean close links between regions.
Vaccinations in one region will eventually affect other regions.
"Now is not the time for self-sustainment," Fuch said, "our work has not been completed, we must intensify our efforts, and we must remain alert to the uncertainty of the future. "
U.S. medical experts, the founder of the "Drug Drug Treatment Act" of AIDS, noted at the meeting that the United States has not yet reached the end of the epidemic.
"We all have to do our best to slow down the spread of this virus."
It was called upon that the public, through its actual action, would take time for scientists to develop new drugs and vaccines.
The International Capital Fund is a non-profit organization aimed at promoting international exchange activities in the United States and in the Asia-Pacific region, committed to the promotion of the status of the United States of America and the development of international youth leaders.
On that day, the Minister for Transport of the United States of America, the Federal Parliamentary Members of the United States and the President of the International Leadership Foundation, made a statement at the meeting, respectively.
They are particularly grateful to Asian medical workers and volunteers who are on one line of vaccines and call upon the United States public to continue to adhere to prevention standards such as "social distance " to prevent the spread of vaccines.

At the same time, the General Assembly decided to further expand the implementation of the scope of central medical observers and to include close contact with people who have been exposed to the presence of nucleic acids (such as diseases and non-communicable infections), and to complete 14 days of communicable medical observations by those close to the contact.
The main airport, the Grand Railway Station, issued a notice every 25 days that the implementation of the principle of non-reconnection of the entire city personnel would not be necessary and that it would be necessary to have a 7-day nuclear test evidence; the Grand Motor Vehicles General Station would have to suspend the sale of the whole city’s road ticket from 25 a.m. to re-establish further notice.
A study in Brazil revealed that CFCs are not effective in the treatment of new vaccines.
Recently, a Brazilian study showed that HCBV is not effective for patients with anticoagulants.
The study was published in the New England Journal of Medicine.
Ba researchers divided 667 patients from 55 hospitals throughout the country into three groups and performed bedbug tests, mainly for the treatment effects of HCFCs or other anti-acetic acids, to analyze whether it was helpful to improve the incidence of new lung cancer and the disease of middle- and middle patients.

In recent years, the demand for red tourism has gradually increased.
However, the development of the red tourism industry is also facing a minority of young groups, the quality of tourism projects and the single challenge of commercialization channels.
In particular, this year's epidemic, national tourism has been severely affected, and the Red Tourism Summit has faced serious challenges.

The U.S. Trade Representative to deliver the August meeting.
On 25 August, Hong Kong "Sunwarn Morning" reported that a prominent informant was responsible for China's Trade Negotiation Group, the Deputy Prime Minister of State and the U.S. Group's co-chairman, who was expected to hold an official meeting on the Seabed of the Trade Representative to assess the performance of the United States trade agreement between the two parties.
It is reported that although China has significantly increased the number of agricultural products purchased in the United States over the past few months, the number of commitments made by China in the trade agreement remains one step away due to factors such as new HIV infection.
Analysts said that recent closures in the United States of America, as well as other disputes, could undermine any progress made by both parties in trade.
The first phase of the trade agreement in Central America entered into force one month after the signature of 15 January, in which it provided for a high-level trade framework group composed of both sides, which should hold a meeting every half year.
The informed persons revealed that this meeting would be "an important turning point", enabling both parties to assess the progress of the agreement.
However, the person also said that if tension in America led to a lack of willingness to speak at this time, both parties might agree that the telephone meetings held on 8 May, i.e. a half-yearly meeting of the Trade Agreement, were met.
Since this year, relations between the United States and Central America have deteriorated rapidly, including a range of issues such as the origin of new vaccines, trade, Hong Kong, New Zealand, the South Sea and the Idea.
President Tranpe of the United States changed his attitude in spite of the achievements he had achieved in the first phase of the agreement at the beginning of the year.
He said at the 23rd White Journalist meeting that although China had recently purchased a record of U.S. mercury, it also bought a lot of paper, "but this trade agreement is now my meaning, it is not as it was when it was first arrived."
A famous government adviser to Beijing also believes that because of the poor relations between America and America, a new round of trade negotiations are not very likely to take place, "the issue of trade between the United States has lost its share of relations".
However, he revealed that China ' s 23-day trade-related unit continued to discuss a series of issues, including how to increase imports from the United States, "We have done our best, so any additional procurement will be difficult".
The Vice-Chairperson of the National Trade Commission in the United States of America said that keeping the first phase agreement "is more important than ever" and that China has made progress this year in opening up the financial market to the United States.
The Independent Research Company analyst Plenum said: "It's not better to talk, even if it's only possible to act as a public service. "

The Chief Representative of the Nasdak China Region: now is the best time segment of China's company IPO -- Economic Observations - Professional Finance News Website
Economic Observatory Newspapers Because of the Russian coffee counterfeiting incident, the U.S. market has imposed more severe regulation on the central unit, as well as a long-term pressure assessment, pressure on the stock market in the United States cities, and pressure on the Internet, as well as the recent opening of the blockage in Kyoto.
It's a very short time. It's like a car company. It's hot in the city.
Are China's businesses now the best time in the city under the crisis?
"In the case of recent IPOs and subsequent companies, it is not of any nature that IPOs have been affected, but now the market is very good, and even now this is the best time segment of the Chinese company IPO for the past 10 years. "
The head of the Chinese district of Nasdak, which is in the Nasdak Paper Trade, expressed its concern at the "Communication of the Citizens of the Citizens of the City Company in 2020".
In April of this year, the U.S. Credentials Board (SEC) and the Public Company Accounting Board (PCAOB) issued " an important statement on audit quality and control of access to audits and other international information - the challenge of accessing information currently available to U.S. municipal companies with a large number of operations in China".
The statement states that, although international cooperation and coordination have increased significantly in recent years, the United States SEC and PCAOB continue to face the challenges of law and practice in accessing information by the United States regulatory authorities, and that the PCAOB website is in line with the list of top-ranking companies and their audit agencies, which are listed in large amounts.
In addition, in May this year, the Senate of the United States Congress adopted "the Foreign Company Account Act", which provided additional information to foreign companies in the United States City.
It appears that the overall crisis in the unit did not affect investors' mouth.
" This news has caused fear of all and fear of the future of the United States, but we have discovered that these issues are not a matter for investors, that investors may ask these issues even as they are standardized when they are recently on the way to U.S. IPO, but this is not an important factor for investors to invest in and not invest in a Chinese company.
It is recommended that everyone look at the current situation with as much interest as possible.
Of course, this appearance may seem to be the most serious situation in the past two years, but there is no impact on the investor ' s mouth.
So from now on or before the end of this year or the U.S. elections, U.S. IPO's heat will continue. "
On 9 May this year, Kinshasa was officially established in Nasdak City, U.S.A., and became the first Chinese company to sell IPO.
"The top of the town of Kinshasa is a very large trust for China's company that prepares IPO for the back. "
I'm sorry, but I'm sorry.
In the first half of the first half of the year 2020, data from the unit data published shows that in the first half of this year, 20 Chinese enterprises in the United States of America have increased by 17.6 per cent over the previous year; from the total amount of capital borrowing, 20 companies have increased by 2725 million compared to the same year; 52.4 per cent have risen compared to the previous year; and in the first half of this year's health sector, the number of IPOs has increased by 100 per cent over the previous year.
It is interesting to note that China's IPO's quality for the first half of this year, with strong basic and growing quality companies, will be more attractive to investors.
From a short, medium and long term perspective, IPO continues to be optimistic about China's company.
"The short term is that the heat of U.S. IPO is still continuing; the medium term is that China's company has more options, Unit A, Port Unit, Unit of America, all will consider the U.S. and Central America's choice as market choices and time factors; for a long time, everything will return to normal, the market's fluctuations are cycled, both political cycles and economic cycles, and finally return to normal stages and the city is always ahead of movement."
At the same time, he said, "There are no more factors to be determined this year, but for quality companies, no matter whether the market is good or bad, as long as they are real and have the potential for growth of investors, the other factors are relatively necessary and the Chinese companies need investment excellence. "

People's Day Reporter: focusing on their own affairs and developing new priorities for the future — on learning how to work closely with the Competitiveness of the Business Conference - Newwave Network
E-mail 25 July Beijing People's Day Commentary article 26 July: Central efforts to do their own thing to create a new advantage for the future
At present, global vaccination and the world economic situation are still very complex, and our country has not had the challenges to face.
Maintaining strategic strength, strengthening confidence, focusing on doing things our own way is key to our meeting various risk challenges.
At a recent business conference, the NAP noted that, in the current protectionist rise, the global economy is undermining, the external environment that is undermining global markets, we need to focus on our own efforts, fully taking advantage of the domestic over-largest market advantages, gradually forming the topical new forms of development in the internal circle of the country, increasing the level of modernization of industrial chains, stimulating technological innovation, speeding up key core technology attacks and developing new advantages in the future.
The wise man, the prudent man, the chosen man.
In the outer environment of deep economic globalization, markets and resources have played an important role in my country's rapid development "outside.
Now, the world under the epidemic is experiencing profound changes that are facing more unstable factors, economic globalization is facing the backdrop and the backbone.
A better time to prepare and work to respond to the idea of change in the external environment, to promote the deterioration of our economy, and to move away from it, a very important aspect is to make the expansion and meeting national needs as a strategic basis for development, to take full advantage of its own preferences, to increase the domestic momentum for our economic development through the prosperity of the country ' s economy.
We need to be deeply aware of the design of a complete internal system of needs, the relationship between long-term development and long-term peace.
The status of the party ' s central trial situation, which clearly provides a firm implementation of an expanded internal need strategy, is the need to respond to the outbreak of vaccines, to the need to maintain the sustained health development of our country ' s economy and to meet the needs of the people for the growing beauty of life.
The advantages of the economy of the country are internally circular.
Our country has the largest global integrity, the largest industrial system, the strong production capacity, the improved packaging capacity, more than 10 million market subjects and more than 17 million people who are highly educated or professionally skilled, including over 14 billion people, including over billion middle-income groups, are in the new industrialization, informationization, urbanization, rapid development of agriculture and investment demand potential.
Public governance is the subject of all forms of economic joint development, the distribution of labour, the distribution of various forms and the survival of the socialist fundamental economic systems such as the socio-economic system of the socialist market economy, which can promote the empowerment of all types of market subjects, the release and development of social productivity and promote efficiency and equal opportunities and continue to achieve common wealth.
We would like to put this strategic base in place, to increase production, distribution and communication across the country ' s markets, to achieve a better cycle of good governance, to clearly provide strategic direction for structural reform and to promote overall delivery and demand balance at a higher level.
In order to accelerate the construction of an integrated internal system, to promote technological innovation and other aspects of innovation, to speed up the progress of the digital economy, smart manufacturing, health and new materials, to create more new growth points, to increase growth, to become a topically topical, and to promote new forms of development across the country.
Open it up. Close it up. It's gonna fall.
The NEPAD noted several times that the open door of China would not be closed, but would only be further expanded.
It is not a matter of shutting down the door of operation with a large domestic circle but of making the internal market and international markets more interconnected by building capacity and better use of two international domestic markets and two resources to enhance more sustainable development.
At the same time, the expansion of domestic needs and the expansion of openness does not conflict with the fact that the internal circle is increasingly fragmented and that it is more conducive to the building of an open new structure and to the creation of an international cooperation and competitive new advantage.
While international protectionism is now on the rise, we need to stand on the right side of history, continue to deepen reform, expand openness, strengthen open cooperation in the field of science and promote the building of an open world economy and promote the building of a community of human life transport.
The Chinese people have experienced many difficulties in their history, but they have never been pressured, but they are brave, constantly growing in trouble and rising from trouble.
On the way forward, there is strong leadership at the centre of the country ' s central party, with close ties to equality, a great advantage of China's special socialism system, strong mobility and powerful combined strength, a united struggle for all the peoples of the whole country, and we must be able to overcome all the difficult obstacles, maintain our country's economic and social well-being, fully building a healthy society, and successfully open up the new national agenda for the full construction of modern socialism!
What about the balance of income after '90' and 'repetitional'?
As the balance is earned, "90" has not only escaped the balance value, but started "repealable" money?
In the first half of the first half of the year, the Chinese New Economic Research Institute, which has jointly paid off the " 90-dollar balance report " (2020), showed that "90-year-old" was more expensive: the total amount of money was almost four times the growth in 2019.
In fact, after '90' it's more likely to start from a 'small money', which is six percent of every dollar's worth of money is less than 20 cents...
It's worth the rest of the money, and it's like "90."
Data show that among the remaining 7 billion users, 1.34 million users are "after 90".
China has 174 billion "90" -- that is, about three out of four "90" dollars for the rest of the country.
At present, the 7-day income rate of the Fund, such as the balance sheet, is higher than 2 per cent from the start of the year and has dropped to about 1.5 per cent.
Even so, there is no impact on the pace of the '90' money.
In the context of the increase in the value of the balance, it is not uncommon for young people who use the balance value to be directly converted into "births".
The payment of valuable data shows that, as at 13 July, nearly a month's pay is more than a year's worth of new "kids" than grew up, and more and more young people are paying "in step" funds.
There were analysts who felt that funding was a significant cause of a clear decline in the share of the MFF from the balance sheet in the market.
The report also shows that "90" women tend to spend more money on average than men; 6 of the users with funds on the pay platform are men and women tend to choose a more stable financial method.
After saving the money, what's the plan after "90"?
The payment of valuable data shows that "90" has the custom of paying for the target and that most users will travel as the target of the money.
Many "90" money was used to prepare for post-mortem journeys; the film industry was restored and new ways to move from money to consumption.
It's going to be high on the top of the mountain.
In recent years, our South-South has been affected by continuous flooding, which is very severe and has resulted in the destruction of 26 provinces (areas, cities) in the north of the Pacific, the Black Sea, the South Sea, the Great Sea, the Far East and the North.
Disasters are orders, disaster zones are battlefields, disaster fronts, party gangs are weapons of war, organizations at different levels, the Department of Major Party Affairs, the People's Defence Forces are firmly committed to the implementation of the important spirit of the recent General Assembly on Disaster Prevention, the rapid entry into the first line of prevention of disaster risk relief, as the main pillar of the population in the disaster zone, and the life force against flood.
The party's flag stands high on the hill. It is an expression of loyalty and a call to the mission.
Before the disaster, one party organization was a fighter and one party member was a flag.
On a cross-border front line, organizations at all levels, large-scale parties' departments show high loyalty to the party, listen to the call from the party's central call to "look at my" action, "come with me" the courage of "I" and build a stand-up, which is an impenetrable Chinese castle.
The iron flag is high on the hill, standing on the ground, as well as on the corner of the hill.
In the face of the floods, the rapid action of all levels of party organizations, the outbreak of "Hungary", which has been put on the scale of the conflict, the Great Party's Ministry of Justice, the People's Defence Force has maintained its position in the conflict, with "The Party's will and action" being the most important and most reliable obstacle to the people in the disaster area.
The party's flag is highly prominent in the opposition to Hong Kong, which is free of charge and responsible.
In times of crisis, at the moment when the people's lives are threatened, the Ministry of the Party, the People's Army, the People's Defence Forces, taking into account all of them, without private dedication, bravely taking into account the strength of the strength of the force of the fight against flood risk, as a whole test, as a whole, as an air force, as a well-sustained warground, as such a private dedication and as a hostage spirit, is a great encouragement to the people in the disaster, and together with the strong spirit to combat the disaster.
"People up to life up to" is both tested at the same time and more critically tested at the same time.
On the anti-Hunga River, the Ministry of the Great Party and the People's Defence forces are always trying to keep the people from seeing the red flag, fighting the image, encouraging the voice to add to the party's flag with unquenchable sand!

France Larger Military Intakes of Space - New York
The French Minister for Defence, Florence Pali, said on 24th, that France would add billions of european defence budgets to develop space military forces to prevent " unfriendly movement " from being carried out outside space by other countries.
During the period from 2019 to 2025, the budget for expenditure on the French military projects will increase from EUR 36 billion (about $42 billion) to EUR 440 million ($500 million) previously developed.
In accordance with the French Parliament's Military Planning Act of 2019 to 2025, France is expected to update existing observation satellites and communications satellites in the future, launching 3-emission satellites to improve the modern level of Rada's monitoring of space.
French President Emmanuel Mackron announced last July that the French Air Force would establish the Department of Military Commands and the Air and Space Force within the French Air Force.
Pali said that she would formally declare the establishment of this space force when she later arrived at a military school in the Provincial District.
Pali said this space force belonged to the air forces and 500 people were prepared before 2025.
She said: "In the past, it was thought that space served the common interests of science, and that the idea was never repeated, now that space is a place where nations are fighting against global sovereignty. "
Pali reiterated the pre-Makron appearance, claiming that the French did not want to launch an arms race.
"We're never in the arms race, but I have a responsibility to know exactly what threats we may face."
Pali reimbursed on the monitoring of military satellites common to France and Italy in 2017.
She says, "Cruit money" is a Russian satellite.
The Russians rejected that statement.
Parly says that France "will soon" have a small patrol satellite capable of detecting and blocking those who are unfriendly behind the blacks."
The French media believed that because of France's quest for the establishment of a space force, U.S. President Donad Tranup requested the United States Department for Defence to draft a space military bill in February.
Tranunup signed the National Defence Authority Act last December and ratified the establishment of the sixth major United States Army — the Space Force.
Some experts are concerned that these United States initiatives have accelerated the U.S. militaryization pace and may lead to a new round of space arms competition.

Hot Lake South, hot face.
On the other hand, the construction of industrial projects throughout the province promotes the enthusiasm for the release of the present spectrum and covers three days of coolness, "in terms of industrial strength and the clear direction of the project in terms of heroism" encourages three-quarters of water.
South-South development is always dependent on building projects, agriculture.
In the face of a very unusual first half of the year, under the leadership of a centrally central party of the Middle East, the entire province has maintained a circle of efforts to fight against vaccines and to protect both strengths and to implement the industrial project as "Six Stabil" "Six" "Six" "Six " " "Six" "Six " " "Third " " .
From one quarter of GDP fell by 1.9 per cent, from the first half to the first half of the first year to the growth by 1.3 per cent, the difficulty of the period, the intensity of efforts, and the lack of words.
In this valuable achievement list, industrial projects are being built to accelerate economic recovery in the South and to develop stability for good.
It's positive, it's irreversible.
Industrial projects are built to be put into large sizes of the General Assembly, which should be improved in position, circumstances, circumstances, and in terms of knowledge, demand and change.
In the complex context of the current international situation, it is also necessary to study the new features of the current situation with a silent mind, more prudent and more scientific efficiency, better integration into the country ' s mainstream, and the new forms of development that promote each other ' s internal cycle.
More focused on capacity-building in industry.
In the first half of the first year, my province had not only a large number of newly-incentive-industrial-based investment projects destroyed land, but also hoped that more traditional preference industries would speed up the pace of digitalization, intellectualization and greenization of industrial transformations, such as landings.
The third science-based project on the existing production line was redesigned by high-pressure power grids; the new tobacco industry in the South of the South was committed to the transformation of energy, the process of building a modernized factory, as well as the life-saving picture of "The New Ageing" ... ... . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  . .     . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
More focused on developing new socio-economic models for development.
As with its new epidemics, it has led to a red-and-white economy, increasing the potential of digital economies to provide new tools for industrial change: in the first half of the year, my department ' s computers and office equipment manufacturing industry grew by 12.6 per cent, and increased by over-sale sales of retail business networks by over 32.2 per cent, and by food business network revenue by 35.6 per cent more than growth.
In the midst of the crisis, new agencies are being launched in the context of change, actively promoting digital industrialization, industrial digitization and leading to the economic integration of digital economies and entities.
More focus on optimisation and stabilization of industrial chains supply chains.
The engineering machinery is the leading army of the South-South industry, but two thirds of the companies that are assembled outside the province still have space and potential.
The strengthening of industrial links will not only result in the continuous accumulation of capital enterprises but also in the achievement of technical disruptions in the key sectors of industrial links; it will also require potential development to strengthen the expansion of the link links and to promote a "block" response to the relevant industrial synergy, to accelerate self-control and secure industrial links.
It's hard to pass, business, but the South is still a good business environment, the market's hot soil, and the recreational land.
In the case of loss caused by the return of the vaccines, the authorities found a short-term pain point in the short-term pain to make it possible to achieve a life-threatening story that was not recommended for business operations, politics was not broken up, and the problem was solved by nighttime.
A focused research industry, the development industry, the real-time business environment for improvement will be able to win more investors' skills.
The front wind is on the move, but the state of the wind is on the rise, which has become the building of industrial projects under the province and has contributed to high-quality development.
During this critical period, it is important to learn well and to follow through on the important series of guidelines to criticize the spirit of self-reliance in order to effectively address the uncertainty of its work outside, to promote industrial projects, to build common heat, to build common hot water, to ensure "135" and to fully build a small-scale society.

As the situation of vaccine control improved gradually, life-cycle production of the whole community continued to be restored.
The Central Party maintains a strong focus on the overall need for progress, further strengthening macro-political energy, comprehensive strengthening of employment priorities, and active promotion of the promotion of the work of the Fund for the expansion of employment.

However, the impact of new vaccines on commodity prices is particularly evident.
The impact of vaccine control, when material supply is widespread throughout the country in February, was inadequate, increased costs of transport of goods increased, as well as the acquisition of some citizens, and the price of some of life ' s necessities was clearly high.

As an artist, communication is very important to me.
Through my artistic work I tried to explain that humans are not naturally separated, but everything is interrelated.
About 10 years ago, I first went to South Asia, and I saw the ice.
I'm afraid.
My heart is moving fast, my head is moving, and I'm trying to figure out what this really is in front of me.
It's just a snowflower, covered in another snowflower, built once a year.
The form of ice is when they break off from the ice or break off from the ice.
Every ice mountain has its own unique characteristics.
They have a clear way of interacting with the environment around them and their circumstances.
Some of the glaciers refused to cooperate to the bottom, while others of the glaciers couldn't endure the melting of ice at once under severe storms.
When you see the ice, it's easy to remember that they're all isolated, they're independent, isolated, more like our people at times.
But it doesn't really matter.
As the ice melts, I breathe into its old smell.
As the ice melts, it releases mineral-rich water, which they feed on.
I'm starting to draw these glaciers like I'm filming my grandfather's paintings, knowing that at these very particular times, the glaciers existed in that way, but it won't exist any more.
It's not death when they're finalized; it's not an end, it's an extension of the path of immortality.
I've been filming ice, some are very young -- thousands of years old.
Some ice, over a million years.
The last picture I'd like to show to everyone is an ice-cream I painted on Kekertsusiak Island, Greenland.
It's a very difficult opportunity for everyone to actually see a snowflake.
So that's what the picture shows.
You can see a small boat on the left.
It's a 15-foot boat.
I want you to notice the shape of the ice. It's the shape on the water.
Here you see it's starting to turn, moving the little boat to the other side, a man standing there.
It's a medium-sized mountain of Greenland.
It's about 120 meters high or 40 meters high.
It's a real movie.
(Music) Like this ice mountain, they show everyone the different aspects of their personality.
Thank you.

It is intended to present bluefin tuna products to the Prime Minister of the Békgendzeung-Hungary Limited Company, Anna (left).
Ma'am, I'm sorry.
E-mail 26 July in the Central and South Sea of the New Internet: Blue Sea Sea "Seaside": "Sweet" for agricultural cultivation
Author, Hullon, Rainbow.
"The Green Sea lakes, full of gold and silver flowers, are high in the sea, high in temperatures, low in the night, low in the air, the strongest inundated by strong sunlight, the strongest in the world, the most active in the blue Sea, the highest in the world, high in protein, rich in nutritional value, low in sugar."
On 26 June, the Under-Secretary-General for Industry and Information of the Heinan People ' s Republic of China stated that he was building a building.
On that day, a direct shipment of products "with the aid of heart disease" was held in the Red Sea, together with representatives of the Chinese Association and businessmen, together with a multi-stakeholder group of GHG products, which were sold on the line for nearly 10,000 BLW and totalled approximately $38 million.
A picture of a rice product for the farm site.
It was reported that this direct shipment activity has been carried out through the Beijing Wallware Business Network, fast-paced, domesticly-known mining companies such as the Coins, the radio, the electronic platform to facilitate the exchange of "enterprises/farms+farmers" and, via the line, continued to distribute "Glusters" to consumers, which is expected to generate almost $52 million a year in total.
In this regard, the President of the Béküdde Group of Limited Companies, Nana, considers it " very valuable": " This is an effort to increase the reputation of bluefin tuna products, attract more consumers to know, like natural maize products that are not added to them, and lead to crop cultivation. "
At the present time, the company has concluded a strategy agreement for production cooperation with a limited company in the bluefin tuna industry, a cooperative in the bluefin tuna sector, and together with a view to promoting the long-term development of the bluefin tuna industry.
It's a sea of oil for the blue Sea.
This evening, due to the need for road safety control, the road for farmers to "travel" was blocked, many farmers were severely affected by the lack of food and the loss of food.
"In the first year, farmers moved from the south to the north, from the south to the north, and from the south to the west, where they lived without a place to live.
As companies, we have the responsibility to help them."
Anna called it.
"Michael is an " environmental reconnaissance team" and is not able to survive serious regional contamination. " The Deputy Director General of the Chinese Coal Products Association presented the fact that the cod is an important component of ecosystems and has an irreplaceable role to play in protecting the diversity of plants and improving the ecological environment.
At the same time, breastfeeding can increase agricultural growth, especially in areas where poor conditions are widely managed.
Research data show that the yield can increase by 15 per cent to approximately 30 per cent.
A presentation of bluefin tuna products is presented by the Deputy Director General of the Chinese Association for Coalition Products.
" The economic, ecological and social benefits of the maize production are far greater than the value of the dairy products themselves, the livestock industry has had great potential in human health, agricultural production, the cultivation of the fertile, ecological protection, but there has been little knowledge of this. "
And I'm not going to be here. I'm not going to be here.
Now, however, the number of farmers is increasing, and many poor people who cannot take action have been selected as co-operating units, apart from regular year-on-year-olds.
" The country has financial support, we link technical assistance to guidance, lack of knowledge and judgment on the market environment, and also need the assistance and coordination of industry associations to open the way. "
The Little River says.
"We hope that everyone will be more concerned about the future and help feed groups," Hannah said, "our dairy products will also be carefully selected and controlled in accordance with national standards, guaranteeing quality and protecting consumers ' rights while helping farmers. "
The effects of continuous flooding have been re-emerged from the mid-Tape of the 6-London Desert, which has been re-emerged in the area since 22 July, resulting in a massive turnaround, which has been completely blocked by the river and formed 13 metres in front of the well and estimated the amount of 550,000 cubic metres of groundwater.
In order to ensure the safety of navigation, the maritime sector has decided to exercise temporary traffic control over long-distance rocks to the coastal waters.
According to the monitoring of the weather and water sectors, from 25 days onwards, the global rain in the Middle East and the North-East regions has been resuscitated to major rain, partly of the region's rain, and in the area.
There will be the highest water station at 26 o'clock in the evening and the highest water is close to safe water.
In order to ensure the safety of navigation, the maritime sector has decided to exercise temporary traffic control over long-range rocky rocks to the coastal waters.
Following the re-examination of the city defence with climate, water, water, and units of emergency negotiations, the Ministry of Urban Anti-Fraud Commands decided to publish warning information at level III of the flood River and to initiate emergency response at level IV.
The Ministry of Rehabilitation, the Ministry of Defence, called for a high level of attention to the water conditions, in particular long-term droughts, floods, floods, pre-study investigations, early warning delivery, enhanced surveillance, strong determination to transfer the threat to the population of the region, timely mobilization of emergency relief teams and materials, rapid and efficient disposal of disaster (risk) and avoid the occurrence of fatalities.
The representative of the Vietnamese Embassy in Laos welcomed the participation of a representative of the Lao People's Republic in the sacrifices at the Lao People's Association of Viet Nam, the Prime Minister of Viet Nam, and the representative of the Provincial Government and the Lao People's Army.
The British priesthood was held in a harsh atmosphere, and representatives continued to sing praises to the British, to the success of the British, and to the greater degree of solidarity.
In his statement, the Ambassador was very pleased to say that this was an opportunity for both former Vietnamese and Lao peoples to share their common appreciation for the British revolution and to express their appreciation for the noble opportunity of offering their free will to the two countries, while the two countries also reminded them of working together to fight against their common enemies, seek national independence, national unity, build up national development and consolidate good opportunities for relations between the two countries.
On 23 January 1946, 74 years ago, 28 former combatants of the Old League were bravely killed when they entered the Ponehe site.
This step-by-step attack has led to a historic victory in both countries in the early stages of the struggle for national liberation.
She stressed that the people of the two countries were always mindful of the greatness of the victims of the fight against the free movement of two peoples, while stressing that a young group of two countries would continue to promote the old and strong tradition and contribute to the continued development of the ageing relationship and the prosperity of the two countries.
It's a long way past!
The new network in the 3,000-th international Milan-threaded amphetamines.
On July 26th, Beijing, on the 26th day of the day, the International Milan International War of the Regen.
According to the Italian media statistics, the client's role in Photoana is the 3,000th International Milanese Association of Minds, and the Blue Army is also the first to launch this series of games.
Since the turnout of the League in 1929, the International Milan is the only team that has never been neglected and the only team that has never been reduced.
According to the Italian media, the international conflict between Milan and Tonania was the 3,000th in the history of the Black Army.
In the civil war in this area, three international Milani clients won the war against the United States.
This service opened twice, and Sanchez contributed one ball instead.
From the beginning, the competition entered the international millennia scene, and finally turned into a game.
On the left-hand side of the Belgian road, the Rukaku trainer broke the door.
In the 82 minutes of international Milan, such as the French strike, in the post-Muslim road crossings, the Sanchez road bag was fired by hand; it was completed twice before the end of Lukaku and was sent to the city of Brozovic to a long distance from the direction of the road. Lukaku entered the block area after crossing Romero, which would be separated by an air-extended at 3:0.
The international Milan client 3:0 won the hottest in Asia, and divided up to 2nd, after the fall of the multistakes, into 4 per cent of the leader Yuvintus.
Thus far, in the 3,000-threaded amnesia, over 90, international Milan won its 1489th, 834th, 677th, and 49.6 per cent.
Between them, the team went to 5038, 3102, and 1.68.
The Blue Army has received 18 UNAMSIL troops and has never been reduced.
The unmanned aircraft was landed in Lithian territory when carrying out its mandate near the " Blue Line " of the border between Israel and Lebanon.
The statement did not mention the reason for the failure of the non-aircraft.
An Israeli media reported that this unmanned machine may have been damaged and collapsed.
It was reported that the Deputy Prime Minister of Israel and Minister of Defence, Guntz, had indicated on Monday when visiting the northern areas of Israel, that Israel would continue to take action against Syria and Lebanon in order to ensure its security interests.
Israel ' s long-term view of Lebanon ' s God Party as a major threat to security and accused Iran of bringing weapons from the Syrian territory to the Lebanese God Party when the situation near the border was tense.
Israel has fought against the organization several times and has launched an air attack on its objectives in the Sudan.
An old-fashioned band of men playing a cuba-Newwav network.
A large-scale fight show, which was held on 16 July, was conducted by the Winglon, the Air Force, the Sussie, the Huangwa, and the Lili People's Party, and was held in the Land of the East at 7:30 a.m. on July 16th.
The drama described a joint sub-computer's flight to the J.P.O.A., U.S.A., which killed the head of the Japanese agent and shattered the Japanese army's surprise.
According to the historical revision, the material was collected from the Soviet military archives that had been blocked for years.
During the Moscow Defense War, the Soviet Red Army was in support of the Far East, at which time Japan's North-East Army considered it to be an opportunity and would like to join the army.
In order to address the risk of being subjected to hostility, the plan "Mudanura" was implemented jointly with Susu's intelligence staff.
Based on this historical background, the famous drafting of the works has been condemned and has resulted in a dramatic collapse of the mind.
This time, he was the head of control and of men in the "computer."
In his play, he was the Chief of the Criminal Section of the Office of the River Police and was a well-beinged and even a little upset by the Cuban police, and he was a true member of a local party.
The women's main dream of the match was the Director of the Forest Security Board, who was deeply impressed by the blessings of the Japanese Division, and there was also an enemy between Donovan and his minor relationship.
Su has tried many different roles in recent years, from "the years we are young" to "the wave of abbreviation" to "the aggression" that has left the audience with deep impressions that have been confirmed.
This was the first time that Suzie and Zhao-Zong had been archived, with the establishment of Chief Tuba and the Women's Police, with views and curiosity.
In addition to the two main points, the "Victory" includes the many powerful players such as Zhaowa, Liliang, Mingbo, Rehan, and Dakhan, which are also one of the dramatic views.
It's also known as the "study" production that is very good, and the team goes through Zhao, Zhao, and the province of Zhinin 3 is almost 2,000 kilometers away.
In order to add to the urban landscapes of the former North-East era, the set of American workshops was working at night, carefully on every detail of the exhibition and construction of furniture, and in order to make it more efficient and historical.
The floods in the two provinces of West Yemen led to the death of 16 people -- a new network in Yemen.
News from New York City, on July 26 (Punjao-Qaida) Sana: According to Yemen's local media on 26 July, the West Yemeni and Hajje Province had suffered a severe flooding and had killed at least 16 people in the past 48 hours.
It was reported that the floods caused by the floods in the Netherlands caused 13 deaths, and 3 deaths in the nearby Haji province were reported.
In addition, dozens of houses in the northern part of the province of the Netherlands and in the southern part of the province of Hajje were destroyed by floods, and some roads and farms were destroyed in different degrees.
A number of years of sustained military conflicts have resulted in a close breakdown of Yemen ' s health system.
According to statistics from the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, since 2017 more than 1 million people have been infected by earthquakes and more than 2000 have died.
Yemen ' s medical institutions are concerned that sustained floods have resulted in renewed outbreaks of tuberculosis.
The "absolutely out" show is a dream-new world.
The film's "absolutely out" film, led by a young man, was directed by high-level coaches, William, the East, the West, and the King-Shibong.
The video told stories of the return of Vinas and the battle for dignity, showing a journey of hot-blooded nightmares.
The film "absolutely out" has been promoted by Thailand as the starting point for the rehearsal of "Tao" as the starting point for the famous King of China's dream. The whole story is based on the change in Chinese cultural values, whether the determination of the falsifiers for the past period for the father of Vinas, or the subsequent efforts to reinvigorate men of the traditional culture with the support of friends and lovers shows great love for their families and dreams.
The "absolutely out" effect of internationalization will also be triggered by various types of audiences.
At the same time, "absolutely out" shows a great deal of the horrors of thievery beatings and training, the violent and hot blood on the scene.
In the video, a small game designer from the East Astronomy helped Vinas, who was re-enacted by Vinas, re-enacted by Viennese, re-enacted to the stage and drew off the scene, combined with the new-fashioned high-tech and hot-blooded competition, also showed a small-scale and vinas looks like "a different", which is essentially the target of brotherly affection.
In addition, the love between Vinas and the well-being of the well-being of the well-being of the well-being of Vinas and the firm commitment of Vinas to the well-being of the well-being of the people has also increased the feeling of the king of the fall.

Opening of a new round of exchanges with the overseas financial transfer of 17.5 per cent - economic observation web - Professional financial information website
Economic Observer Network Journal of 26 July, U.S. Department of Land Control (60066.SH) issued "an indicative notice of the transfer of shares of the company's shares by way of public procurement arrangements".
The content of the press shows that for further deepening State financing reforms, improvements in the structure of the State's capital base, improvements in the structure of the shareholding unit, a limited company in Haiti (hereinafter referred to as "the property of Haiti") and a limited company in the upper sea (the company in the upper sea) (the "the investment in the sea") are intended to transfer the share of the company held by way of the public collection of the assignee, which is not more than 17.5 per cent of the share proposed in the total unit of land.
The cost of this transfer is not lower than that of the two above: the average daily value of the average price of 30 trading days prior to the notice dated 27 July 2020; and the net asset value of each unit audited by a recent annual accounting firm.
At present, new strategic investors on the ground remain uncertain, and according to the public information estimates, new strategic investors are expected to receive 17.5 per cent of the amount of funds transferred to this mixed area.
It is worth noting that after the transfer of this unit, it is expected that there will be no control over the original and actual control of the unit, but more changes in the control structure may occur.
Since the establishment of the Green Control Unit, several institutional reforms have been carried out: in 1992-1997 under the rules of marketization; in 1997-2013, the establishment of a non-permanent control unit, part of the Employment Unit; in 2013-2015, the introduction of strategic investors, the formation of State and non-public capital transfers units, and the integration of all systems; and to date, the entire city has become a public company.
The current GHG change programme is similar to GHG. In December 2019, high-capital hemisphere powered by 416.62 million GHG power generators (000651.SZ) 15 per cent, GHG small-scale spare parts and after the change, GHG has implemented a high-powered business management plan, without actual control of its structure.
In Haiti, the overseas investment was a group of state-owned ventures that were fully funded by the MFIs, the Head of the Land Control Unit, and the Prime Minister said that this project was a major step forward in the integrated reform of State-funded funds, an important initiative to accelerate a new phase-of-country financial finance reform, a full demonstration of the need to develop a new approach to structural adjustment through the introduction of new strategic components of the MFIs, to support the increased level of marketization of enterprises, to increase business management freedom and to accelerate the overall release of the reform force.
Cross-pronounced re-entry, open-up of the country's national capital traffic-Newwave network.
At 1220 hours on 25 July (the newspaper Leif) New York City, a total of 200 passengers from D771 motor vehicles arrived in the city of Manau Province, which was also designated by the Ministry of Culture and Tourism since the country's first cross-pronged motor vehicle tour since the visit of the TIR (the district, the city).
On the west side of the area, the city of Lunji, the city of the West, the lighthouse, has many views such as the village of Lunji, the deep valley, and the village of Zhangu, and over 200 seafarers will conduct a two-day tour of these areas.
The Deputy Director-General for International Maritime Tourism (group) said that, according to the latest policy, the company had an urgent need for cross-country travel, for the first time contacting the city of Lancashire, and for the careful launch of the products "On the Sea to Langue" and "On the Second Days of Summer" and not for the first week of sale.
My uncle from the sea said that because of the infection this year, there's no door.
"It's been a long time in the house, seeing a group of people on the street, and soon sharing the news with a friend, who had never come to London before, and who had been looking forward to this trip."
It was understood that in September last year, the city of Lancou signed a strategic cooperation agreement with the limited companies of the International Tourism Group on the Overseas Sea, which was scheduled to launch 12 high-speed tourism in the Netherlands in one year.
Am I wearing myself?
The U.S. White Consulate has been reworked early and new in the states.
The U.S. White Corps consultant has been working in the state of Anti-Ban.
On 23 July local time, the number of cases of new lung cancer in the United States fell by 40 million, representing 30 per cent of global diseases.
Over the past few months, U.S. President Taranup has repeatedly called for the restoration of the state until recently, and he has been taking the initiative in the open field to rehabilitate the press, and his consultant has been more "reversive" than some governments have ever done.
On 22 December, the President-in-Office of the White House, Calian Conway, in the press release, stated that some governments had not complied with the standards of rehabilitation and had reopened places such as the bar.
Conway also noted that the previous statement regarding the President ' s " absolute power" decision to re-work in various states was misleading.
"The President is a federalist who believes that all states have the right to self-government."
She argued for Tranquo.
However, the "word" contained in the Contigence," which Tranquo said orally on 13 April.
This is the most self-sustained operation that the netizens have known as "reforming history".
Karen Conway wants to change history. She's a liar.
Trennan, governor of Michigan, said he was an independent judge because she followed the medical guidelines and kept working.
Tran's intention is to promote rehabilitation so he can hold meetings.
This isn't the first time that Carlian Conway got into a fight.
On 15 April, when he received Fox News, he released: "This is COVID-19 and not COVID-1, friends!"
She seems to understand "19" as a version, and it's crazy by netizens: I don't know how to look at the paper!
Recently, we've seen the impact of a network attack on the business world.
Like Morgan, Jacob, the wealthiest and most expensive companies in the world, revealed the data of these companies, resulting in billions of dollars, even billions of dollars.
A few more attacks like this, the whole world economy will collapse.
The public sector cannot be happy either.
From 2012 to 2014, the U.S. Human Management Office has been providing very serious data.
Security licenses and fingerprints were stolen, affecting 22 million employees.
You may also have heard that some government-funded aliens try to use data that affects the overall results of some countries.
In the last two years, together with large data incidents in the Federal Parliament of Germany, together with the National Committee of the Democratic Party of the United States of America, e-mail incidents.
Network threats have affected our democratic process.
And there's a strong trend.
The more computer technology developed, the more vulnerable the means we use to protect data.
In particular, a new computer technology called a number of computers, it uses the microclay of the natural environment to significantly increase computer operating capacity.
It's powerfully able to break the many encryption systems we're using today.
So do we have no hope?
Should we start picking up electronic survival equipment for the next coming date?
I don't think so.
There's only a number of computers in the lab, and it takes a few years to get out of real use.
More importantly, there has been a lot of significant disruptions in the encryption area.
For me, it's a very exciting time in the history of security.
About 15 years ago, I realized that we were unlocking new skills that could produce quantities that were not existing in nature.
Using the basic laws of physics to advance the development of encryption technology, this idea has made me no longer excited.
Today, some selected companies and laboratories, including me, have advanced this technology to a practical application phase.
That's right.
We're going to use a lot against a lot.
How'd it work out?
First of all, we're going to get to know a more encrypted world.
You need a cover bag, you have some important documents to send to your good friend James Bond, lock it up, guarantee security.
Because these materials are the best secret, we're going to use a super-progress paper.
It has a special password lock, and once it's locked, it'll convert the contents of the document into the computer's serial number.
So as soon as you put the document in, lock it, this time it's turned into the computer's number, you're sending this envelope to James.
When you haven't delivered the envelope, you're calling him to tell him the code.
Once he gets a copy of the license, enter the password, complete the document translation, completely perfect, you've successfully delivered a encryption information to James Bond.
(Laughter) An example of fun, but it describes three secrets.
Password -- we call it the key.
You can imagine it as a code.
Tell James the phone number.
We call it the secret.
It assures us that we can send the secret security to the designated location.
And the key to encryption and reconciliation documents.
We call it encryption.
By means of the key, it will convert the contents of the document into the sequence number.
It's hard to break the code without a good calculation.
The importance of the bill is that if someone gets a copy of it, opens it, opens it, has no secret, does not add a code, it can't read the contents of the document.
It's just a couple of computer numbers.
Most of the security systems depend on the safe way to transmit the secret to the right place.
However, rapid growth in computing capacity is at risk of many of the methods we're using.
For example, we now use a very wide system -- RSA.
When it was discovered in 1977, about 4 billion years ago, a 426 RSA secretary could be destroyed.
By 1994, only 17 years ago, this code was broken.
As computer efficiency increases, our need for code increases.
Now we'll always use 2048 or 4096.
As you can see, the struggle between encryption and reconciliation is under way, and wants to win against each other.
In the next 10 to 15 years, when computers arrive, they're going to break more complex mathematical laws, which are the basis of the encryption system we're using today.
In fact, the computer will turn our security castle into a close-up paper house.
We're trying to protect our castle.
In recent years, a number of research institutions have emerged to study how to use quantities to enhance encryption.
People's got some exciting surprises.
Do you remember three points that were encrypted?
However, progress in science and engineering has been threatened by two of them.
First of all, it's the secret.
The computer number is the basis for the secret.
But to this day, they're not really with each other anymore.
At the moment, we're born into a secret key, based on the machine's frequency, based on software, which we call a machine's number.
The number of processes or mathematical methods, there's always some, maybe not so clear rules inside.
These numbers are as low as organically, or in terms of terms, including the smaller ones, they are more easily predicted.
Recently, some of the shelters were attacked, and they were very creative.
They're taking a little time to take a look at the engine.
Network offenders use reverse engineering to produce a reverse reverse digital generator.
So once they have a lot of rates, they're predicting a shift, so they're going to make a lot of money.
The secret is not safe either.
It's important to have a real computer digital generator for security generation.
Over the years, researchers have been trying to create a real computer digital generator.
But most of the design, whether it's not easy or fast, or it's hard to re-use.
But the world of a lot of things is really complicated.
It is very important to use this true traceability.
The device that can measure the amount of effect can be generated very quickly and continuously.
It's not possible to play the crime that just said.
A number of universities and companies from around the world are making real computer digital generators at the center of energy.
In my company, our amount of computer digital generators were born on a two-mile-long lighthouse table.
Then we cut it into a box size.
To this day, we can put it on a PCC, put it on a simple computer.
It's the fastest number generator in the world.
It's measured by the amount of energy that can produce 100 million followed-up numbers per second.
Today, it has been widely used throughout the world to improve the security of suppliers, banks and government agencies.
But even if there's a real computer digital generator, we're also facing the second major network security threat: that's the security transmission issue.
The current key transfer technology can't be connected to the anti-computer.
And for the quantity solution to this problem, it's called the distribution of the quantity key, a short statement of QKD, it uses a basic characteristic of the physical violation.
Look at this behavior, it'll change this pattern.
I'll give you an example.
Let's think about it again, giving James Bond the code.
But this time, we don't call him, we use the amount effect, we're using this code with this trigger, and we're sending it to James by means of the ordinary light.
We assume Dr. Nono wants this code.
Fortunately, Dr. Nono's trying to cut off this number of secrets will leave an electronic fingerprint, James and you can see.
The secret that's drawn like this will be gone.
And the remaining secrets can provide strong protection for the data.
Because this security mechanism is based on the basic principles of physics, the amount of computers, or any future supercomputer, it can't be broken.
I'm working with my team, along with many colleges and the defence sector, to improve this exciting technology, to develop next generation's security products.
The Internet predicts a high-time Internet presence, and it is expected that by 2020 there will be 250 to 300 million equipment on the Internet.
To think that our society is functioning normally in the Internet world, it's essential for the trust of these interconnected systems.
We believe that mass technology is very important for building this trust, and it will guarantee us that we enjoy these wonderful innovations, that these can make our lives rich in colors.
Thank you all.

Do 3-year-old children's playouts get fired and the school's reparation is justified?
2020-07-26 05:01:11 Source: Legal Journal Author: King's Deputy Editor: King's Deeds
The operation was interrupted, the child was reparated from the school.
□ This reporter.
A three-year-old boy who was playing at a university's opera was accidentally hit by a football team's head when he was playing.
Following a reparation, Mr. PVC as a legal representative of the minority, appealed to the court to apologize for the school's claims in the place of operation and paid medical costs, amounting to $2 million, such as mental damage to pensions.
Recently, the People ' s Court of the Bay of Beijing has found that the school has established a protection network at its operating site, has fulfilled the appropriate security obligations and has been reparated by someone who has so decided to reject the complainant ' s application.
Mr. Win claimed that during his 2019 vacation, he played small games at school and was then training for the game team.
To avoid the risks posed by this, small texts, Mr. Win and many other small friends and parents are active in the security areas designated by the game team.
But later, when the team of the game team dropped something at the time of the shooting, it caused the ball to fly over the grid into the above-mentioned security area and hit the small rear-view mirror.
Mr. Win was immediately taken to the hospital for treatment and diagnosed as an extraterrestrial.
Mr. Win believes that facilities at school did not comply with the relevant security requirements and did not manage effectively against the team and the related facilities.
The failure of the school led to the above-mentioned events and caused great suffering in small towns and also caused greater suffering to its families, and it should be legally responsible for the school.
In this connection, the school party argued that schools had established a protection net at the operating site and had imposed administrative provisions, training notice, notification of the need to stay away from the operating site and to remind themselves of their safety, and that the prosecutor could not prove that the school "did not meet its security obligations", so he refused to pay compensation.
The Court considered that the presence of security security obligations in the management of the premises of the school concerned in the open-ended premises of the university of the case, although such security obligations would only be met by general attention.
Schools have set up a protection net at the operating site, have fulfilled appropriate security security obligations and have been awarded medical compensation to small individuals in accordance with the above-mentioned compensation agreement, and the loss of two thousand dollars, such as transport costs, has been agreed upon by both sides to settle this once-a-time solution.
After the case, the Chief of the Small Testament again appealed for compensation to the school and, without legal basis, the Court decided to reject all appeals against the accused.
After the declaration, both parties had not appealed, and the decision had come into force.
In accordance with article 37 of my State ' s Act on Infractions, schools as managers of public places have security obligations; in the event of damage caused by third parties, third parties are liable for violations, but not exceeding the obligations of insurgent public places.
The judge claims that, as the manager of public places, it is most likely to understand the reality of the entire site, that risks and damages may occur, so that the most likely measures may be taken to prevent the loss or mitigate the damage and avoid the minimum cost of damage, and that the law provides for its obligation to ensure that social activities are carried out.
In this case, the obligation to secure the school is consistent with its social activities, in particular with the obligation to take basic security measures and to inform the public of the dangers of blindness.
In the practice of justice, it is also not necessary to impose excessive security obligations on public places managers.
If the school has already adopted a network of protections and has fulfilled its obligation to inform it, it may be found that there is no fault in the school and that it should not take legal responsibility.
In addition, in respect of third parties ' violations, even if the administrators of public places such as schools do not fulfil their security obligations, their responsibilities are also as an additional compensation for damages and may be reimbursed to third parties in accordance with the latest probationary civil law.
In such cases, the victim should no longer extend the scope of the claim after receiving direct compensation from the offender.
Today I want to show you how we make things in the future.
I'm sure our building and machinery will soon be able to assemble themselves, self-copy and repair.
So I'm going to show you the current situation of the manufacturing industry I'm thinking about, and then compare it with some natural systems.
So in the current manufacturing industry, we have a monumental building for two and a half years, between 500,000 and a million parts, very complex, using new technologies in the fields, inland and inland.
We've got moving machines that can take us into space -- five years, two hundred million pieces.
But on the other hand, if we look at the natural system, we have two million species of protein that can break into 10,000 seconds, we can copy DNA with about one hour.
It's our complexity of the natural system, but they're very effective, they're more effective than anything we've created, they're more complex than anything we can make.
They're more energy efficient.
They're a little wrong.
They'll be able to repair themselves.
There is an extremely interesting thing about the natural system.
If we can turn it into our building environment, then the way we build things will have a lot of potential.
I think the key is self-assembly.
If we want to use self-assembly in our own physical environment, I think there are four key factors.
First of all, we need a code for all the complexities we need to build -- our building and machinery.
We need to define them as simple sequences -- basically our building's DNA.
The next part we need to prepare this part can accept this sequence and be used for breaking or rebuffing.
We need some energy to activate, so that these parts of us can break up according to the procedure.
We need some sort of miscellaneous balance to ensure that we build successfully.
So I'm going to show you some of the future projects I and my colleagues are doing to achieve this self-assessment.
The first two projects are MacroBot and DeciBot.
These projects are large-scale reversible machines — 8 meters long and 12 meters long.
They're intruding electrical equipment, transmitter.
You need to figure out how you want to break up, code it into a series of angles -- 120 degrees, 120 degrees, 0 degrees, 120 degrees, 120 degrees, -- such things; a series of angles, or shifts, can pass through this sequence by electronic means.
Each unit receives its own information — for example 120. It rotates, checks whether it rotates to its place and then transmits the order to its neighbours.
There are many outstanding scientists, engineers, designers working for this project.
I think this item really shows up: Is it really possible to expand?
I mean, thousands of dollars are spent on making this eight-foot machine.
Can we really expand it?
The next question is to look at mobility, or try to reorganize it.
But it's more step by step, it's trying to actually calculate.
It's basically incorporated most of the basic modules of calculation, digital logic, directly into the parts.
It's with the door.
Each door to calculate has one square, two entrances to four.
One of them is from the user's input, like you're building a bridge.
The other one is the entry of a bag that was left before it came.
Then it'll give you three-way outputs.
This means that the user will pack the bags in whatever way they want.
It's based on what it did before and on your instructions.
Now it's starting to move within three-way space-- up or down.
See left, [1,1] input is equal to 0 output and indicates below.
On the right side, [0.0] the input is 1 output, indicating up.
So this real meaning is that our structure now includes the blue map we want to build.
Thus, information on what they want to build has been fully included in it.
This means we have some form of self-restraint.
In this case, I call it self-direction, because your structure contains accurate blue charts.
If you're wrong, you can replace a part.
All local information is included in it and tells you how to repair it.
So you've got something that can be boring, and you can read it and one output.
It is directly embedded; no external command entered.
The last project I'm going to show is the favorite link, which might be the most exciting example we've seen in the mobile self-adjustment system.
It's reversible and organized, making it a fully activated system.
It's basically the element you have in a series.
Every element is exactly the same, and they're preferable.
Each line, or each element wants to turn to the right or to the left.
If you're going to fit the tie, you need to prepare for it.
To tell each unit to turn left or right.
When you move this line, it breaks into any structure you're coded for -- so, in that case, a circle, a fire, two connected bodies.
Basically, you can design within three-way space — or one-way, two-way — this link is fully activated.
What kind of future does this foretell for us?
I think this tells us these in our body structure, in our building and machinery, this self-adjustment, self-copying and self-rehabilitation possibilities.
There are new organizationalities in these sections.
You can get a new possibility from there.
We'll have space.
Just imagine our building, the bridges, the machines, all the pieces can actually be calculated.
How amazing and estimating and disseminating the ability to calculate and design new possibilities.
It's an exciting potential.
I think these projects I've shown you are just a small step towards the future, if we achieve these new technologies for a new world of self-organization.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Under the standardization of immune control, people's enthusiasm for the movement's health is high.
With the gradual release of cross-pronounced tourism operations, the tourism market will also be welcomed back.
From 21 July, the Province of Fountain resumed its tourism operation, and the first week after the opening, it was hosted by the guesthouse of the tourist hot door.
As a tourist destination city, a few visitors arrived on the weekend.
The train station is expected to send 37 million passengers to the train and the airport is operated by students, tourists and visitors.
The tourist market was gradually back on track, and in July it ran 440 times a day, and 80 per cent of domestic flights have returned to the pre-mortem situation.
Air carriers have closed the doors to the upper sea, Beijing, Copenhagen, and the capital city, such as Western, and have taken over the post-resurrection tourist market.
At the present time, a number of cross-pronounced travel products are on the top of the road, mainly from the area.
On the train station, the airport's high-speed customer service, the units concerned at the value chain, the area where people are gathered, such as the security roads, and the promotion of the improvement of the "8-pound health code" and the sharing and interaction of health data between 31 provinces, have contributed to the orderly recovery of the tourism market.
"Can we get a new fireflies out of New York?
"Explorer 2" announced on December 24 will appear as a video of the original archive of the age.
The second continues to be a performance of praise, control and leadership for the whole new story.
It was reported that the accession of the second element of "nuclear bomb" also made it more difficult for this bomb expert to face challenges, warning of a number of surprises in it, a heartbreaking line, a massive explosion of shells, a fire-extinguished airport, and a rather devastating scene.
Three years ago, the "expert of shooting" by the former rebels captured the five-storeys of the year and won seven nominations in Hong Kong's film prizes, and the award was also a public-interested card.
This time, the "expert 2" was also again expected to be able to extract a new fire from the King's band.
"Explorer 2" told a whole new story: the former bomber storm expert (Zudavah) landed at the scene of the explosion and was listed as suspects by the police.
In order to find the truth, he had to seek the help of a good friend of the shooter expert.
The women's surveillance of the case, as well as the women's ex-connaissance, was also included in it.
It is still a bomb expert, but it can be difficult to see the new role of the Dwarf from the archived warning: cut off one leg and wears a belt on the other side of the rocket expert's tail and another on the other side of the command of former girlfriend Janie.
What was the relationship between the three and what was done at the Hong Kong Hotel and what were the cases, what was the professional experience of the bomb expert, and what was not surprising.
It is understood that the film's main game is the world-class landmark building in Hong Kong, along with its top-down specialization teams, which have led to a real visual shock.
(Laughter)
On 26 July, the new Internet of the Russian Satellite Network reported that it was the Russian Navy Day on 26 July and that the major military events of the Navy Day were held in St. Petersburg and Kashtaad.
The President of the Russian Federation, the highest unit of the armed forces in Copenhagen, Kashkent, participated in the celebration, where 15 bats and patrols were visited.
Local time was held on 28 July 2019 in St. Petersburg, Russia.
It was reported that Beijing's army officers celebrated the Navy's Day and that a number of small dogs flew across the river from the coast of Finland to join the army and then were visited by troops at the main theater.
Putin stated that the Russian Navy had included the most recent arms and special equipment and that the equipment level was constantly rising.
In the Russian Navy, Beijing said: " The Russian Navy has a high-powered army, strategic submarines and multi-purpose submarines, aircraft such as the latest aircraft, special weapons and special equipment. "
On 24 June local time, Russia celebrated the victory of the War of the Defence State for the 75th anniversary of the war.
He also stated that the Russian Navy would rely on digitalization and effective means of defence to achieve a unique advantage.
It is reported that the major Russian Navy troops held their military service in St. Petersburg and Kazakhstan, together with 46 battalions involved, including the "Casatonov" defense, the "Currakov" large anti-Squadronian submarines, and the large landmines, small missiles, shields and submarines.
The series was presented in a quiet manner near St. Petersburg, the most impressive of which was the first Russian warhead "Poltawa" in the 18th century.
In order to avoid the spread of new vaccines, only local residents and guests can enter Kashtod this year.
The last Sunday of July each year is the day of the Russian Navy.
Beckyee's team has created an annual death, and it's a new network in 86 years of age.
On 26 July, the Beijing Group issued a report on the establishment of the Beijing Team, China's famous commander, music educator, final academic member of the Central School of Music, who conducted the year of Professor Zhao Zhao, who was disabled from medical treatment and died at 13.55 p.m. on 26 July 2020 at Beijing, and who was 86 years of age.
Photo from Beijing's favorite team member.
It was born in 1934, the Sunnyakin, from a young Korean music family.
In 1951, the Young People's Radio Consortium was directed by the Young People's Radio Team, and was re-examined in 1951 by the heavy music system of the Haiva East Masters, the teacher was taught by Professor Zhezman and the German commander, and the former Soviet expert, Alzamanov.
In 1958 he was taught at the Beijing Art Academy of Music, and in 1973 he was transferred to the Central Music School, which he conducted.
The year was 1983 when the Beijing Olympics were formed.
Over the past thirty years, he has pursued the purpose of "love and dedication" and has led this group around the world, and has received several prizes in major national competitions.
In the past, the Central Group was led by a team, the Central People's Music Team, the Eastern Music Team, the More than 30 Teams, such as the Marine Union, and a number of concerts and concerts.
They have "group training", "computer training", "computer training", "second song", "Children's Song" (sub-table) and "Communication of Music", "Communication of Music" and "Communicator Law", and "Dexie's and Voting Language".
Do you know how many plants?
There are 250,000 species -- at least we know there are so many -- 250,000 plants.
And the flower is a problem.
It's really hard for plants to grow.
A great deal of experience and many resources are needed.
Why would it bother so much?
Of course, the answer is, like many other things in the world, sex.
I know what you're thinking when you look at these pictures.
So important is sexual reproduction -- plants have many other ways to reproduce.
It can be used in the form of eggs; it can grow in the same sex; it can be fertilized in the same species.
But they really need to distribute their genes together with other genes so they can have an ecosystem.
That's how progress is made.
Now the way in which plants transmit this information is through flowering.
Some of you may have seen these pictures before.
As I said, every family should have one thing to look at.
How many plants there are, how many different types of flowers.
This is actually useful for law enforcement.
It's a very low-efficiency process, and it's why we always run into our nose.
Because most of them have been abandoned, hoping to include reproductive cells in flowers, they're going to fall into another flower.
All the trees, that means all the hills, and most of the trees, spreading flowers.
But most species actually use insects to complete this process.
The insects and other species can carry flowers, move them directly to where they need to be.
Clearly, we notice the relationship between plants and plants.
It's a kind of social relationship, whether it's a bird or a monkey, they can get back, it's usually a flower.
Sometimes this social relationship will result in a strange adaptation -- a beautiful adaptation of the Red Cross.
Plants have been acquired, and the sky has spread flowers to other places.
The plant's advanced, where it creates a path that falls, it's probably lost.
Many plants look like other insects.
These are hundreds of flowers, very rare, so when an unknown insect falls on it, the flower turns around, carries a lot of flowers and hits the back of the plant, so it can follow the insects to other plants.
There's a kind of flower that looks like there's a common flower, and to some extent it's true; it's forced to bloom, it's flowering, and it's taking flowers elsewhere.
There's at least 20,000 flowers -- a variety of amazing things.
They have different flowers.
They have to try and attract fans to help them complete this process.
It's called Darwin's flower, because it's been studied by Darwin, and when he saw it, he gave a remarkable prediction.
The most important thing to do is -- when we get to the flower -- it inserts the middle part of it into the middle of a path known as flowering to get flowers.
Darwin said, look at this flower, "I guess there's something going on with it. "
There's no question about it. It's a bug.
I mean, it's usually wrapped up, but it's been extended, it looks like it.
Now you can imagine, if the flower is so valuable that the price of produce for plants is high and can attract many fans, then, as in human behavior, people may start to deceive each other.
They might say, "I have some flowers.
It's a plant.
It's a plant that likes South Africa's insects.
This is a model.
This plant is a plant before the simulation.
There's a long-distance ring that doesn't get any flowers from the liar because the liar doesn't give it any flowers, it thinks it can.
So, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Such lies spread throughout the plant kingdom.
It's a black flower: they may look like we're black, but I'm telling you, for the kind of creepy insects that are suitable, it looks like only two very sexy.
(Laughter) When the insects arrive and stand on the ground, they will, of course, be taken to other plants, and if they look at the images that each family should have, they can actually see some of the pictures, the three-quarters.
It can even make the insects feel comfortable, it looks good.
These electron-shaped micro-circuit pictures -- this is a flower in a flowering cell -- you can see that the different parts of the structure have different colors and different textures, and maybe they feel very different.
It's advanced to simulate the face of metal light seen on some of the bacteria.
You can see this face -- it's very different from the other face we've seen.
Sometimes the whole plant is like an insect, even if we look like a bug.
I mean, I think it looks like some sort of flying animal or beast.
It's a beautiful and wonderful thing.
It's a smart place.
I think it's sometimes dirty.
For suitable types of bees, it seems like another very aggressive bees, it will fly through it many times and try to get rid of it, of course, it will make it blossom.
Another thing it's doing is that this plant is modeling into another rich animal-like flower.
But there's nothing.
So it's cheating on both levels -- it's hard to believe.
What we see is Ireland, part of the great smell.
I actually felt it before.
These flowers aren't really necessary.
They're spreading amazing flavors, attracting any interesting insects.
This flower doesn't feel like it.
This flower actually feels very bad again, it's a progress, it looks like it's a corpse.
That's why he likes it.
He flew in and gave him a drink.
It's the White Sea. It's also called the Dead Sea.
I don't know what it tastes like to die, but this flower may feel very much like.
It's really scary.
It doesn't stop you from feeling bad.
Get in there, get in there one way.
It's a very good piece of meat, not knowing that there's no food here, but it'll die here, but at the same time it'll benefit, because it's broken and it's gone, it's raining to another flower -- it's amazing.
It's a marine plant, a European Ocean, a mother of the Black Sea, called the country's age.
This is what I did last week at Dosset.
This guy's getting hotter than the environmental temperature is about 15 degrees -- it's amazing.
If you look at it inside, it's a little bit like a large hole, it's drawn by heat -- it's a kind of chemical substance of the fungus, and the insects -- they're stuck under this container.
They're having sweet flavors, and then they're getting a little confused.
In the night they were covered with flowers, beneath them on top of them, and then the hard hair we saw on top turned into beads that made these flowers run away -- it's hard to believe.
If you think it's hard to believe, it's one of my favorites.
It's the spring of spring.
People from Brazil should know about this plant.
This is the most amazing thing.
It's about a mile long.
It has a capacity that I know no other plant has when it emerges -- it's the meat in the middle -- for about two days, it's caused some sort of change in taste, some like milk.
And there's no lungs, it's plant food, it's got a lot of things like green beans, to burn them at the speed of the lungs, burn them, thank you, run at about a small cat's speed.
By weight, it's two times the energy of the chicken -- absolutely amazing.
It's done something unusual.
Not only will it rise to 155 degrees, 43 or 44 degrees, two days, and it will remain warm.
There's a heat exchanger to keep warm.
Why do you want to do this?
Now you don't know, some insects like to share under this temperature.
They're in there. They're full of flowers.
(Laughter) The plants are full of flowers on them, let them go and feed them.
It's such a strange thing.
Now we think most of the mammals are insects, but actually in tropical areas, many species of birds and insects are also being pollinated.
Many of the warm flowers are red, which is because they're red and they look like us, we think it's very good to see red.
But if you look at the light, the bird and us, we see red, green and blue, we see this light.
The insects see green, blue and green lines, they can see all the dark outer lines.
There are some colors behind here.
"If we can see those colors," I heard you ask.
Yeah, we can see.
So what do you see?
Last week I took pictures of these desert resorts, half-day flowering in Dosset.
As we have seen, these are tiny flowers, all over the place.
It looks like it's under the light.
If it looks like it's going to be red.
Most monkeys don't feel red.
And then I put the outer ring on my head at a certain rate of time, and then I got this photo.
It's like a really weird heart.
Now we don't know what the bear sees at all, when I call it red, you know what I see.
We don't know what happened, whether it's insects or other humans' brains.
But it looks like it's probably that way.
It's another little flower -- located between different extraterrestrial frequency zones, different beads to match different transmitters.
It looks like it's probably like that.
To prevent you from thinking that all the blue flowers have this feature -- there's no damage to the flower in the film; just put it on three feet, and don't pull it down -- under the green light, look at this.
This could be the basis for the defense, because it works by absorbing radiation.
That's why some of its chemicals may be useful.
Finally, it's a night of smoke that Bjorn Rosslett sent to me from Norway -- a wonderful way of hiding.
I like this way of hiding.
I think it's very clever.
It's the main use of this kind of spell.
Of course, the Golden Star is a God of love and fertility. It's a flowering word.
Just as flowers have spent so much energy trying to attract predators to their invitation, they don't know why they have successfully convinced us that they contain rich inside us when we were born and born, especially when we were married, when you think about it, at this moment genetic material moved from one body to another.
Thank you very much.

On 26 July, the new Central Network reconvened electricity (Purity Newspaper) on 26 July, the Commission for Urban Development and Reform reported that the city had been robbed of 4404 people as a whole, representing 42.54 per cent of the population concerned.
This year, 53-year-old Levinian countries receive an interview from new netizens, who said that they were fishing in the Lung River, and when they were 11 years old, they were fishing with their father, fishing on a small boat, crossing the Red Sea, climbing back to the coast, and down to Long Beach. Each time they leave home, they spend about ten and a half months trying to keep their family alive.
Since 1997, however, as the rural population has increased in urban areas, the population of high-security cities has increased and environmental pollution has increased.
The Lung River border built paper factories, factories, plantations, and contaminated water.
By 2007, the Lung River had become a wastewater mine.
"All the fish caught are black and dark in the back."
The country said it was becoming increasingly difficult to fish after the river was contaminated.
Locally, large-scale hydropower management pollution has begun to occur, including clean, patrolling and water resources management, and so forth.
Literacy also recapitalised its people and became a member of the patrol team and maintained its water resources.
Since 1 January 2020, a total ban has been imposed on the urban areas of biosafety and related waters of the capital.
According to the data of the Commission on Urban Development Reform, as at present, the reconnaissance of 3403 recapitalised fishing vessels, 4643 recapitalised fishing vessels, 63.3 per cent of the three-year overall mandate respectively, 86.3 per cent.
A total of 42.54 per cent of the population was arrested by 4404 people.
Of the 4404 persons who have been arrested, 4267 persons have been employed and 96.89 per cent of the people who have been arrested.
Pension insurance guarantees cover 2691 persons, representing 61.10 per cent of the people who have been robbed.
The next step, the reconnaissance city will step in and step up specific restructuring operations to improve the use of the cross-border project cleanup, complete a new cycle into the river-dispersion census and conduct corresponding restructuring operations, essentially complete the "third" task (i.e. mining, mining and mining) as well as the improvement of the small water treatment process, the improvement of the specific actions of the two coastal forest-farms, strengthen the construction of the green mine, strengthen the illicit flow of lead, and strengthen the collection of the results of the illegal collection of the target areas, and further further progress in the prevention of the reunification of river basins.
Strengthening Israel ' s prevention response to vaccines in new networks
2020-07-26 04:56:44 Source: Daylight Journalist: King's Dream Editor: King's Dream
Strengthening Israel ' s prevention of recurrence of vaccines
The initial outbreak of the new lung epidemic is evident in Israel ' s prevention measures.
However, with the gradual prohibition of prevention measures, the number of new vaccines in recent Israel has increased significantly, and many urgent measures have been taken by the Government of Israel to strengthen prevention of infection.
On 28 February, Israel examined the first case of new lung cancer in its territory in order to quickly close all entrance gates, to suspend the informal sector, to turn schools into online courses, to restrict public transport and non-required social activities, to block serious urban outbreaks, and to maintain joint police control initiatives.
This series of measures soon had a positive effect, and by mid-May, the new Israeli case of tuberculosis had been reduced to a number of points.
As vaccines are controlled, Israel's prevention measures are fully dissociated, and since June the new vaccine has gradually increased the number of patients.
In particular after the entry into July, the spread of vaccines continued to increase rapidly.
In recent days there have been more than 8 days of new Israeli outbreaks each day, and as of 25 July, 916 new cases have been published.
As at 25 July, Israel had a genuine hospitalization rate of 59745 and 448 deaths.
Several times, the Government of Israel has taken urgent measures to strengthen prevention of vaccination.
On 6 July, after the serious outbreak of 30,000 cases of disease, the Government of Israel closed down health facilities, swimming pools, bars and nightclubs such as the General Assembly, while imposing restrictions on public transport policies to ensure that every passenger in public transport cannot be more than 20 persons.
On 17 September, the Government announced a series of new restrictive measures, including the implementation of the "compressive" measures, including the end of the week, which provided for the implementation of "citizens" for every 517 hours per week and 5 hours per week.
During this period, the public can leave, but shops, shopping centres, entertainment shops, libraries, libraries, animal gardens, museums, museums, museums, swimming pools and tourist attractions will be closed, and basic facilities, such as supermarkets and drugstores, will remain open.
At the same time, in all dates and times, more than 10 persons were prohibited from attending meetings, health facilities, workshops, restaurants and coffee shops would be closed, allowing for the provision of external services.
At the same time, the people of Israel did not pay sufficient attention to the seriousness of the epidemic and could not form an alliance with the Government in combating it.
After the Israeli outbreak of the epidemic, many people were on the street for street protests because of government control measures that affected their own economic interests.
On 11 July, over a thousand people conducted demonstrations in Traviv, which were considered to have an impact on the economy.
During the evening of the 21st night, thousands of protesters gathered before the funeral of Prime Minister Nathaniya Huu of Jerusalem, protesting the promulgation of the restaurant, and the prevention measures, such as the coffee house, were not compensated accordingly.
In addition, many people have also failed to comply with the requirements of the door-to-door operation, keeping the two-mile security society away from the door, so as to avoid punishment by the police for not carrying the door-to-door door, and many people simply carry the door-to-door or hang on their hands.
During the epidemic, schools were a major disaster zone for the spread of new vaccines and, according to the press, recent visits to the children ' s camps revealed that neither teachers and students in the youth camps were required to pay their fees, nor were they separated from each other by two-metre security societies and were covered by the virus for large numbers of teachers.
Professor Eli Waxman, member of the National Security Commission for Israel ' s Advisory Mission against Vaccination, believes that Israel is heading towards a " dangerous situation", noting that the measures taken by Israel at present are not sufficient to close all vacations, recreational places and summer schools to control the spread of vaccines.
Waksman stated that Israel was lacking a comprehensive plan for anti-emergency prevention and that Parliament and Government departments should reject their own interests as soon as possible and reach agreement on anti-emergency issues and take clear steps to develop measures, including related restrictions in the various sectors.
This is Tel Aviv 25 July. This is the newspaper in Tel Aviv, King.
Ninja was a strong farmer who could not afford to spend the day with his older children, and two people were sitting in the car from house to house with more than 20 students at the Chung Cultural University.
Even though these two years' walk is impossible, 77-year-olds are looking forward to "the three-and-a-five come here and play."
This is an invisible building in the state of the original city, which is different from that of the general agricultural house. It is also a beautiful and beautiful movie, handicrafts, traditional beads, beads, and so forth.
The Lord of the House called it "The Garden." It was a tree.
More than 10 years ago, he began to design a cultural university.
The cultural life of the villagers has become rich.
Newspapers haven't even gone to the university, and the song has been broadcast.
The choice of singing for our neighbors is that of the village village of Blyhhan.
She's been in love since she was a little girl, and now there's a little rage in the area, and as long as there's time for her, she'll come to the cultural college to play a show for her relatives.
Recently, Brilliant also played the network directly.
Brilliant said, "There's a stage where more people see their own performances, it's a very happy thing."
On the stage, the performer's face is one eye, the dancer's voice, even though he's still adorable, but he's never lost his enthusiasm.
As is the case with farm produce, the "garden" art and non-receptive culture are found outside the farm.
The University has also collected several years of agricultural equipment, with more than 300 materials, such as waxes, paper, paper and film.
The paper was moved to the hospital in which he showed the old things he had collected, the old wine, the three-pounded car.
Why does a normal farmer build a cultural university?
"The movie is my home art, and I've been learning this art since I was 15. "
In 2012, the University of Künchen culture was established as the first rural "non-material cultural heritage" in Ninsha, also a model museum for the protection of cultural non-material cultural heritage in the original city.
In addition to the Citizen Cultural University, there are over 120 Citizen Cultural Museums and 79 Citizens, of which there are over 50 large cultural universities, such as the Cunego Cultural University, the Royal Cultural University, the Cunego Cultural University, and all the towns and streets of the province, with over 5,000 visitors.
These farmers live in the middle of the countryside, enriching the cultural lives of the people and meeting their spiritual needs.
"As life progresses, traditional cultures cannot be reduced. "
"The "Treaty of the War" came back again and again to the "Course" to the "Creation of the "Creation" against the "Treature" team. "New York.
The 40th World War I will be held in Beijing on 16 July.
"Figure" has been translated according to actual fact-finding, and has been collected for years in the canals, the first Soviet military file to face.
In the drama, a popular performer, who is known for his "smoothing" performance, challenged an interesting "smoothing agent".
In recent years, the red-haired "faced" "aircraft" has proved to be the most powerful force in the world.
Unlike the previous war works, "Illust the world" and extend beyond the background of the story to the eastern part of the Soviet Union.
It was based on the final stage of the war on the day of the war in 1944, and described a story of the positive action of the Sudanese Far East Intelligence Agency, led by the Ministry of Forestry of the People ' s Republic of China and the head of the Sudanese Bureau of Intelligence.
In a number of battles, the man's head as a high-level interlocutor, one of which is a high-end, intelligent, mature perfect image.
But it seems that such a person is not fit to be a midwife, "I should be the one who can't find a child, if a place is such a very beautiful picture, can't all be interested in you, can't it?" "You don't come to me, I'm forgetting I'm a national party," and I'm going to be fine."
So, in the "consumption" he doesn't want to be a judge to design his master's dolls as a pleasant "meaning agent".
The other side of the "Victory" competition was created by the world's Prime Minister of Police, who was represented by the Japanese well-being and lily.
In the north of the south, two powerful players added a number of high-powered views to the entire drama.
The film was directed by the word "play" in the form of a play, "that's really a game, and they're both special silences, and that's very shocking to me. They're often "the present," for example, for example, we just wrote half-page length, and I don't stop when we film, and they can't always play."
It is not only possible to play between high-handed players, nor to lead players to games, but also when players are in their roles and guarantee their own personal status, not only can they play roles from a human point of view, but it can bring more visibility to the audience.
In the drama, you can also see a number of famous faces in the "Georgian Wars", three of the "Georgian F4" that were also included in the "Georgian War."
This time, the left-hand side of the flight was replayed.
"These two people are not so generous, they're just in that time, and they're moving along with the environment."
"We have to have a sense of self-esteem. This feeling is that people around me must be good, bad people are enemies, but we must develop them, and our troops must grow up."
The two of them were also carefully designed by the Journey Board, and he was confident that a satisfactory response would be given to the audience.
(Laughter)
Four of the students were killed. Officially, the incident was called a warning network in New York City.
During the 25th evening of July, the New York City government announced that four local students were unhappy with drinking water.
On 24 July, at 15.50 p.m., 110 of the Security Council of the United States of America received a warning that six primary school students were drinking water.
After the police were arrested, the local civilian police went to the scene for the first time, rescued two students, followed by the local emergency response agency, the water services unit, and participated in the rescue.
It was reported that the rescue site had been launched together by civilian security police, police officers, fires, hospitals, and 80 others who had been sent to continue their search for water through noise detection.
The journalists learned that the local rescuer had found the first victim student on 25 July at 6.40 p.m. and that the second victim was found at 11:30 p.m. and the third victim at 2540 p.m. and that the third victim had been identified at 12.40 p.m. and that the last victim had been found at 13.34 p.m. and that more than 4 were found dead by 120 emergency centres.
Officially, this time the flood struck a warning to the whole community.
At present, the local government-related sectors are preparing some knowledge on the prevention of floods and are hoping that the tragedy will not occur again.
On 25 July, the President of the Hong Kong Government Finance and Capital Office of Hong Kong stated that the financial market in Hong Kong remained active and functioning orderly.
He welcomed the financial stability and economy in Hong Kong.
At a web workshop organized by the Hong Kong Economic Trade Office in Toronto and the Portuguese Chamber of Commerce (Communication of Canada), 24 (Dorondo Time), it was pointed out that Hong Kong was experiencing a difficult situation because of "adjusted windfall" and new flu epidemics.
Port exchanges stable and preferable levels of assurance.
The banking system has no clear evidence of financial flows, in contrast with more than US$ 1 billion since June.
The total bank's savings have also continued to increase over the past few months, and the stock market has a series of open-source fund-raising activities and the market has improved.
It has been said that new vaccines have brought pressure on the global economic and financial markets, but the basic advantage of Hong Kong remains unchanged.
Many of the advantages of Hong Kong, including geographical, rule of law, high-speed communications, free flow of financial and financial information and simple low-tax systems, continue to be the leading international financial centre in Hong Kong.
It was pointed out that the Government of the Special Territory had set aside $600,000 million in "Fifth Prevention of Vaccination" and had established approximately 30,000 temporary posts in public and private areas in the coming two years, covering different skills and academics.
In order to support the development of financial technology, the Government has also launched "tillion plans" to fund local financial technology companies, creating other enterprises with financial technology-related operations to create 1,000 new positions for the recruitment of local and rich financial scientists in Hong Kong.
Looking forward to the future, let the universe express its optimism about the financial stability and economy in Hong Kong.
He encouraged Canadian enterprises to make good use of the advantages of Hong Kong and its status as the International Financial Centre, the International Centre for Assets and Riches Management and the World Trade Union for Foreign Peoples, and to develop and invest in the region of Ouagadougou and nearby areas.
China's immune efforts to encourage countries to learn new networks of experience
A 25-year-old newspaper of Yun-Shiang stated that China, as a country with a population of 14 million and a country similar to Europe or the United States, has been effectively controlled at this stage by new vaccines, without having had a wide range of spreads, which has largely been controlled by domestic vaccinations.
The article stated that, over a period of almost ten years, China has made considerable investment in domestic research and public health construction, which has made China's preparations for the new season more prepared for severe respiratory traction (SARS) than during that year.
It was stated that China was prepared at the start of the SARS strike in 2002, especially the disease virus cannot be identified.
When a new vaccine was discovered in December 2019, Chinese scientists quickly identified the strain of the virus, and on 11 January 2020 shared genetic data with the international community.
By the end of January, doctors from the mainland of China and Hong Kong had identified the virus as being asleep and warned the world of the threat of new vaccines by means of the research paper published on "Hungary".
China has also been at the top of the vaccination research and, in the state's state of emergency, through close cooperation within the country, such a study has been conducted very quickly and strictly, and the results of the early vaccination experiments developed by China were published in May and July, respectively.
China ' s experience shows that investment in national health and research systems is essential to the effective enhancement of laboratory capacity.
This is the basis for a rapid and effective response to health emergencies and global health security.
Other countries, in particular low-income and middle-income countries, are highly worthy of consideration and learning.
In addition, China's experience has shown that on a solid basis of research, there must be a strong and firm commitment to the scientific basis for correct decision-making, which has enabled new vaccines to be effectively controlled.
The article emphasizes the need for Governments and their leaders to respect science, to understand the value of science and to act on it in a way that is most beneficial to society.
In the early days of the attack, the National Security Commission of China sent three groups of HIV experts to the armed forces to investigate the risks and spread of new vaccines based on the decision of 23 January "The City of the Armed Forces"; the Government quickly made decisions and implemented rapidly when it presented the need for and urgency of construction hospitals; and the broad participation of communities and communities also gave swift control over vaccination.
The article concluded by stressing the need to strengthen global cooperation and joint response to global health emergencies.

The White Sea was detached from the New Network of Partyhood of the Ouija board of the Ouija board of directors of the Ouija board in the area of the Nemongogo Self-Government.
On 26 July, according to the IMO information contained in the IMO, the Commission of the Parties to the I self-government of Mongolia had previously approved that the IMO had conducted a standing review of the serious violations of the White Sea in the Baltic Sea by its former IMO.
Having been examined, the White Sea is a leading department of parties, with the idea of loss of belief and a clear violation of the principle of private ownership, against surveillance; the organization of the vision of desertification, the movement of work for other persons and the acquisition of other funds in the election of the Department; the economic collapse, the acquisition of large-scale interests of business enterprises, the right to trade in property; the deterioration of life and the adverse effects of corruption.
The White Sea is a serious violation of political discipline, organizational discipline, clean discipline, life discipline, as a crime of duty and is suspected of committing crime, corruption, and indiscriminateness, inhumanity, inhumanity, and sex should be dealt with seriously.
In accordance with the relevant provisions of the rules of procedure of the CCC, such as the " Monitoring of the People ' s Republic of China " of China, the Committee of the High Commissioner for the Non-Self-Governing Region of Mongolia considered and reported approval of the Committee of the Parties to the Self-Governing Parties of Mongolia decided to grant a division of the Party to the White Sea and adjust its treatment of its enjoyment; to collect its damages resulting from violations; and to transfer its alleged crime to the prosecution authorities in accordance with the law and to transfer the financial implications of the case.
At 25 p.m. local time, a small plane struck a multi-level housing building in Weser, Northern Germany, which resulted in the death of three persons.
The Duisburg prosecutor, the Wezner Police and the Wezner Fire Department jointly announced that on that night, at approximately 1440 hours a day, two small planes were attacked on the roofs of a three-person apartment building in a multi-story residential building in the town of Wezer-Kamp.
On that day, it flew from the town of Mal, in the district of Rull, in the north of Norway, to the airport of Wezer, and then toppled into the building.
The identity of the deceased or a woman's home and a small plane on which it was attacked.
A two-year-old child in the house was injured and rescued.
The rest of the house was not damaged in the accident, but the situation remained unabated.
The current picture of the DeNews Society reports shows that the houses of the accident were fired once and that firemen could see the damage of the houses after the fire.
At present, the cause of the loss of aircraft is unclear.
The "Leather Post" quoted the police as saying that there was a line of evidence that the plane or the building had been dissolved before the attack.
The police indicated that several parts of the missing aircraft had been found in the scene of the accident.
The German Criminal Police, together with the Duisburg Prosecutor, jointly investigated the cause of the incident by the Federal Aviation Investigation Agency of Germany.
On that day, journalists learned from the General Consulate of China in Düsseldorf that the hall had been contacted by the local police and the fire department, and that there was no Chinese civilian in the killings.
On 26 February, the Ministry of Health of Singapore announced that as of 12 p.m., Singapore's new new case of infectious diseases had been confirmed by 481 cases, 50369 cases had been reported and 27 cases had been reported.
Data show that in new cases of increased hospitalization, 5 of which are local community diseases, 4 of which are cases of admission, and the rest of which are foreign workers living in special accommodation.
The Ministry of Health of Singapore stated that 98 per cent of new cases of disease related to known infections.
There are currently 173 new patients treated in the hospital, most of which are stable or improved and no one is in the hospital.
In addition, 4648 persons were separated from community facilities.
Among Singapore's new infectious groups, the vast majority of foreign workers are.
According to statistics, there are 220,000 foreign workers living in 43 foreign workers' specialized premises and about 100,000 foreign workers live in other types of housing.
The Singapore Anti-Semitting Working Group had indicated that the Government of Singapore was intensifying the investigation into the most recent high rates of infection for foreign workers.
After the completion of the tests for all special premises, the vast majority of foreign workers will be re-worked, but they will still have to carry out a re-examination test regularly.
The big show "Giji" is on the Red Cross Web site.
On 18 July, the twenty-third international film series above the sea was published on the official list of the Golden Awards.
The first real-time real-time film "Gijoo Likes", led to the award of the film at the top of the show, while the video was officially released at the top of the screen.
The sea news. The camera.
The video "Gieu" is the first real-time material to lead the big show, and he's a second conclusion to the Golden Award.
The video told a story: A movie led to a surprise, returned to the rurals of the North East, and wished to make a family a film last year, which resulted in a series of accidents.
Family members gathered for filming completed the final meeting.
One of the members of this family — the "Third King" sitting in the center of the picture — is the background of the northern black land on the bank of the East Bank, which is the prospect of the Chinese harvest of the year.
It seems that the complex and complexity of this large family relationship has emerged, as it were.
It has been reported that, in addition to the "Third King" of Gjiu's daughter, the rest of the game was performed by real-time family leaders, video-tested videos, broken the play and real border, and brought to the audience a new visual experience.
According to a lead presentation, the creation of "Giju's will" came from "a day's purpose " , and during the film, the family was confronted with a series of changes that had to be made so that the original film plan had to be changed without the final recording of life in the comic book and the release of the pressure beyond the design.
How does the big show deal with this "heavenly will " and how should we continue to receive the kind of changes that have brought about this day's will?
There is no doubt that "Gieu's intention" is full of experience and that almost all-inclusive assumptions and innovative ways of listening will turn the life before the head into a movie, and under the true image package, audiences will also find a picture of themselves and the family in the video, as this family gathers together together in a series of thoughts.
NEWS. GOV.MO: The Centre for the Coordination of New Type-Hymph virus Research Statistics on Hotline Statistics (25 July 0800-26 July 0800)
From 25 July 2020 to 26 July, from 0800 to 0800, the search hotline for new anti-emergency vaccines should be adjusted to a total of 292 telephone calls.
With regard to 291 cases of vaccination, the representative of the relevant sector has been referred to as follows:
271 cases (including: investigation of separation; investigation of nuclear acid testing; investigation of both maps; health code; other.)
Security Police Department 17 cases (including: investigation of entry measures; investigation of entry measures for two Australian road vehicles; investigation of the hotline of the coastal authorities; investigation of the retention of documents.)
1 case of the Tourism Agency (including: research on the question of hotel separation.)
Education and Youth Council 1 (which includes: search for ways to find Australian students to return to England.)
1 case of the Marine and Water Agency (including whether it is necessary to report to the Sea and Water Agency on the need to access Hong Kong ports and the related matter of the testing of nuclear oxygen).
Bazaar's duty station and a warlord's duty station.
In this year's average temperatures below 10 degrees Fahrenheit [- 40 ° C], one simple room stands at the mountain gates, the camp is not far from the country's edge, the fighters are stationed in the air every day, and they need to go regularly to a higher location patrol.
The warriors climb up the rock floor and use their hands and feet.
The value of the season is low in July, when the low seas are full of vegetation, while in the bazaar there is only relatively dense green in the back of the camp.
At that point, six-year-old warriors pointed out that this was their backyard, which was only seven months old each year, and soon after all the snow was turned and snow covered.
It may take about nine hours.
In the harsh, high-rooted environment, the warriors who live here spend years with the snow and ice are also going on a regular journey to a higher mountain patrol.
A day ago, a patrol consisting of eight warriors, once again walked on the patrol under the leadership of the leader's lead.
Each soldier weighs about 30 pounds, and a big one goes up to the target point.
One of the combatants is on the way, and the war friends are on the way to rescue.
In addition to patrolling missions, combatants at the Bazaar are trained in tactical and physical training every day.
Over a few seconds, the sea level has increased, the ozone levels have increased, and the force has increased. These factors test the will of patrol personnel.
Their teeth are strong, they pass through several points, and they pass through a number of emergency situations.
At 16 hours it was a lunchtime for patrol crews who took their own food and sat on the beach for 5700 yards [5700 m], accompanied by snow and food supplements.
The fighters at the Bazaar are trained in tactical and physical training.
During the rest, they play cards together, the transporter's gonna make a dance, both fun and exercise.
After a short rest in the snow, they set up this patrol target point and took the flag out of the mountain gates and vowed.
It's Mount Mammon. They're just a few miles away. They're the safest guards in the country.
Beijing Consumer Reunification Network - New York
In accordance with the principle of "full reopening, focus planning, orderly progress, strict organization", Beijing's activities are relaunched.
On 26 July, 1.5 million political entrants were issued, including 1 million food purchases under the line, 500 million intellectual products and consumers were available in the Kyoto APP.
The Deputy Director-General of the Beijing City Trade Agency, Mr. Zhanging, presented a presentation at the press conference on 25 February that the post-reopened consumption season, based on the maintenance of existing consumer card preferential subsidies, would further reduce business funding.
Since August, government and business funding has now begun to be adjusted to 2:1, for example, if the original consumer has received a card to the store if it is available for 120 benefits, of which the government's subsidy is $60, the company's interest is $60; the government's subsidy is adjusted to $80, and the company's interest is $40.
During the period of consumption, three major operators will make around 5G consumption subsidies for flows and terminals, further promoting new Beijing 5G infrastructure and 5G consumption.
Zheobo means Hong Kong's economy has been repeatedly attacked because of the epidemic, calling for a new network of time-consuming borders.
On 26 July, the Director of the Finance Division of the Hong Kong Regional Government said on 26 July that Hong Kong was facing a new outbreak of tuberculosis in New York, where it was originally attacked by the resurgence of its capital business and economic activities.
The Government of the Special District once again called for the renting of large-scale small-scale enterprises and working time with retailers, food and small businesses.
A post entitled "Water's Way of Resurrection" was published on the Internet on Thursday.
He said that the recent New Hampshire case had a high number of cases, the situation was serious, the impact of social life, and the economic difficulties.
In response to the vaccine, the first is to make a serious contribution to the case and to treat and stop the spread of the virus at the earliest possible rate; economic activities should be restored when the vaccine is controlled accordingly.
He noted that, in the face of a new outbreak of TB, the former business of recovery and economic activity had been fought.
For the business community, social responsibility is equally important in addition to the contract spirit, especially those groups that have received substantial government subsidies in the "safety Employment Plan".
He said that the economic situation in Hong Kong was still very serious this year, but the situation seemed to slow down slightly.
On the export side, he felt that the situation outside Hong Kong was still serious.
Zhaobo said that the development process in Hong Kong over the past several decades has shown that every crisis has hidden new opportunities and every difficulty has hidden the keys to future development.
A couple of years ago, a winter morning in Johannesburg, South Africa, when I was driving to work, I found the city was flooded.
I'll drive there almost every day, but this time it's very unusual, I've never seen such a vision before.
Johnnesburg has no special inter-day ID on it, but it's almost invisible that morning.
I soon realized that what I saw was a serious shock caused by air pollution.
The beautiful environment I've known since, and the contrast between the skyline that I've known so far, I can't breathe in my heart.
I'm worried there's a possibility that the ever-changing sun will be covered with dark clouds.
At that point, I felt a strong urge to do something, but I didn't know what to do.
All I know is that I can't stand that way.
The biggest challenge is, I don't know environmental science.
I'm a computer engineer, and I'm very sure I can't rely on code to solve air pollution.
What kind of identity am I going to solve this problem?
But I'm a little town girl.
In the next few years, I've learned a very important lesson, and if we want to achieve a better future, we should all keep this lesson in mind.
Even if you're not an expert in some special area, your professional skills may also include ways to solve the problem in that area.
Sometimes, you have a unique perspective that can trigger a very regular thinking about the situation around you, but you need to take a big step to try.
It's the only way you can know the results.
What I knew was, if I wanted to try to change, I had to know enough about pollution first, so I made another student.
I've done some basic research, soon to understand that air pollution is the world's greatest environmental health risk.
The World Health Organization data show that in 2012, almost 14 per cent of deaths worldwide were caused by family and surrounding air pollution, particularly in low-income countries.
The mortality rate caused by air pollution every year is higher than malaria and AIDS.
In Africa, unsafe health conditions resulting from early deaths or malnutrition caused by children appear to be inexplicable before air pollution, while it also brings huge economic costs: according to economic cooperation and development organizations statistics, expenditure relating to 2013 exceeds $40 billion.
In my work, I've been looking for the results of human science, including human and machine-related socio-economic relationships, finding useful enough points and helping us make better decisions.
When I think again about how to manage air pollution, things become clear, we need to find a better way to make decisions, taking into account the great issue, and co-operation is very important.
So I decided to meet some people working in this area.
I started an official dialogue with Johannesburg and other nearby cities, and I joined the local scientific community, and I also phoned people who were totally dependent.
These experiences I've been involved have helped me to understand this more deeply.
And it's also helping me to avoid my people trying to update my career, and sometimes they're going to fall into the trap: quickly use a technique before they're really having problems.
I'm starting to think. What can I do to improve this situation?
I started to ask myself, how could I effectively integrate my knowledge skills in software engineering and human engineering and the professional skills of people I contacted?
I want to create a platform for air quality management in line, to reveal future pollution trends, to predict the consequences that might happen.
I'm sure my idea can be a real solution, but I also face uncertainty, and I can't guarantee it's definitely successful.
What I have is a set of specific engineering skills that I have already acquired from my work. (Laughter) Of course, my skills for those who have been working in the field of air pollution for many years are completely new.
I gradually realized that sometimes a new perspective, a new set of skills, can happen something wonderful.
Our will and imagination is a light to guide us through the obstacles and open up a new chapter.
I have more insight into the issue of air pollution, found weather pollution data for the last ten years, as well as weather data for Johannesburg and around.
This software can analyse history and real-time data to reflect the trend towards pollution over time and space change.
We then use the new machine to learn technology in the next few days to predict future pollution.
This means that people can make better decisions about their daily schedule and where they live and where they live.
We can predict adverse incidents of pollution, define serious sources of pollution, and allow relevant authorities to decide to adjust their operational activities.
By planning additional circumstances, how to improve infrastructure, such as housing in industrial areas, urban planners can make better decisions.
We've established a first test of that technology, run 120 days, covered all South Africa.
Our expected results have been confirmed, and our forecast data and our field data have shown a close relevance.
Through our management, we introduced the world's leading wetlands, predicting the quality of the atmosphere, its analyticality and correct rate were unprecedented, so that I could benefit from the early winter mornings of the city I entered. Then I said to myself, "Some things are wrong, I have to do what I want."
So, the focus is: what if I didn't do it in the first place?
What if I don't care about the state's environmental situation but send hope to some places, some other people take care of these things?
What I've learned from the middle is that when we're doing our best to advance one of the things we're convinced of, it's very important to be concerned about the possibility of success and consider the consequences of not being a cause.
We should not focus on opposition and harassment, it should move us to go further.
So no matter where you are in the world, the next time you find out something interesting about your life, it's excited, and it's about what you're thinking, you have some crazy or brave ideas, even if it's not your professional area, ask yourself: Why don't you try?
Why don't you go ahead and solve the problem?
Maybe you'll be happy with the accident.
Thank you all.
(Applause)
This year's largest earthquake in the eastern Taiwan Sea
On 26 July, the New York Stock Exchange was distributed in the east of Taiwan, at 2052 hours, at a maximum of 6.1 hours, at a maximum level of 4 levels, with a full range of shocks, which is the largest global earthquake this year.
The media, such as the ETtoday Newspapers, reported that the earthquake was 86.5 km south of the Government of East Ireland, namely the east coast of Taiwan, and 53 km deep.
The Chinese earthquake network has identified this earthquake as 5.5.
The largest earthquakes in all of Thailand are: the 4th grade of the flowers, the 4th floor of Ireland, the east of Thailand, the South tower, the 3rd floor of the jungle, and other markets of the area.
The Taiwan Weather Service noted that this earthquake has been the largest since this year and that there has been no type of earthquake on the board border, which has always occurred in the past and has been more active since this year.
In the next week, there are still more than four-level remnants.
Many people think that driving is one thing that only those who can see can do.
The blind want to drive a car that is so safe as to be seen as an impossible mission.
All right, I'm Dennis Hong, we designed a car designed for the freedom and independence of the blind, and for those with visual barriers.
Before I talk about the car used by this blind man, let me simply say another project I've done is called the U.S. High Research Plan for Urban Challenges.
It's about making a self-contained car.
You start by pressing the key, you don't touch anything anymore, it can reach its destination completely automatically.
At the 2007 challenge, our team won $5 million, the third one to win the game.
About that time, the National Blind Association, or the Blind Association, presented challenges to the design team about who could design a vehicle that would make blind people independent of safety.
We think we're gonna try it out, 'cause we think, uh, where's this going to be?
We already have a car.
We just let the blind get in the car, it's not over, is it?
But we don't trust each other.
It's not a car that can contain blind people's noise, it's a blind person's initiative to make choices and steal.
So we have to leave everything we've had to do from the beginning.
To test this crazy idea, we've designed an original car for testing its feasibility.
In the summer of 2009, we invited many blind young people throughout the country and gave them a chance to breathe in this car.
It's definitely a cold experience.
But the problem of this car is that its design is only to allow the blind to stay in a very limited environment, like a closed car stop -- even on a small road with red traffic.
So this success, we decided to take an important next step, to create a real car that can drive on the real road.
So how does it work?
Well, it's a relatively complex system, but let me explain, just simplify.
We have three phases.
We've got emotional phases, we've been calculating phases and non-visual interfaces.
It's obvious that there's no vision for the hunters, so the system needs to know the environment and collect data for the hunters.
That's what we're using the initial measurement component.
It measures faster, faster-- like a human ear, Nether.
I'm putting this information together with the Global Positioning System to predict the location of the vehicle.
We're also using two cameras to find out how to drive.
We're also using three radiation detectors.
It stimulates the visualization of the environment to detect obstacles -- from the front, from the back, from the back of the vehicle, and there are any obstacles on the road, any obstacles around the vehicle.
All the information from the sea was collected into the computer, and the computer did two things.
First of all, one thing is to process information to understand the environment -- which are road roads, which are obstacles -- and turn it into information for drivers.
This system is also very intelligent and can be the safest road.
We can also issue instructions on how to operate vehicles.
But the problem is, how can we transfer information and instructions quickly and accurately to the blind to ensure that he can recover?
To that end, we designed a lot of different non-visual user interface technologies.
The first three-dimensional sound system, the amplifier, the voice of the wheel, the legs, even the feet.
But today we're talking about three types of non-visual user interface technology.
The first face is called a handcuff.
It's a handbag, it's an engine component in the department, so you can transmit instructions -- direction and magnitude.
Another device is called a speed striker.
This car seat-- actually, it's a mojo seat.
We're putting it out, we're reorganizing elements of different modes, we're sending them information about speed transfer, and there's also how to use oil doors and trucks.
Here, you can see how the computer understands the environment.
This is sensitive data, which is transmitted from sensor to computer.
So these two equipment, handcuffs and speed shocks, are very effective.
But the problem is, these are instructions.
So this isn't really freedom, is it?
The computer tells you how to drive-- turn left, turn right, speed up, drive.
I'm calling it a vice versatility problem.
So we're avoiding the command signal device, and we're more interested in the information device.
A typical example of this non-visual information interface is called space map.
Let's see this as an indicator of the blind.
It's a small desk, there's a lot of roofs on it, and it's off the inside, so it can be described as a picture.
So even if you're blind, you put your hands on it, you can feel the road and obstacles.
In fact, you can also change the frequency released in the air, which may also have temperature.
It's actually a multi-user interface.
Here, you can see left, right-hand picture heads, and how the computer analyzes and transmits this information to the map.
So, we're showing a simulation process, a blind man is using an airplane.
This process is very helpful for training the blind and quickly testing different concepts on the basis of different types of non-visual user interfaces.
That's how it works.
But this car is a model car, and it won't be on its way unless it's proved as safe as it is now.
I'm really sure this will happen.
But is it social, can they accept this positive idea?
How do we handle insurance?
How are we going to print a photo?
There are many different obstacles behind technical challenges that we need to deal with before we really become reality.
Of course, the main purpose of this project is to design a car of blind people.
But what's more important than this is the great value contained in the sub-products of this project.
It can be used to pass through the dark, raining sensors.
And in this new face of this kind, we can use these techniques to provide them with more safe vehicles for visible audiences.
Or for blind people, household appliances on a daily basis -- education facilities, office facilities application services.
Imagine, at the classroom, the teacher writes a note on the blackboard, and blind students can also use these non-visual interfaces to understand and read what the teacher wrote.
It's very precious.
Today, what I'm showing everyone is just a start.
Thank you very much.

Marinicev said that changes in value were affected by lubricants and vaccines.
He said, "The service costs are increasing.
Because of vaccination, more time is being spent on the Internet. "
Malinicoff does not exclude annual internet prices from high prices and believes that operators can provide higher speeds and more services to compensate people for price fluctuations.
The Chinese doctor has been filming the anti-Hungary Web.
In recent days, Chinese filmmakers, with respect for the anti-mung hero, led by the leader of the Bona Chamber of Commerce in winter, conducted a conversation on the production of the film of the anti-mungal film "Dictor of China".
Bona's film industry hopes to be awarded by "Cinine Doctors" to all the doctors who fight in the field of immune control, who are honored by their profuse workers!
In 2021, the film will be publicized as a national celebration of the 100th anniversary of the dedication of China's Communist Party.
Currently, Bona's film industry is being deployed under the arrangement of the Ministry of Public and National Film Office, and with the support of the Film Office of the Ministry of the Interior and the Film Office of the Ministry of Justice of the North Sea, the head of the organization of the film "Chief of China" is a Chinese doctor who is a strong leader of the party, and the National People's Union is committed to combating new antipsychosis.
The video collection of anti-Fraud vaccines will provide a human background for armed medical personnel and municipal paramedics from a human point of view, using unique symphonies and highly shocking head language, as well as a full range of sensitive stories of Chinese medical personnel who are dedicated and self-sacrifice.
It is understood that during the first time on the day of the arms embargo, Bona’s company was faced with serious difficulties, sending out a group of in-depth vaccination lines, and sharing information with hundreds of medical staff, and collecting information, which has now been visited by the first person in the city of Ninun, the General State Support Army, the Führen Banking Hospital, the U.S.A., the U.A. Hospital, the U.S.A., and the first whites of the anti-Ministerial Hospital, as well as the U.S.
In this meeting, the House of Lords had also expressed hope and hope for films: " I hope that you will not only visit a number of experts on your head but also visit more medical personnel who are suffering from a single line, most of whom are " .
He said that he had seen "Me and my grandfather" Chief of China before," and he thought it was good to talk about the story of Great Britain in general.
"There are now some foreign friends who still have some misunderstanding with China. "
In talking about the release of the video, Mount Nunu stated that some people outside the country are interested in politicizing the signs of politicization on the virus, and he hoped that the film could move the audience from a human perspective: " This film would be better displayed outside China than it could be in a way that everyone outside the country could understand and that it would move the audience with the true human spirit. "
In the middle of the 80th century, it was so many years ago that I was the deepest impression I had ever seen in the post-retirement film or in the middle of the year, when friends of doctors outside my country were crying, and if "the Chinese doctor" could play such a role, it would be amazing."
The people of Mount Nun said that if "the doctor of China" could lead to a common audience outside the country, that would be very successful.
In the dialogue, the people of Mount Nun shared their views and recommendations on current international vaccine prevention, " I believe that people are always smarter than the virus. "
San Francisco stated that although it is difficult to predict the virus, from the original society to the present, mankind has been exposed to thousands of risks, and today's society has developed medical technology and social management measures, as well as medical personnel around the world, and even hundreds of people have a basic understanding of the scientific response to new epidemics, and people will no longer be moved "to look at both aspects of the work, to examine how the world has been strengthened by increased cooperation and to focus on the comfort of the hearts of people."

A red boat model, an East-West-Speech painting, an amplification of artificial and ever-changing works... was opened on July 25, 2020, at the South Sea Red Tourism Cultural Festival.
As one of the topical activities, the first red culture industry exhibition will be held at the tourist consultancy centre throughout the mountains.
In the area of exhibitions, red-eating products, and old-fashioned Turkish products such as the Revolutionary Region, led to the purchase of all visitors.
" This Red Cross is an exhibition of the results of the national red culture industry, as well as a tour unit and business exchange experience to explore an important platform for development. "
The Director of the Committee of the First Committee of the Red Cross introduced the theme of the Red Cross, which was "The Reinforcement of Red Cultural Assistance" for a total of 3,000 square metres, and set up around-the-ground construction areas and exhibition areas, as well as the area of the Red Road Network.
An invitation was extended to Ouija board, to participate in eight foreign municipalities, such as Chiangani, and to 137 companies in my province, Sasha, Zhuang, Zhao, and Zhao, including 768 exhibitions, including red arts, crafts, food goods, travel routes, red training courses, red food creation products, etc.
The destruction area will be held until 29 July.
As head of the Red Cross, we're looking for a bright spot.
The head of the exhibition area reported that the exhibition was divided into a two-part red industry and a two-part red culture industry development.
There are 31 exhibitions of six companies, such as WAY, WAY, TY, and nearly 200 products of 27 units, including red culture industry development books, red line food, red line products, and red line products.
A number of visitors were attracted to handicraft and cutting art in the comfort zone.
The Director of the Municipal Tourism Agency for Delayen described this visit as a very good choice for the two-year extension of the quality of red wine products, 16 of which are the best products for the 2019 national red wines.
At the same time, they invited national-level non-material cultural heritage protection projects " Ansecut paper", "Northern People's Song" and project-level non-permanent film promoters, focusing on the promotion of anchovy products, and taking advantage of this opportunity to interact with other community-based enterprises and promote cross-regional cooperation.
New Japan has more than 30,000 cases of infectious diseases on the New York Network.
According to statistics, 26 Tokyo has added 239 new cases of infectious diseases, and more than 200 new cases of each 6-day growth have been reported to be totaled by 11214.
In addition, there are 141 cases of cancer, 90 cases of cancer, and 80 cases of cancer.
In the first half of the year, the telecommunications network has grown to seven times as high-end-in-news.
On 26 July, the new Central Network was charged with fraud by 58101 persons by national prosecutors in the first half of the year, with 35 per cent increase, according to information from the top of the website.
In particular, in terms of prevention of infectious crime, fraud is rampant, and the prosecution authorities have prosecuted 43.4 per cent of all persons involved in the prevention of immunization.
The Supreme People ' s Prosecutor ' s Office is guided in a targeted manner, with a total of 9 cases of fraud in which 10 cases have now been published.
From the first half of the year's trial, there has been a number of names relating to fraud, up to national macro-political policies, down to hundreds of years of age, including prostitution, "medical" fraud, "healthcare" fraud, "citizenism" fraud, "road fraud, national subsidies fraud, national assets freeze, etc., and a growing "new" presentation", including education, medical, employment, old age, social security, land degradation, extreme poverty, financial credit, not only causes economic losses but also serious economic social development.
In particular, some telecommunications networks break down national borders, restrictions on areas and personnel, including public, cross-border, distance, electronic payment characteristics, non-specific groups of victims, are at great risk.
For example, there are specialized companies that hire high-quality writing buildings, create multiple departments or offices, use legitimate network platforms to advertise, recruit, train and evaluate recruits, use business operating models, and wear "legal outer garments", which are more complex.
It is the responsibility of the prosecutor ' s body to provide timely warnings to the public and relevant sectors in accordance with the law for the punishment and prevention of crime.
In the case of the judiciary, the Prosecutor ' s Office is committed to carrying out its duty to maintain a high-pressure attitude towards fraud and to promote social governance through law enforcement initiatives, such as through the development of prosecution recommendations.
The Prosecutor ' s Office has seriously arrested, prosecuted facts of fraud, evidence, procedural and legal implications, which are based on the fact that it is legally binding and unconstitutional.
In particular, in the case of cybercrime, focusing on the central role of electronic data in real-time identification, efforts to build electronic data, verbatim evidence, and evidence link between documents.
In the case of an intrusion case conducted by the Prosecutor ' s Office of the Mining district of Minbo Province, the prosecutor ' s body was first introduced and concluded from the case for only five days, reflecting the spirit and determination of the Council's stability.
In reviewing the arrest and review of the prosecution circle, focusing on the prosecution of the perpetrators of the case, correcting the arrest of 733 persons by the Public Security Agency, and correcting the disappearance of 1113 persons by the Public Security Agency.
In the first half of the first year, the National Prosecutor ' s Office issued 298 prosecutorial recommendations on fraud, promoting joint prevention of fraud and promoting deep-level governance.
For example, the communications companies found in the case, the Bank, the Inter-Agency Organization, etc. in the TT network regulation, the Public Prosecutor ' s Office in the province of Pratto, the City of the East City Prosecutor ' s Office, and the Office of Public Prosecutors in the East, urged the units concerned to strengthen their control and to improve their mechanisms to help build an effective system.
The fourth is doing a good job of tracking damage.
The prosecution authorities are involved in the investigation of evidence guidance, review of the key elements such as prosecutions, encourage the investigating authorities to actively pursue payments, work together with the relevant sector to track losses and strive to minimize the economic losses caused by fraud to the population.
In the case of a case of a certain set of rentals in the Beijing City Prosecutor ' s Office, the case relates to a 22 series of property round-the-clock checks, where the property may have been previously disposed of by other cases, to the Court of First Instance and to the Court of First Instance's recommendation that the Court of First Instance suspend the execution of the property in question and make the best efforts to recover the property in question and recover the loss of the victims.
The prosecutor reminded everyone that there must be a high warning against fraud, that we should not expect "the sun to set on fire," or that we should not think that it is easy to believe and keep our "money bag".
The town of Winnipeg, U.S.A., had planted a tree and spread out a new network in the middle of poverty.
2020-07-26 11:42:58 Source: China Economic Network Author: Juvenile responsibilities editor: Juvenile
The Chinese economic netizens went to the town of Winnipeg, U.S. state.
On a hard day, the villagers were faithfully sowing in the ground, although red on their faces, but few of the lyrics were sung from time to time.
In the town of Vingin, where there is a low level, sea level, enough light, a high temperature of summer, high sugar and a certain reputation in the surrounding area, but also because of a small, small amount of money that has not been sold at a high price and cannot constitute a size of industry.
The city was a poor town with a "floating ocean basin", with a local poverty rate of 25.8 per cent over the last 10 years.
During the crucial period of forced entry into the fight against poverty, changes in traditional cultivation habits, adjustments in industrial structures and increases in agricultural income are under way.
After several visits, a team in the Citizen Committee found that industrial development could no longer go on its way.
To that end, the town of Zhao introduced a mining company to modernize the production of fruit.
Vienna, Deputy Director-General for Agricultural Limited Construction, came from the city of Zhaoshi in 2015, looking at local farming conditions from 2016 to 2016.
In the beginning, Leigh was moved by the faithful movement of the land into the orchards, and the faithful women of Leigh committed the harvest in the heart of the village: "The fruits of so many years have been produced, and no one in the village has ever seen the fruit of the village. "
"The fruit of every tree is a fruit of perpetuity, and it will not grow too high. "
It is not surprising that Leigh did not realize that this plant had adopted a new method of planting the fruit, that the water flow flowed down every fruit tree, that the water and fat flow into the tree, and that when the fruit was grown, the trailer opened the garden directly, where the fruit could be harvested.
At the present time, the fruit base has gradually entered the breeding period, and the market has not been sold, as expected, but has been loved by urban consumers such as Beijing, the Far East and the Far East.
The growing fruit industry has made new changes in Leigh's life, although still on the ground, income has become a new source of income.
Leigh's loyal men transferred more than nine land flows to the fertile ground, and each year, in addition to the low land flow, there was a share of the benefit, and their spouses usually worked in the base, "each can earn $80 a day and they can work every year".
Leigh told reporters that last year's profit was over $2800, plus land transfer and income from work income for his wife and more than $80,000, "the day of health is over."
"It has now been effective for over $15 million, about 10 times as much as a single fruit. "
There are only 6,000 tons of fruit in the Central Sea villages, covering 4056 houses and 177 million people, including 656 homes in the Carica poor, 2952 people, and over $6 million in a year for the distribution of wages.
Leigh, who was encouraged every day by the box, also began to achieve his "will."
This year's agricultural holiday, Lee bought a more wild car, such as today's driving down the car, "there are ten more land in the house, the next step to the growth of the fruit base, and the whole stream to them, and the income is increasing."
Economic Journal -- China's economic netizens, chumps, cows, new king.
The new network in the "Effectives" section of the detached technology.
Deployment of technical assistance to break the "heat effect"
New Type of Mix Basic Equipment Technology Index
This report is a report from the news media: The University of Petroleum Environment and Bioenergy has recently made significant progress towards "the capture of carbon dioxide by depletion law" and has successfully developed new combination-based preparation technologies, with a significant increase in carbon capture capacity.
The results have been published as an international periodic article on greenhouse gases: science and technology.
The "green effect" is a major environmental problem for human development, and carbon dioxide emissions are the cause of "green effect".
How effective capture and use of carbon dioxide is the concern of scientists.
"Separation Law" is a new emerging carbon capture technology which, with the help of lead materials, separates carbon dioxide from efficient gases and operates a simple feature.
How to make the material "inhalation deep breath" more efficient than the gas separation factor is the problem of carbon dioxide capture using the depletion law.
The Scientific Group of the University of Petroleum explores the impact of different pesticides on greenhouse gas segregation through re-examination.
The results of the test showed that N-M-M-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-A-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-A-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-A-A-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-A-A-C-C-C-A-A-A-C-C-C-C-C-A-C-C-C-C-A-C-C-C-A-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-A-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-A-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-A-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C--C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C--C-A-C-C-C-C-C-C--C-C--C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C---------A-C-C-C-C-C--C-C--C-C------C------------------------------------------------------------
With such new technology equipment, the combination of the basics, carbon dioxide segregation, can approach the theoretical delimitation of present-day material.
" The new technology has provided new ways to obtain carbon dioxide from depletion law. "
" We hope that such technology will provide strong support for future combustion plants and manufacturers to deal with greenhouse gases and play an important role in controlling greenhouse gas emissions. "
Before it's done, we'll find out what professional differences are in the new network.
2020-07-27 02:22:36 Source: Reinforced Newspapers: in Qao responsibilities editor: in Qao
Before it's done, I'll find out what the professional level is.
Each year, students or parents who do not know the names of those involved in the voluntary declaration are required to make their voluntary contributions.
This year, Beijing University of Transport, Beijing University of Technology, Beijing e-mail, Beijing University, Beijing University, Beijing University, Beijing University of 5th University of Business, released a 2020-year-old reception policy to eliminate professional misconduct.
What does it mean at the professional level, and what is the significance of voluntary submission?
Three methods of professional distribution
The expert recalled that prior to the voluntary publication, there must be a detailed reading of the "Inventory of Heart Schools", understanding the rules of entry for higher education, including the percentage of the transfer, the rules of professional distribution, etc.
The rules of professional distribution, which mean that after high-school storage, are mainly professional priorities, a number of priorities, and three different methods of professionalization.
The way high school is specifically used will be clear in the "Constitution Charter".
However, there are also some principles of higher education that are a general priority and there is no discrepancy between professionals.
In other words, it would be considered in accordance with the overall order of the acquisition, when the number did not reach the first professional voluntary acquisition line, to see whether the second professional voluntary acquisition line had been reached, until the last professional will had been obtained and the number had not been established between the various professional volunteers.
The so-called "professional failure" is one or several sub-values published under the Recital to determine the recruitment of different professional volunteers, which is "professional failure".
It is also the difference between the first professional will and non-primary will of the school, and the number of inter-professional differences, such as 3 minutes, 2 minutes and 1 minutes.
For example.
The assumption that students were given a high level of A and 560 and their professional will was taken into account separately: computers, international trade, automation, mechanical engineering, electronic commerce, A higher level of professionalization, and a 2-minute difference of 1 and 1-minute.
In the course of professional distribution, if the first professional will be informed of the requirements for professional acquisition and the planned balance of professional acquisition, the latter will be taken into the "computer" profession; if the computer is not acquired, his sub-assembly will be reduced by 2 per cent, and the first professional will be awarded a "International Trade" review of the results of 558 per cent and determine whether the conditions of acquisition are met; if the third professional will still fail to meet the requirements (i.e. 557); if the third professional will is not met, the sub-assembly will be reduced by 1 per cent (556), and if the second will not be withdrawn by the fourth profession, follow-up will not be reduced if the professional will is still not met, such an increase.
Different levels of vocational disparity at different universities
With the universality of the same will, many high schools have now eliminated professional ills, but some of them have retained this method this year, which has been published by the schools, with more than 20 universities established professional ills this year.
For example, the University of Qiao Agricultural University, the University of San Francisco, the University of Medicines in Montenegro, the University of Apology, the University of Xiao, the University of Medicines, the University of Medicines, the University of North America, the University of Medicines, the University of South China, the University of Industry, the University of Ninsha, the University of Santuary, the University of Applied Sciences, the Institute of Civil Aviation in China.
In these high schools, there is a difference between the professional level of each university.
Some high-level schools are located at different levels in each profession, such as the University of Ninsha, where the case has been submitted to the school's examiner, and according to the order of the examiner's will to be completed by one minute after a series of series.
Some universities have established different levels of professionalism among different professions.
For example, at the University of U.S. University, the total vacancy rate is 4 per cent, i.e. the first professional will is 3 per cent different from other professional wills, the other professional will is considered to be equivalent and the other professional will is 1 per cent different.
When completing the wish, both parents and parents must carefully read the school ' s education policy and see if there is no professional discrepancy and how the different forms are, and at the same time taking full account of the number of selected schools and professions, as well as a reasonable analysis of the number of selected schools and professions, and if the school is clearly adopted by differential methods in the entry into force of the entry into force of the constitution, consider the degree of selection among the professions and increase the number of recruitment rates.

The three-year-old girl in Belgium died of New York's virus infection.
On 24 April, the Belgian health sector said that a 3-year-old girl died of a new vaccine, which was the youngest of the patients in the country.
Budwin Kathrí, a spokesman for the Belgian health sector, said that this girl had suffered other serious diseases before the new vaccine; in addition to that girl, there was recently another 18-year-old death from the new vaccine.
Kathrí said 85 per cent of the new number of patients under the age of 60 was new in Belgium last week.
He reminds us of physical health and does not let the younger people down.
" While young people die of new viral infections are rare, no one has immune powers now. "
Last week, Belgium's new case of tuberculosis increased by 89 per cent compared to the previous week, with an average daily death of 2.9 people per day from new HIV infection and an increase of 1.7 per day during the previous week.
