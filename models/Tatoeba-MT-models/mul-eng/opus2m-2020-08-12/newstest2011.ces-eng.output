What are you doing? ČSSD in Prague doesn't know Voldemort or sugar
The new head city of the ČSSD will have to, in all likelihood, have a certain language barrier to understand their ODS senior colleagues in the Prague Council and representative.
Today Currently.cz members of the new board of the ČSSD "tested", as they know the notorically introduced slang that occurred at the workshop over the last few years when Prague ruled the current coalition partners.
The coded dictionary, which was introduced by the Persian political conquistadore during the previous era of primator Paul Béma, describes some of the most famous positions, situations, and causes in the metropolis.
Surprisingly, the new concept of work has been misunderstood.
At least they say it.
"Who's Voldemort?"
"I really don't know."
"I'm in Prague's politics you're making money," he responded to the test of "kmotrovsk" dictionary for Lukáš Kucký culture.
And when it comes to the political veteran, he reacted to the work of Karel Brézin.
Maybe on the concept of golf jacket.
"It's the only expression you're suggesting to me that I use sometimes."
"I don't usually know the slang."
From the dictionary, whose expressions of the daily Current.cz published this year in June before the ODS elections, she chose the edition of six examples, especially those that were notorically connected with the Prague Master.
Sociologists were supposed to explain the concepts "Voldemort", "the biggest golf course in Prague", "to go to the sugar shop", "to the village", "to the capital city" and "to the top."
Three of the workers agreed with the Swiss, fourth - Antonín Weinert, who has a future head of the Polish school - first signed a conversation, but later he has not taken a phone.
The five-year-old Petr Dolinek refused the same test.
"I'm not going to solve these things at all, and I'm not going to appreciate how the citizens of democracy are doing."
"I now decide how we will understand within our programmes," he replied.
As already noted, Mr. Lucas Kucky would hardly have known in the title above that it is about influential businessmen and friends of the expressionist Béma Roman Janoušk.
"Voldemort" has nothing to say to Kuckey, and the only term he has correctly calculated in the test is "the largest golf course in Prague".
"It's a White tunnel," says Kucky, and then he adds, "but I know it better than the news."
"I'll have to pay for some language course," he jokes.
The golf course then as a channel Blanca directly decrypts not only the carel Brézin metador, but also works for the living environment Lukaš Plachy.
Both social Democrats then know who is really Voldemort, and Lukaši Plachima is aware of where to find this position - the meaning of the expression "go to the sugar" .
"I mean going to some Prague company," is the Plachy near the solution that it's about the seat of Janoušk's companies.
In harmony with Bresin, he recalls that he was more interested in knowledge than in using such a dictionary.
In social democracy, according to the test frequency, there is no similar dictionary of slang expressions.
"I've been working with my colleagues, but it looks like we really don't have anything like this."
"We call ourselves more names, sometimes short names and confused names," says the President of the Prague ČSSD Petr Hulínski, whose guests admire Hilda.
"At school I was told by Bríza, but I don't know if my colleagues call me that," confessed Karel Brézin to his own admirer.
The current day.cz name has tried and works.
Weinert's work is for the site Grandfather or less friendly Grandpa, representative of Miroslav Poche, who warned him before the elections of the sponsorship of the party, has in some colleagues a review of "Player".
The reviews are also the only thing that social democracies can do in domestic languages.
Hulynský prī Huldu does not like to hear it, but the daily Current.cz also noted another look of this Prague President.
"Doctor of the law of clothing" recalls that Petr Hullinski received his title JUDr. at the Bratislav police academy.
The government wants to limit the torture of "the witch", published the brochure
Women reported in Burkina Faso as witches have several common signs.
More to older generations, they cannot engage in work, for example for health reasons, are free and have no children.
The one who is sent by the monster is sent into isolation so that she does not threaten the rest of the village.
"This man's only gonna get very weird."
"Even young healthy women are not responding because they are helping with work and children," says a number of sisters who are in the capital of the West African state of Burkina Faso in a special home for more than a hundred women whose communities have grown up in their ranks.
The local government has now decided to step up its fight against unusual "social measures".
She published an information brochure that should help her to limit the occult.
But he's got a knife.
"More than 70 per cent of adults in Burkina Faso are unable to read," warned the failure of the written journal Die Standard.
The charge of witchcraft is also common in other African countries.
In Ghana, where Burkina Faso is a neighbor, Amy Hemma died two decades ago, after her three wives and two men were tortured, burned with oil and burned.
The BBC server reported the case.
Pachatlers claim that there was an unhappy situation.
According to their version, the oil used to be used for ritual washing.
He got up soon after the group wanted to "get out of the evil spirit" woman.
Insulations of "breeders" support people regardless of the level of education they have received.
The Der Standard quoted a 20-year-old businessman from Burkina Faso: "The fires of human souls were always dangerous," he said.
While in Burkina Faso she is trying to make peace with the government, in Gambia she was still taking part in the president's election year.
"The Gambian President Jammy, after his aunt's death, spoke to a large witch who was likely to share her death and try to kill her own president by means of black magic."
"With the help of the help of the Chamans from nearby Guinea, who, for police, soldiers and personal protection of the president, have violently taken over the elected men and women from the Gambian villages to the presidential farm in Kanila," Amnesty International reported.
On the farm, people had to drink a medicine from a hallucinogenic effect that also caused moderate and renal problems.
Two prisoners didn't stay on the farm.
After international pressure, almost a thousand prisoners were finally released.
Bakal's landlord: Top in stones, above the rent he signed
The oldest sub-stationed man jumped out of the door of the client centre of the company RPG Byty "ulhobaron" Zdenůkka Bakaly, the largest private owner of rented apartments in Česka.
He took note of the case and entered into a new lease with three rooms: his own daughter and his son, who is in line to be punished.
All three of them just deregulationd the rent.
Instead of 3500 monthly, the son will pay for 2+1 second category 4400 crowns from the next year.
"And there is no hot water and top must be petrama (stone on dry fuel, p.r. red.)," indicates the man's finger in his son's new contract, whose signature is full of power.
"But I signed it," he explains half angry and half rejected.
BytyOKD.cz civil society, which has identified new rental conditions as "uncorrected and irregular", advises tenants not to sign a new contract and wait until 7 December when public advice on how to deal with them.
But the man just has his hand over it.
"One says it, the other it is," it's dark.
The disaster is becoming a major deregulation laboratory.
After New Year's, he's waiting for a large majority of the apartments in the Czech Republic that still have a non-profit rent.
Currently.cz decided to visit the "laborator" personally.
The RPG waiter is one of the four in Ostravska and is already full on Tuesday at 9:00 a.m.
The security agency and its trailer shall be protected immediately by the door.
"Michael 2011", the bright special button on his touch screen.
One kiss and a paper with a number is coming out of the machine.
You don't even read "157" and your number is already popping up on a large screen under a waiting screen.
You're on your way in half a second.
At the rent a minute comes to ask an older married couple, he's in wait, but the new rents are obviously not quite familiar.
Most people have come to solve common problems like others - requests for correction, certain events and similar.
Letters with new rental contracts are sent to Ostravska to the postal warehouses of most of the 44,000 apartments of the RPG portfolio gross from half of November.
RPG Apartments in letters proposes an increase of 15 to 38 per cent.
The special transfer to new rentals was opened at the customer centre on 18 November.
"It runs over a week, so it's just in the process," the employees respond after a break when the client presents himself as a journalist.
Deregulation and the former coastal areas of Bakal are local explosives.
Before the elections the Vice-President of Parliament and the family of the island Lubomír Zaorálek from the ČSSD welcomed him, and local newspapers are still full of him.
"For twenty years after them, I want a new base."
"They didn't even change my desk to the back," says the man mentioned at the outset.
Most of the time, according to the employer, pensioners come to convince themselves that they will get a discount if they sign the RPG in their special offer.
Half-loans on a flat-rate rental will also be obtained by other tenants who will sign the new contract by 15 December.
The Havirovian "regulatory" package, but the issues are not clearly raised.
"From yesterday's 360 clients there were only about forty to fifty people for the 2011 loan," the staff estimate is for the past.
At the same time, RPG proposes an individual meeting of the contracts where this will be needed.
However, if both parties are not eligible for a loan, it will have to be determined by an independent court.
"It's not about threats but about information about the only possible and completely legitimate legal procedure," the RPG warns on its pages.
"No one will be judged here," says one of the RPG Byty's employees and the man on the street before the client centre gives her part of the truth.
"I have 13 thousand pensions and I have five thousand left for food, I don't have it to decide," he says.
The employee's gonna get away with it, but he'll just get out of here.
"We'll see."
"Mr. Zaoralek tells them in the media not to sign, so people are probably waiting," he says.
Loans regulations end in most of the Czech Republic with the New Year 2011 and according to the RPG Byty, their economic necessity is increased.
"The current rental still does not meet even the above requirement for the simple maintenance of the housing fund," recalls Paul Klimès, director of the resident portfolio of RPG Byty, that the real estate of the housing fund is primarily due to the increase in rent.
While in the five years between 2005 and 2010, RPG was able to invest in four billion apartments, in the four years from 2011 to 2014 it will be 5.2 billion.
A large screen covering the surface against the dusted seating of the Havorian waiting room is currently rehearsing several red-expressed information.
"The increase in rent in 2011 by 15% and less relates to 31 200 bytes, which is more than 90% of RPG."
"And it's always going to be up to 7.50 Kč per meter four and a month," it turns out on the screen.
Only in 400 apartments from the RPG portfolio will be rented by 38 per cent.
"In these cases there is an increase from an extremely low amount of 19.66 Kč per square metre," warns the RPG.
The next year, 2600 apartments will remain the same.
RPG Byty promises that the deregulation will not be raised by jump rentals, but will be divided into four to eight years.
In addition, it adds another commitment: all the money from raising the rent (see graph) allows the company to return to the apartments, mainly to warm up - new windows and heating.
In particular, they have to get people who sign an increase in the rent agreement.
The offices are part of the school. They understand architects.
Administrative building Avriopoint in Brná is a new residence of Arch.Design.
No one would expect to hide also a mini-school with all that belongs to it - with colorful walls, attractive furniture, buying toys and even a mini-atural playground on the outdoor terrace.
Since October of the year, children of the employees of Arch.Design can visit her.
Arch.Design project-architectonic company, whose workshops included a number of important brn constructions, has been counting space for its business school from the first exhibitions of the Avriopoint building.
However, it employs almost 90 people over the age of a baby and it is up to her to allow women projectors and architects to get back to work quickly.
Together with the opportunities for short-term connections, the school is a benefit that Arch.Design offers to its employees under the social programme.
So the architects and architects have the opportunity to include decent employment with child care.
The Ministerial School was designed by the staff of Arch.Design and, with the support of leadership, managed to get support from the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.
The Ministerial School is funded by the European Social Fund through the Operational Programme of Human Resources and Employment and the National Budget of the United Nations.
Thanks to the grant funding (exceeding €2.8 billion), they were able to purchase equipment and equipment and for two years to provide qualified staff and services.
After the financial contribution has been exhausted (2 years), Arch.Design has an obligation to run a ministerial school at its own expense for 3 years.
The preparation of the project lasted one year and, with a request for a grant, helped the Economic Rating company significantly.
The school provides a qualified staff, a full-time nurse and a teacher of MS, who can go to school without ageing, although most of them are 3 years old.
Because it's about "a little boy", there can be only five children at the same time, but it's going to blow up more during the day.
Schooling is flexible according to the needs of parents and children of all employees have the same right to use the school regardless of the hierarchical position of the company.
Although this is about individual training and care, the level of pre-school education is comparable to that of the pre-school education framework.
Children are not only playing here, but they are also assured of quality education - from basic knowledge to preparation for school colleges, they also learn English.
The class is equipped not only with toys, fun games, but also with computers that children can use.
The presence of young children directly in the company creates a friendly and positive environment.
Parents may at any time be able to check on their children and reduce the stress of late school leaving their parents ’ workplace.
Parents thus use working time more productive.
It is not surprising that there is naturally a loyal relationship between a employee - an employee.
Arch.Design has so arranged for Czech companies that offer significant benefits in the collection of new employees, are friends with family and through this program has strengthened personal marketing.
The house from the coast is also fascinating for 100 years. See interiors from Gaudi.
The roof looks like the back of a straight glass, a monumental mention of the fifth dinosaur and the balconies are open fish mouth.
This is the house of Casa Batlló in Barcelona from the Catalan architect Antoni Gaudí.
From the local house, thanks to its organic design, he served the view of the House from the coast.
Organic shapes, wild colors, unusual use of stones, crochet parts and brains, a phase of remembering soups and all-inclusive soft cracks, all are typical for Antoni Gaudí's net.
The front of the house is playing the sound lines, gentle colors and textures of nature and animals.
The detailed observation is to see geometry, rhythm and precisely thought order.
During the night, the whole phase of the house is more dramatic, it is enhanced so that it will be even more comfortable to see the light of color.
The causation and rotation of the shapes are equally evident within the interior.
The wood in the valves copys frames, screws, beautiful parts of the door, cubes and leaves.
The house Batlló, located in the fourth Eixample on the Russian shopping street Passeig de Grácia No. 43, was built in 1877 by architect Emilio Sala Cortese.
The reconstruction took two years and the house was completed in 1906.
Investor, rich industrialist Joseph Batlló, originally held on to build an old building and building completely new, soon adopted Gaudí's idea of unusual and cheaper construction.
The Chinese house of Casa Batlló, but Antoni Gaudí didn't give up on himself.
The architect Joseph Maria Jujol worked with him.
Right on his projector hand, decorations for the representative apartment of property owners and the use of the brains on the stage were created.
She was working at the stage with a number of other artists and artists.
The joint work on the house project of Casa Batlló started with Jujol's successful collaboration with Gaudí.
Jujol shared in the construction of Gaudí's house Casa Milá and Güell's park, where there are other Gaudí's works.
He served from the local house of interest after completion thanks to his organic features of the review of the "House of the Coast".
Others called it "the calling home" because of the specific mechanism of opening the window.
It is also said that at the top of the building is likened to the sword of holy Jiři, the patron of Catalan.
Hidden religious motives also include other sociological elements of the building.
Gaudí has designed a unique central heating system in his time with wind currents and typical rooms.
It can look like their forty-five degrees.
During Gaudí’s construction, he did not fully respect these building regulations and refused to agree with them.
At the start of the construction of the network, the construction permission was obtained from the city, but its planned reconstruction data were so serious that two years later the city council was exhausted and requested correction.
For example, I worked as an example of the construction of pillars into a public hall.
On the contrary: only fifteen days after the city's call, Joseph Batlló requested (and successfully obtained) permission to rent two of the highest floors of the building.
The owner himself moved to lower ground.
In the gallery on the second floor there was a social salon and a third floor of the bedroom and a private part of the apartment.
The land was found on the ground.
The entire six-storey house is surrounded by a warehouse that can be located on its own roof terrace.
The main components of the building were the destruction of all the right walls and direct lines and their replacements with closed walls.
Gaudi also worked with a modern concept of space-producing.
The part of the Community can be fully shared by opening the hall door and the larger company can communicate with agreement without having to keep up with the privacy required for further discussions.
In addition to the new phases, the house with Gaudí also received a non-traditional suspension and two quarters more.
It also causes Gaudí's game with light, blue and white-vowed chairs, which are placed in the inner courtyard, and the lights.
The game two colors provides maximum light in all patterns of the house.
It's just enough to apply the principle that the white reflects light more than the dark that the sunflowers.
The House of Casa Batlló, which was founded in 2005 into the foundation of the Unesco World Heritage Fund, can be visited by everyone.
In the first floor of the house, the most spacious and dignified apartment is accessible to the public.
The owners decided to take this step until 2002, on the occasion of the celebration of the year one hundred and fifty years of the birth of a famous artist.
They visited because they found out that it was a very good business and they also expanded the area of common and bloodless areas, including surface terraces.
The entry into the memory is certainly not feasible, the amount of EUR 16,50 and students, pensioners, groups and tourists have a 20% discount.
The amount significantly exceeds the price of entering other Gaudí building in the city.
If you want to taste the right atmosphere at home with expensive beads, you have to make quick contact with one of the Chinese people and visit him directly at home.
How to choose matrices and growth: Women have requirements other than men
They're never a nice bed, but the quality of bed sheets, so matrices and growth, they're giving the foundation a really good bed.
In addition, it must be added in a harmonic manner in order to appeal to a particular user.
In the selection, he decides a lot of things, from weight, height, age, health status and half the owner.
It is also important for the type of interior in which matrices and growth are added.
A typical example?
Maybe on weekend chalupes where they don't regularly burn, they're not suitable latex matrices because they're less likely to burn.
In addition, they have a significantly higher weight than standard polyurethane matrix.
At the same time, it is necessary to turn them around regularly.
If they don't have a lot of breathing channels in the core and still lie on a solid board, they keep the humidity: they could also be exposed to music.
In the selection, it is also common.
Those who have spent longer time abroad, often using very high matrices with a shrinking species, will find it difficult to feel well on the low and hard surface.
"Mostly all hockeyists who returned from NHL complained that they wouldn't sleep here."
"On their specific shoulders, legs and sides they needed matrices with a kind of shrinking line of sand."
"These are also recommended for people with diabetes who have a breakdown of the nervous system, so they misappropriate "information" from clubs and skin," explains Sylva Haddamčýk, who specializes in human consumption.
Many hockeyists, but other customers, that's why before the year of matrice with a line of paint, she gave it up.
"Today it's okay, a suitable matrix needs Tempur, Italian Magniflex, but also Czech Tropical."
You don't have to be a fighter from NHL to evaluate the line of pay.
This "miracle" just works.
Optimize your noise and shape according to absorbed heat or adapt to your warm body.
Nothing bothers you, you won't be overindulging in the night as a heavy game.
Just better get some sleep.
The line of sand also works as a protection against floods.
When you choose the size of the matrice to your height add the length of the walk, which is about 21 to 34 cm.
Men and women with a height of about 180 cm so need bed 210 to 220 cm.
The minimum width for one should be 90 cm in double box, then 180 cm in total.
In individual beds, for example in singles, at least 120 to 140 cm is recommended.
For a comfortable and possible visit.
"In other words, it is a rule for the wide bed of simple: when lying behind you you should have your hands comfortablely pushed in your pocket," says Ing. Helena Prokopová, Czech-Schooled Cech of members and decorators, who have been engaged in the problems of healthy sleep and ergonomics for years and presents it to professional schools.
In the double box, you need every own growth and matrice, but here you are careful when buying to imitate high matrices.
It will not take anything other than to mount the plants to different heights, but it must not be given to you in any frame.
Peanut matrices should have a height of at least 14 cm, of at least 15, of which at least three centimetres can be counted on the shape and shape.
"When it comes to your hand or to your stomach, you must certainly not feel the pain," warns Helena Prokop.
Each matrix requires a certain type of growth.
The whole bed, when matrices and ground are like mature Sime doubles, has nothing to do with bedrooms.
Matraces are in the wrong wind, they can't follow their path, which is now common.
And since we usually go from 0.2 to 0.75 l after night, it is clear that after five to seven years of matrices will start to remember one big (and hidden) network.
Therefore, experts reject advertising life insurance for up to 25 years or even life insurance.
But everything has its own.
And so the advice from the seller's practice: in maturing with a wide range of 120 or 140 cm of hygiene and work, don't give a pictureable drawing, but add to the advice of a matrix guard that you can easily pick up and track.
Although today it is common to produce mating streams throughout the range, so we get two parts (for washing and working size is very important!), although it could be manipulation in larger types (and in one person) when drawing up to remember the weight of easy weight in the ring with difficulty.
Do you have a solid desk in bed?
Never!
At least to bed for one night's visit.
However, keep your desk up (if it's no longer available) with windscreens and use matrices with a supply box and a minimum height of 15 cm with springs in your pockets (with it.Tashchenfederkern) and a cypressic species.
Polyurethane matrix does not belong to such a base.
On inadequate lamela plants 14 to 18 lamelas will be suitable latex or sandwich matrices (needing a combination of latex and coconuts), but you will always pay for larger numbers of lamels, 28 and more where lamelas in the range of beads are doubled and their noise can be controlled.
The positioning lammelons do not belong to the matrice with the spinal cord because they do not respond to the positioning.
According to the configuration of the noise wave, it may also be possible to access the shoulder pad.
It's about a special snapping of the needle that allows you to press or even push the needle so that it's slightly "lost".
For men who have "ranna across the back", a very important thing.
They even remind us of the matracies that started using the fragrant area right in the frame area.
They also remember women - they add soft surfaces to the places of the cheetah.
For the most annual customers, growers or distillers are defined as multi-torn farming.
The pressure spreads to more points and decreases pressure.
As soon as you use the correct matrix and growth of the wrong poster (large and "advertised"), most "plus" disappear.
The basic rule is simple: the poster must support its head and tipping only to the shoulders so that it can release the shoulder straps.
As appropriate size is recommended 50 x 60 cm, which are preferred for example in Scandinavia.
When lying on the side, the poster should be equal to the height of the frame (sand with a framed edge or a welded zone in the matrix).
Modern matrices have only a few things in common with the original strawberries.
Their producers continue to use natural materials or at least direct.
The trend is just like he was on the matrice.
The raw materials from which polyurethane beans are produced are replaced by natural oils such as hops and soybeans.
Almost all known producers use soya.
"It was in mathematics that the core was made of pure natural origin material," explains Petr Vasček from Tropico Plus.
Natural substances are also used in the production of matrific data, one of the first was aloe vera.
But you can even get a microcapsule to relax your clean skin of the forest or avalanche.
There is also division between men and women.
While a man "delays" a plant extract from his chest to absorb heat and cool the body, I'm a woman of "top".
Extract from red peppers increases blood circulation, so it's less than half the temperature.
Today's favorites?
Matheracies made of dried beans (with more powders with damaged bona fide structure) are more transparent than normal polyurethane and offers better elasticity.
Combinations of different wastes of cold pines and "line" pines produce multiple matrices that know exactly where to be heads, beads and potatoes.
For quality matrice, you will pay up to seven thousand crowns and higher.
Those who meet the health parameters have a lower rate of DPH are protected as health aids.
As the first to arrive in the Czech Republic on this advantage of Gumotex.
It's not easy to keep your eye on the matrice and growth.
At times it may be necessary to use the shares of producers or sellers who offer two matrices at the price of one.
Maybe the Magniflex sign offers Duofreez matrices with all memory memory for the 11 990 crown.
The other can already be set free.
Eru of lines or visco-elastic pens with an open bonfire structure and high frequency started with "cosmic" temperature of Tempur material.
It was originally produced as a material for NASA because at the beginning the astronauts were exposed to enormous weight.
The temperature in the heat is soft, the cold is cooler.
The warm human body is thus perfectly adapted and optimally distributed.
It is therefore ideal against the cause of sleep, but also to increase comfort during sleep.
Viscolastic pens are used not only for matrices but also for medical products, which require special plastics under the legs that remove the legs and the living system.
Land producers use, for example, Eucatherm C or Twinsaver pens and similar.
People's tracking devices want as many parents as they want to take care of their children.
Fear of owning a child keeps more and more people thinking about looking through the GPS.
The system originally created for car patrol can also monitor people's movement, and this may help in such cases as the disappearance of nine-year-old Anicchi Janatque.
The device is still as big as a scrap of cheese, but it can be as big as an hour.
All right, people were afraid of the missing Anicic case and began to struggle for the means to protect their children better.
And for the price of violating their privacy.
"We are trying to say to everyone that there is no spying but another means to reduce the likelihood of some tragedy," says Petr Pilin from Macro Weil, one of the suppliers of tracking devices on the Czech market.
"I'm sorry that in certain cases it may be possible to use such devices, perhaps when they are put in a bag for someone who doesn't know about it, but we haven't met with such a case yet."
"Most customers really buy it for safety reasons," Pilin added.
According to him, the child should always know what purpose the "bitch" serves and how it is used if necessary.
Child psychologist Dana Bočková warns that if a child doesn't want to wear anything like it, he'll just get rid of it.
"And very young children show great creativity in how to lose things voluntarily if they don't want to be under control."
"Many expectations have been raised earlier by parents of mobile phones which, however, are allowed to turn off the same as this tracking device," Bočkov says.
According to her, it is also controversial whether such equipment would help in the event of an attack.
"When it comes to a prepared egg, the nurse will always make sure that she has no electronics that could make her position. "
"Now it's a phone."
"When the following devices are expanded, they will search for them because their sales will certainly be supported by massive advertising."
"In such a case, criminals will always take steps before the police," says the psychologist.
However, it will allow a similar device to help in the event of an imminent pedophile attack.
According to Robert Čecha from the RC Monitoring company, which offers tracking services for both cars and persons, even if he comes after an attack on the immediate destruction of the tracking device, his presence can help.
"The arrangements may be set up for the regular dispatch of positions after a certain period of time."
"If his injury comes to an end, at least the last position of the person concerned will be available."
"Strengthening devices also have built-in nylonometers, so even if a person just stepped in and stayed in bed, the device immediately issued a warning with a hit-and-run," says Czech.
According to him, similar services can also carry smart mobile phones with navigation where there are enough to play special software.
The problem of current tracking units is that it is related to devices similar to those of the size of cheese or smaller mobile phones.
They're always so threatened with their losses.
According to Pilina from Macro Weil, this is why it is now testing devices that look like normal digital clocks.
"This will be the greatest benefit in that the relevant aggressor does not have to know the tracking device at all."
"Or it's known for a while and it can give the police more time," she adds.
Whether the following devices are already developed into frames or tubes, they will continue to use the same technology that is used to monitor vehicles.
It's about combining GPS position detection (which is used for normal auto navigation) and mobile phone function, which is the current position of the vehicle.
The army's got fire-fighting plans to invade the Czech Republic.
The Czech army has acquired 445 miles [445 km] of shells that are fired by trucks.
At the same time, the Ministry of Defence has already added 224 kilometres of iron.
The army has got his resources for 225 years.
The problem is that the strength of the snake is two, at least four years.
The army bought fuel from the STV Group's stock market, i.e. 40 million koruna.
The general price for the purchase of such a large quantity of MF DNES fuels claimed that soldiers consume 60 kilometres of fuel per year during training.
However, from the number of military pyrotechnics that MF DNA spoke about, it appears that then all generals, officers of the army, secretaries or officers should be trained in a very intensive pyrotechnic training every year.
Minister of Defence Alexandra Vondru and military leader Vlastimila Picka are not surprised.
Only then would it be possible to justify the annual military consumption of 60 miles [60 km] of fuel.
This length corresponds to 25 thousand explosions.
And even if it were true, the army's resources would be sufficient for more than ten years.
On the other hand, if it were paid that the basic training of each new professional would require at least two metres of fuel, as experts say, the army would ensure that the purchase - and with the increased use of women or special units - of resources for the above 225 years.
The Brigadiers of the fast-fashioned invasion recently complained to Minister Vondra that they had almost nothing to do with armaments, so they also had to be shot because of the need for money.
I don't talk about the lack of the basement.
"And my head doesn't care that they buy so much fuel from us again."
"But it's their decision, and he certainly knows what will happen to them."
"For us, the army is a good customer, which we as traders try to get," says business manager STV Group Jan Thank.
The Ministry of Defence's spokesman Jan Pejšek explains the hundreds of miles of the routes bought and that the army will have the resources of this "munice" for at least ten years.
However, Jan Thank you from STV Group is only talking about four-year life of fire and police or military pyrotechnics for only two years.
"In perfect storage these can be the four," says one of them who, as a soldier because of the military crisis, doesn't want to publish his name.
After life is taken away, every ammunition must be carefully tested whether it is still reliable and does not threaten soldiers' lives.
However, these tests are not free and are worth more money.
Another argument of the ministry is a multiplicity of 445 kilometres of fuel lines.
"We have been 70 per cent less than a long delivery of two hundred and forty kilometers," Pëšek says to the Ministry of Defence.
Only for comparison: the annual consumption of the firing squads of police pyrotechnics who liquidate ammunition from the second world war or after the Soviet army does not exceed a few years of 1,500 metres.
And the police are always ordering only so many people to use this ammo before life is over.
It has been proven to be the safety of pyrotechnics, and it can also be more flexible to obtain more modern and even more reliable types of lead.
The Ministry of Defence has already had significant difficulties with the liquidation of tens of thousands of tons of ammunition since the Warsaw Treaty when the two-year-old Czech-Slovenian army was preparing for arrest in Rün.
According to the Czech pyrotechnics MF DNES, for a few years, the problem will be solved by hundreds of miles of old fuels, which today buys "lacino".
So far I've got some of the contacts I've got with the competition.
The winning place in the game The Year's Biologist helped Lukaši Pytloun to sell his hotel in French.
By winning last year's competition, the Year's Liverpool became eight-year-old entrepreneur Lukaš Pytloun from Liberce.
His story of success is like a movie.
Luke Pytloun likes to travel.
And abroad, he realized that there was a lack of quality accommodation at a reasonable price in Liberca.
With the help of foreign patents and bank credit, he bought a semi-trailed house with five apartments.
The fact that he was still a third-year high school student was a great challenge.
"The harder the difference between the quality and the price of living with us, the more I don't want to do anything about it," said Lukaš Pytlon.
The first renovated apartment started to hire foreign workers.
All the profits he invested back into the house, which he gradually transferred to the pension with 54 bottles.
Since then, in seven years of business, he has been able to open four pensions, two style restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of over 300 beds of all categories of accommodation.
The most comfortable of them was an up-to-date four-star Pytloun design hotel.
This year, however, another, same quality came to him.
"We have just signed a contract with a hotel in the island of Tise, where we have sold our French concept and other interest in the French language of Pytloun hotels," says the Lonian biologist number one.
"And on this sale license to operate the hotel has greatly contributed to the real victory in the Year of Life competition," adds Pytloun.
His victory brought him greater knowledge and popularity in Libercia and the environment.
"People knew me on the streets, they often congratulated me more and I have to say it was nice," she recalls.
Participation in the competition strongly recommends to all who are trying to do something.
It's not even necessary to win. Every visit is good.
He says he's still getting rid of contacts and knowledge that he might not have.
"I started trading with some of the people I met because of the competition."
The fame associated with the success of it has affected so much for every employee.
And that he's got about 70.
"I observe them more loyal and proud to share in something that has received general recognition."
"It's not just my personal success, it's the result of good work for all of us."
"Only my name is extended to the front," says the humble Luke Pytloun today.
Your performance before the rest of the year we had in Farmet.
Europe's victory has been exploding with the effects of the crisis.
But thanks to the importance of winning, Farmet has worse times behind him.
For the first place in last year's Vodafone Company competition, the owner of the Farmet company, Karel Žjärski, came to the house of Slovenia.
He then assessed the efforts he had made through his small tool divisions in the Czech Skalici company with stem cells.
"I can say that the evaluation has not only aroused me, but all my colleagues and has increased our awareness of competition sports," says a long-term winner today.
At the beginning of Farmet's history, it was a pleasure to do something useful.
And so when the state offered the father of Karla Žjárska to rent a small share as compensation for the communists' entertainment property, he refused a career in the company where he was working at the time, and with a couple of friends around him placed the company on plastic floors.
Soon thereafter, they began specializing in the leaves of plant oil.
After 18 years, they became the largest producer of automatic fibers in Central Europe.
Greater awareness among the non-discriminatory public was reached by the company after its success in competition through the media.
"Not only did our customers start to notice the brand Farmet much better, but foreign partners also began to appreciate that they are working with a company that has achieved greater success in their country," says Karel Žjärski.
However, the current year was not only in the Farmet in symbol of euphoria from victory.
The evaluation was based on the economic results of the company by 2008 and only partially from 2009.
And just 2009 was the most difficult year for the sale of machinery goods.
The crisis has still not affected citizens, but companies have already stopped their investment projects and have begun to limit the purchases of new machines and technologies.
"This situation didn't go away from us, of course."
"The markets closed by 40%, we had to limit the production and there was also a decline," explains Karel Žjärski.
A viable company must at times be able to make such non-popular measures.
But the situation got worse and kept the company in profit, even though less than before the crisis.
However, as far as the farm is concerned, investment in research and development is concerned.
"We set up a research and school centre, we made presentations at international fairs, got the main evaluation at home exhibitions," Žjárski says.
It all testifies that the crisis is behind them.
Markets are growing again and with them are the number of new employees.
"The new victory is a pleasant feeling of victory, but in a calmer atmosphere," says Karel Žžjársky.
An investigation which removes unreasonable rules
An Absurdit survey of the year is the fourth part of the corporate bond.
Some unreasonable rules have already been made possible.
The unfavourable victory of the next year's Absurdita survey year became the obligation to carry documents that are also available online to officials.
More than a third of the four thousand votes cast.
For example, social security management required a paper issue from the trade register, even though the official could obtain it by two clicks of the mouse.
It's going to change with the poll.
"The Czech Department of Social Security will no longer require an issue from the Business Register at the time of checks at the payment of the security," said ČSSZ spokesman Jan Buranová.
To comply with all the rules and regulations that companies and companies in the Czech Republic have to comply with, and that it is unreasonable to cancel them is the meaning of Absurdita's annual competition.
This year, the fourth part of the business loan organised by the Economic News is becoming increasingly popular among the public.
If about three thousand voters participated in the vote, there were fewer than four thousand of them this year.
And it's not surprising, the most diverse legal obligations that only serve to maintain a business, we still have enough and enough.
"Maybe we are in the first places in the world to recognise tax," notes Karel Havlíček from the Association of Small and Medium Enterprises and Peoples of the PRC.
The simplification of business has become the declared goal of all governments in recent years.
In comparison with the world, however, the situation in the Czech Republic is not particularly improving.
According to the World Bank, the Czech company was placed in heading 74, which is eight places higher than the lion.
The Absurdita competition for the year was first declared in 2006 and runs annually according to the same scenario.
An administrative and bureaucratic misunderstanding may be reported by any person from the bottom of each year to the end of the event when the competition is closed.
The website of www.firmoroku.cz Then the competition provider selects seven candidates for "anticenu" and allows it to vote on it through the Internet at www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and www.ihned.cz.
The absurdity that gets the most votes wins.
More than one hundred more, more than 105 regulations and regulations were notified to the annual survey.
The guys sent businessmen, but also professional alliances and journalists.
For example, between the "finalists" competition, there was a requirement that vehicles for the maintenance of the distance and speedy roads be paid in cash, or that businesses with twenty employees, two offices and two toilets should be paid every two years.
The list of proposals for this year is published on the competition pages.
The declaration of competition, which is always held at the Václavsk village in Prague, is part of the Hapening which regularly participates in political and social life.
This year, for example, the competition was attended by Eva Freebod, Director of the Association of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises and Livers of the Czech Republic or by Peter Kužel, President of the Economic Chamber of the Czech Republic.
"The economic prosperity cannot function where the state houses business clinks under its feet, so it is my goal to cancel at least three dozen paragraphs each year, which are just too complicated today," Minister of Industry and Trade Martin Kocourek told.
The attempt to delete an unreasonable regulation does not go unnoticed.
In 2007, the largest number of people were required to notify the company three days before the veterinary office in a place where permanent operation is located, with the intention of taking a stand at the exhibition or on a trip.
This obligation has been removed by the new Biodiversity Act.
The second most voted duty in 2007 which was notified to the Agency by its foreign office of service for up to 30 days was removed by the law on a so-called green card.
And to the third of all good.
In 2009 the regulation of physiotherapists was adopted to have a large vortex, refrigerator and two negative weights.
This year the Ministry of Health has been calmed down - the obligation to have a refrigerator.
The new category assesses corporate responsibility
Evaluation of environmental, humanitarian, educational or sports projects.
In the fifth year of competition for economic news, the news is a category called the Responsible Company in 2010.
Sending this competition is a support for a reasonable and fair business.
"We want to support companies that take into account the impact of their business on the environment and support the community's responsible activities," says Patrick Bartholdy, the regional manager of the mobile operator, Vodafone, who is an auditor and a competition guarantor, as well as in the case of a rebellion of the year.
In the first year of this special sub-category of Vodafone’s main competition, the 2010 company joined companies for which it was not successful in pursuing this sole long-term objective.
The story of each of them is very inspiring and would be published in a separate article.
Although the subject of its activities differs from one another in a diametrically different way, support and transparency may be considered to be of common interest to the candidates for their efforts.
In one case it concerns, for example, people who have been hit and others need personal problems or the health of their own employees.
Among the fourteen celebratory finalists, for example, the Prague software company Et Netera, which supports the creation of informal sports teams between employees who are then participating in a series of tournaments in different sports.
Another example of the company responsible for Pardubic's country is Isolit-Bravo, which has been the main contributor to the tax fund for children with disabilities for 17 years.
A paper from Podébrad, which has more than 70 per cent of its healthy employees, is also old enough and therefore received the title of the company in charge of the Central Bank, and Vodafone’s company was placed in the country as a third country in competition for the year.
At Olomoukk, the accountant MiRiz Soft won, which introduced a generous working time, even more reduced in average 35 hours a week, but without a moderate reduction in pay.
The title of the jury also made it possible to purchase from Czech producers, support civil activities in a close environment and the environment.
"We are trying to recycle as much as possible so that our businesses and our administration have at least the least impact on the environment," explains Dr. Millus Riznarov.
The responsible IT company Enlogit from the Usteck Country once again thinks about the health of its employees and has arranged ergonomic chairs and keys for each note, supports their work from home and uses catering services provided by local protected department.
"In addition, we support the task of human beings in the press, which helps the local Roma community in particular," says the representative of Andrej Suchy.
In the latter order they are also subject to the terms of the activities of the company and the cleaning of the Karlovar country, which will contribute to their pension insurance by their employees in the form of standard bonuses.
"We are also making contributions to the field, transport, promotion of qualifications and recreation," says Josef Strapáč from Czasch construction company, winning in Morravskosleszka country.
The company responsible for the year was automatically notified to all national finalist competition Vodafone Company of the year which answered the questions of the questionnaire attached to the report and sent it by 15 July at the latest.
The incorrect or incomplete answers in the questionnaire were then deleted from the evaluation by the authors.
"If the representatives of the competition companies did not respond to the questions, they could not participate in the competitions of the company responsible for the year, but were not discriminated against by the "main" of the Vodafone Company for the year."
"It is not possible to sign up for this competition alone because it is a sub-category of the company's main competition for the year," explains Karel Goldman from Bison & Rose's computer agency.
At the Land Fund in Plzni, the police were caught in public competition
In the building of the Land Fund in Plzna, the anti-corruption police were arrested in the past days.
The railway detectives set up local businessmen in the media area and traders with Luboshi G.
He apparently tried to manipulate the direct public competition for the order of refund payments so that the land offered in the competition would be of particular interest.
He was supposed to pay half a million dollars for it.
"I can only confirm that the police are reaching one person because of the war in public order and in public competition," said the Law of the Head of the state of Plenary, Antonie Zelená, by providing further details with regard to the ongoing investigation.
Sixteen-year-old police businessmen were released after 24 hours.
As regards how public competition could be affected, it is only possible to speculate on the minimum official information.
The talk by the Land Fund Lubomír Black on the question of the Law indicated that the police were really involved in the chosen place of work in Plzni, during public competition.
"It was about a client, not even our employee," she explained.
The public competition is entitled "Requires to tender for land transfer under the Land Act" and takes place when more right-wing applicants are interested in the land offered.
"These persons are offering a higher value of their refund benefits, which are to be paid for the transfer than the land value has been declared."
"The proposed loans provide for the order of the buyers and the Land Fund will then transfer the land of the person who has offered the highest rates," explained the speaker.
Luboš G. apparently had information about who joined the challenge, and because he was also the right person, because he bought a number of refunds, he offered interest on land that the competition was not involved.
He's clearly indicted the dissident.
That would make it clear that he had so much money when he was arrested.
Luboš G. had over-standard contacts with PF in Plzni in the past.
He was represented in the case of former chief PF Václava Sankota, who was convicted of having been released in the country's repatriated land for which a decision on the location of the building had already been issued.
At the same time, Luboš G. received from the fund, for example, land intended for the construction of public communications, in particular in the place where access to the industrial area of Borska Poland was required.
Later he was very good at replacing the master with a house in the very historic center of the city, which had a much higher value.
She had to join the workshop because otherwise she would threaten the building by blocking the land.
Housing allowance per cent per month
Households will have to pay from the winter for all kinds of energy, but also for water and fuel supplies and some plants and rents.
The families will thus have to get out of the money from the winter to the hundreds of crowns a month more than now.
The electricity is up to 4.6 per cent, the gas will be about 2 per cent more expensive until you will have to pay for water supplies in some cities and many will also reflect the supply of central heating.
Power generation should take place in apartments every year on the stock market so far.
The prices of power electricity have decreased while all major suppliers have, therefore, a significant increase in support for energy production from renewable sources, particularly photovoltaic.
The sand of the river seems peaceful, at a time when people are the most hot and they have the highest consumption.
It must also be calculated annually by hundreds of crowns.
While electricity and electricity are reflected throughout the Republic, the change in the price of central heating varies from place to place.
Price increases are mainly planned for larger cities.
For example, house rent in Pardubic or Hradci The King pays from January for the central edition of approximately 50 crowns a month plus more than 1000 crowns a year for the family in Libercia.
The people of Prague are also threatened that over 9 per cent of them look watery and expensive, and that the city increases rent from infrastructure.
If the rent doesn't change, it'll pay 6.8% of the price.
However, the price in Prague will remain in the comparison between the lower and the lower.
In the north of the Czech Republic, where the current prices are now between the highest, has a water and a catch of 7.4 per cent.
For example, the price increase of rent in 450 thousand rental apartments can be seen as a great example, where the regulation ends from the end of the winter.
For example, the CPI Byty company, which in Austria over Labe, owns about 2500 apartments, is able to increase by up to 100 percent from the winter.
Those who won't agree with the new higher rent are willing to give the company to the court.
The regulated rentals that people pay in some 300 thousand apartments could grow by up to 10 per cent next year.
Czech children drink with fernet and rum. The beer is from fashion, it works slowly.
Fernet, rum, vodka, except for a better sign of whiskey stolen from parents.
These are the drinks after which the most frequently end up in the care of drunk doctors who haven't been even fifteen years.
Except for children who are treated from the opiate in the hospital repeatedly.
This is due to the experience of doctors who are dealing with similar cases on the incomes of children from hospitals.
"Some beer or wine are completely improbable because it lasts a long time before you drink them."
"Trendem is certainly a strong alcohol," he gave the right to receive the children's ward of Hořovice Hospital in the central Czech People's Republic of Pelikán.
"If they can pull the father's lashes out of the box, then it's about whiskey, but it's about fernet and vodka."
"The vodka here has the benefit of moving it into the jungle and it's not so much to feel then," explained the nurse.
And in fact, he's being given a speech by the School Hospital Motol Eva Jurin.
"The most common is fernet or rum."
"This is today's modern alcohol especially at basic schools."
"In some cases it was about the elephant that they brought out of the house," stated Jurin.
According to Pelican, there are thirteen or fourteen-year-olds of alcohol on the hospital income relatively normal.
Before the Horóvices, where he worked since this year, he worked for ten years just on a pediatrician in Motole, where sanitists celebrate broken schools from a wide environment.
"One girl was lying with us about four times."
"The career started in twelve years when she was brought to us with 3.5 drops of alcohol in blood in addition to the combination of extasis," the doctor said, in particular, a serious case.
"She was at the Holesovic exhibition at some dance parties."
"It's interesting that her mother didn't come at all special that she didn't know about her daughter 48 hours ago," he exclaimed.
The fact that parents are not interested in or even their considerable tolerance for drinking their own offspring is considered to be the main cause of growing child drinking.
However, according to experts in children, it is not a matter of dependence in the right sense.
"The concept of alcohol is understood by several years of chronic dependence on alcohol on all the phenomena involved, and it is not in children."
"Of those who use alcohol repeatedly, there is rather a prominent family-social background," Pelicán explained.
According to Jurin's spokesman at the pediatric clinic in Motole, 40 drunk children were hospitalized in half of the November.
However, only those with severe intoxification who had to stay in the hospital will be given statistics.
Children who are drunk who are taken by their parents after an ambulance attack may not be counted at home by the police.
In addition to the cases when children just sit down after school and drink their glasses, there are three seasonal training courses under Pelikana that can be relied on: grandparents, Silvestr and the end of the school year.
"They either drink regret from the wrong confession or celebrate the beginning of the holiday."
"I've been living at the convent for seven children's drinks at once," Pelicán lamented.
The writer who spends the night detoxification under the supervision of doctors is paradoxical in the benefit of the person who suffers from unpleasant cocaine on the second day at home.
Early headaches caused by dehydration and a lack of glucose are also associated with induction infusions with glucose and missing animals.
"They're actually better at it, because they've got a nice evening experience and good exercise and nothing's wrong."
"They're just confused about where they are," Pelikán admitted, with the fact that sometimes it harms patients by at least the cost of their treatment.
The transport of sanitica and hospitalization on the acute bed will also go out to tens of thousands of crowns.
"I used to use it as an excellent means of training when I counted the children on the visit immediately, how many of their opiates remained and that they could also spend the whole year on the Brigadier so that they could make themselves at that same dinner," Pelikán added.
However, according to the Regressive Treatment, health insurance does not include the cost of treatment for children.
Two L-159 flights are first in foreign hands in Spain
Two L-159 flights from the total five courses for which the Czech Ministry of Defence exchanged the Casa C-295M flight, in the afternoon they travelled to Sevilly, Spain, where the manufacturer of Casa - EADS is staying.
It's the first thing that machines of this kind have discovered in the possession of someone other than the Czech army.
They've only been in abroad for a few years or a few years.
This is the double version L-159T1, which has been operated by the Czech army and which has been flying.
The remaining three machines are L-159.
These are currently reserved in Aeru Vodochody and the trade mediator - Omnipol - has already taken over it last week.
When flight physics is being repaired from the Waterhead, according to Jan Pejška of the Press Committee, we are not yet known.
"The L-159 single flights for the exchange were withdrawn from long-term deposits, without other deposits and investments by the Ministry's resource."
"Two-way L-159T1 has been changed in the current state and the like," Pijšek said.
He added that the army would not be left without double flights because in May 2009, the ministry signed an agreement with Aerem Vodochody on the value of 200 million kroner for the reconstruction of four non-required L-159 machines on two dual-purpose machines.
One new flight took over the army in July, the other we'll take to the end of the year.
According to Pejška, the EADS committed that the planes are heading for some foreign land.
"The contract clearly states that L-159 flight pickers are EADS and will serve as NATO pilots."
"That's why it's the choice of how this thing will be realized," Pejšek said.
The economic newspapers pointed out in advance that, for example, the Spanish army on L-159 is not interested.
The exchange of five L-159 for one year of Casa and the purchase of three more years for 3.5 billion crowns has been approved by the government of Mirka Topolánka.
The Ministry of Defence did not issue an election order and spoke directly to EADS.
The stricter conduct of the defence argued that the exchange of support for future exports L-159 to the border.
The Czech army bought 72 machines from Aera and uses only 24, the rest of which she wanted to sell.
The purchase of Casa's plane will probably also have a court case.
The European Commission therefore appealed to the Czech Ministry of Defence to the European Court of Justice because it had to select aircraft on the basis of the European Trench and never by the performance of one manufacturer.
The army had already taken three flights from Casa, the last one on Kbely's Prague airport should be arriving within fourteen days.
An indicator greater than a fingerprint means less risk of cancer
Men who have an indicator longer than a fingerprint are exposed to a lower risk of cancer.
This is an amazing conclusion to the study published in the middle of the British cancer magazine.
It can be related to the cold male hormone testosterone.
"Our results show that the relative length of the finger can serve as a simple test of the risk of cancer of prostate, especially for men up to 60 years," said the co-author of a study by Ros Eeles, professor of cancer research at the University of Warwick.
The finger could thus be used to determine which men should undergo cancer tests of prostate cancer, in particular in combination with genetic risk or other hazardous factors such as family health concerns, Eeles added.
During the period 1994-2009, she followed with colleagues in Britain more than 1500 patients with cancer cancer and more than three thousand healthy men.
More than half of the participants in the study had an indicator on their right hand shorter than a finger.
She paid for them the same risk of cancer of prostitutes as for 19 per cent of those whose fingers were equally long.
In the case of those who had the indicator longer than the ring, however, this risk was 33 per cent higher than that of men, even 87 per cent lowering for men up to the age of sixty.
The measurement of the length of the two mentioned fingers - created during the transitional period - is likely to reflect the different levels of the central hormones that the child is exposed to in the section.
Less testosterone corresponds to a longer indicator.
Previous studies have shown that testosterone directly supports the growing cancer of prostate cancer.
The former Czech geneticist and former President of the Academy of Science Professor Václav Páčes for the Czech Republic said that he generally knows about this study, but he does not seem to agree that the relationship between long fingers and cancer was "completely demonstrated".
Czech is under snow, D1 and D5 are closed
The Czech Republic, like most of Europe, is covered by snow on Thursday morning.
On the roads and on the roads, most of the snows covered most of the night, the drivers walked through many places.
In the morning, D5 is closed between 89 and 93 kilometres in the road to Rozvadov because of a number of traffic and personal car accidents and is also D1 in Brna in the direction of Prague.
The newsman said this to the central car club (UAMK).
On the 91st mile [91 km], he struck a truck, and on the 93st mile he hit two freight cars, the accident called for an injury.
A number of personal cars were also closed in the case.
The problems are also at D1 distance to 185 km towards Prague.
Two trucks were hit there.
The drivers should travel closely behind Brne at 190 km or go across Brno and then spend 182 kilometers on Kyvalce.
There are several miles of columns.
There's also an accident on the D11 road, and it's coming to Prague right now.
In Prague there are several centimetres of snow, the temperature shows less than seven degrees Celsius.
The cars are formed, for example, on the Prosek, which is also captured by Štőrboholska.
The safest means of transport is a meter.
He's driving late, for example, on the road between Karl's town and the town of Peace.
At 8:00 a.m., he's gonna have to sit down again at the Prague crisis scene.
The problems are also related to railways and airports.
The Czech roads had already had to break down seven fast connections because of the snow.
The problem is, for example, going from Prague to the King or from Prague to Beirut.
Travelers should control the current situation.
The Russian airport was closed from 11 o'clock in the middle of the night to five o'clock in the morning.
Most of the roads in South Moravia are already on track, but only with increased caution.
There are three main roads in Uzbekistan, Brníńsk with snow language sites and Blancensk with some communication in the above snow network sites.
The most reached places belong to Scotland.
So far there are closed roads: Rousinov - Slavkov, Bohdalice - Kucherov and also Sharatice - Milešovice.
They're gonna have to put some fresh air in their pockets.
When they're transferred, they can't figure it out yet.
There is a need for caution in the area of the White Carpaths.
On the roads where the protection of nature is maintained by inert only, the CTC shall be located up to 15 inches [5 cm] of snow.
In the Czech Republic it struck from two to ten inches [2 to 10 cm] of snow, most of which fell in the northern Czech Republic, sometimes up to 18 inches [18 cm].
In Morravskoslasland, about 15 inches [15 cm] of snow struck.
The snowing in the Czech Republic is moving forward.
American soldiers have a new "discreet weapon"
The U.S. Army has set up a new "discreet" weapon in Afghanistan, known only under the code code code XM-25.
The generals hope that the new automatic gun will affect the dark conflict with the Taliban and "change the game" in their prosperity.
The new weapon is something like a little super-precious work.
Her projectiles still mention laser with precision for several meters.
Special strains of 25 mm, designed for this gun and containing high explosives, actually work as small grenades.
The fear can be programmed so that they explode not only at the sight of the target but at any point in their ballistic roads.
It can then be used against enemies who hide behind a barrier, a wall, or a trap.
Shore is not usually protected, and when a deadly layer of osteonecrosis is poured on it, it can be removed from the fight.
According to Richard Audetta, who participated in the development of XM-25, the new gun is the first weapon for the five that uses "discreet" technology.
"The sword with it is basically so that a laser paper which determines the distance will get a clear purpose point, according to it, it will handle the plan and cut the pieces."
"Let's say you've planned 543 meters."
"When you press the trigger, the gun will hit and fire the gun at 543 meters plus minus one, two or three meters," Audette said.
Move 400 jobs
The Fujitsu Group is moving from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
400 employees move their place of work in July of the next year from the competent administrative building at Marienbader-námėmė, Bad Homburg to Astro Park.
The Japanese company Fujitsu is moving from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
In the middle, a giant in the range that specializes in computers and their maintenance is transferred in July of the next year 400 men and women from their place of work from the city of Marienbader administrative building in Bad Homburg to Astro Park, which is a large administrative complex in the Lyons Street, in the part of Frankfurt called Niederrad.
According to Mr Fujist's statement, there should be another 100 other jobs of the group which are already divided into the region at the time.
The offer to rent was by very attractive and large-scale offices in Astro Park, more and more attractive to employees.
Also in Bad Homburg was Fujitsu's only rent.
The competent leader Bernd Wagner said, "In Frankfurt-Neederrad we found a central seat with outstanding infrastructure."
The unique connection with the airport is just as important to the global company as Fujitsu.
The recent movement of an important undertaking within the region brought joy to the winners and to the winners.
The leading economic rapporteur in Frankfurt, Markus Frank (CDU), said that this was possible for a "global player".
It's a " Fantastic demonstration of trust in this place".
Fujitsu is heading to the city, the relief is an important impulse for Niederrad.
Old Bad Homburg, Michael Korvisi (Green), appealed to Fujitsu's decision.
The city was previously informed by the company’s management of its purpose.
"Of course we offered our help to the company," said Corvis.
Friends contacts, however, could not change the problems of computer manufacturers with the owner of the real estate at Marienbader-näm.
As a result, there were decisive economic reasons.
Now it's about preventing long absences from being held in such a prominent place.
"I hope he's the owner and the owner of the building co-operative."
The house at Rathaus-næ town, which had previously been used by Fujitsu, and the nearby "Kleine Verticale" belonged ten years ago with other buildings at Marienbader-Nämme to the most discussed construction purposes of the city.
Between the plant and the workshop came up as a joint project of the city and a private projector called the city entrance, which was criticised for the massive construction of the area which had previously served as a parking lot and also for the construction of buildings.
In 2001 the company of investment advice and rating Ferri, a software manufacturer for travel distribution systems, Start Amadeus, moved into the house, just like the computer manufacturer Fujitsu, who was still connected to Siemens.
The buildings used by Fujitsu were acquired in 2006 jointly by Frankfurter Deutsche Immobilien-Cancen-Groupe and Morgan Stanley Real Estate Fund and were sold in Madrid by Falcon Real Estate Investments SA after year.
Fujitsu group from Tokyo is known as the third largest IT supplier in the world.
It offers, for example, computers and servers available and also takes care of the necessary service.
The area in the region of Rīna and Mohan is one of the largest in Germany, most of the employees of Fujitsu are in Munich.
From Bad Homburg it is moving to Frankfurt-Neederrad subsidiary Fujitsu Technology Solutions, other companies in this area will be Fujitsu Services and a company called TDS.
In the administrative building Astro Park was located for this purpose of 7,000 square metres.
In the complex - his name warns on the star-field, which is twenty years old, and sits in addition to the middle of the electrical and electronic industry.
Amazon detached server - attacks against Assangem
Wikileaks is getting into closets.
The Amazon Internet Service has shut down its detection platform on its servers.
It is possible that this has happened to political pressure after the publication of the statistics of secret diplomatic deposits.
The Founder of Wikileaks Assange is likely to remain in Great Britain.
Wikileaks, the detection platform, is getting in the United States under increasing pressure.
Internet activists have lost access to their traditional home server in America and are now looking for Internet homes in Europe.
Meanwhile, prominent American Senator Joe Lieberman called other countries and businesses to fight Wikileaks.
And the founder of Wikileaks Julian Assange, who is on the list of Interpol sought, is to remain in line with one press contribution in Great Britain.
"Wikilaks is no longer on the Amazon server."
"Free display in the free country," they reported active publication of short news on Twitter in the middle (local time).
A short time ago, Amazon Internet company created Wikileaks documents from its servers.
Internet activists used Amazon Web Service (AWS) to manage a high number of access to documents.
With the help of Twitter, Wikileaks explained this step: "It's fine - our dollars now we're going to lose our jobs in Europe."
When Amazon has such problems with free display, "and they should stop selling books."
Amazon stopped using its servers for Wikileaks after Senator Joe Lieberman's associates conducted interviews, published CNN television stations based on information provided by Lieberman's office.
The President of the Senate Committee on Home Affairs threatened Amazon with a fight, informing British Guardian.
"I would like Amazon to take this step earlier, given the earlier publication of classified information on Wikileaks," said the senator.
At the same time, Lieberman called for a ban on the use of servers in other countries.
"Wickleaks is one illegal, harmless and unbiased and therefore our national security is exposed to danger and threatens life on this planet," said a non-foreign senator.
"No company responsible - whether American or foreign - should help Wikileaks in their efforts to expand stolen material."
Founder Wikileaks Assange, who is searched by Swedish authorities for suspicion of rape, is listed by Interpol.
According to reports in the London newspaper "The Independent" the 39-year-old Australian in Great Britain, Scotland Yard knows the exact place.
Internet activists have always marked an investigation in Sweden for the intrusion of their opponents.
Speaking of Wikileaks Kristinn Hrafnsson in London, he said it's here.
"Docence was a challenge to the murder of Julian Assange."
That's why Assange's right to be afraid of his security, said Hrafnsson.
That's why Wikleaks will keep hiding.
Hrafnsson must have responded to North America's productions.
In the United States, former Republican Governor Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, asked him to be the person responsible for publishing Wikileaks for the charge and correction.
In Canada, one head of government, Stephen Harper, said on television - obviously ironic, Assange should be "killed" and Obama could use "target flight".
Between the White House and Assange's speech interpreter.
U.S. President Baracka Obamy, Robert Gibbs, called it "a funny and absurd" that Assange asked for a resignation from Foreign Minister Hillary Clinton if he is responsible for recent Spanish diplomat challenges.
"I'm not quite sure why we're interested in the opinion of one person with websites," said Gibbs.
"Our foreign policy and interests of this country are far more important than its website."
The U.S. government is now expanding its database's security.
The Special Commissioner was appointed by the Deputy Director of the Anti-Terrorist Action Centre, Russell Travers, to hand over the White House.
Travers became responsible for the development of "needed reforms in the structure", which are necessary after the release of the message from the mission to Wikileaks.
The White House also wants to examine how the whole government exchanges and protects information.
The U.S. government also announced that it wants to take care of the safety of dissidents and activists if they should get into danger due to the release of Wikileaks.
"We have raised everything to get in touch with them," said foreign-speaking ministry Philip Crowley.
"We are ready to protect them, if it were necessary."
Winter University
The Gelato University of Bolon prepares frozen sugars for a better period of year.
The basic course for the future refrigerator, which lasts three days, is of great interest and visitors come from all over the world.
Where's the ice cream?
Gelatier and Gelataio.
Gelatiere, a little older than Czech ice cream, produces cream according to all the rules of Italian ice cream art.
Gelataio extracts an old ice cream from a cold box, puts it in a flat and sells it.
To find out, you don't have to go to Anzola del'Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But if anyone wants to learn more about ice cream, he won't get rid of "Gelato-Universities" of Italian Carpigian companies.
In 2003, the producer of ice cream machines at the ice-cream university arranged to meet the high Italian ideals.
The basic course for the future Gelatier, which lasts for three days, is huge interest and visitors come from all over the world.
But it also offers several day special courses on chocolate ice cream and practice in its own ice cream.
Someone's suffering in their Midlife-Criss after a new career, someone's looking at the thin ice of their unclear complaints.
This time it's 40 participants from 19 countries of all lighthouses - from Brazil through Hungary and beyond Saudi Arabia.
Jacky, an art teacher from California, likes to move Slow-Food and wants to offer a quality European product in the country of the Ice-Cream industry in the future.
Anke from Berlin is a business consultant and would like to start something on her own after years of hard work.
Two Egyptian youths dream of opening a fridge in Cairo.
One man from Malta and one from Brazil wants to improve the quality of ice cream in their bars - and a Canadian woman in Julia's home came because her children love Italian ice cream.
Maestro-Gelatiere Luciano Ferrari first explains to participants the ideal properties of perfect ice cream.
The solution is not only good taste, but also mild irritability and good consistency.
Luciano doesn't forget during his training in the South and Owning Garden: "Italian Gelato is just the best - and then there's still a need for a romantic dose."
The first step of production seems to be quite simple.
Luciano inserts the basic ingredients of milk, milk, milk powder, sugar and stabilisers into a large mixer, which all runs an electronic program at 85 degrees and then looks at four degrees.
Then he turns on the machine with a cochut and runs a pasteurised white base cream, based on all kinds of milk ice cream.
Immediately the teacher is asked questions: Is it possible to make ice cream only from natural substances without a stabiliser?
How can a person experiment on his own?
Luciano warns to let himself be lost by a spirit of ignorance.
Who's talking about ice cream "only from natural compounds", apparently used stabilisers - most natural products like guarantor molluscs from guarantors.
Of course it is possible to make ice cream without stabilisers, but it must be sold within one day, otherwise it will meet and the customer will have its own ice cream.
Certain variations in basic weights are allowed.
It's gonna be more of a sense of aromatism.
Maestro Luciano varies in the taste of frozen milk according to the taste that is bought in the supermarket either in fruit and sweets.
There are also pigs and creams.
"Congratulations will try to include a lot of aromatized pledges."
"But you should just experiment."
Be with fruit sorbets with sugar and pure fruit.
Or frozen from white basic weights that change eggs on yellow cream and cheese based on all chocolate tests.
Now we can take part in ice cream machines.
Luciano is always allowed to produce four different types of vanilla, chocolate, coffee and liqueur ice cream - whether with or without eggs in basic weight, with more or less vanilla flavour or other natural ingredients.
The same experiment will be carried out with the fruit types of ice cream.
More aromatic substances, more fruit juice - given the taste it's not always better.
Liskooris ice must not taste more oysters when it contains more liscans.
The favorite ice cream made by a group that uses more fruit, less water and less stabilizer.
As soon as the weighted mixture breathes straight into the taste of Gelato, says Luciano.
The production of ice cream is purely a numeric task: If a high sugar-based broccoli is used, the sugar content in the basic recipe must be reduced.
There's a need for extra sugar in lemon juice.
Luciano uses a device that determines the sugar content of the fruit (the grapes are measured from the roots).
Tables of luck ease the numbers.
The production of ice cream no longer requires as much body fat as before.
It does not only help the machine to automatically produce basic weights.
There is also a device that combines the finished freezing mixture at the same time into the cream and takes care of the minimum temperature.
And despite all the automation, we don't avoid minor accidents.
Brasilan Gustavo is stopping himself and his colleagues from spreading to the bottom of the fruit pie when he's out of control of the big mix.
"In every course," said Maestro Luciano, "it's only a matter of time when something like this happens."
Two-light auditors
The European Food Agency for Efsa is operated by an industry which experiments with genetic plants.
This charge is now referred to by a group of Testbiote experts, which is considered to be an independent institution for the calculation of the results of biotechnology.
"It sounds like a splice theory, but we've documented it well," said in the middle of Munich's Chief Testbiotech Christoph Then.
The leading team of Efsa experts for genetically modified plants, Harry Kuiper, and other Efsa experts have already been in agreement with the Ilsi lobbyists for several years.
He's a fund-raising company like Monsanto, Nestle or Bayer.
Kuiper has shared in a decisive way the Efsa control rules for genetic growth and are so clearly in the field of interest, criticised then.
The Efsa rules are in full agreement with the Ilsi documents and are not such a manuscript of the industry that should be controlled by the Italian Parmé.
It's already second to what Testbiotes are warning about.
Recently, a senior manager from Ephesus passed without any additions or transitional periods to the Swiss agricultural group Syngenta - and then changed the parties.
The Central German (MDR) resolution also rejected recent EU industry lobby control personnel associations, which raised both the interest of both the Ministry of the Environment and the EU's MEPs.
In the meantime, Efsa can't recognize a lot of interest.
It works with all the serial data, including those from the industry, if they are highly skilled, it is mentioned in one declaration.
Experts working for Ephesus are not required to have contacts with industry.
But he's got to put them on.
Cooper recognizes his work for the International Life Sciences Institute (Ilsi) in the United States.
It is only known as the neutral forum of experts from science, industry and politics - except for the calculation of the risk of biotechnology without a lobbyist contract.
Independent experts such as Then criticise that at present genetically modified plants are currently allowed to grow in animals without any feeding attempt and that genetic plants do not test their response to the effects of the environment.
"We want to know what, for example, does genetically modified maize on the ground," says then.
Modern practice is only to test isolated proteins rather than the whole genetic plant, which does not produce reliable results.
"If they don't look for the risk, how could they be found?" he asks himself, lamenting, "Then.
That's what Angelika Hilbeck agrees with.
The science lab has been testing the genetics since 1994 and is currently working at the Technical High School in Curychu.
In this area industry is trying to be more and more influenced or trusting critical scientists, as in the United States, as in Europe.
That's why there's almost no scientists who wouldn't be united with the group anymore.
Most of them do not publish studies that are critical to companies.
"The industry controls security research," Hilbeck is thought to be.
Stone rate
Uli Gsell also ordered some, about 400 kilograms.
On Monday night, he was standing in front of a store in Stuttgart, a backyard.
It was a demonstration.
It's snowed.
The story is known: In September the barracks came and began to watch a large corner of the north wing.
The world in Stuttgart was no longer the same: Thousands demonstrated against S21, billions of downsizing.
When the building was stopped, most of the birds were lying in their dens.
Scattered to 6,000, 7,000 pieces.
A wedding with Crail Sheim, a soft stone used in the years 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is a sugar in Ostfieldern, 43 years old.
He's got a few of these cuts.
"These stones are left."
"He shouldn't be gone."
It says, "Low and poor stone, simple and forthright."
When one broke up, he smelled like a cigarette.
What he's gonna do with those shirts, he doesn't know yet.
Stones have time.
Uli Gsell, too.
The stock of stones from Stuttgart leads to the Tübingen forest on the former storage site of the French army, where Manuel Rongen built his stone solution.
A 44-year-old man is dealing with old stones.
He bought all the things that happened during the war in Stuttgart.
"It would be a shame if they were on the floor or disappeared on the deposition," says a wooden house that was once a housekeeper.
He says he was threatened and threatened when he was bought by the rest of the North wing from a demolition company.
But he talked to S-21 opponents all day long.
And he explained to them that it can't even be demolition.
And when this happens, it's the smartest thing when stones continue to use.
Then there were about 200 S-21 opponents each about 80 kilograms of heavy block, a price of between 650 and 14 euros.
As a reminder, some also hope that they will return it at the reconstruction.
Rongen bought 500 tons, cost 25 big cars.
About half of it's still in the woods, the rest of it's been sold for a long time.
The gardeners, the national gardeners, the housekeepers.
They came out of all the boxes and removed what came into the trunk and the trunk.
The stones of the Stuttgart competition have long been transformed into "damages" or as the end of the existences.
"This stone is really nothing special," says Rongen.
"If it weren't for the political clues."
He sits in his field car and goes for his 20-hectare kingdom.
He studied in front of the law, stopped studying, later biology, then became interested in computers, and eventually became a stone dealer.
And a lover of stones.
He's got 40,000 tons of stones.
He's taking his savings from all over Germany.
He says he's the biggest dealer with old stones in the Republic.
It's too bad.
In the snow are artificially designed sandbags.
"One of them belonged to the Marien-most in Dražjana," she reports.
The Labe writer, yellow, warm, inspired.
"My favorite stone."
We're going on our way up the woods.
It points to the herd: a red peas, a former part of the farm in Karlsruhe.
He's still here.
"A nice travertine."
One time those squares belonged to the Neckarstadion court in Stuttgart.
There are stones and stories in the snow, Cannstatt-travertin from the police station in Stuttgart, a red granite from the Sankt Blasien temple, a tube from the hospital in Heilbron.
What a job, what a way, what a way.
When Rongen thinks about how stones were handcuffed and transported by simple warehouses and vehicles, he'll become quite ecstatic.
"It'd be a scandal if something like that happened."
He's not rich. He's not rich anymore.
The stone trader today employs 14 people, and in addition to that, stone was planted in the forest, one sugar, one coffee, one glass and one garden.
"We work hard, but it's comforting," says the other one.
He'll have to go to Colin in a while.
They're gonna save the stones there too.
High-potential talents fight
There's a lot of people in town.
16 students are pressed into breadcakes with salmon, raccoons and sweetness.
The Technical University of Braunschweig and Volkswagen Car Manufacturers invited students of engineering and design to the workshop.
Together with VW's developers here, they have to talk about the car of the future - and that's just how Volkswagen is known.
Many companies are trying to compete on smartest heads, like VW, success and success in co-operation with universities.
Their mission is: What may first be recruited into the most likely graduates of the audience before they get to the labour market and take care of others.
Since universities do not publish any list of the success of their students, companies are trying to identify outstanding talents in practical projects and get them.
At TU Braunschweig the car company is trying to get talent on the second day.
One young lady from the personal department distributes prescriptions, rubber beads and desks with VW logo.
He will send young talent to practice programs, student jobs, and guide them to the group.
Nico Selle from TU Braunschweig is looking after the project together with VW.
See the benefits for both sides: "Students will get in touch with industry and gain experience."
"VW can get to know students at the same time, get to know interesting candidates and think about who would act as a co-workers."
Such cooperation, according to Selle, is not unusual.
But the news is that she's so open about students.
" Otherwise it was rather a major professional project," says Selle.
The fight for purity will probably be even harder.
In many sectors companies are no longer able to select their employees from long-term representatives.
On the other hand, efforts must be made and efforts must be made to attract, in particular, highly qualified workers.
In particular, the graduates of the engineering teams have excellent coordination positions.
According to the Svaz of German engineers, VDI remained in October of unaccompanied 40,000 engineering positions.
And according to the VDI forecast, so-called lack of engineers is still growing.
Following the auditory and advisory company of KPMG, Roman Dykt goes to the talent hunt.
It organises an ordered Recruiting-Events such as KPMG-Race, a type of modern base race where participants must find their way according to GPS coordinates.
The company plans to send these eight promising students to the United States next year.
At the same time, participants can look at the areas of KPMG and get to know the company.
First, it shall be decided in two selections who will participate.
Only Creme de la Creme from many interested people fly to the United States.
In the High Potentials file at the universities they will pay according to the Dict still tougher laws.
"We want to be different with our Race."
"The simple trip to the beach was too small for us."
Looks like Uncle's talent hunter is lucky.
"We have remained in contact with all participants of the same action in the past year."
"Some people will soon finish the study and plan to take care of our work," she says.
In addition to direct reference to the campus, small and medium-sized enterprises present classics on the markets.
"We're trying to contact graduates at professional exhibitions."
"For example on Intersular," says Sitha Stübe, head of the solar technology manufacturer's personal department.
The company from Bonn employs about 1500 employees in Germany.
The words know the problem with young workers.
At the present time, 35 posts have been published on the websites of companies.
"At present it is quite complicated to have free places."
"It takes a lot of time and money," she says.
Another option is to contact professors at universities.
Solarworld works with various high schools, such as the University of Freiberg.
"Professors inform us that we can practice or write a diplomat."
The solar specialist doesn't arrange any expensive advertising action.
Instead, the company is trying to tackle other benefits: personal atmosphere, low hierarchy and easy communication.
"Many companies can't offer it often," says the head of the staff department.
When looking for work, money no longer plays a major role.
Flexible working time, child care or good practice options are other factors that are crucial.
Solarworld included in one study of the Great Place to Work 55. place among 100 best employees in Germany.
The Institute is the annual list of best German employees.
In addition, workers are asked how they are at peace with their work and their working environment and are subject to the conditions of their employees.
The Head of the Personal Division of the Stübes hopes that its location will bring points to stakeholders on the job.
"I believe that stakeholders are particularly informed about external evaluations of potential employees," she says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler from the German Employee Branding Academy advises companies who want to build a long-term strategy of good news as an employee.
He advises his customers to be more authentic.
And according to Mr Kriegler, this means the main internal measure.
"The best way to see yourself as an attractive employee is through your own employer," she says.
This is called the internal employer Branding, which means that employees are being placed on the market within their own staff.
"The peace of employees are the best messengers."
When a company takes good care of its people and they identify themselves with the company, they will make their employees advert between friends and acquaintances.
"It's like a game with practice," says Kriegler.
Both stop new mines
During the following years, new red fields emerged before the border of the state of Florida, in the Gulf of Mexico.
The government in Washington issued a corresponding ban - and then terminated its previous plans.
New gardens are already under ban in front of the Atlantic coast.
Minister Ken Salazar sent it in the middle.
The reason for the strict ban that should be paid at least for the next five years is the explosion on the "Deepwater Horizon" in depth.
Before this accident, which continued to lead to the greatest disaster in the US, President Barack Obama had signaled the pressure of opposition and industry to allow new gardens in the eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico.
The residents are trying to reduce the U.S. dependence on foreign roache supplies.
Today, there is no clear explanation as to who is responsible for the oil spilling into the furnace.
In the middle of the crisis, the British energy group BP is faced with billions of demands.
The Commission of Inquiry, which entrusted Obama, should submit the results during December.
In October, Minister Ken Salazar issued a return order that he paid from the explosion.
The following were submitted to different different different groups of applications for new value-added purposes.
Both Obama and Salazar want to prevent a similar disaster from more stringent controls and strict safety regulations.
At present, there is a fundamental reform of the control authority which has warned many of its corporate charges.
At the same time, Obama announced that it would cancel the lucrative tax opportunities for oil and gas companies.
The industry is now clearly warning that stricter regulation is essentially reducing the volume of heavy metals in the furnace.
"The government plans are the largest bridge for the growth of the gas and oil industry," says the results of the current research in the BDO Advisory Company - still before the ban on entry into the middle.
The American Energy Alliance still complains about the uncertainty in the field: "No one knows exactly what changes are being made."
Investments in new training projects are being postponed until the call is made - for growth.
The area of Ogoni burned
The water in the rivers is oil wells, smells like pumps: billions of litres of unique rocks destroyed nature in the area of Ogoni in Nigeria.
People live by stealing, corruption and illegal robbery.
Celestine Akpobari thinks it's good.
"Don't deal with it," says an environmental activist, "you'll get a lot of rough dust in front of your targets today."
The 37-year-old Nigerian followed up with an attempt to photograph a boy who sails through the chest of water that includes shmushes: this scene takes place in a water lake with spiritual colors almost beautiful.
The fact that under the blue surface of the robin's nest is not seen.
She's been collecting enough grain here before, she's sending Esther Badom on the edge of the Bodo-Jetty River.
Meanwhile, there was a bit of flooding water completely dead.
Five years ago, a large number of rubies came into the vast area from broken roads.
Fishermen from the nearby town of Bodo must swim for at least six hours to get to the water where there are fish: the area Ogoni, which is located in the heart of the Niger delta, belongs to one of the largest frozen areas in the world.
The road along the river with the mangrove pools with a lot of side effects is quite famous for the entire range.
The engine fires on the floor instead of the light waters of the canal, and whoever washes his hands into the water, removes the oil rings.
The roots of mangroves are removed from the country as black branches of medicine, and the roots of the populace are left to dry out their leaves.
We're looking for a bunch of birds that are usually exposed in the wet areas: As soon as the engine shuts down on the crew, it's spread into the previous paradise, where it smells like a pump, terrible silence.
"What's playing here is the ecological management of the war," laments Celestine Akpobari: "We live in constant fear of health."
The comparison with the war is right.
The area of the Ogooni settlement is a battle field where more than 60 years have fought: more than 60 years ago the first inhabitants of Europe gathered here, here created the first battle in the 1980s with later editor Ken Saro-Wiwa, where the Shell group had to stop its production in 1993 because it was very dangerous for employees.
To date, Ogoni can not return to the area: while it is difficult from the whole area of Delta with three sizes of Switzerland with more than 5000 ferries and 7000 kilometers of driving more than two million barrels of black gold, it is a hot field in the area of Ogoni Ladem, for the group this situation is very unstable.
Each several hundred meters is related to the water of the steel structure as a magic soybean: "Morning Trees", so they call themselves the heads of garden openings.
They're 50 years old, most of them up to the sea.
Every moment, the head of such a garden opens, says Akpobari, and then runs a constant flow of rocks into the water.
According to experts, more than two billion litres per 50 years went into the ecosystem: Each year, the number of mines that emerged into the sea in Alaska at the disaster of the supertanker "Exxon Valdez" 21 years ago - one of the greatest disasters in the history of mankind.
They're arguing who's responsible for the ongoing environmental disaster.
While the Shell group marks the sabouting and organized theft of holes by more than 90 percent of pollution, it speaks of the protection of the living environment over the cracking heads of gardens and unhindered guides as the main cause.
Shell in Nigeria requires much less security regulations than it is in the world, said a group in 2008 American scientist Richard Steiner: Only the amount of traffic on the roads is "sometimes higher than any other".
In a place that looks like a distant, oil-stained piece of oil under the wide sky, it is made up of mangroves: they are completely wet and after the crack of oil.
Under one of the many courts, which are partly connected by conduct, partly voluntarily disintegrated across the country, there is a fire: illegal small refinery.
The thief is burning in court over the fire for several hours, explains Michael, the leading group.
Before running from the ledge to the covered basin of petrol, later cape at the end of the kerosene conduction and finally oil.
In this way Michael and his four employees make up up up to four hundred liters per day: "We're going to make 34,000 Naira" - about $22.
The residents of the deltas use chronically inadequate weights in the largest red state of Africa.
Nigeria owns only one refinery.
A mixed low price of EUR 40 cents per litre of oil can still be passed by illegal producers: because they have raw materials free of charge.
It comes from "bunkers", who are involved in the management of Ogoni: according to experts, this is the whole area of the Niger Delta, losing the country at least 16 million litres of oil a day.
But only slightly small part of provisionally stored raw materials is illegally released: most of the full-organised criminal network, to which also belongs the policies and high positions of the military representatives, are in tanks and are sold on the world market.
The debate on whether people have caused a disaster and their savings or a slow method of production is considered by activists Akpobari to be purely academic.
"If we didn't consider ourselves a slave company and if we didn't completely destroy the livelihood of fishermen, there wouldn't be neither Sabota nor thieves and illegal refinery."
In the meantime, however, the relationship between Ogoni and Shell is so damaged that it only comes from the group: "Maybe other peoples like China as better."
Michael's surprised.
"The tallest time for you to disappear," says the delicious producer.
"The soldiers can come at any time."
If they find a special military unit, they are not threatened with imprisonment, but with a painful payment.
Also, soldiers who mostly come from the north of the country - like all Nigerians - want to benefit from raw materials.
"That damn thing got our country all the way down," says Akpobari.
Researchers have discovered a dangerous construction error in A380 engines
A380 clearly has a major security undertaking.
Researchers have discovered a possible construction error that could lead to a "dangerous engine failure".
The company Qantas wants to complain about engine manufacturers.
When the Qantas airbus was forced to arrive in November, there was probably more happiness than ever before: the Australian Aviation Safety Agency has found a great safety stop on some A380 engines - and now warns against possible construction failure.
The argument may have serious consequences: one oil connection could lead to drought due to the need, this Thursday was announced in a public statement by the ATSB Authority.
This reality could lead to a "dangerous engine failure".
It's about the Rolls-Royce engine in 20 A380 flights.
Among them is the Qantas Airbus, which had to arrive in Singapore on 4 November.
The Australian airline has now taken legal steps against the British turbine manufacturer.
The Court of First Instance of the Court of Justice of the European Communities of the European Communities has given rise to a complaint from the Court of First Instance in Sydney which allows other legal measures against this company.
The chief of Qantas Alan Joyce said his company would be demanding compensation for an incident at the beginning of November.
During the engine fire, parts were released and they damaged bone surfaces.
Rolls-Royce marked for damage to fuel oil.
After this event, up to 40 engines have to be switched around the world.
The Australian investigators announced that they would carry out further safety tests with the aeroplanes equipped with the engines concerned.
The security recommendation is the result of cooperation with Rolls-Royce, said speaker ATSB Martin Dolan.
The lack of security has been considered sufficiently important to inform all concerned.
After the emergency landing of the Qantas machine, the airline left its A380 fleet on the ground for several weeks.
Singapore Airlines left three of its A380 units across the country.
Lufthansa replaced one A380 engine as a safety measure.
The second-party plane is the world's largest personal aircraft.
National snowing is causing chaos in the way
Germany's entire white: almost all over the country was snowed through the night.
On many roads, government chaos, train connections and planes have been destroyed.
At least three people died in traffic accidents.
Winters hate Germany: almost the entire Republic fell on Thursday at cold temperatures - which leads to traffic chaos in many places.
It lies in some places up to 15 inches [15 cm] of snow in the north and east.
On several roads and many roads there is a very limited transport.
At A7 in Flensburg, the railway service was still in operation, but it did not produce new snows.
There was still a strong nasal wind over the Baltic Sea.
The BSH is expected on the coast of the Baltic Sea in Switzerland-Holstein on the morning of the storm with a water position of 1.2 metres above normal.
Snow pollution has caused significant problems in Saskatchewan on the remote and state roads.
According to the centre of the bad weather Meteomedia was therefore the highest rate in the Sáskýkarka region of the region - at least the highest.
Some 30 inches [30 cm] of new snow, strong and clean winds caused storms.
There were several expensive and personal vehicles left there at night.
In Sasku-Anhaltska, police authorities also reported serious road problems.
On A2 he caused the wind and snow to slow down the operation and seizures.
There were problems in Durynsk because of snow on A4 and A9.
According to the German road, there is a major problem in Saska, Sasku-Anhaltsk, Durynsk and in northern Bavaria.
The main problems are snow on the wheels, turned trees on the wheels or broken up the top driving and escape.
In Saska, a remote operation had to be stopped from Lipska to Norimberg.
In Durin Saalfeld, one ICE had to stop to Minichov.
165 passengers got in the train from the driver and rescuers with their bathed blankets, food and drink.
Snow wind over the road.
In large German airports, snow winds have been destroyed for many years.
According to the information centres for the years, they have already been reported from Minichov since the previous years.
In Frankfurt, after Mohan, it was broken down by Fraport for 40 years.
The maintenance of the vehicle is in constant contact.
The seat on the airport remained only a few passengers without connection, but 400 full beds were prepared for them.
There's already been a lot of road accidents in the middle of the night.
One driver died last night while fighting a train on a rail train in eastern Holstein.
The driver was easily injured.
Because of the blocked road, a similar accident occurred near Norimberga: a freight car was also caught here on the railway trip because the vehicle was on board.
The driver's dead.
Four passengers were injured in the train - the route from Bayreuth to Norimberg, so it was closed by early hours.
And then a 30-year-old woman died after turning herself into a wheelchair in Aschaffenburg.
But meteorologists have the good news: snow remains in the form of easy-to-reading, and therefore it will rise even when the winds are light.
But the wind is weak.
Only at the Baltic Sea will the swift wind of the strong wind.
But it's going to be big winter - locally up to minus 15 degrees.
Deutsche Bank is looking for a buyer for a couple
Deutsche Bank wants to split up with its mark: according to one newspaper contribution, the buyer's bank is looking for two branches with offices in headquarters in Frankfurt.
Property could cost up to EUR 500 million.
Deutsche Bank just restored its seat of the group: the corner-twos in the Frankfurt bank district were modernised; while the bankers were allowed to return to their old jobs.
But now, obviously, the financial group wants to renovate again - and is looking for buyers for both blackouts, as it informs "Financial Times Deutschland" by calling on the speaker.
The speaker did not mention the reasons for the planned sale.
"We're still testing whether it's more meaningful property to own or sell and then to buy it again," he said.
This is why the largest credit institution in Germany will soon re-issue its company residence.
The Bank took a fresh-two half-year loan for EUR 272 million from its own fund investors and then reimbursed it costably.
Energy restructuring of the company according to data of around EUR 200 million.
The sale would probably bring the bank a lot of money.
The experts in the field estimate the value of the new text between the so-called Greentowers volumes at around EUR 500 million.
The speaker said it was not decided whether the building would be reselled into the property of the fund or the independent investor.
Thousands of trolls for the dead.
More than 10,000 people lost memory of the sleeping giants in New Zealand who were declared dead after several explosions down.
There is still no way to release the dead because the security situation is still complex.
Almost two weeks ago came to the Pike River Mine near the city of Greymouth for a powerful explosion.
29 climbers between the ages of 17 and 62 were infected.
In the shelter where the accident occurred, the probe was released, but no step in life was found.
Due to high concentrations of evaporating gases and subsequent explosions, safety did not result in the presence of safe forces.
After the second powerful detonation, the authorities and experts came up with the fact that the rebels no longer had any chance of survival.
He still couldn't release the dead.
Now they've lost the memory of dead relatives and friends.
In Greymouth on the southern island of New Zealand, tens of thousands of people were gathered during the sun.
It's been two minutes.
29 tables were set on which helms, lamps, and names were placed for the remembrance of the sleeping giants.
Also pictures and personal items, such as clothing and surfing rings here, found their place.
In the state government buildings, trains were driving at half a yard.
New Zealand hoped that the mountainers would come out of "deep ground" on the surface again, told the participants of the memory action of New Zealand Prime Minister John Key.
"But they never came home."
He can't get away with his son until he sees his dead, said Laurie Drew, whose son Zen was buried down.
In addition to the Ministerial President's and related victims, a number of foreign diplomats were also involved.
During the explosion on 19 November, British and South African rebels were also arrested.
The rescuers started by burning fire inside the underground bottom on the southern island of New Zealand.
As soon as the current currents are released, the high temperature will begin to ease down, said police president Gary Knowles to reporters.
Damn it, warrior!
Does it look like an artist's movie?
Director Nicolas Winding Reffn is trying to get back to the old border with his fighting era "Wahalla Rising".
What kind of audience did Danish director Nicolas Winding Reff think when he hit "Wahalla Rising"?
An occupied Viking fighter with one eye (Mads Mikkelsen) is free from his persecutors and in a large slaughter almost with the supernatural force of his opponents - it sounds ideal for young Panic fans who seek blood action because our hero helps their enemies kill and even their enemies in the river of life when they have a bad feeling.
On the other hand, the One, as it is actually called, will not say a word during the entire film, and the other positions will bring at least one or two flowers or will be allowed to stick to the stresty dying challenges.
It's also quieting and swimming in a very beautiful territory of Scotland, which offers a world of Vikings almost a thousand years ago.
The film is an ideal time for adult audiences of cinema with an interest in existentialism and a very comfortable collection of cameras.
It's good when I have more target groups, it's just bad when they get rid of each other.
Director Winding Refn, after discovering his wild and stylized trilogy about drug dealers "Pusher", is considered to be a Danish version of director Quentina Tarantina, but defends himself to draw his work closer to either more humorous and less brutal art audience.
Most of the artists of the art cinema are obviously allowed to do it everywhere by shooting brains and interiors.
Activists will be involved no later than when the One comes out for free reasons with a group of violent Christian missionaries on board to Jerusalem and will continue to live all eternity in the air and the moon, until it is clearly added to America and still silent there.
It's not surprising, then, that Wallall Rising didn't get to the cinema in Germany and now it was just on DVD.
It's a damage mainly due to beautiful sights, but also because it's a personal phase, places to shed blood, it's hiding a moving film that deserves some attention.
In this film there is no dialogue or specific event, everything is an atmosphere, a hot dream that became a movie.
And it's not for the wildest escape.
Reff won't allow him even the moment of release and slowly breathes him into his cold hugs and a cold hypnotic soundtrack, especially but unwarranted hate that comes from the heart.
Only a little blond boy who helps the One, leaves something like innocence, all the others are tortured by violence.
Of all the unifying horns whose motives will never be explained, which will become time for enemies and transition alliances with a warrior from hell, perhaps the Devil.
It's creating an order, maybe, but it's just for those who've been charged.
"Wahalla Rising" is a fascinating film that is possible to hate and admire, for breaking up, awakening and awakening.
Have a good time.
Land-based work
The IAEA nuclear power agency has a new warning on the secret nuclear programme in Syria.
The country, however, defends the statement - and does not allow control.
Around midnight from 5 to 6 September 2007, at least four Israeli warplanes F-15 I attacked the west quarter building in Syria.
They are located along the Euphrates; the nearest city is 30 kilometres away and the name is Dair as-Saur.
The documents of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) reveal its name when it relates to the reactor which Syria has reportedly installed using North Korea in this quarter hidden in the valley that is away from the flood.
On the basis of a communication from the US-American foreign secret CIA at the end of April 2008, the reactor, also known as the nearby village el-Kibar, would be well built for the production of plutonium - from which nuclear weapons can be installed.
There's nothing else going on in the past 50 years.
The CIA was presenting video with unscathed satellite photos.
Using computer animation, she explained where the components of the reactor could be before the destruction, it should be a reduced copy of the North Korean nuclear power plant model Yongbyon.
In addition, photographs were still presented that showed the building close or even inside.
The reactor was just before the discharge, but still without fuel.
Today, more than three years after the bombing, he doesn't know much more than this time, even the number of accidents has increased.
Former U.S. President George W. Bush recently announced in his mind that the CIA was very sure that Syria was building an el-Kibar reactor before the attack, but it was not based on the fact that there is an "active nuclear weapon programme" in the country.
Some of the reporting services in Europe are even more cautious and are only talking about "the data reactor", even though the CIA's presentations consider it to be "confidential".
They lack clear evidence, just like IAEA.
When asked how sure he has an reactor before him, answered by a senior UN diplomat in summer, IAEA has "a lot of material to solve questions".
In fact, the Syrian "unexploited military buildings" were quickly removed, and the land was also accurately cleared.
However, it was possible to find the IAEA team under the leadership of former Chief Inspector Olli Heinonen in El-Kibar, who was manufactured by people.
In addition, the IAEA received satellite photographs of commercial sellers from the time following an attack that should be more favourable than those presented by the CIA.
Unfortunately, these are not market concerns because he bought only an unknown customer - perhaps Israel.
The IAEA cannot therefore confirm their rights.
Syria has always claimed she never had a secret nuclear program and never set up an reactor.
Uran comes from Israel's weapons. Damascus appeared.
But that's what IAA turned out to be.
Since then, Damascus has refused to discuss the matter - just like the satellites.
In addition, he ordered the auditors to have a second inspection in El-Kibar and access to a few bombed buildings.
But Israel will also be silenced.
"We will never comment on this," confirmed recent official opinion at the time of Governor Ehud Olmert.
The investigation of this case will be carried out without delay since June 2008 and "in view of the Agency's reliability" as the High Western Diplomat in the IAEA headquarters in Vienna - it is a serious breach of the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons which the IAEA is monitoring.
The IAEA considers the key to progress in the matter of three other devices that should be "in functional connection" with the data reactor - and in contrast to it still exists.
At the same time, the auditors did not present any evidence of any of the devices or any of their functions or why they were suspected.
According to the newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung, IAEA is internally designated as Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskanariayah, taken again by nearby cities.
Independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington (Isis) identified these objects and found on satellite imaging complexs that are probably one of the suspects.
Apparently within or near the middle of the military base - for this reason Syria refuses to access these three places.
In Vienna it was reported that the Syrians are afraid of what is called fishing expedition - that the IAEA would be sent before the United States to excavate military bases.
The nuclear detectives were warned about the United States secret service.
The IAEA has bases and satellite photos that between these three places and the fourth quarter of the country was transporting material here and there.
In Vienna, he told a high Western diplomat that at least one facility should be "in relation to fuel production".
However, there is no "no evidence of sensitivable activities" on uranium-riching and new processing; processes necessary for the production of nuclear weapons.
The type of reactor is damaged by a net uranium that is not enriched.
But where the uranium comes from and where the plutonium should be removed from the bomb later, there are only likely estimates on these central issues.
It is also not known whether the thresholds that could cover the important steps are kept at these three places.
The Jacobs disappeared from the surface of a percentage of the cost of freight vehicles, no one seems to have any information on where the judge got it.
Only a few kilometres from El-Kibar, on the other hand, lies the salty valley of al-Tibni, which was allowed by Syria to control in 1998 as an appropriate fund for radioactive waste, the IAEA considers it unlikely.
Former IAEA inspector Robert Kelly gave him a link to the reactor in one analysis of satellite photos for the renowned Jane's Intelligence Review magazine.
Photos from the universe, however, show that after the IAEA requested access, Syria carried out all suspected land jobs and removed large containers.
It could have been an accident, but it didn't help to explain the suspicion.
In addition, the diplomatic circle is talking about the fact that the IAEA has spent many months making a plan for auditors that would allow Syria to keep any military secret - only this approach shows how much interest the auditors have.
In the meantime, the lady also rejected this proposal.
If the Western diplomats in Vienna were still calming down a year ago that the reactor was destroyed, and that's why it doesn't bother, US Ambassador Glyn Davies has been talking about special inspections, which is one of the strongest means that the visual nuclear control agency has.
Chief IAEA Yukiya Amano, who would have to propose an inspection, has already been talking about "the possibilities I'm going to face in the future," but he's still heavy.
This choice poses a major risk: on the one hand, there is a need for most of the IAEA government councils and many of the 35 countries represented have no particular interest in scale.
On the other hand, how does one diplomat warn, "What happens when they don't find anything?"
Love in Wartime
Ever since Angelina Jolie started working on a still-free regime in summer, problems have arisen.
She herself wrote a scenario about a kind story of a woman from Bosnia and Serbia.
He doesn't know much more about it yet, but it's also a source of anxiety.
She kept talking about the woman who is a Muslim, falling in love during the war in Yugoslavia with the Serbian man who raped her.
The Bosnian women's communities immediately protested, so the planned raids from Sarajevo to Hungary immediately moved.
The film was filmed in Hungary and it's in post-production, but in Bosnia it's still protesting.
Bakira Hasecic from the Women's War Victims' Organization wrote through the UN-Organization to help refugees UNHCR Jolie and asked for a meeting with herke, informing now Bosnian news - Jolie is also the UN-Association Organization for Refugees.
It's not exactly diplomatic - she offered women a week ago a meeting in Hungary, which they refused.
The meeting must end in Bosnia, Hasecic said.
In the camps where rape was committed, the loving stories were not perfect, and Jolie's attitude toward the victim reveals enough about the scene.
Her organization therefore recommended that the UN organisation help the refugees to miss Jolie as a tourist, he informs Guardian.
What are the scenes that Jolie wrote?
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture, which was able to read its scene, allowed for smaller savannas in Sarajevo - it is not quite clear why Jolie did not accept it.
The young author points out that in his film he does not follow any political ideas that he has made a great effort to conflict in Yugoslavia to show the terrible consequences of war and to give space to all the parties involved.
In view of the content, it remains unclear.
On the Internet another version of a film that sounds really different: lovers knew each other before the start of the war and meet again when she is as a Bosnian Muslim attracted to the Serbian camp where she serves as a guard.
Which really sounds quite different than "the victim of rape falls in love with his torturer".
The fact that Jolie's film is really starting before the war - it's true.
Jolie says there's a pressure on her that's "not fair and is based on incorrect information".
Now she can be released from Hollywood's hackers: The fact that public illegally online her stage as they have done so many times.
Nothing but gone
It's good for Iry once again tonight.
I don't even know how it's going.
The domestic team dominates much more than its guests from Sweden, Finland and the United States.
The fans are glad to hear the sound of the music, the back of their legs.
Baley-Pub in the Yihoir Corku cave, because the players house tennis balls at a distance of three meters into the green hills - and they meet.
The "Pino Pong" is called a wonderful theatre and it is possible to win 500 euros as a winning prize and for this flight to Las Vegas to the world's master of beer pong in January.
Cian Tanner is a calm guy; this stolen beer game and sustainable computer, it's not too much fun together.
Nevertheless, 26-year-olds try to exercise, respond to the current question of what the future will bring.
His plan isn't playing in Las Vegas, he's going to talk to New Zealand in January.
"I have such a strange feeling," she says.
"It's so far away and I still don't have a job."
However: His friend is already waiting for him in Auckland - "Now she got her honest job as an Eventmanager, maybe it's a good sign," says a young man and smiles.
Because of their bad appearance at home, two of the three Tanner sisters have tried to make themselves happy abroad.
His sister Yvonne, a social worker, is in Sydney, his brother Colin has a place as an IT adviser in London.
Boys go: Like Tanners it looks like it's in many families on the island.
100,000 Irish leave in the country at the time under review, the experts of the Institute for Economic and Social Affairs of the ESRI in Dublin.
They are even numbered by 2015 with 200,000 immigrants.
For such a small country with only 4.5 million inhabitants, this is a major loss.
If the warning is confirmed, it will come to a similar driving wave that has been experienced by Ireland in the 1980s.
After the decade of the rise, which brought great prosperity to Iran, the unhappiness is again spreading.
The economic crisis is mainly affecting young people who have been educated in Iry, who have just survived.
The loss of employment and social status has been considered absurd in these years.
Everyone needed it. The money was over.
In the meantime, three out of ten women and men have been unemployed for up to thirty years.
In the Irish Times there are many letters of readers who complain, "In Ireland everything comes from the head."
"It should come up against politicians and bankers - who can, it goes away and our country will lose this entire generation."
"The last one please shut up."
The law student Leanne Caulfield, president of the Irish student union, sees the future in black because the government only offers no prospects for the future for the young.
"They're reducing minimum wage, but they don't have any strategy to create new jobs," says 20-year-olds.
He observes how her colleagues get tired from one unpaid practice to another.
Her biggest concern is that she'll have to move herself in four years.
"This idea is sad and depressing."
Men like Stephen McLarnon are trying to see this topic positively.
McLarnon organises a "WorkingA BroadExpo" exhibition that offers a comprehensive service on foreign employment.
"Working abroad is an excellent opportunity for beginners on the labour market," says the manager.
On its website are photographs of surfers in Australia and skiers on the snowboard in Canada.
The message is clear: Working abroad is not easy, but freedom and joy.
What it's like to build something somewhere else, she's been in Seán O'Donovan for half a year.
Since the 29-year-old engineer had no work in Ireland, he is now employed with 15 Irish colleagues on construction in Germany.
He's right in Gelsenkirchen's fashion house.
He's going to Hanover in January or Berlin for another project.
O'Donovan will get a lot of money at home in the meantime because he works in extra changes so he can pay his rent at home.
"The situation is sometimes really a bit crazy," she says, when it takes a long time to break the roof of her own house.
"I'm making money in Germany at a house in Ireland where I'm not at all."
He laughs and walks in cold rooms.
The small house is located in a good neighborhood with maintained gardens, parking a large expensive car in the streets.
O'Donovan bought a house together with her sister four years ago for EUR 380,000 - 100 percent financed by loan.
"It was a crazy time, simple money was without a lot of questions," she says.
Is he afraid it wouldn't be good with the loan?
O'Donovan thought for a moment, a hot tea comes down and says, "I don't have kids I should live and I'm young; even if everything goes wrong, I can start again."
The construction engineer doesn't like to say what he's hearing so often.
"No one should be hungry - our situation is not as dramatic as it was before," she says.
"The moment we work abroad, it's not the worst thing that can happen -- maybe then we'll feel like Irva."
He smiles and then tells of his father who left for England after the last economic crisis.
"Seven years later he was back and life went on in Ireland, almost simple."
Cian Tanner likes this idea.
Let yourself be open to the future and just wait for the new life to develop.
He's been working in London for several years, and why shouldn't it be on New Zealand for him and his friend too?
There is, however, one more thing that concerns him today: the celebration of his 27th birthday on Friday in Dublin.
They're afraid she might turn her back on the Christmas celebration.
"There's no emotion," she says, and she's drinking a good beer.
"By the way, it sounds disturbing."
"Let's call it a holiday, absolutely simple, with a few friends, a few drinks, a few here."
Common Practice of Democracy
Support for democracy in Latin America is growing, as is support for private enterprise.
The active activity raises more concerns than unemployment.
And many regions in Brazil consider Brazil to be more influential than the United States.
These are some of the results of the current Latinobarometer study, which was conducted in 18 countries and was published exclusively in The Economist magazine.
Since the research has been regularly carried out since 1995, changes in existing areas can be monitored over the entire area.
In the annual study conducted in September and early October, two related things dominate.
The first of these is that Latin America has a relatively good mood.
The second is to increase the stability of the positions towards democracy and its key institutions.
Support for democracy in several countries in the South American Pacific has grown significantly (see Table 1).
For example, in Peru, where economic growth is on average 6% annually since 2002, democracy support has grown from at least 40% in 2005 to 61% in this year.
It also grew up in Mexico, where the economy flourished after the deep decline in production in the long term.
But only about half of the questions raised in Mexico and Brazil, two of the most common areas, are the conviction of democracy, which is a regional average (see figure 2).
About 44% of respondents over the entire area spoke peace with how democracy works in practice in their country, it is the same number as in the long year, but compared to 2001, when 25% were treated, it is a major increase (Figure 3).
The total of 34% indicated that they rely on snow in their country and 45% trusts the government again about the same numbers as last year, but this is a major difference compared to 2003 (17% and 24%).
Ten years ago, democracy in Latin America was undergoing an economic crisis.
Support was likely caused during the global financial crisis because many Latin American countries suffered only a short recession and enjoyed a strong resurrection.
In addition, a stronger social security network has helped to protect the poor.
(The Economic Commission for the United Nations Organisation for Latin America announced this week that the proportion of Latin Americans living in poverty increased in 2009 only slightly and 32% again this year.)
But it changes in a wide spectrum from land to land (see figure 4).
The strong economic performance of Brazil and the popularity of its outgoing President, Luise Inácia Luly da Silvy, are reflected in the broad sense of progress.
This situation is more rare in Mexico and Central America, where the recession was more serious and the situation of violent criminal activity deteriorated.
At the very second stage since the start of the investigation, more respondents have seen Latin America as the most important problem of crime more than unemployment (see figure 5).
The Group of 31% says that either they or their close relatives have become victims of criminal activity in the London year, but this is a decrease compared to the 38% data from last year and is also the lowest number since 1995.
The greater economic performance is reflected in growing support for private enterprises and the market economy: around 71% of respondents across the region say that private enterprises are necessary for development, which has grown by 56% since 2007 (see Figure 6).
About 58% agree that the market economy is the only system that enables their countries to develop, this percentage has grown from 47% last year.
Interestingly, 62% of Venezuelan respondents have the same view (and 80% support private companies), although their left president, Hugo Chávez, has many private companies.
Brazil is a country which has a leading position in the area as mentioned by 19% of respondents (over 18% in the long year), followed by the United States (9%, around the long year without change) and Venezuela (9%, around 11% in the long year)
However, the United States is considered the most influential country of respondents in Mexico and in most of Central America, while Venezuela enjoys its success in Ecuador, the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
Criticised choices
No one expected the general elections in Haiti on November 28th will be perfect.
But they were much worse than outsiders who are trying to help the country get scared.
The volleyballs were full of urine and repeated voting, voting lines scattered across the channels, breaking up the volleyball rooms and intimidation.
Free rooms opened after hours of delay.
Many Haitians, including many who have moved because of the cold earthquake, traveled around and tried to find out where they could go.
Some of them finally gave it up.
More than ten presidential candidates, including a number of alleged pre-trials, complained that it was underway and called after the election.
The protests, some of which were violent, spread throughout the country.
However, Edmond Mulet, a highly-established UN official in Haiti, declared that "in many respects there was a pretty good choice."
Observers from the Organization of the United States and the Caribbean Community said very carefully that "they believe that these inequalities, no matter how serious, did not have to break the process".
In other words, the show continues.
The electoral authority whose opposition votes are binding on René Preval, the non-popular outgoing president and his candidate Jude Celestino, shall notify the preliminary results on 7 December.
The expected trigger file is scheduled for ice.
Not all popular hopes are lost.
Two former opposition candidates Michel Martelly, rapper and Mirlande Manigat, former lady, resigned from their original challenge to be declared free of charge.
The problem may arise, however, if Mr Célestin, who has little or no support between the voters, will be designated by the Electoral Commission because he has obtained a decision-making file.
As a result of a number of heart attacks and more than 1 million people who are still living in the states after the earthquake, there were fears that the voluntary participation would be low.
After all, many Haitians wanted to do so, but because of the disorganization, they were banned from doing so.
The total of 250 000 evidence of identity which are necessary for voting remains short before the elections.
There's a lot in the bag.
The gifts see the election of legitimate and popular governments as a key step in the reconstruction of Haiti.
And it's clear, then, that the Haitians are on their own.
After the syringes into the center
In the weeks when she got here, critically, Argentine president Cristina Fernández, from public sympathy when her popularity increased from 20 to more than 50%, the highest ever since she was elected in 2007.
Despite this success in the successful campaign for the second functional period in the elections next year, it may depend on whether Mrs. Fernández is compromising her late husband, predecessor and political partner, Néstor Kirchner.
And everything will be based on these signs.
Mr. Kirchner, who continued in economic policy and after his wife was successful as president, was accustomed to drawing up budgets that reflected tax revenue, economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the first couple to lose other income for freedom.
Ms. Fernández's government has lost most of the year in the London Congress.
But the opposition broke out and was further destabilized at the death of Mr. Kirchner on 27 October.
Some members of the ruling political party of Peranist joined Mrs Fernández.
But after the catholic meetings (which came to the falsification and prosecution of corruption by the government), Congress was unable to accept the budget for 2011.
"I don't agree with this," said the president.
The budget for 2010 will also be paid for the next year, while the President will have more space to spend on freedom.
The economy is overcrowding: this year it is likely to grow by up to 9%.
The official inflation rate is now 11.1%, but many private estimates and committees are talking about the number approaching 30%.
Mr Kirchner, who joined the office in 2003, when Argentina was hit by an economic collapse, placed the priority on growth and poverty reduction rather than on inflation control.
He refused to contact MMF, challenged the private sector and cleared INDIC, a statistical agency that was involved in monitoring official inflation statistics.
Can President Fernández now calm down this policy?
She called for a consultation between private companies and committee transfers.
And her officials say they want to limit breast growth by 18% next year.
The economy was supported by a rise in world prices for the export of Argentine agricultural products.
But inflation broke down the growth based on a major devaluation in 2002.
This may be the reason why President Fernández tells us he wants to renew the cash financial links to the rest of the world.
At the beginning of this year, the government established an agreement with debt holders who previously refused to restructure the debt that Argentina had not paid in 2001.
Ms. President Fernández is now in the hands of an agreement with the religious governments that are grouped into the Paris Club, which owes $6.7 billion.
Kirchners always insisted that this reality not be controlled by MMF as usual.
But last month, Amado Boudoudou, the Minister of Economy announced that the Fund would provide "technical assistance" to design a new national consumer price index that would remind you of the introduction to the INDEC clean.
It is still unclear whether Mrs. Fernández will want to remain in politics after the end of the functional period when her husband is no longer on her side.
If he wants to stay, he needs to get support from the middle class, which is motivated by Kirchnerism.
At the time of the return of Argentinans from the summer leave that they have in March, a wave of sympathies will fall.
If he wants to win another election, he will have to decide whether there will be no need to speak quietly about the many views his wife held in politics.
Half-life for China
The Taiwanese volunteers are closer to the strong link.
How does Taiwan feel about his big brother across the sea?
More than 7.5 billion voters, 70% of the eligible people, voted on 27 November of old age and city councils in five city councils, which can be considered to be the wider evaluation of President Ma Ying-jeu.
Mr. President Ma is the sole representative of the feelings which are firmly dominated and firmly rooted in business relations, including agreements on partial free trade, in the largest comparison of relations with China since 1949.
Mr. President Ma has passed the test, but only carefully.
Although his party Kuomintang (KMT) finished winning three out of five senior officials, he was unable to win most of the votes.
According to this Democratic Progressive Party, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which is founded on major independence of Taiwan, has received almost 50% of all votes against 45% of KMT.
If it were the presidential election, President Ma would have trouble.
From the time he was elected two years ago, the voting share of his party decreased by approximately 8%.
First, the DPP party was together with KMT in the city councils.
The volleyballs were played as a majority of Taiwan's volleyballs, which include cheap volleyball cars and mass gathering with trainers against the girls.
The participation was even a mandatory secret attempt on the subject.
Sean Lien, son of Lien Chana, the honest president of KMT, was acting for KMT candidates in the pre-election evening.
The man from the scene shot young Mr. Lien clean up his face, hurt her, and killed a monster.
It was not quite determined whether the gunman was meant to hurt Mr. Lien or dispute with the candidate.
In any case, Tsai Ing-wen, the leading DPP, claims that the shooting affected the choices, the suspicion falls on DPP and leads voters towards KMT.
About the only big win in the campaign was China.
It was remarkable how she remained behind the issue of her own strength.
Instead, the candidates focused on plans for state housing construction and job creation.
Taiwan usually enjoys its de facto independence and hates the military threats of China.
KMT therefore tends to avoid links to the government in Beijing.
But this time DPP also left behind the promotion of anti-Chinese positions.
It is a response to reality and it is aware that Chinese trade is essential for Taiwan's economic survival.
Mr. Ma, on his behalf, confirmed that China's policy is most acceptable to Taiwan.
From the Beijing government, it can be expected to continue in commercial payments, together with its strategy to get Taiwan back into the state.
China did not waste any time sending a consignor to Taipei to order a sum of investment protection and medical cooperation.
Of course, I would also like to see political integration, but the order.
It will be better to wait for the presidential elections in 2012.
The DPP page has, in any case, revealed itself.
Two years ago she was at the wrong level: her former leader, Chen Shui-bian, was sent to prison on charges of corruption.
The president in 2000-08 was the mayor and the residence of clear independence.
But under the leadership of Ms. Tsai, a new generation has developed that is balanced and DPP is working hard to attract experts and young people.
Ms. Tsai was summoned as a DPP candidate to the president, for example Su Tseng-change, who was suspended from office under Mr. Chen.
Their sides are now doing their best to show that they can work with Beijing as well.
Ms Tsai published plans for research institutes that serve as a contact point between DPP and China, assuming that their conduct can be conducted without prior conditions.
Ms. Tsai informs the Taiwanese public that her party represents a "trustworthy alternative" to Mr. Ma's enchanted approach to China.
Mr. Chen seems to be upset with this idea.
In a declaration issued from its objectives, he expressed the view that DPP candidates would be better able to maintain that Taiwan is a separate country.
He even ordered Mr. Su, the pragmatics not to apply for the president.
But without Mr. Chen's influence, DPP will fight for the choice of potential candidates.
KMT is entitled to search for its own people.
Mr. Ma's assessment was wrong, despite the overdue pace of economic growth; KMT candidates did not want to go to the campaign with him.
His unwillingness seems to be based in particular on unemployment and deepening the gap between the rich and the poor.
Speaking KMT says he's reorganizing his office, just like the local side.
Strongly applied proposals for Taiwan's support for connecting friendly relationships are limited.
At the same time, most Taiwanese citizens consider economic integration with China to be inevitable.
According to Antonia Chianga, a prominent publisher, "the point from which there is no return has already been raised."
Nominations at Grammy Price: Jazzó song Esperanza Spalding is a surprise in the category of the best new artist
Meeting the President's request and the people must legally pay attention.
Esperanza Spalding, 26-year-old jazz bassist and singer chosen by President Obama to attend the Nobel Peace Prize ceremony in 2009, is marked as one of the surprises of Grammy's price this year with the appointment of the best new artist in the category.
In view of the fact that Spalding was a celebrated station on the 2008 scene when her album "Esperanza" was released, the nomination came a little later, but it is in accordance with the Grammy rule when the artist cannot issue more than three albums before "it is established a public identity of the artist."
Her ambitious album from 2010 "Chamber Music Society" certainly marked the step forward and thanks to its ageless vocal style and hand-cuffed hand with the elements of pop, funk and Latin influence, we can talk about Spalding as a success that was recorded in 2003 by Norah Jones, the closest equivalent to the voter in Grammy who are looking for similar work in this category in recent years.
The Jinde grammy jurists rightly appreciate the album Vijay Iyer Trio "Historicity" in the category of instrument album, which is exciting, freshly driving the album which was a hot favorite in the long year.
Iyer will compete against the album by experienced saxophonist James Moody "Moody 4B" and key player John Beasley "Positootly."
Thrombone Shorty, a chraptic favorite from New Orleans and a popular host in the HBO "Treme" series, was rated in the current category of racing, which is otherwise awarded by Stanley Clark, John McLaughlin and Jeff Lorber.
The Darcy James Argue's Secret Society has gained a number of reputations in the category of large files when the comer's jazz Children Ensemble and still brave Dave Holland, whose live album with the village "Pathways" created a beautiful example of how he can have a bassist free hand as a hat.
Nominations Grammy Awards: Michael Daugherty, Steve Mackey leads in the category of classical music
The nominations for classical music at the 53rd Grammy production prices have a wide range of musicians and composers from around the world.
Michael Daugherty and his "Deus Ex Machine" have a key and orchestra, with five points number and Steve Mackey with his album "Dreamhouse", an eclectic orchestra work, with a number of three points.
Among those appointed by the association in South California was the Estonian composer Arvo Pärt and his Symphonie No. 4 "Los Angeles", the work that was ordered through Los Angeles Philharmonic and started at the Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2009.
Founder at L.A. Avner Dorman and his Mandolin Concerto also has an opportunity for evaluation.
Nominations in classical music are divided into 13 categories including orchestral, opera, collection and solo recordings.
The category for the producer of classical music for the year has five named Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin and James Malinson.
Nominations on the classic album were obtained by Bruckner and his Symphonie No. 3 and 4 by Royal Concertebouw Orchestra; Daugherty and his "Deus Ex Machine" and "Metropolis Symphony" by Nashville Symphony Orchestra; Steven Mackey and his "Dreamhouse" from the Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Synergy Vocals; "Sacrificium - the Art of the Castrati" by various artists; and Verdiho "Requiem" by Chicago Symphony Orchestra and Chorus.
As regards the category of operations, named Berg a "Lulu" by Orchestra of the Royal Opera House; Adolf Hasse a "Marc Antonio and Cleopatra" by Ars Lyrica Houston; Kaija Saariaho and "L'Amour de Loin" by Deutsches Symphonie-Orchester Berlin; Rodion Shchedrin and "The Enchanted Wanderer" by Orchestra and Chorus of the Mariner; and Arthur Sullivan and "Ivanhoe" by BBC National Orchestra of Wales.
Among the developers who are named on Grammy for the modern collection are Pert for Symphony No. 4, Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machine," Hans Werner Henze for "Appassionattoto Plus," Magnus Lindberg for "graffiti" and Shchedrin for "The Enchanted Wanderer."
Pärt's Symphony No. 4 had a prime minister at the Disney Hall in January 2009 at the exhibition, which was hosted by L.A. Philharmonic under the Esa-Pekka Salonena.
About 30 minutes of work is called "Los Angeles" and is awarded to former red magnet Mikhail Khodorkovsky, who is imprisoned in Russia.
Dorman and Mandolin Concerto were named for the instrumental performance of a soloist with orchestra.
The editor of L.A. stated that he had written 15 minutes' work especially for the mandoline interpreter Avi Avi Avi Avila, who was performing a concert with Metropolis Ensemble while sitting in New York.
"I've written it through tons from the Middle East and many North African rhythms," Dorman said in a telephone conversation.
Director Pierre Boulev, 85, received nominations in the category for orchestral performance, for the management of Chicago Symphony when recording Stravinsk’s work.
Among the instrumental soloists who received the nominations are planners Nelson Freaire and Marc-Andre Hamelin; varhaník Paul Jacobs; household list Julia Fischer; and Harfist Sarah Schuster Ericsson.
Among the so-called vocal soloists were only women this year, namely Anne Sofie Von Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucia Duchonová, Vivica Genaux and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the class transition category, she got the name of Soprano Jesse Norman for her "Roots - My Life, My Song."
The planned museum in Temecule receives approval from the planning committee
The planned mosque in Temecule received one-time support from the local planning committee after more than five hours of frequent public witnessing.
Critics attacked the project that promotes terrorism and will lead to a stop of trade.
However, the courts decided on Wednesday night that the new religious centre is in accordance with local laws and will be aesthetically effective.
"Many good people have come to support this project - Christians, Jews you remember," said Hadi Nael, president of the Islamic Centre in Temecul Valley, on Thursday morning.
"I am very proud of it as an American citizen."
"This means that justice always wins."
"The opposition is minimal" added.
"Those who are against, they only shout out loud."
"We have really great people in our valley."
The meeting started at six o'clock in the evening and lasted almost midnight when most of the time they had discussions with people who were for or against the center. These voices were equally divided, the Press-Enterprise says.
She continued her discussion on the Internet news pages.
"America no longer exists," one comment said.
"We are the planet's opium with Socho's freedom to fall into the sand."
"America's clumsy."
The planned Islamic Centre also launched protests in other parts of the country, including the vicinity of Ground Zero, a place of tragedy that took place on 11 September 2001, when terrorist attacks took place in New York.
In Temecula Valley I have Mahmoud Harmoush condemned violence.
His religious village, which read about 135 families, joined the Riverside County after a year without an incident, but he built a bigger and more suitable space than the storage space he owned together with the producer of filter systems.
The new mix of 24,943 square feet in the Mediterranean architecture will also have two mines and grow to a height of 43.
She should take a seat at a 4,32 acres [4.32 acres] at Nicolas Road, about three kilometers east of the Chapral High School.
Opposers can still appeal to the City Council regarding the project.
Microbes with resistance to the arsenic increase the possibility of new types of life on Earth or elsewhere
The discovery of an amazing bacteria that can use the arsenic as one of its animals expands the space to search for new forms of life on Earth and may still be.
Researchers have discovered an unusual bacteria here on Earth and claim that it is a sign that life has its potential beyond the main elements that have been considered and basic.
"This organism has two powers."
"May grow either by phosphorus or arsenic."
"This reality is very special, but it is not evidence that it is a form of "foreign" life," commented Paul C. W. Davies of Arizona State University, a co-author of news that appeared on Thursday in the online journal Science.
Long considered necessary for the life of six main ingredients - coal, water, mercury, oxygen, phosphorus and cheese.
However, scientists have found that bacteria discovered in Mono Lake, California, are able to continue growing after they are replaced by fossil fuels.
"It's starting to surprise you what's still possible," said Ariel D. Anbar from Arizona State University, the news correspondent.
This finding is important for finding life outside the Earth, because researchers must be able to recognize life and know how life can look, Anbar said.
The study focuses on the microbes found on Earth.
However, the report on this newspaper was published to discuss it, which did not reveal the details of the finding, caused a wide range of speculation on the Internet that the report denied the discovery of foreign life.
It's not like that.
The discovery "shows that other planetary organisms can be able to use other elements that trigger biochemistry and that now the elements we consider as 'standard' must not be so essential for life," explained Charles Cockell, professor at Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute, Open University, Milton Keynes, Great Britain.
Cockell wasn't part of the research team.
"This work is unusual because it shows the replacement of one component to another in basic biochemistry and biochemical structures," adds Cockell.
It wasn't an appropriate find.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon from the Astrobiological Institute at NASA, which conducted the study, focused on Mono Lake because it shows high levels of arsenic.
Arsen and phosphorous are very similar elements, considering that the microbe, which is exposed to both elements, can be able to replace one another.
"Arzen is most vulnerable because his chemical behavior is very similar to phosphorous."
"The result is that organisms can make it very difficult to separate these elements from themselves."
"But Arsen is so different that just like phosphorous it doesn't work. When it gets into the organism, it starts to work in biochemical processes," Anbar explained.
Scientists gather bacteria known as GFAJ-1 and exhibit them at increasing concentrations of arsenic, which are bacteria capable of adapting and growing.
Microbes grow better when phosphorus is formed, but given that they can also survive with rewarded are increased the possibility that the form of life used by the arsenic may naturally occur, whether on Earth or on another planet or on the moon where the arsenic is more common.
Jamie S. Foster, an expert microbiology assistant at the University of Florida, said that the idea of an Arsenian that could be replaced by a phosphorous is not new but never an example that this reality would prove.
Arzen was more common in earlier times on Earth, she said, and so scientists speculated that they could use it in earlier forms of life.
"This means that there could be other ways of creating life, not just the way it was created in the early Earth," Foster, who was not part of Wolfe-Simon's research team.
Research has been supported by NASA, the Ministry of Energy and the National Institute of Health
The remaining dog thefts were found in Compton
The remaining two of the four show dogs that someone stole from the Bellflower motel were found.
Four exhibition dogs - two cats and a large pembroke corgis - disappeared on Tuesday when someone stole Chevrolet Express from 2006, where they spent the night at the Bellflower 6 motel.
Two dogs were found in the middle of the afternoon and two dogs were left in the middle of the evening, said Steve Whitmore, speaking from the police department for the Los Angeles area.
"The good news is that dogs are okay," said Whitmore.
"They're in good shape."
"They were handed over to their rightful owners."
Whitmore refused to say where exactly the dogs were found in which location he did not share any detailed information about their finding.
"The investigation continues."
"We don't want to talk about it," said Whitmore.
"We keep the rules."
Dog owners, Kristin Rickard and David Peek were not arrested to be able to express themselves.
They were very happy when their two cats found themselves in a trap in Downey in the middle of the afternoon.
The sheriff's agents found out and two dogs in Compton.
Akity Trace, three-year-old dog Trace and 10-month-old Fen Didi, were unharmed, sent by the authorities.
But Bunny and Peter, the Welsh Corgi Pembroke Rickard and Peek tribes, who were planning to participate in this week's district competitions in the name of their Japanese owners, remained undeterred until they were revealed later in the middle.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, are in town this weekend to attend the AKC/Eukanuba National Championship on Long Beach, where they were planning to show Trace.
The other dogs were to compete in other competitions planned in the days before AKC/Eukanuba show, Peek said The Times in the middle.
South California is just one stop on a monthly trip of pair after dog exhibitions.
On Monday night, Peek and Rickard entered the motel.
They often sleep in motels and park their car in front of the room window.
They also took three dogs - the boxer shop, Parson Russell's territory and the British harbor - who stayed with them in the motel room.
Akity and Pembroke Welsh corgis left them in the car where they should be colder.
They opened the window a little bit so dogs can have enough clean air in the car.
Peek and Rickard reported stolen cars at 6:00 a.m. in the morning.
Peek said he'd offer a reward to anyone who's gonna lead them to lost dogs.
It wasn't clear on Thursday whether the prices would be made.
Lev is again ready to run now when the restructuring of MGM receives final approval from the court
After 18 months of shock and uncertainty, MGM finally got green so it could start again.
On Thursday, the Federal insolvency judge in New York officially blessed "before the packaged" of creditors' plan to pay about $5 billion debt and clear the road for 86 years old entertainment company, which is focusing on the production and production of films and television shows.
Fourthly, that the plan meets the requirements of the US competition order does not leave any legal obstacles to MGM to re-start Spyglass Entertainment Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, which will become the main lead of the focused study.
The number of employees is up to 320 of the originals over 400.
MGM shall not be excluded from Chapter 11, until JPMorgan Chase is not eligible for planned financial resources enabling loans of up to $500 million to finance new MGM operations and production.
Now it's about connecting to an investment bank that needs 75 million dollars alone and funding is expected around half a quarter of a day.
The restructuring process started in May 2009, when Moelis & Co.’s investment bank was hired to advise on how to manage its finances, as management fought to allow payment of interest rates of $300 million per year.
This August, President Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, former director general of Enron's company and a business expert known as Krispy Krem Doughnuts.
Moelise and Coopera’s attempts to solve MGM’s financial problems and 140 students lasted a long time before expected.
After a few months of discussion, the parties agreed that by the end of 2009, the company would be able to sell.
Although the auctions attracted several stakeholders, none of them were willing to pay $2 billion in the US dollars plus the money required by the creditors.
At the end of the year, everything was back on the drawing board, and the MGM team started working on the restructuring plan. After months of discussion and internal disputes, the plan was finally approved by the end of October.
When MGM is officially triggered by competition over the next few weeks, Moelise and Coopera will receive multi-million-dollar bonuses for their work.
The company Moelis & Co., which has already received $1.2 million, will receive $9.5 million.
Cooper companies, which are in charge of their services, which run $375 000 a month, will receive a reward for success, namely " Success Fee" of $4 million.
Barber and Birnbaum are planning to renew the production in MGM, which was published in this year only one film and to submit a total of seven or eight films to be released by the beginning of 2012.
They are also planning to share in financing two films that will be proposed for the book "Hobit", along with Warner Bros.
The studio needs to meet a special loan between 265 million and 275 million dollars to finance its share of these two films that will be directed by Peter Jackson.
Investor Carl Icahn, who owns around 18% of MGM debt, was looking for the possibility of studying with Lions Gate Entertainment, where he is the largest shareholder.
However, recent dealings between the two companies have not been reached in the agreement.
Technology players who will keep your budget in balance
The leading candidate for this year is the most amazing iPad player, followed by the video hardware system. In both cases, however, it is one of the most outstanding principles in the budget for the gift.
Consider that for the price of one iPad you can buy five round BMX for $99 and one game Kinect is equal to 10 coral reefs or about 48 Play-Doh.
But there's a way to keep your budget in balance.
I recently visited three national players - Wall-Mart, Toys "R" Us and BJ's Wholesale Club - and watched what electronic players I could buy for less than $80.
It was immediately clear that Moore's law works; annual technology players have a lot more energy than last year's prices.
While relatively few new players have appeared with related websites, two of the most famous players of this type, Webkins and Club Penguin, offer more.
The number of players with button batteries is increased, as is the number of players with battery bidders.
Here are some recommendations.
(All the prices mentioned are from Toys "R" Us, except for cases otherwise specified.)
Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, 13$, 3 years old) are a floating animal that sings when you press them quickly.
At one press, the animal will issue a tone and the other press will begin to create a song.
If you buy more than one, they'll sing together and harmonically.
Warning: Once you start fishing, you cannot stop.
The best choice in the combination of song and dance is Dance Star Mickey (Fisher-Price, $60, from 2 years old)
Last year I borrowed 14 handy animated girls from Elmo Live technology, who are able to play the Simon Says game and also able to play the month course thanks to their innovative, blockive noses.
Children test Mickey's dance instructor's play, even though their parents complain of a lack of voice control.
If you're a 80-year-old child, you might remember Alphie, one of the first computer-learning games.
He's back, (Hasbro/Playscool, $40, for children from 3 years of age), with a bag full of cash cards that are designed to change the car into a pleasure with a self-employed, funny work bag.
If you send a smartphone to your child, there are three independent options.
VTech's MobiGo ($60, for children from 3 to 8 years) is the easiest option with easy use, with a keyboard square, although games do not have as effective training as Leoster Explorer ($70, for children from 3 to 12 years), the first major change in the Leapforg Leapster series, with a new and clear display.
No version is compatible with older units.
iXL from Fisher-Price ($90, for children from 3 to 7 years of age) uses the iTunes-like system to introduce herr and e-books and has a slot on SD card that allows family photos to be displayed.
And finally, Scrabble Flash ($30, Hasbro, for children under 8 years) is a five-pound file that is not larger than a doll box, each of which has a LED display.
The aim is to create words by placing a box before the start of time; it is great for competition in improvised creation of words.
More and more players have at least some kind of online connection.
To the highest extent, two Webkins and Club Penguin players were represented in the games.
If you want your child to buy online games from Club Penguin, you can choose for example Disney Club Penguin 2" Mix 'N Match Figure Pack, $5$, for children from 6 to 12 years old), which contains coins with hidden code.
When you activate the online code, your child will get enough credit in the Club Penguin store on two items.
This could include a pickle or Puffle animal.
About a little bigger than your toothbrush shield is Hexbug Nano (10$, for children over 5 years), the latest of a series of microbots on a button battery.
Brouk is moving fast on 12 vibrating silicone legs in an appropriate direction.
It's fun when you make a mess out of your shirt and see if he can find a way out.
He's very brave too.
That one of us was able to fall off the kitchen table and spend some time in the back of our dog.
Introduction of the most attractive police controls in China
As a city military instructor, Tang Shenbin walked around the village, checked his orders carefully and issued orders in favor of the military authority.
He wanted the female members - the Chinese state-of-the-art leaders of the city order, beaten and raped for their firm steps and violent entertainment - to bring some idea to the minds of those around them.
"Get up right now!"
"Shut up!"
Show them how beautiful girls look!
Four large young girls in white gloves and the same olive caps and panties stood in sight.
Four black boots are sorted according to rules.
The four coverings of the head sit perfectly on the hair that are perfectly tied with blue and white stems.
"I personally think they look average," said Mr. Tang.
"The models are beautiful."
More than one government has tried to revive the image of city inspectors in China.
One city ordered new branches to have high school education.
The province of GuangDong has changed the sedo-green uniforms to a much more attractive fashion.
Wuhan, in central China, rewarded strong-armed views: in 2009, one report stated that 50 officials had accidentally turned their cars around and looked at their owners while the domestic salesman collapsed after half an hour and separated.
Xindu, a city period of 680,000 people in Chengdu, chose operations in the main picture.
Since 2003, he has complemented his urban police with 13 women who have been selected specifically from his point of view, orientation and youth.
The aim is to show the police' roughest, female side as well.
Unfortunately, even Scarlett Johansson himself would have trouble getting into secret Chinese urban groups.
They would argue for good reason.
Unlike the police, these police officers are allowed only to apply for city registration, to issue accounts and other administrative procedures.
But the Chinese media often capture a different reality.
In January 2008, police inspectors from the province of Hubei identified an unparticipated viewer to the death after using their cell phone to find out how they start in the early hours of protest against the warehouse.
In the London year, police training was conducted in Beijing, the manual for this training was stolen and placed on the Internet. In the manual was another description of how to effectively remove the cartridge without blood.
This year he got a domestic dealer with melouna in Shanghai into a wheelchair with five police officers and suffered injuries to the left part of his brain.
One video game full of violence that can be downloaded online shows Chinese police how they attack street vendors.
"Chengguan scared the government," China Daily, a national edition, said in London a year after another debate on tactics.
The paper was "very thoroughly cleaned up."
Skeptics say that such access is not enough.
After a period of interest in eight new women's police officers in October, Initiator The Beijing Evening News asked whether women have real obligations or are just discrimination.
The answer seems to be from both sides.
The period required women aged 18 to 22 with a good position and "five features face in the right proportion."
Adjectives should be higher than average - above 1.6 meters.
The 26-year-old service is mandatory.
Officials say that work is too psychological for women over 25 years.
"Their images are important," said one named police officer on Rednet.com, such as government websites.
"The candidates must first demonstrate the external qualities which then determine other, including the height, weight, face features, etc."
Then comes a series of behaviors and internal quality.
Women are like flowers, he said, "In addition to being bonded, they will have other responsibilities."
Zheng Lihua, the deputy director of the district, does not agree much with this description.
But he pointed out that higher requirements are common in China for other employment, and that is both genders.
The same as the requirement for direct features of the face.
This means that the issue of good looks is between China and the subject of discussion.
Healthy delivery or freezing is certainly free of charge.
"We can't afford to serve a chrysali or a back man," said Mr. Zheng.
"His image wouldn't be good."
Liu Yi, who has a look at Baoguang village near the monastery, has 22 years of age, faces like an apple and a perfectly designed mouth.
It doesn't seem like the focus on her view could have had a social impact, she said.
"Do you think I look sexy in this uniform?" she asked with an ironic look.
The 21-year-old Xu Yang says, "Our task is to represent the city."
They don't have intentions against their limited performance, they say, because their career ambitions are bigger than just getting businessmen into the streets where they can do their work.
Each morning, the group stands against more than ten traders who run the sand or on the wheels and tries to sell as much as canyons and tofu meat before they are avoided.
"Mr. Wang, you have to go."
"We've told you so many times!" said Ms. Xu, when the trader started running, and in time he left his car with a truck with nozzles.
The police describe their duties as more monotonous than verbal.
"Every day goes basically about it," said Huang Jing, 20, who studies in his free marketing.
"Great routine."
One reason is that women's police don't have the right to be their men's opponents so that they can entertain the goods of the seller.
They can only threaten that the reality of this is reported by their male leaders.
The trend is then to protect them from sudden public manifestations of hostility against the official device which are common throughout China.
This year hundreds of people in Kunmingu, the capital of Yunnan Province, gathered after spreading false reports of the police killing the seller.
More than ten police officers or police officers were injured in night hours; 14 government vehicles were turned over or burned.
Xindu's still out of such violence.
But rest can be guaranteed only by the distress.
Just two blocks from the quiet Baoguang village where the police were watching this morning, more than 50 people were gathered on the street.
The police had a motorcycle that was repaired on a walker instead of inside the store, as required by the rules.
The owner of the car could cry as he wanted.
15 minutes' walk before a police officer, who was formed to flee, with his vehicle pickles and quickly walk away with his motorcycle and his owner.
Li Xuedong, 40, coordinator of the male group, stayed behind, his white badge turned around to hide his name.
Like female police, coordinators are men over 40 years of age who have only a helpful role.
Unlike them, they are not trained to maintain and highlight images.
"Sometimes we fight verbalally."
"Sometimes we fight physically," said Mr. Li forever.
"Most of them are the public that starts with it."
The prosecutors won't charge Senator Ensign
The prosecutors of the Ministry of Justice cleared Senator John Ensign of a criminal charge involving his case with an ex-computer for the campaign and his efforts to secure lobby, announced in the middle of the senator's case.
The decision concludes the most serious legal threat that Mr Ensign, a non-Vadish Republican, has faced and has been considered as a possible Republican candidate for the president for 2012. His affair has reached national titles and has damaged his career.
Mr Ensign's office said he was "very happy" by a decision that followed almost a year's investigation.
The Senator could still face disciplinary action at the Senate Ethics Commission.
Lawyers Mr. Ensign said that the Ministry of Justice "We have been informed that Senator Ensign will no longer be the subject of investigation and that there is no plan to bring further charges against him in this regard."
The Ministry of Justice refused to express its case.
The decision was surprising for many ethical lawyers outside the Ministry of Justice who claimed that there is serious evidence that Mr Ensign was preparing a violation of the federal lobbying ban.
Talks, e-mails and other documents published in October 2009 in New York Times indicated that Mr. Ensign helped Douglas Hampton, one of his assistants, to secure the lucrative lobby that would lead to the silence of Mr. Hampton and his wife, Cynthia, about the senatorial relationship with her.
Mrs. Hampton used to work as a storekeeper at Ensign.
Mr. Ensign contacted a number of political supporters to find work for Mr. Hampton and supported their views after Mr. Hampton's employment to hunt for them, so many documents and discussions were introduced.
As Hampton was recently assisted by Mr Ensign, he was excluded from the law by his former employer or Senate for a year.
The ethics experts claim that the unusual arrangement between Mr Ensign and Mr Hampton, who were prior to the business of friends, appeared in conflict with the prohibition of lobbying.
Among the evidence that was published "it was revealed that there was a clear case of a violation of the law," said Stanley Brand, a Washington lawyer who specializes in the selection of clients who are under investigation by the government.
While the Ministry of Justice refused to explain the reasons for the decision on the matter of Senator Ensigna, Mr. Brand and other ethics specialists said that the ministry is careful with regard to political complaints, following a large number of accidents, including the decision to stop the application against former Senator Ted Stevens in the middle of a state-owned case.
Federal claimants "clearly hid weapons", said Melanie Sloan, Executive Director of the Civil Service for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington), a legal group that presented a number of difficulties against Mr Ensignov.
"It shows that the laws do not apply to high-level government officials," he added.
Paul Coggins, Chief Justice Mr Ensigna, told him that on Monday he was calling the State Representative of the Ministry of Justice and then the second day, and told him that the ministry had not been looking for any charges against his clients.
Mr Ensigna's team is working with the complainant in an effort to convince him that the senator, as his office packed in the medium-term statement, "has acted in accordance with the law."
Mr Coggins refused to clarify the legal arguments which he presented to the representatives of the State.
"I don't like to look at the details of my discussions with the Ministry of Justice except that we think they made the right decision," he said.
Last month the Federal Electoral Commission decided to stop self-examination investigation, in which the ethical group accuses that Ensign Hampton's parents' payment of $96,000 violated the federal electoral law.
The Voluntary Commission stated that it had not sufficient evidence to prove that the money had not changed anything but a gift.
One company for which Mr Ensign helped Mr. Hampton find a lobbying job was NV Energy, the main Norwegian company that supported the long-term senator.
An e-mail from December 2008 showed that after Mr. Hampton started acting as a lobbyist, leading Mr. Ensigna - John Lopez - communicated with Mr. Hampton and told him that he "bushed" to the Ministry in relation to the subject under discussion.
Mr. Ensign also participated in lunch with Mr. Hampton and another non-Water client, Allegiant Air and selected the Minister of Transport to discuss a meeting on behalf of the airline after Mr. Hampton's hire for lobbying.
When the case report first appeared last year, Mr Ensign apologized to his voters and rejected his position as the fourth president of the Republic in Senate.
After several months of stagnation, Mr Ensign told the rapporteurs two weeks ago that he was planning to participate in the third electoral period in the Senate.
In the report that Mr Ensign is no longer aimed at investigating his spokesman, Mr. Jennifer Cooper, saying that the Senator hopes that the Ethics Commission will soon follow the Ministry of Justice and complete the whole investigation.
"Sentator Ensign is pleased to continue his violent work on behalf of the non-Vadish people," she continued.
Calling the city of Cheshire on Twitter
In a series of court cases, half of them were burned.
About a minute later, they sent a message about a terrible witness on Twitter.
In conclusion, the poll says that more than 140,000 messages on Twitter have been carried out by rape and forced children into a house that was burned.
On Thursday, the prosecution of Steven J. Hayese, who was sentenced to three Cheshire, Connecticut, families, ended the official execution of the death penalty for which the jury voted.
But Mr Hayese's lawyers have already appealed to the court with requests and arguments which would probably be in the hands of the court for years.
One of the most provable is that intensive reporting on the process - including widespread use of Twitter by major reporters - has created a "circuit atmosphere" and this expanded, indirect disclosure of information with disturbing details then led the jury to decide in terms of public opinion.
This claim could lead the judge to question whether, with the introduction of new technologies, new rules should not be required in court.
"As I have experienced this transformation, I think there is a real danger that the entry of new technologies into the judiciary affects the right of a fair process for individuals," said Thomas J. Ullmann, the main advocate of Mr. Hayese.
The Court of Justice of the Court of First Instance, Mr C. Blue, has specifically rejected the claim regarding the expenditure from last week and that the means of communication were "extremely controlled" and that there is no evidence to show that the jury was acting under public influence.
But it's probably not about the last word in this case.
Over the entire decade, the courts have recognized that notoriety of known cases could raise questions of procedural justice.
In the U.S. Supreme Court's 1966 judgment on the murder of his wife, Dr. Sam Sheppard, in his decision, said that in the case of Sheppard version Maxwell, the "carnival atmosphere" was dealt with by the media in the case of Sheppard.
Some are convinced that this criminal act was inspiring TV show and film "Friday".
Some lawyers said that the appeals court that had reviewed Hayes' judgment about half a century later might be surprised by the argument that there might be a new rule which determines how to communicate from the courts, which was, in the case of Dr. Sheppard, unrepresentable.
"There is a general reason for concern about the impact of new media," said John J. Donohue III, a professor of law at Stanford Law School who studied the death penalty in Connecticut and wrote a report that said it was carried out voluntarily.
Professor Donohue stated that some judges may be concerned with the idea that restrictions on indirect communication can make the process more just.
The case of Twitter is only one of many stressed lawyers, Mr Hayes, who would be able to argue for years in order to hold the trial.
The prosecutor also claims that in Mr Hayese's case, it may be a precaution if Judge Blue refused to allow him to test the reaction of potential parties by showing them criminal photographs of the threat.
Some of the jury reported that they were afraid of the victim's photo by Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48 and her daughter Hayley, 17, and Michaela, 11.
The prosecutor also claims that the death penalty is rejected and claims that the judge has wrongly dismissed a judge who was critical of the state agents and that his decision has wrongly placed more pressure on the loan and directed the court to think about the weekend.
The children weren't separated.
But their arguments about the impact of the process may attract the greatest interest.
They pointed out against the verdict last month that the case was dominated by a report in Connecticut and was discussed during the election campaign of candidates for the governor and Senate of the United States.
They argued that the media continued to dissipate the emotion of this case.
"The day before the trial, the media, the cameras and the reporters," the lawyer wrote, "there was something that was not yet seen here in New Haven and one might also be about the nationality."
Their focus on Twitter is controversial.
Some journalists argued in discussions that the immediate presentation of the report was more disturbing than the reports later and that the judicial police should, from their point of view, manage the scope of other proceedings.
However, some lawyers called for appeals against courts with often used arguments that social and technological changes require court adaptation.
Mr. Hayes' lawyers are trying to enforce this right.
In their archives they referred to the decision of the Supreme Court of 1966 on the matter of Dr. Sheppard's trial, because of the broad scope of the process and wanted to clarify the requirement that the new media require new rules.
"This case," they wrote, "is the case Sheppard version of Maxwell 21st century."
Can the court believe the crash?
After the campaign, which was recognizable of its vulnerability and negativeity, this week in Washington, D.C., revealed a small amount of resistance.
Is it the first real owner of two political parties or just an illusion moment before a quick return to foreign war in the capital?
The afternoon meeting of President Obama and Parliamentary leaders did not provide any key information on the main issues to be discussed during the meeting.
In each case, however, there was an open debate on the differences of opinion between the two sides, as well as the definition of their joint responsibilities, rather than the other empty episode of foreign interference.
The mid-term presidential meeting of the Deficit Commission was also civilized, despite the political differences that remained between the members.
It seems clear that the close presence over a period of several months has raised mutual respect that transcends the ideological destruction that members continue to divide.
And it's quite difficult to say that a new era of cooperation has begun.
Both sides are now in the test period - they are looking at each other's signs of college and compromise, trying to assess the limits of public opinion and the Volcano's tolerance towards the renewed foreign war.
Therefore, the afternoon meeting and its subsequent assessment of participants was also conducted with a minimum of requirements or charges.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republic are too wide and too deep to propose rapid changes in the ratios that last two years.
Whether it's about taxes, expenses, health care or rights, both sides are miles away.
However, the November elections were prepared by Washington at least as soon as possible.
"It is not a question of whether regulatory matters have changed," said Pete Wehner, Bush's administrator, now at the Ethics and Public Policy Center.
"You're inexhaustible after the elections.
The choices have aroused the emotions of the guests and then they have to run away.
It's good."
In a number of issues, especially those that are to be held, the Republicans and Democrats have little chance of finding solutions.
Bush's tax reduction was lifted at the end of the year, and no one thinks it's too expensive.
Both sides want to find a way to protect someone or everyone, and this lasts for a while or temporarily.
Similarly, a possible compromise with regard to unemployment rates is only because the Republicans cannot look at how they support the reduction of taxation for the poor, while the unemployed reject unemployment support.
After the morning meeting in the White House, there is already a greater optimism about possible agreements on these issues, along with ratification of the new start-up agreements.
But William Galston of the Brookings Institute warns that successful cooperation on key issues will not necessarily lead to a relationship between two political parties when 112 conventions refer to winter.
It's probably probably a bad time, or even inevitable, he said.
"After doing things that have to be done, psychology will soon return to one of the confrontations," he said.
Wehner also expressed scepticism - which is to a large extent extended - to the fact that the plant is a true cooperation.
"I look at all events between the present and the year 2012 as a shadow box when major events occur in 2012,," he said.
The reasons largely relate to the formation of a new republican majority in the White House and the lovers of tea parties who helped to create it.
Republican leaders are now in danger of overcrowding, know that they must act in accordance with their promises and reduce government expenditure and repeal the new health law.
These business lines are clear in the initial responses to recommendations on the deficits which include tax reform and raising some taxes, increasing the age of pensions and reducing expenditure.
Co-Presidents Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have taken up one of the most difficult tasks in Washington and, in their view, have developed the pressure of deficits to the public programme in a way that cannot be ignored.
However, 14 votes in the 18th Committee are required in order to present their plan as an official recommendation and therefore to fight to draw as close as possible to this number.
The greatest challenge is between the elected officials in the jury who suggest that in the case of financial issues we have, at least today, small foundations or wills for compromise.
Galston foretold two phases in the fight between the White House and the parliamentary republics.
The first year will begin in the form of foreign conflicts when the Republicans develop Obama to resolve budgets, taxes and health care, when the period of greater foreign cooperation is followed.
What's the reason for the move?
Public opinion.
There is plenty of evidence that despite the fact that the last elections, most Americans still want to see two parties working together.
If it could be addressed to the pact as it was in 1995, then both sides will be very careful to monitor the public's reactions.
As soon as it threatens to lower its voice, it will likely change its course and seek compromise.
It can be an optimistic view of the matter.
Foreignness and orientation are larger today than it has been in the mid-nineties and shows that there has been a greater ideological gap between Obama and the parliamentary republics than in the case of Republicans and Bill Clinton.
Equally active on both sides sees 2010 as a front for the most important elections in 2012.
On the basis of this reality, the monster that appeared this week would welcome many Americans.
But it will take a lot of effort on both sides to find common ground on issues that still divide them.
An American document depicts Moscow as an attack on corruption
The city is in the hands of "keptocracy" and it continues some of the charges and charges for the protection that come to Kremlin, the US Embassy in Russia has succeeded in depositing supplies from the Union.
The Police and the Federal Security Service maintains a wide range of protective wings that help to explain the high cost of life in Moscow.
They choose money not only from legal transactions but also from organised criminal groups.
Each type of bureaucracy - which Prime Minister Vladimir Putin called "the vertical office" - will take his own money when the money begins to be hung over the top.
The record sent to Washington by Ambassador John Beyrle was published in the middle by WikiLeaks on their websites.
The record is based on sources whose names have been edited.
The record was written at the time of Yuri Luzhkov's old age and charged her with much corruption.
He was called in October by President Dmitry Medvedev, but since then we can only monitor minimal changes in clarity.
Luzhkov and his wife Yelena Baturina, who owned a prominent construction company, have been reporting corruption for many years and has won several complaints for such a charge.
In September he said to the Russian television station when he was questioned at the evidence of corruption: "It's crazy, it's dirty, it's poison."
The Russians with absolute conviction believe that if their company is corrupt, it will appear to be voting.
It is, however, unusual to meet with such details in such a way as to be expressed in a bilingual report, and it is also unlikely that diplomats from foreign countries would do so.
"The government of the city of Moscow and its connection with criminal life have led some to call it 'disfunctional' and confirm that the government works more than as cleavage," says the report.
"Criminal elements are happy with the so-called 'krysha' (a term from the world of crime and mafia, which literally means 'blow' or protection), provided by the police, the Federal Security Service, the Federal Security Service (FSB), the Ministry of the Interior and the State Representative's office, as well as everywhere in the government bureaucracy of Moscow.
"Analytics identified and acquired a three-way structure in the criminal world of Moscow."
"Luzzkov is on his own. "
"The Federal Security Service, the Ministry of the Interior and the militia are at second level."
"And finally at the lowest level are ordinary criminals and corrupt inspectors."
"It is an ineffective system in which criminal groups fill empty spaces in some areas, as the city does not provide some services."
The report says the FSB takes money from the largest companies and the police is focusing on smaller companies.
One source said, "Trade owners in Moscow realize that it is better to obtain protection from the FSB or the Ministry of the Interior (more often than organized criminal groups) because they have not only weapons, resources and forces than criminal groups, but also protected by law."
"That's why it's no longer protected from criminal gangs."
The report says that while the choice of money is complex, protection alone may already have difficulties; even those who pay may sometimes be locked up.
Those who do not pay enough fast will end their trade under different contracts.
He spoke several times about the fight against corruption, but he admitted that he had only made little progress.
The embassy is talking about men carrying suitcases, probably speeded-up preparations, in the Kremlin itself.
"In his fight against corruption Medvedev has to rely on bureaucrats," said George Satarov, director of the Moscow research team in India in a recent conversation.
"But it's part of this bureaucracy."
"It's not part of the political class because there are no political classes in Russia anymore."
No politics, no opposition, no power sharing, corruption is inevitable, he said.
Another estimates that Russia's corruption is worldwide more than $300 billion a year.
The country is headed for 154th place in a recent study on the global perception of corruption of non-governmental organizations Transparency International (the country is divided by at least the most corrupt).
The disclosure of reports by the US Ambassador, which appeared in Moscow until late evening hours, certainly did not call the Russian government for an appeal, even if only to the extent that the failure of Moscow can be blamed on Luzhkov, it can be an opportunity for Kremlin to argue on the matter.
During a CNN discussion with Larry King, Putin told him that documents published by WikiLeaks could be subversive and reacted to a statement by American diplomats calling him Batman and Medvedeve Robin.
"The truth about the whole thing is that it's about our interaction, which is an important factor of domestic policy in this country," he said.
"But to be honest, we didn't realize that this would be done with such arrogance, with such pressure, you understand, so unethical."
The Red Khmer veterans are forced to match the past
In the dispute of enlightened concrete lessons with sealed and collapsed walls, the director of the Anlong Veng High School of the man who set it up, the leader of the Rudny Khmer Ta Mok.
"Everyone here loves Ta Mok."
"He was a good leader and cared for his people," said Sreng Kor Ma, 42.
Known as a "beast" for its strength during the government of the Rudny Khmer, the leader of this remote country of Rudny Khmer remains popular in northern Cambodia, where he has set up hospitals, bridges and other infrastructure and where thousands of former soldiers are still alive.
But this year, 12 years after the hands of the Rudi Khmer governments, a long-term loyality was also acquired in Anlong Vengu.
In depth, the victim was allowed to meet with people who were part of the regime.
In June the government provided teachers who first explained the history of the Rud Khmers and their ex-combatants.
And in July, the UN and the Cambodian court brought up the first review of former member of the Rudny Khmer, the trial of a former leader, notoric of the known violent association Tuol Sleng, Kaing Khek Iev, known as the Spirit, for 35 years in prison.
With any such progress, there has been a gap between the Rud Khmers' veterans in Anlong Veng, which makes it difficult to reconcile and try to re-enter Cambodia's company.
"Among the former Rudny Khmer are fear and fear, but they are powerless to do anything," said Chhang Youk, head of the Cambodia Documentation Centre, an independent organization that examines the regime.
"For them life between the Red Khmer was beautiful, but the regime became a symbol of evil."
"It divides the family."
During the Rudj Khmer regime in Cambodia, from 1975 to 1979, it was estimated that 1.7 million people were cured or died of hunger, disease or treatment.
When the Vietnamese attacked and destroyed the Paul Pot government in 1979, the rest of the regime and its soldiers flew over the Cambodia border with Thailand.
There they started a rebellion that lasted until the last earthquake in December 1998.
Paul Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary led the party wars from their foundations in the mountains and jungles in western Cambodia, while Ta Mok cultivated a stopover in Anlong Vengu.
But in the mid-1990s, after the peace agreement, sponsored by the UN, the country was taken to the first democratic elections in 1993. A large group of Red Khmer fighters began to move to the government that raised the capitals of Ieng Sary in 1996 and Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Paul Pot died of natural death in 1998 and Ta Mok, who endured, was occupied by government forces in nearby Dangrek mountains in 1999.
He died in Phnom Penh Prison in 2006 while awaiting trial.
They were no longer concerned about them, most former warriors of the Rud Khmers were drawn into the ordinary Cambodian foreign life and many of them were nostalgicly remembered during the harvest season.
Although several elite Red Khmer have maintained their local government position in exchange for their weapons, their positions remain weak as unqualified farmers.
"These people had only minimal profits," said Sok Leang from the Centre for Justice and Reconciliation, leading a public forum throughout Cambodia, including Anlong Vengu.
"They're covered by the utopian agricultural ideology of the regime."
"There was no idea of the performance of the trade."
Sor Lim, 55, who joined Rudy Khmer as a teenager in 1974, fought in the jungle around Anlong Vengu before he settled as a poor farmer in 1998.
"Life under Rudy Khmer was good," he said.
"This Mok enjoyed it all."
"But now life is hard because we have to make sure we all do."
The run-up court of the Rud Khmers also raised concerns.
At the beginning of the following year, the court will begin its investigation of Nuon Chea, Khaeu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, Ieng Thirich, another former Prime Minister of Rudy Khmer.
The Court has a mandate to arrest the leading offenders and the people responsible for the crimes, but it has not been said whether it will continue in these four cases.
It was just a little bit to calm down anxiety in Anlong Vengo.
Recent media speculation focused on Im Chaema, 64, which was the district leader of Banteay Meanchey during the reign of the Rudny Khmer government at the end of the 1970s.
In 2007, she told researchers from the Documentation Centre in Cambodia that she had taken into account the construction of Trapeang Thma, a project that probably killed thousands of convicted workers.
A recent couple-night Im Chaem returned from work on the field into his wooden home on a dirt road outside of Anlong Veng.
As the sun began to set and revealed the walls over the dry grass, Im Chaem refused to talk about his past between Rudy Khmer.
If the judge had called her, she would have refused to go.
"In Cambodia, peace prevails and is stable," she said.
"If there are other criminal incidents, there will be war."
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who passed from the Rudny Khmer in 1978, also repeatedly warned that he would come to instability if the court would look for other suspects, although experts and historians disagree.
"Cambodia has to dig up a deep hole and bury it in the past," he said.
But the confrontation with the past is just what Cambodia has to do to move forward, Chhang Youk said from the documentary center.
"The direction in Khmer dimensions means the darkness of broken bones," he said.
"It is our duty to give these broken pieces together so we can understand."
The Centre has issued the first lecturers approved by the government on the Rudy Khmer, which has 75 pages and is called "The History of Democratic Cambodia."
It was distributed in Anlong Vengu in June as an addendum to the history of the Ministry of Education, which contains less than four pages on the Red Khmer.
Just like many people in Cambodia, young people in Anlong Vengu knew only a few details about the Rudny Khmer, even though the city was connected with the regime.
Touch Valeak, 19, a high school student in Anlong Veng said that a new school helps students understand important parts of their history.
But his parents reacted skeptically when he took the book home to study.
"My family rejects a lot of teachers and judges," he said.
"They're suspicious because they're not sure how many people will be judged."
Such resistance makes the reconciliation process more complex and difficult, Sok Leang said.
But public forums, classrooms and courts are beginning to have an impact, he sent on.
The Red Khmer here still has a strong knife.
Up in the mountains of Dangrek Mountains is a road that is surrounded by mud and paved with plastic bags, which leads to a black seine dealer covered with a flat roof.
The body of Paul Pota here was burned at a collection of pneumatics after his death in 1998.
Nuom Sothea, 31, a mobile salesman at the end of the road said he doesn't know much about the men who were burned at that place.
"But I have a strong spirit, many local people go here and pray to him," she said.
Nuom Sothea was born and was later planning to visit the place of Paul Pota’s rest, where she will bring a couple of mature bananas in hopes of bringing her happiness.
Belarus agrees that it seems to have its weapons resources based on uranium
In the surprising victory in President Obama's campaign on nuclear material security around the world, the Belarusian government announced that they are releasing their resources from highly enriched uranium, which is a critical component of nuclear weapons.
The agreement was published in a joint statement issued after the security summit of Foreign Minister Hillary Rodham Clinton and Belarus Foreign Minister Sergey Martinov.
After a year the U.S. government tried to convince Belarus to give up a highly enriched uranium and it seemed that they had damaged the past brand on the rock.
But U.S. officials said The Washington Post that in the last two months a number of sealed operations were carried out with Belarus to remove 187 free weapons based on the uranium from the Belarusian research facility.
This prepared the ground for a medium-term agreement on the disposal of the remaining material - about 500 pounds, according to an official who spoke under the terms of anonymity, because it is sensitive.
The agreement showed itself to be one of the most important results of Obama 47 of the National Nuclear Safety Summit in the depths of Belarus.
And it was obviously good here to ensure the invitation of the former Soviet Republic to the next summit in 2012.
"I was really fascinated by the fact that they wanted a place at the 2012 nuclear safety summit."
"This proves that the process is working," said Ken Lugo, president of the Global Security Partnership, a group that supports nuclear security.
Clinton called the agreement "a very important, important step" from Belarus.
Both promised in Prague in April 2009 that they would provide all sensitive nuclear material around the world for four years.
Since then, the U.S. government has helped six countries to free all their resources from highly enriched uranium.
Belarus will be seventh.
Thousands of countries have done so for George W. Bush's management.
At the time of Obama's nuclear security summit, White President Alexander Lukašenko announced that his people would never give up their uranium.
"We have highly enriched uranium - hundreds of kilograms of what is basically the basis for weapons and less enriched uranium," Lukašenko said.
"It's our comedite... we don't decide to produce spy bombs and we don't want to sell it to anyone."
"We only use it for research purposes, that's all."
However, a few months earlier, Belarus had joined the United States and was particularly interested in reaching an agreement.
The first commitment to remove the Belarusian uranium in October was particularly complex because the material was easily noticed by the officials.
He was put on a special train which traveled more than 1,300 miles to the Russian settlement and settlement facility, the officials said.
The second operation was closed on Monday and was carried out airtightly, the officials said.
The U.S. government has spent $13 million on the programme, most of which is the supply of less enriched uranium, which is not suitable for the production of nuclear weapons.
"All was carefully coordinated and managed on the basis of confidence," which led to the agreement signed by Clinton, said Andrew Bienewski, the Ministry of Energy working for the Global Thread Reduction.
James Martin Center for the study on non-proliferation of nuclear weapons this year estimated that Belarus has at least 88 free uranium used for the production of weapons.
Belarus will, according to a joint declaration, force its resources to be removed by 2012.
The relations between Belarus and the United States have been strained throughout the year, particularly because of the cruel repression of human rights by Lukašenk.
But the average declaration indicates the possibility of gradual silence.
"We welcome the progress made in these global security issues, the United States and Belarus have recognized that the continued maintenance of democracy and human rights in Belarus remains the basis for improving mutual relations and this is necessary for the progress of the country and its citizens," he said.
The Spanish government didn't do it with CIA expensive flights
The Spanish Government has not made expensive contributions to the CIA flights of Taliban prisoners and members of Al-Qaida to Guantánamo over the Spanish territory, as expressed in its telegram by the United States Ambassador to Madrid.
This is what follows from the documents provided by the Wikileaks daily El País, where it also says that the former prime minister, María Teresa Fernández de la Vego, requested that the Spanish executive be informed and "may thus show that he has due respect for foreign flying Spanish airspace".
In June 2006, following a communication from the Council of Europe in which thousands of States were charged, including Spain, with the involvement of human rights violations, a meeting was held between Ambassadors Eduardo Aguiirre and the United States Fernández de la Vegovo.
The Prime Minister said that the Council of Europe's communication "has removed Zapatero from the government from the game" and insisted that Spain has nothing to hide in this matter.
De la Vego pointed out that Spain has no problem with the years of secret service across its territory.
"They just want to be informed," so they don't be "uncompliant"," Aguirrre reports in one of the documents.
The former Foreign Minister Miguel Ángel Moratinos also pointed out to the American Prime Minister that the Spanish government "want to give this concern as much as possible, but since it was in the hands of the judges, the cabinet had limited influence".
In February 2007, Prosecutor Vicente González told Velvyslanett that it was not intended to block the initiative of the judge to request the withdrawal of documents from the National Secret Service Centre (CNI) and the Ministry of Defence concerning CIA years.
"This information does not contain any incriminating complex or any sensitive information," Velvyslanetti explained after the interview with the prosecutor.
However, the United States expressed more concerns about "the apparent coordination between the Spanish judge and the German prosecutors" than about the removal of information from CNI or the Ministry of Defence.
"This coordination between independent researchers will make our efforts to resolve this case indiscriminately between governments," laments Aguirrre.
In March 2007, on the occasion of the meal of the U.S. Ambassador and Interior Minister Alfreda Pérez Rubalcaby, he told the audience that "even though the Spanish judges are very jealous of their independence and do what they are supposed to do for themselves", he had already instructed his colleagues "to avoid scattered comments with a view to reducing tension".
The Ambassador also expresses his concern about the political party's involvement with the Party People's Party (PP; Czech People's Party - see also) in this regard.
"Even with its general pro-American orientation, our experience tells us that the Party People's Party will not be obliged to use any indication that Zapatero's government has tolerated or deliberately ignored the United States movement which could be interpreted as a possible violation of human rights, and even if this division could have negative effects on the government of the United States," he notes.
A well-known mother-killer complained about her mother's "age" network.
A young woman was talking about a child when she was already dead, and she had her blog "Teror after the Galicia"
Mónica Juanatey Fernández says "Muki" on the Internet.
With this insight that she had already used, she communicated with her sister and at least one friend; two of them are from the town of Noia in La Coruny, where a young woman comes from.
The reports are from 2008.
In order to be able to understand, women need to know what life is like, which the ABC daily rebuilds by witnessing to its family members.
A 30-year-old woman from Galicia entered into a relationship with industrialist Ivan Tunez in 1998.
They walked together for a year.
Shortly after the divorce, she found out she was pregnant.
The man wanted to know if he was his newborn baby, but his ex-girlfriend never let him do DNA tests.
Soon you found a new knowledge.
His name was Alberto, a young man from nearby Lousme.
Their relationship lasted a long time.
Little Caesar lived with them.
When a girl went to the Balearic Islands looking for work, the boy stayed with her partner, who even came to visit her for a week in Palmy.
However, it is clear from the content of her communication that the relationship has deteriorated.
In March 2008, he's on his own at Menorce and he writes, "Alberto is angry that I've gone to work."
"When I told him that, it seemed good to him, but now he realizes that he has to be with a little day and can't do what he wants."
Then she's talking about the text message she just got: "I want you to come back this month or give me the address where I'm going to send your child."
He says, "If he doesn't like me to leave my mother, I'll take him when I get back."
In May he talks about his return to his place of residence, "I'm going to eat there this week, but I'm only staying until 19 because I have to go to work so I don't come to this place."
He explains that if everything goes well, we'll take our son to ourselves.
"He'll be with someone who's going to be with me, then he'll never be able to leave him with someone other than my mother," he suspects in view of her bad relationships.
There's another contribution here in July.
When this report is quoted, it is assumed that the child who arrived on the island of the first day of this month and was likely murdered 10 is already dead.
"The Caesar is peaceful on the one hand, but not on the other."
"He likes it here on the one hand, but on the other hand it goes almost every day to school."
He's talking about moving to Mallorc.
"He's gonna go (son) to the summer school, and I'll save some money for the bread."
Seventeenths of good health and difficulty.
"A big kiss from Caesar who asks me when you're coming."
"Alberto says I don't know what videos you send on e-mail, see how he likes to meet me, sex is necessary."
The third report says, "The boy's good, he's going to the summer school to learn Catalan."

People would get in Snow 4 chairs and PSC (Socialist side of Catalanska - p.m.) would lose 9 missions
With the results of 28 November, the PP party could have the main word at the workshops in Lérida, Tarragona and Barcelona.
Following a significant increase in the votes received and the number of experienced Members during recent autonomous elections, the Catalan PP (Lidová side of Catalan - no.) already has a given representation of the general elections, whether it is already in progress or never, its results are more positive than they are, since the number of votes in the national elections is usually one such solution to the Catalan elections.
In 2008, the Catalan people received 610,473 votes in general, while in 2006 the autonomous elections included only 316.222.
Last week, PPC received 384.091 votes in favour.
If this trend is maintained, supported by the translation of votes from the PSC and the loyal PP voters, the analysts of this party calculated that if the general elections were to end, the PPC could receive at least 12 MEPs against the existing 8 CU (Convergencia i Union, Czech Federation and Union) sides in Snow would also receive 4 mandates (they do not have 10), and the PSC would lose at least 9 crosses (they have 25).
These calculations would confirm that Catalan has a fundamental importance for PP and PSOE (Spanish socialist partner party).
According to this analysis of the peoples, the ERC (Levic Republican Party of Catalansk - p.m.) would lose one of its members - now has 3 - while the ICV (Green Initiative for Catalan - p.m.) would continue to have one mandate, if any, to receive another.
However, according to the electoral calendar, the most recent delivery will end in May 2011 at the opportunity of general elections where people could also have a decisive impact on the end of the rule of socialists in the four main provincial cities and also on the changes in the Barcelona Council (Diputación de Barcelona), which is one of the largest planned budget of EUR 661 million for 2011.
As nationalists, people agree with the possibility that the PSC could lose its workshops in Barcelona, Tarragon, Lérida and Geron, where socialists would not keep most and could not return to their traditional alliances, the ERC and ICV parties.
In view of the debabilities of the Republicans, it would not be possible if this party lost its representation in the Barcelona representation - as at least 5% of the votes should be taken.
The PP party has increased the number of votes received in the four main cities and could have a decisive impact in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragon.
Nationalists are convinced that they could play the main role in the operation in Tarragon, where they co-operated with the PP party before the current age of Joseph Félix Ballesteros.
In Lérida PP only received 500 votes more than PSC, whose elderly Angel Ross has a very good relationship with Marian Rajoye - during the last campaign they met on several occasions.
The people also obtained from other important workshops such as Badalona, Castellelles or Reus.
At the present time PP has represented 34 offices in Catalan and would like to create candidates in as many citizens as possible.
The Catalan colony provided Al-Qaida thousands of passports
In addition to the seven prisoners held in Barcelona, three other prisoners were detained in Thailand
Seven Pakistani and one Nigerian who were detained by the General Information Commission in Barcelona, created a Jihadist headquarters from Thailand, which arranged travel passports for various groups of Al-Qaida organisations, including "Tygry for the liberation of Tamil Ilam" or "Lashkar-e-Taiba", while another designated group was the author of the polls in Bombaya, where 106 persons were killed in 2008.
The Ministry of the Interior attaches great importance to the investigation of this concern, with the aim of providing "Operation Campai" with a reduction of Al-Qaida’s shareholding equipment at international level and "limiting its operational capabilities".
Researchers estimate that during two years when it was active in Catalan, it was possible to send thousands of passports to Thailand, where they were then divided and then provided to groups that create the criminal galaxy of Al-Qaida so that their "warmen" could travel safely across the borders in Europe and other Western countries.
This broken hole was not the only active one that had a Jihad network in Europe and therefore other European police units participated in these investigations in addition to Thai services, and it cannot therefore be ruled out that in the next days it will not come to other European countries for similar principles, as it was last Tuesday night in Barcelona.
In connection with this operation (when Pakistanis Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammed Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arsad and Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade) developed further in Thailand where Pakistanis Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan Ehsan Butt and Thajec Sirikanlaya Kybumrung were engaged.
They were just the men who drove from Bangkok to live in Spain and elsewhere in other European countries.
The Catalan network, part of which was liquidated in 2009, was stolen by tourists in particular by travel passports that met the demands of Islamists.
This means that documents had to be suitable for men between the ages of 25 and 45 years, had to be valid for several years and had to be without certain visas.
The investigation documents state that there are no known facts that would have been associated with an attack in Bombaji, although the author of these attacks, "Lashkar-e-Taiba", should have been one of the groups that accepted the passports stolen in Spain and then counterfeited in Thailand.
However, it is provided that a few days before this attack, about a thousand dollars was transferred from the Catalan transport agency, which was "inserted" to purchase tickets on mobile phones, which were later used by members of the "command", who killed 106 people.
The police have already taken a lot of evidence.
The People's Party (PP) requires Mass to terminate the fiscal agreement
The President of the PPC (Lidva Party of Catalan) Alicia Sánchezov-Camakhová had the opportunity yesterday to give Arthur Mass his personal terms, for which he was willing to support his presentation as President Generalitat; these conditions are consistent with those proposed during the campaign and their priority is to revive the economy and rediscover the risk-taking companies as an economic agreement which the leaders of nationalists want to propose during their mandate.
The President of the Catalan Peoples presented to the meeting with Arture Mass with about 18 parliamentary crosses held in previous weeks' elections, which is more than a satisfactory number for obtaining clearance, so the CiU candidate needs at least one of the formations of the opposition to hold a vote on his arrival in the office.
As far as possible, the future alliance with the PP depends on which nationalists would like to remain in the Sneaming, when all the general elections are over, but while the discussions that take place in these days with the rest of the political leaders are not in the Catalan spirit.
With regard to President PP, in order to get her support for the implementation of the function, "it will have to end with all the intended and delivered events", as with the economic agreement - similar to the one from Bashika - which the CiU leader even wanted to vote in the referendum.
Both leaders would like to clean up the broken political machine of self-government and reduce the grandfather and donor tax.
The details of the comparison with Masov's entry into function will remain within the framework of PP Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
The mass has already met with Joaquin Next (PSC), who has pledged a firm opposition, Joan Herrerou (ICV) and today meets with Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Albert Riverou (Ciutadans) and Joan Laportou (Solidaritat Catalana).
The manager of the guerrilla device shall ensure that the death has not been caused by "a lack of action"
Olot's performances do not rule out that their storekeeper killed more than 11 clients
The leadership of the La Caritat de Olot (Gerona) Gerona gave a press conference yesterday to repair what damage had caused the criminal administrations of Joan Villy Dilmé, a carer who - while here he was employed - killed at least ten seniors who were in care.
The director of this house for Senior Joan Sala presented himself in the case of a lawyer, Joan Canady, and announced that "the expectation of the house La Caritat would be able to bring charges against the guilty" responsible for the murder, as well as "the law and responsibility force us to give up this process to the competent authorities".
In addition to damage to a good name that can be endured by this institution because of the fact that it has not at one time abandoned its criminal activities, the house of La Caritat now poses a great threat to the house of La Caritat to the material damage that is already calculated by the legal representatives of the rest of the family.
Joan Vila Dilmé admitted that his first crime was committed in July 2009 and that since then he has not stopped killing
The judge ordered exhumation of eight bodies of clients at home for seniors with suspicion that in many cases no doctor had visited the dead personally, although, in view of the age and poor health of the patients, everything was resolved by telephone.
La Caritat yesterday, through her director, firmly rejected this nationality and stressed that "the lack of action could not be in any way due to what happened".
The Legal Representative of La Caritat added that "there is no indication that any third party would be allowed to make an error in the case of its own accused".
The man now surprised by "Angel of Death" admitted 11 deaths yesterday and explained that the first crime was admitted on 29 August 2009 and about a month and a half later killed another elder.
In this case, death by administration of too high a dose of insulin was caused by the use of a mixture of restorative tablets.
Director La Caritat pointed out that it is difficult to control staff access to medicines.
Insulin and cocktail sedatives were likely in six cases by means of nine means that this carer used to kill patients in his attempt to relieve them from suffering.
However, just the analyses that are currently being carried out in the laboratory should show if Vila was not and really was looking for her first victim to die less severe or killed by giving birth, as he had already acknowledged in the case of three women killed between 12 and 17 October.
in La Caritat they do not believe in a medical claim and do not exclude that the number of killers may be higher than they were admitted to, and justify their behaviour in different versions given by Villa to the court with the awareness that they must change their behaviour when it comes to finding out that they killed eight people.
Therefore, they say they want justice to be available to shed light on the whole extent of this concern.
The European Central Bank is at risk
Investors responded yesterday early yesterday to the threat of President of the European Central Bank Trichet, who warned that "markets should not underestimate our ability to respond".
The regional differences have been closed by force and the European Bank's shares have closed by more than 5%.
However, we should also not underestimate the ability of the European Central Bank to lie – the euro is just above the critical value.
What happened yesterday is typical for the non-liquid market, which, although it comes to destruction, is being maintained - but thanks to a short and very speculative position.
Investors will take some time before they lose their fear.
A month ago, the European Central Bank urged us to take back the liquidity peace today, and tomorrow it will have to call for a second time for two years.
The Bundesbank requested that the State debt recovery plan be terminated and that all exceptional liquidity measures be eliminated within a period of time and to leave unlimited access for only one week.
After the Irish crisis, we expect the liquidity balance to precipitate "minimum to March" and maintain a three-month bid with unlimited access to the end of this quarter to guarantee liquidity by at least June.
We also hope that they will continue their debt purchase programme and will even announce its intensity.
If not fulfilled, it will again create a market reaction from yesterday, and if they will continue to be blind in the pursuit of the peace of liquidity, God with us!
It was the same at the meeting in May, where they claimed that they did not even consider buying debt notes, and it came to the market collapse - tomorrow it could be history.
The European Central Bank must be reliable and sustainable.
In May, she announced that she had picked up a lot of money on Mondays and told her in the middle that she had already acquired a lot of them, causing further market deterioration.
Yesterday's bid changed for a year in Portugal was very poor.
El Tesoro issued only 500 million with 5.28%, compared to 750 million with 4.81% of previous expensives.
As the rate in Portugal fell by 30 points below, reflecting a change in market conditions that were in line with Trichet's words.
In Ireland, there were published figures representing the losses of Allied and Bank of Ireland.
The estimated amounts represent a total of 10,000 million on short-term securities and other 15 000 potential securities, are likely to become private capital, otherwise they will be lost.
While Ireland has no credibility since the problem has not been resolved in July, the shares are acceptable within the framework of an aid plan and help reduce uncertainty.
However, the next Tuesday will require the government to gain the approval of the new budget by Parliament and still does not have enough support, so there is still a government uncertainty in Ireland.
Angela Merkel calmed down the tone of her demonstration in order to release the tension in the face of the next EU summit held on 14 December, where it is necessary to reach a political compromise that would show that we are Union and we are all on one ship.
The problem is that Germany wants to play Wagner while others prefer Beethoven's Oda to be happy.
In Spain yesterday, the Prime Minister had the opportunity to present a plan of action to be adopted at the Council of Ministers on Friday.
Pension reform, transparency in autonomous areas and financial institutions, reduction of deficits, liberalisation, privatization, employment recovery measures - to other investors it is known as the Four-year period from Vivaldi.
The double effect of Trichet and Zapater explains why the Spanish bourgeois has grown by 4.5%, so twice as the other European bourgeois.
The reaction of the government and the Spanish national banks was fast and convincing - we are quite tired of the surprise effect.
Today we have a key long-term tender for three years that will be justified by the effect of Trichet, and we hope that there will be a big question on it which will help to raise doubts about our refinancing capacity.
Requesting a rescue plan would be for Spain's suicide.
They would give us what we don't need - in El Tesoro is available 40,000 million in cash, three times more than in March - further high rates and market access would close our day.
Nevertheless, it is necessary to continue to apply Caesar's wife's strategy - "not only to be there, but to appear to be."
We'll prove it.
The President of the Eulen Group is attacking Vega Sicilia's company's children required
The bourgeoisie of the Álvarez family, owned by Eulen and El Enebro, is not moving in the open conflict.
David Álvarez, the founder of the group, will then attack what he considered to be "all unrecognised", the legal meeting of El Enebro planned for the 16th month and the required five of his seven generations, where he should try to use his majority and strengthen himself with the help of the legal authorities of the Bodegas Vega Sicily.
David Álvarez and his son Jesús David and María José host a legal group for a new chapter of their dispute on corporate governance.
The founder of the largest holding of business services may not be willing to settle in his dispute on membership in the ruling El Enebro groups.
Of its administrative committee, five of its seven descendants were named transfers during the gathering of shareholders on 18 January of this year and their object is placed in the Commercial Register.
The El Enebro Group's hearing scheduled for the sixteenth month, which was approved by the Office of the Trade Court No. 2 in Madrid, re-examined the Álvarez family line.
The appeal to the Court is until the dispute is resolved by the only legal instrument which guarantees the Commission's approval.
The last step of Juana Carlos, Pablo, Emilia, Marty and Elvira of the Álvarez Mezquirizoví is considered by David Álvarez as "the reliable means of his five children serving with the legal letters and a clear legal basis for the strengthening and improvement of the 18th January meeting which was completely free".
This argument will serve as a basis for justifying the legal attack on this behaviour as "all insignificant".
Self-defensed protagonists who deliberately silent have already tried to call the court in June.
In El Enebro, a group owned by other activities Bodegas Vega Sicily, manages seven descendants of David Álvareze 100% capital.
However, according to the family protocols, the founder of the group requires the right to use 51% of capital.
This is a key issue that will have to be decided by the judge when calculating the question of a court attack.
Red Bull triumphs in Formula 1 with a secret weapon from Siemens
The software proposes perfecting in vehicles in real time.
Since Red Bull entered the Formula 1 series in 2004, his history in this remarkable world is characterized by surprise and success.
At first, no one took too seriously the possibility of this new future team, and despite the growing trend from recent times, all of them went to the triumph of Ferrari Fernanda Alons.
Before we want to lower the driving skills of the champion, the German Sebastian Vettel, or the possibility of the Renault engine driving his car, in the world of Formula 1 came up with a legend - "secret weapon", which the Siemens multinational put into the hands of Red Bull to make it a winning team.
In fact, it is an executive software that simulates the origins of which the German company placed on the market in 2007 for the purposes of very remote car sports.
The so-called PLM, this powerful software device, was used to design assembly lines in manufacturing races around the world, in energy races and for high-performance devices.
Its purpose is to reproduce the product or simulate the process before it is actually created, which can be avoided by excessive errors and expenses.
PLM facilitated the development of Canon photo equipment, Sukhoi aircraft or Nissan's most recent commercial vehicles.
Siegfried Russwurm, the leading industrial division of Siemens, explains that the use of this software enabled the Red Bull team to "in a few hours, almost real time" the modification and perfection that otherwise are detected during races and tests.
Russwurm says that in 1992, average 10 technicians were employed who were able to perform at least three or four perfectings over a period of one period.
The Red Bull team is currently working on 180 highly qualified professionals equipped with an executive information technology that analyzes and proposes any type of vehicle modification.
Siemens explained that the PLM software is capable of analysing and improving all elements of Red Bull racing vehicles with the exception of the engine to which Renault is fully responsible.
Materials, fuel, aerodynamics and safety components are modified.
Changes can be transferred from virtual reality to reality within less than 24 hours thanks to advanced manufacturing systems using laser and highly technologically advanced vehicles.
The only limit for this technical facility is the amount of $40 million representing a maximum which can be issued by each Formula 1 team for each period to improve its competitiveness.
Red Bull set a distance of 50 km from London's race of spicy technologies for the design and production of its racing cars.
It's about two buildings where I'm limited in access - especially for journalists.
All that is being played here is considered a "great secret."
The list of participants of this project includes 580 persons including two pilots - the Vettel and Mark Webber champion.
Herdino Red Bullu is in Formula 1 without any doubt the pure Sebastian Vettel champion.
According to the disproportionate technological means that the sign of energy drinks has contributed to its participation in the competition areas, other protagonists are also hiding their help which is invaluable and no one knows.
The chief of manufacturing technology Steve Nevey says that five years ago it was possible to say that the progress in the research and development of vehicles contributed to 50% victory and the rest of the passengers' benefit.
At present, this ratio has changed and technology stands for 85% success, while pilots contribute 15%.
Nevey admits that the Vettel or Webber will never be replaced by the calculation technique because they are "unpredictable gladiators".
HP manages its own business for two years in cooperation with local distributors
Hewlett-Packard (HP) in cooperation with his trading partner Pont Reyes opened his first exclusive sale in Barcelona yesterday.
This company will be the first from the network of 20 shops to range from 80 to 100 m2, which this international company plans to open in Spain for the next two years.
These shops will also be located in 16 existing shops such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn or El Corte English.
The Vice-President of the Spanish HP Helena Herrero cited as an example of a new stop sale on the Barcelona Gran Vía, a company belonging to Pont Reyes, with which HP has been working for 30 years.
The North American company reached a plan to set up 200 sales places in Europe by 2013, which includes 20 Spanish shops.
The first sales were opened last week in Bucharest (Romansia) and in Belgrade (Serbian), trade in Barcelona is therefore the third.
Herrero didn't want to build where other sales would be opened, yet she admitted that Madrid could be one of the following places.
Herrero, which is also leading HP personnel systems, has ensured that the opening of business philosophy is still the same - with the use of local distributors who have sector experience and expertise.
The North American company here offers exclusive equipment design for sale (with products which may be tested interactively) which will be identical in Europe.
In addition, HP is also responsible for providing business staff.
Helena Herrer said it would be a matter of franchising and stressed that the exclusive network is sold to "improve customer service, services to small and medium-sized enterprises at the purchase, service, sales service and even the coast".
Trade in Barcelona is part of the pilot pioneer programme at world level, which aims to address any problems with computer equipment in the guarantee.
The online service is offered with a technical centre based in Maastricht (Nisoland).
"So we'll be able to solve problems that may last for up to two days in 10 minutes."
"This system is specially designed for small and medium-sized enterprises and ordinary customers, given that large companies already have contractual technical assistance," highlighted Helena Herrer yesterday.
Sababell is convinced that he's been stealing for three years from his competitors millions of customers.
More optimistic than any other chief, delegated member of the Bank Banco Sabadell Council, Jaime Guardiola, believes that 2011 will be an order for the bank, but rejects the new liquidity crisis and warns the end of the passive war.
However, it is calculated by lowering the rate of interest rates, which will however attempt to compensate for the decrease in bank fees and credit prices.
Sababell expects him to be able to get a million private clients within three years.
Sababell has found a way to use the next three years and to survive under difficult economic conditions.
The Bank will launch a new strategic plan for three years in 2011.
The aim is, in addition to surviving without the need to turn to public aid in the FROB, to get market share by attracting millions of new private customers - their respective 700,000, if those who, if possible, leave the bank - since until now the constitution has been more expensive for small and medium-sized enterprises and large companies than for small customers.
This year the bank has already acquired 250,000 private customers and 50,000 companies.
Its share in the market is about 3.5% of private customers, while it's more than 10% in business customers.
Another of the main views of the 2011-2013 plan is the commitment to productivity or also to flexibility, with a view to reducing the costs which the bank will show when the results are presented during the period.
No bank institutions are currently considering setting targets and publishing them as the financial crisis has changed all the plans of the world banking.
This year Sababell closed its Optima programme, which was established four years ago, although it was originally three years old, but the situation on the markets required expansion for another period.
Clients who leave the office will be their main target group.
At a meeting organized by the APIE Guardiola, the year 2011 will be "hard and very important".
It is thought that the road from the crisis in Spain "will be slow".
In addition, for two or three years it will be "very difficult to create employment", which is essential for the survival of the banking sector.
And although they believe that the passive war - which reduces the margin - will rise, the price of the risk premium paid by banks and investors for their emissions in order to obtain liquidity, is already being transferred to the prices of loans that compensate for the reduction of the margin.
"The issue of liquidity and financing is structural and will represent a pressure factor on credit."
"We haven't shut down yet, but differentials are very high," admitted Guardiola.
Banesto has already issued its network on Thursday order to reduce long-term credit and increase the prices of differentials - see CincoDías on 22 and 27 November.
He also recognized that the trend in banking "there is a reduction in supply", but there is a "competitive framework".
The Sabadell Bank's strategic plan is based on organic growth, while the group does not normally exclude corporate operations.
It does not guarantee free will that in Spain they "will demand greater sizes".
"The next year won't be left on the stone," he assured.
It confirms that capital needs are "adequately reduced" and does not rule out that some Spanish institution will enter between red numbers.
And it shows that FROB can manage to pool funds on the market before a new capital measure.
After ensuring that Sababell can survive the temporary closure of the markets, it continues to pose a serious problem that some bankers predict as a new liquidity crisis.
It means that it cannot be issued but, unlike what was in June, short-term funding can be obtained through a repo rate which calms the crisis.
The ECA excludes another wave of fussed
The Director-General of the ESCA refused yesterday that another wave should be created and resumed at the pace of reorganisation of the sector.
When he started the Spanish association process, several institutions were assured that this first phase was not involved and are waiting for a second round.
However, the Director-General of the Spanish Confederation (CECA) Mr José Antonio Olavarrieta yesterday excluded that a new wave of these operations should arise.
"I believe that most of the mergers have already been carried out, Cajasol's incorporation into the Banca Cívica group cannot be considered as a second wheel, what is going on is the contract."
"Most of them are fully implemented; it is possible that instead of 17 articles we will go to 13 or 14, but all major processes are already ready and under the protection of the Spanish National Bank, which worked very well in this regard," said the director.
In his statements at the ADEA meeting (Association of leading and executive officials in Aragon - see also) Olavarrieta said that the concentration process is being carried out "as fast as possible and we must be very calm as it is shown in payments that are not now revealed in business plans with the Spanish national bank," he stressed.
"To go from 45 compared with the average assets of 28,000 million to 17 with 75,500 million is a process that has no comparison history, which reduces the number of institutions by 62% to make these larger and this fall in line with the Basel Treaty," he said.
Olavarrieta recognized that "there are a number of very few happy views on the slow process", which show "a lack of seriousness and understanding", because "what the Spanish National Bank does is to remind us that we must be in the end of the year".
Director General CECA José Antonio Olavarrieta yesterday made sure that Spain has the most accurate financial system across Europe and "probably" in the world, and those who doubt this have contributed to "the lack of knowledge".
The director noted that in the current favourable economic situation, "we can be calm" with regard to financial institutions and the system which managed "very important" the concentration process and which continues "as fast as possible".
He also recalled that Spain’s banking was very well out of the stress tests carried out by the European Central Bank in July.
Zapatero and red German line
Berlin decided to maintain the euro, but laid down conditions for the Union as a whole.
The pressure on the markets caused two government responses.
On the one hand, José Luis Zapatero proposed new adaptation measures, from lowering taxes for small and medium-sized enterprises, through the regulation of private brokering agencies or the cancellation of EUR 426 for unemployed persons, until after privatization of 49% AENA (Spanish airports and air traffic management – see also), Barajas and El Prat Airport Manager and 30% State Lotteries.
Vice-President Elena Salgado, with the support of former Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez, contributed to the criticisms at the address of Chancellor Angely Merkel because of her responsibility for resolving the current crisis.
How do you interpret this motion?
It has been said that Merkel's position is not a mistake in her communication policy.
However, this is the next item in the complex process of reddefinition of the euro.
And here Germany has a radically new vision of what its future will be, which undermines the idea of keeping old traditions, which is held by a large part of the other members.
In the face of European resistance, three possible routes from the crisis are being explored in Germany.
The first of these is a strong euro area, which would be part of Germany, for example, Austria or the Netherlands, while the southern states would leave the mesh area.
The second is to return to March - although it can now be seen as a scissors, this version has wide public support, approaching 50% of the population.
The third option is according to German proposals for the processing of the euro with greater macro-economic surveillance, budgetary competence, accounts for the Member States, possible payment costs for some of them, and the expansion of possible costs for the regulation on the private sector.
The German position is clear and it's been defined for some time, so there's no space for escape now.
First of all, when the International Monetary Fund and the European Commission committed deficits in 2009, the German Government lifted the constitutional reform to prevent them from leaving 2016.
This was the first sign of a dispute between what Germany considered to be the right (taxation plans and the stability of public finances) and what its European partners practiced, including France.
The other showed this central European country when Merkel was severely opposed to the Greek rescue decision.
It was already the subject of serious criticism, but it is true that the political consensus in Germany and the public opinion, which was also published, were strongly opposed to the salvation of Greece.
Finally, in the last few days of October, Mercel again had a clear position when it called for the reform of the European Union's treaties so that it could be saved by a Member State and at the same time be obliged to bear part of the costs.
This opinion was interpreted as anti-European because it accelerated the Irish crisis and all the others.
However, its proposal, although in some peaceful manner, has been approved, and during the next few months we should follow the reform process of the Union which should allow this measure since 2013.
The German ran a red line that he didn't agree to cross.
And it tells us that even now there is a need to take measures that are obviously not in agreement with it, since this date will end with the old operation of the euro.
The year 2013 will represent the emergence of new exchange zones in which Member States are severely penalised and may be forced to report the suspension of payments, and the private sector will also have to bear part of the costs.
Germany points out that we need to make an accurate path to growth by increasing the level of support and investment, balanced consumption, improved productivity and competitiveness, and capital reserves.
Another option is based on search and construction, with huge limits in the payment balance, which governments in the years of Spain's growth are simply not willing to tolerate.
The offer is clear.
And we'd make a mistake if we didn't understand.
It is only about the renewal of the public deficit by 3% in 2013.
What they want for us is much harder.
And the worst thing is that under these conditions, we could be wrong ourselves.
I hope these current turbulence will bring more rest.
And we're taking advantage of the opportunities they give us by the spring of 2013.
It seems that Prime Minister Zapatero has also understood this and his two statements (reforms promised after meeting with large companies from last Saturday and yesterday's announcement of new measures) suggest that, through criticism at Merkel's address, he opened his way of thinking that things should be put in order.
But the red line that Germany ran is here, and it doesn't seem like it's going to move with her.
And from the possibilities to be considered, the release of the euro area cannot completely exclude serious countries.
Well, Germany will always be able to tell us it protected us.
Sports and rules processing
Fines, led by Alonso and Ramos in the game with Ajax, show a girl never intended to avoid punishment.
It was thought that the release of two Real Madrid players (Xabiho Alonsa and Sergei Ramose) in the League of Masters against Ajax on 23 November made it clear that the sea was inconsistencies about whether this is non-portrait behavior and whether UEFA should not be affected by both football players.
As it is known, a few minutes before the end of the game (which had their team clearly won) the names of players each other significantly wasted time at the time when he had to play the faul so as to provoke the judge, and he showed them a second yellow card.
In this way they both are playing full-time punishment in the next game against Auxerre - while Real Madrid ends in its group in the head - and they will be able, free card, to continue into the next phase.
Finally, the UEFA disciplinary committee punished coach José Mourin on two charges and the prosecutors received money.
The extraction of yellow cards under similar conditions is not a new practice, although most of it is common in football.
It's so wide that it's part of the etose football, so the rules that are written are not written, but are being followed.
The part of the discussion in this case was due to the fact that her participant was a Real Madrid team (which in its humorous humility and respect, which had already been touched by similar acts by its players), and as it seems, also thanks to dramatization led by Mourinh, which thus adds itself to its long history of comedian and the cause of another episode.
In any case, the debate is about whether this type of action which is not explicitly prohibited is in line with the principles of sport, so whether it comes to the exercise of the right; it is an effect on action that respects the rules of sport which are intended to be included as far as it seems to be concerned.
It's a matter of what kind of damage such behavior causes a sports spirit.
One of the proper sports behaviour is the physical disability of players who have not been injured in these cases or have not come to violent games.
Another of these appropriate features of the clean game is to avoid having players have their own rebellion against the enemy team - which has not come here either.
Thus, the paradox of the action of real Madrid players is the fact that it has not come to what we normally characterise as a forest or law enforcement, it has not come to a hidden violation of rules in order to avoid sanctions, although this behaviour should be the most consistent with the objective of punishment.
They waited and liked the punishment.
The next question, however, is what the benefits of their deliberate sin will be.
It is necessary to note here that the competition does not reach an inappropriate position and that there is no benefit in the current game, as it is evident that the team will have fewer players on its own.
And it's not even a useful strategy in another game, because the club won't be able to count on these players.
The outcome clearly begins when players begin another phase of the Ligy Masters without a card that could threaten their participation in the future game.
However, it is a long-term advantage and with a certain degree of uncertainty, so it can be eliminated from the first view by the team, and in this respect, the players will be punished, and they will go to the second round of the car where one card is less than the first round.
So as the car goes on, it won't be quite clear if it's for the benefit.
In short and well, these meetings will not be against the sports spirit, which is part of making a strategic decision that will allow maximum benefits under the rules to be achieved.
In the case where we are staying here, the players should not have chosen to avoid being punished (which would have been a clear case of behaviour of rules), however, they would have chosen to do so.
They made a strategic decision without avoiding or fleeing from a punishment.
Although there is no limit between doubt and rule-making, I believe that in this case there was a uniform approach to doubt.
It seems to me that the controversy arises for two reasons: because it was about two self-determinations and the way in which the transmission of instructions was carried out to draw them out.
The breach of the sport principles of these actions is not as ethical as aesthetic as it is.
Combating the sale of Christmas parties in Barcelona
The dictatorship of the calendar concentrates this year on the mountain reserved for 16 and 17 December.
It will soon be celebrated by single employees who want to lose between 20 and 30 euros.
Like Turkish medium or lottery, with the arrival of December, pre-alternative parties that continue to act as a sugar bomb for restaurants and leisure facilities in Barcelona, however, the crisis has led to a price reduction fight: almost everyone wants to spend between 20 and 30 euros on food, and business and association issues from this sector are agreed.
In order to complete the complexity of the figures, the calendar of this year (when the Friday day came) concentrated on the application for a week from 13 December, which resulted in a day-to-day reserve (16 and 17), while there was almost no operation in the previous week.
As it has been since 2008, when lost years began, there are many companies that have broken down the collective dividends for budgetary reasons.
In order not to let tradition go, many employees pay the rent at the parties from their own pockets.
Regardless of the situation, many require price limits, the president of the restaurant association Gremi de Restoración de Barcelona, Gaieeta Farras.
The representative of the patronage of restaurant facilities shall not at this time be required to predict what will be the celebration of this month.
"People think it's a good idea before they make reservations."
"They want to go out, but when it comes to price, they're careful," she adds.
Trades are good for those "who offer quality and good service at affordable prices", she says and recalls that through the crisis, customers tend to go down and most customers want to spend about 25 euros now.
The investigation in various devices shows that the greatest effort required for booking is on the evening of 17 December.
The Soteras Group shall report a real booking boom on this Friday, with the highest requirements for losses up to 30 euros, which have been affected by the proposed menu, whose total prices are from 25 to 30 euros.
in another major company, Andilana, which is reading 16 facilities in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Funda and so forth), has brought with it the special feature of the annual calendar of time reserves and this has been since the beginning of November.
"We have made it possible and impossible to keep prices from a long year, and our menu from which everyone should choose will move from 1995 to 30 euros," they say.
The AN Group, which belongs to El Mussol, Attic, QuQu and a total of 23 companies, remains optimistic after the second half of the profits increase and has relatively solid views on the holiday market.
The sources of this company point out that 18 December will also be difficult, as the premise between friends will end.
to their six group menu they added the menu of dinner, with a budget of 30 euros or more, as they recorded in comparison with the long-term trend of guests to lose 10% more exchanges for other items such as caca (Spanish wild wines - p.r. change.).
They also noted that companies that call their employees again appear and that the size of the group seems to be something bigger.
The Vice-President of Fecassarm (which includes institutions such as Bar Association, Restaurant and Free Time Centre in Barcelona) Henri Goma believes that he starts to see the end of the tunnel and claims that the number of bookings is "lived", although the customers "correspond to maximum".
Not even during the Christmas celebration, this idea shows who pays it.
Pakistan's nuclear programme has produced a great disillusionment in the United States
Islamabad produces nuclear weapons "faster than any other country".
The Wikileaks documents confirm the links between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of correspondence between the United States Embassy in Pakistan and the US Ministry of Foreign Affairs published by the Wikileaks Portal confirms the extraordinary silence that triggers a Pakistan nuclear programme in Washington.
According to the clear and significant details offered regarding the content of the communication and the opinion of representatives of the North American diplomat in Islamabad, these documents show that cooperation between the two states, in terms of nuclear security, is "in progress", and that this unstable Asian country produces "more nuclear weapons than any other State".
The particular feature of the Pakistan nuclear programme - that its weapons are not assembled but are based on the work to ease their destruction in the event of an attack - is one of the main reasons why Washington is used.
This calculates a great deal in Pakistan by Anne W. Patterson in a report before the visit of this national security adviser James Jones: "The proximity of some nuclear installations to the territory under Taliban control, the apparent proliferation of nuclear materials and the vulnerability of the transport of nuclear material".
The increase in the number of people associated with nuclear arsenals and the shooting programme has already been observed not only by the United States but also by Russia, as a whole and as a reason to be cautious.
"Pakistan has had to hire personnel with a strong religious belief to protect nuclear devices; given the fall in education and culture, extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit people who will work in nuclear programmes or controlled shooting programmes," said expert Jurij Korelev from the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs at meetings with their U.S.
The largest news document published by the server Julian Assangho is that it continues to reduce cooperation between the United States and Pakistan on the proliferation of nuclear weapons and the increased rate of Pakistan ' s production of these weapons.
Debes issued by the Ambassador in May, which qualifies communication with Pakistan as "frustrating", says: "Transparence often does not exist; aid offers remain unrepealed or are rejected".
In another report, Peter Lavoy, a national intelligence service worker for South Asia, notes that "even in the face of economic disaster, Pakistan produces nuclear weapons as quickly as no other state in the world".
Petterson also asks Washington to "be very clear" during the visit of General Ashfaq Kayani's army chief" that "the Pakistani army must end with silent support to terrorist groups".
She's head of Wikileaks.
Both appoint a highly established staff member responsible for the fight against terrorism to avoid new incidents of information.
Interpol issues "red challenge" with the aim of investigating and identifying where Assange might be.
All about Wikileaks and his founder Julian Assangho are creating a complicated labyrinth where it is difficult to be sure of the facts.
Yesterday, Interpol announced "extraordinary challenge", i.e. a series of notes, to "localization and monitoring of movement" Assanaho.
However, it is not a classic order for detention.
In addition, this challenge is not new, but it is due until November 20.
And there is nothing more than four million diplomatic documents to do with the last one, despite the allegations of sexual abuse that Australia is facing in Sweden.
According to this, the legal representative of Wikileaks Mark Stephens assures us that "the police know where and how to contact Mr. Assang".
On 20 November, however, when the International Police Council in France issued this order at the request of Sweden, it did not publish it until yesterday when it received permission from the Swedish authorities.
In this situation, 188 Interpol countries have instructions for the identification or location of Assangho "with a view to temporarily withdrawing and issuing it".
Although Interpol cannot order detention of persons facing the Red Challenge, many Member States, as the organisation has explained, consider the so-called number of notes for possible arrests to be carried out - this must be ensured by the national police component - particularly in the event of States having an emergency extradition agreement, such as in the case of Sweden and England, where it is likely that Assange should be found.
This step has been broken by Assenge lawyers who published writing yesterday, where 9-year-old Vicileaks said he was willing to answer questions from Swedish authorities through videoconferencing.
They also recall that Asseng requested and subsequently obtained permission to leave Sweden from the prosecutors of his case, which compares with the legendary Lavlovič Berjeu, chief of Stalin's security.
"This is an honor and not a legal pursuit," writes the letter.
While the whole world is looking for - and from Australia his mother respects his son's innocence - Assange is still in an unknown place, yet German.
On Monday, he gave Skype an interview from an unknown location to the chief editor of Time magazine - in this conversation he asked the demistries of the United States Foreign Minister Hillary Clinton.
"If it is shown that it was responsible for the US diplomats' ordering them to carry out Spanish operations in the UN and violate such international agreements as the United States has signed, it should resign," he said.
His view yesterday was rejected by the press spokesman for the White House Robert Gibbs, who qualified for the dementia requirement as "mortal and absurd".
"I'm not quite sure why we should rely on an individual who runs a website," he said to CNN.
Obama himself believed a highly established staff member responsible for the fight against terrorism, Rusella Traverse, in order to hide other details of the document.
President Barack Obamy's intention to stop adding Assange to the importance is in contrast with the views expressed by conservative politicians and commentators today.
Peter King, a member of the Congress, who will be chairman of the National Security Committee in the Lower Room in January, asked the foreign ministry to explore the possibility of including Wikileaks between terrorist organisations "that it might be possible to intervene and reach anyone who would financially assist them or otherwise provide assistance".
Tom Flanagan, the councillor of Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper, who announced that Assange should "be killed", which he then had to call.
"We both should write a reward or use a pilot-free plane or something."
The one who didn't talk was Mike Huckabee, the Baptist priest, former governor of Arkansas and a potential candidate for the president.
"Whoever is in the government, who is responsible for the crime of information, has committed treason and any other punishment than the correction would be too peaceful," declared Fox station
Puigcercós is looking for the ERC calm "flying" on Caroda's farm
The President of the Republic shall allow the party to vote in secret on its detention.
Huguet proposes more plural execution and the end of the consultation system.
Joan Puigcercós has apparently found a recipe to fight a number of internal revolutions in a series of ERAs (Levic Republican side of Catalán - vs. vs.), an endless loss of 11 Members and half votes.
The Chair of the Party is aware that his gesture with regard to demeaning seems insufficient to former leader Josepa Lluís Caroda-Roviry's colleagues, and he also knows that the impact of this sector is now as weak as his leader himself, and that he can't make any of the concerns he had with other losses.
Therefore, the leader of Levice will try to find new criticisms by means of migrating, which will help him turn to popular tastes.
Firstly, Puigcercós first announced yesterday that more than 200 members of the National Committee would be able to speak in secret to him.
I'm not going to raise my hands.
If the Carodians want to present the President with a criminal vote, they will be able to do so without fear of the measures being taken.
In fact, the chief wants to avoid spoiling and detailing his own people.
in several discussions he claimed that he would not be considered a confirmed half-voice and one-off, but added, without explaining the percentage that it would also not be a good result "in Bulgarian".
Caroda's staff require more of the President than they can give their functions - which they consider to be a gesture that has no weight, as Puigcercós rules the highest authority on seats.
But given that they don't have enough to expel dementia, they'll try to remember an executive plan from now on to May.
It is therefore expected that they will participate in the development of a strategic reorientation document to be held by the National Council on 18 May.
Their aim is to support Puigcercóse in exchange for this promise to move the convention in the winter of 2011.
The ERC leader stated that "multi-voice" is damaging stability and that his aim is to once and for all that organisation is capable of doing its spinal work behind closed doors.
In this context, there seems to be a prominent article that current consultant Joseph Huguet has signed on his blog.
After taking Puigcercós's ideology into account, this innovation consultant took it for granted that the leader would be confirmed "in exchange for several purposes".
And he named them five, of which two are alike.
The first is "recommendation" of executives in order to represent at least 90% of the members, which means including new forms that are also from the CARODO sector.
The second goal can be a big news item.
Huguet proposes that the ERC be fully consulted as a operating mechanism.
This is how it is fighting to reform states so that Congress can be concluded by means of elected delegates.
Ending with the model of the meeting system, the exception in the Spanish political party system, is the intended goal of the Puigcercós team which has already fought in this direction for the last two sessions.
However, the 2008 warm meeting decided that the meeting must be assessed at a special convention on state reform.
This concern is still unresolved because the situation within the party reflects the solution to this issue.
Now, without critical sectors, it could be time to get back to this issue and try to close it once and for all.
23 murdered in November; 390 in 2010
According to MILLENIO, Mexico reported a decline in 4 cases compared with 2010.
In November 23 persons were killed in Mexico, less than four months ago, as reported by MILLENIO.
Among the murders are cases of three women and find a couple of separate bodies in Mexico City.

The victim suffered at least three shots, further wound from compassion to his head and had hands and legs tied to the neck.
The next day a body was found in a cave that was placed in the outer space of a vehicle over the Mixtecas street, in the Santa Cruz Acatalán colony, in the Naucalpan period.
Early on the morning of Thursday, 4 November, the members of the community revealed non-significant torture signs and at least three fatal shots into the mine near Tenango-Ixtapan de la Sal in the summer of Villa Guerrero.
According to the body, the report is probably signed by the criminal organization La Familia Michoacana.
On a later day, in Nezahualcóyotl, a man who had been murdered for ten years was shot eight times after he left his house and wanted to start collecting waste.
On November 7, two victims at the age of 30 were shot in the San Pedro Xalactoc colony, in the Ecatepec period.
In Chalco there was a dead man shot into the head on a distant road in the El Naranjo colony, and under the body was a gun gun of 25 caliber.
In Ecatepec, parts of the human body were found in the canal of wastewater in Playa Golondrina colony.
Saved components carried out a thorough search of other parts of it, however they did not find them.
The inhabitants of Tepotzotlán reported finding bodies with their hands tied back and stuck their heads in the place of Pen Colorada.
A man had an injury from a gun on his way home.
In half of the month, two men were reported to have been killed in the bedroom and left in the parking space of the vehicle in Villas de la Hacienda in the Atizapán de Zaragoza period.
The following day was found in the Valle de los Reyes colony during the Los Reyes La Paz cardboard box containing human head.
in a nearby colony he was found the remains of the body that was damaged in a black plastic bag, reported by El Incorregible.
On the seventeenth, two dead women were found wrapped in bed in Zoquiapan's camp during Ixtapaluca, and on the second day a man was found in Huixquilucan who was previously infected with yellow bluetongue, which according to reports of his body's death, was identified as Mario Ríos.
in Ixtapaluca there was a woman without a record of life with two wounds in her pocket.
The tattooing of Santa Muert's sacred status on women's skin was revealed (the text "Holy Death" - see also footnote) as well as its likes.
At the end of the month, at the city of Zinacantepec, a dead man with at least three shooting wounds was found in the car and reported to the criminal group.
Two days later, two men were found who had head covered with sand and were also reported in the village of Puente de Piedra, in Santiago Tepatlaxco.
The victim was probably one of the criminal organizations in which it said, "This will happen to those who don't fit".
two bodies were found in Ecatepec, which carried signs of torture and had binding conclusions, within a taxi left behind by the Centre of Justice in the San Agustin colony.
The last day of the month, two men were found in Los Reyes La Paz and Nezahualcoyotl.
The first one was tied up and found in the Cuchilla Ancón colony and wrapped in black plastic bags, bound with sand and had a message left with it; while the second was studied and found in the plastic lake in the streets of Colonia Juárez.
There were agents with him, and the letter was sent.
China maintains its goal to reduce greenhouse gas emissions
The representative of this country at the UN Conference on Climate Change COP16 ensured that its country had developed extraordinary efforts to reduce carbon prices and stressed that it was committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by between 40 and 45% by 2020.
China will keep its promise to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45% in 2020, Su Wei, representative of this country at the UN climate change conference.
At its first public meeting at the 16th UN Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change Su Wei ensured that its country had developed an inalienable effort to reduce carbon levels and change its industry.
He said his country had already invested $245 million in efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions over the last four years.
However, it has become clear that China will not change its objectives and will continue to work with the international community.
He referred to that the Chinese strategy for climate change is divided into the following four items: dialogue, capacity-building, institution-building and support for pilot programmes.
In all these points, progress has already been made to explain, among other things, the adoption of a new Act on Energy, which includes the proposed objectives of reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
It further stressed that the federal authorities in China worked in coordination with the provincial and local authorities to achieve their objectives in terms of energy mitigation, energy efficiency and emission reduction.
Further, as he said, various plans have been carried out or have been completed, which are funded by both the Chinese Government and the governments of other States.
For example, it was pointed out that the Programme for the Effective Use of Energy, which was introduced over the last five years and which had received investment from the UN, government and private initiatives.
The provincial climate change project is also underway, further the project of exchanges for adhesion plants and a reconciliation and adaptation project has been clarified.
At the same table, Martin Krol, the country's expert adviser for climate change, assured him that China's efforts were greater than he generally thought.
For example, the greenhouse gas emissions on one citizen represent 6 tonnes in China, while in the United States it is 100 tonnes; China is responsible for 9% of the historical share of emissions.
It has also developed unprecedented efforts in terms of energy use - for example, it has increased energy efficiency by 20% over the last five years and expected further progress by 2020.
Legally excluded Espin: César Nava
The National President of the PAN (Partido Action National, Czech National Action Party - p.r.) stated that the former President of the Party is entitled to apply to the National Order Commission his or her right.
The National President of the PAN, César Nava Vázquez, ensured that Manuel Espiny Barrentos was granted exemption and that the former President of this party was entitled to return to the National Order Commission and to apply for his right.
In the discussion held before the opening of the appeal by the Governor of Gabon Cué Monteagud said that the exclusion of Spain is in any case a decision taken at the local level.
"It's an autonomous decision of the Order Commission in Sonor."
"Mr. Espino shall have the right to speak to the National Council by means of difficulties in his case in order to deal with the decision made by the competent authority," he added.
He further explained that there is no time to think about 2012 and that he was never at the joint table on the presidential candidate alliance.
Nava Vázquez expressed his conviction that the PAN will come out of the internal elections of the following 4 and 5 December, in which his successor will be strengthened.
"This (aliance in 2012) is a topic that was never at the board of directors, at least not too far away, was intended for local elections that were successful and fulfilled its purpose," he added.
The PAN President said that there is 71 years of dialogue behind him, and that is why "we are not relieved of internal competition, but we are suffering from it and strengthening us," he added.
He said that without debate, the Committee could choose the best president or president to whom the PAN deserves for the next three years, so he gave the staff to "who the committee appoints".
"I am therefore absolutely calm and relieved, any of these five with pride I give to the Bureau of the President of the Party."
He predicted that the rise by the party in recent July elections would be reflected in future vows, although "there is no time to think about 2012".
"There is no need for Governor Gabina Cué to perform this task."
In this connection, he stressed that these three governments, which have roots in alliances in Oaxaca, Pueble and Sinaloe, will represent the train and will be subject to observation throughout the country, since "there are many expectations and complaints in them, and I am sure that Gabino will be able to do so".
When we asked her about the criticisms of President Felipe Calderón by the PRI (Partido Revolucionario Institutional, Czech Institutional, p.m.) because of his four years in office, César Nava invited the members of the PRI to think about the six-year period of former presidents Ernesta Zedilla and Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
"If Zedilla and Salinas are thought to be better than Foxe and Claderón, then let them start calling them out of their streets," he testified.
He claimed that the head of the federal executive authority has the right to express himself as he did during the show in the National Auditorium, since there is no theft or censorship in this country.
Both promote on Twitter the law to support students without evidence
"If you think the adoption of the Dream Act is right, let your senators know and urge them to accept this law," a US president tweeted on a popular social network.
President Barack Obama joined the national mobilisation in support of the Dream Act, which should legislate students without documents on his personal account.
"If you think the adoption of the Dream Act is right, let your senators know and urge them to accept this law," Obama tweeted.
His short report warns of an Internet link to a document that requires the public to contact the senators without delay, as the vote on this law is near.
"Because it is expected that the vote will take place soon, now it's time to let your opinion be taken," she says.
The report was published after 42 Republican senators threatened to block the adoption of any law unless an increase in tax reductions from the Bush era and government funding has been approved.
Such blockade, which was announced by the letter signed by 42 Republican senators, could affect the vote on the Dream Act law and other projects such as the ratification of a new agreement with Russia against the proliferation of nuclear weapons, called START.
When asked about the Republican blockade of the Dream Act and other proposals, the president said he believed that once the fiscal issue was resolved, a calendar could be set up for the rest of the projects.
"I believe there's still a lot of time left..."
"We all agree that we must resolve the tax issue before the end of the year..."
I believe that we will be able to reach an agreement on this subject at some point and then we will be able to plan a series of other matters," he said.
The leader of most democratic senator Harry Reid announced in the morning that he would ask for "vote for closure of the debate" concerning the Dream Act law, so the proposal to legalize students without evidence could be voted in the Senate on Thursday, although it is likely next week.
The senatorial approval of Dream Act or the law of "American dream" would legislate the mass of 800 thousand young people who were admitted to the United States 16 years ago, remained in the country for the last five years and were admitted to higher education or military institutions.
However, the students need 60 votes in favour, because they need the help of several Republicans, so their associations make intensive efforts to ensure the approval of this Act.
Democrats, most of whom support Dream Act, have 58 mandates.
However, at least one of them, Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska said he would vote against, and only one Republican, Richard Lugar of India, expressed his support for this law.
Therefore, the participants in the Dream Act project need to get several Republicans to decide to reject the proposal.
Among the Republican senators, with whom the most famous are the senators from Maine Olimpia Snowe and Susan Colins, as well as the representative senator from Florida George Lemieux, who completed the mandate of Senator Mela Martínez.
Other Republicans who in the past supported Dream Act are Orrin Hatch from Utah and Kay Bailey Hutchison from Texas, but announced that she will no longer support it.
Another republican who supported the proposal, John McCain, has not yet expressed himself.
Although the snowy representatives are attracted to another version, most analysts believe Dream Act will face the biggest obstacle in the Senate.
with literature inserting the finger into the wound ("poner el dedo en la llaga", translated "put the finger into the wound" is the period of Czech "put the plunger on the head - see also)
The second cycle of language pleasure was a walk where participants presented a literary gallery of presentation
"That's why I understand sex in Spanish, but... Right to the wound? What's waiting for me?", the writer Luisa Valenzuel, who was invited to begin the second round of fun with language, the cycle that celebrates the literature written in Spanish, and her question was used for this opportunity as a subheading (in another corner, the subject of sex was discussed in the golden table in the language, explained).
In the early morning, "It brings us to the castles", an Argentinian writer kindly handed out to the public, composed mostly of young people who attended the International Book Fair in Guadalajara to hear this debate at the golden table, modernized Marisol Schultz and with the participation of Valenzuelo, Sergia Ramíreze, Mayry Montereve and Luis Garcíi Montere.
Luisa Valenzuel read the text that she gave to Gonzalu Cellorio, which Schultz later noted for the great news in which Luisa appeared in the first person as a protagonist, who, in the search for knowledge, is coming from a doctor who does not receive any answers from the same story.
From the infectology, there's a conviction that "patience isn't my strong site, maybe it's my early morning."
Finally, after frustration with the traumatologist who took her breath in the middle of the road, he explained to her that the wound is not a scientific term, it's a psychoanalytic that reveals this secret: "The morning represents this really open and this symbolic language is the tongue."
The protagonist slowly woke up and concluded that "in the morning it was only possible for her to know that it was really broken up and that it does not exist", but she was convinced that the pleasure and threats in the language must go hand in hand.
Writer Valenzuel's game with both.
Nicaragujec Sergio Ramírez also appeared with a lovely statement called Praise Investance, in which his finger is not named in the morning, but at one point it appears.
from the roots of magical realism, she brought back the famous wizard who played the Dark, people who went away, or repaired the honour that one woman lost, this story that then turned to America, a great novel, where his own chroniclers who had sent it, and here is quoted by Bernal Díaz del Castillo, who criticises the transfer of the recipient's capital.
"Cervantes, who found us all (writers), laughed at the fictitious witness presented in the past as real, but in another way he never managed to tell American stories with such imagery that he even worked here."
However, he stressed that "they are crazy and liars who have greater fantasies" and right where the reality and lie are where they don't know what the story belongs to one group and what happens to the other, they achieve the fictional literature of their top.
It's called the "Servant tradition" effect.
"We've got what we've got because of it."
The following Mayra Monter has highlighted and praised the diversity of interpretations that enabled the invitation of the International Book Encyclopedia to his Word Prist to strike.
The Cuban-Portorian writer showed his finger on a large scale of social violence that goes through her country - and shares Latin America - and is the result of commercial disputes and drug sales.
"I think that good literature, good poetry and good song closes the silent compromise which is of course not conceived," she said, after which she pointed out that the reality of literature is communication and the dimension of the compromise created between the author and the readers - and in their "chemical reaction".
In the evening, Spanish poet Luis García Montero closed, whose exhibition also marked "this finger to the wound of the author's bound".
He said that in a fast world, as well as in intellectual customs and control of consciousness that transcends dogmatism, he would remember that "the small is not hidden by every attack and every obstacle is also small yes."
"To be masters of our ideas and realities we must be colored: and to paint a significant number of times to place a finger on the wound and to burden those individuals who are much more comfortable, as they think in characters, blacks, in fixed ideas and without coloring, and also to burden authorities who prefer this black world," he said to support the sense of writing.
Romano goes after his first title
Rubén Omar Romano reads three hits in the finals, during his career he lived good and bad, but he was already able to reach three opportunities on the decisive series.
in Santos Laguna and Monterrey in the final, there are also two different styles identifying their techniques, teams that have different differences in results.
Rubén Omar Romano is reading three victories in the finals, during his career he has lived good and bad, but he has been able to reach out on three occasions on the decisive series, but until now he's gone with an unlimited, and that's why this chance is extraordinary for him.
Argentinan had to calm down with a silver medal, remained a victory step and played with the same team next to the finals.
The Santistic strategy as a trainer came to his first final in the Apertura tournament 2002 when he was in charge of the Morelia Club, with which he had a total of 4-2 against Toluce; then in the Klausura tournament 2003 he returned to the decisive duele and also lost it with a total score 3-1, which was against the Rayados team.
Already with the Santos Laguna club in Tourneo Bicentenario 2010, again against "Devils" from Toluky, Rubén once again suffered defeat, although his team played against "Uzners" (another review of the Deportivo Toluca club - no.) after 210 minutes of games uncertainly 2-2, after a series of violent shootings, he got three on one and had two opportunities to write a title, but at the end of his three players passed 11 steps and the team suffered 4-3.
Rubén has already won two finals against the "Red Devils" from Toluky and one against Monterey, his future rival, so he would like to avoid the same fate and escape the curse, and he could first celebrate the title, although he says he's the most important institution for it.
"I want to go out as a winner, I don't want to play statistics, this is for the club, for the party I am committed to, and the title would be of course also for me, but it's the first thing that's important," said the coach when he was challenged about the number he's finally talking about.
in the live memory, he has a previous final, which, as he confirms, has learned a lot, "when we have learned that until the decision-making end, we can't celebrate, we have to be ready for action, just like the players, because we were already ready to celebrate with the two of us, and I think we've learned in this, until the game is over, we can't celebrate."
She doesn't worry that this series could be decided in criminal shootings, she says to her players: "You never try to get to a series of criminal attacks, you try to end up in a normal time, but there's sometimes no other chance and it's necessary to be prepared, in the past tournament we've been prepared, sorry but judgment has come wrong, perhaps because of the nerves or frustrations we felt when it was titled in our hands, but we've lost it, we've left it in our body, and we hope this time we don't come to something like this."
Romano has in his hands the chance to stop being the second and try to celebrate the first one that brings the titles.
The United States changes rules for visa-sharing
People will have to return to the Service Centre for visa applicants even before the Consular Division conversation; the costs will be lower and the waiting time will be reduced.
As of 10 January 2011, the visa delivery process in the United States of America and consulates will be changed.
with a new procedure, most applicants will have to return to the Centre for visa applicants (abbreviated from the ASC) before the Consular Division conversation.
ASC staff shall provide the applicant with biometric information and they shall be assessed by the Consular Division prior to the discussion.
The new procedure will have certain benefits, including the following:
The total cost of the visa facility will be lower, no more payment will be required for the agreement, second for the processing of the application and other for the provision of a transport document.
The applicant pays only one fee that covers all three services.
The current rate remains unchanged: the amount corresponding to $140 per tourist visa, 150 dollars per visa application (including temporary workers visa) and 390 dollars per visa for traders and investors.
People who want to renew their visas will not have to conclude a conversation with the consular officer, but will only turn to the nearest ASC where they will submit their documents and receive fingerprints.
Given that biometric information will be collected in the ASC, applicants who will require a second meeting with the Consular Division will spend less time than in the past.
Similarly, those who will ask for a visa for consulates in Ciudad Juárez, Monterey and Nuevo Laredo will no longer pay extra salary for $26.

NASA announced the discovery of foreign life
The U.S. Space Agency referred to a tomorrow press conference to present a discovery that could lead to harm when looking for foreign life.
The National Aviation and Space Agency (NASA) of the United States will announce tomorrow, in the fourth quarter, an astrobiological discovery that could confirm the theory of the existence of extraterrestrial life.
The exhibition will be presented tomorrow at 13 o'clock of experts on astrobiology, a science based on study of origin, evolution, expansion and the future of life in the universe, at a press conference at NASA headquarters in Washington.
When she invited the journalist, NASA assured her that it would present "discover that would cause harm in the search for foreign life", which led to speculation by experts from other countries.
The revelation could confirm the theory that there exist other than us and other creatures living in non-hospitable conditions that were considered non-citizens and who could imagine that one of them would become intelligent creatures, like humans, if the better conditions in which they live.
It seems to be one of the microbes found at the bottom of the lake Mono in the Yosemistic National Park in California, where it lives in an environment that was considered too expensive for any form of life, since the lake is rich in Arsen.
The creation of Arsen uses its life in some way, and this right this capacity increases the likelihood that a similar life could exist on other planets that do not have an atmosphere that is on Earth.
According to astrobiologists, if these organisms use their arsenic metabolism, it will prove that "there is another form of life different from what we know."
The Space Agency shall notify the actual amount of information at the next press conference.
The conference was attended by the participating geobiologist Pamela Conrad, who studied the possibility of life on Mars; biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists who study Titan (the largest month of Saturn), with the prospect that his chemical composition is similar to that on Earth.
PRD, PT, Convergence and Patron produce opposition "block"
Reforms of the Constitution of Congress will lead to "bipartism", declaring.
The 60th parliamentary period was not yet started when opposition block was created in Congress, led by the MPs of the PRD (Partido de la Revolucción Democratica, Czech "Spartido del Trabajo", Czech "Strana Works" (Strano"), Convergencia (Czech "Shoda" (Shoda") and Jesus Manuel Patrón Montalvem, who was declared independent, and these four discussed one thing: the arrival of "bipartism" to Snemovny.
Prior to the beginning of the 60th parliamentary period, Felipe Manzanez Rodríguez from Convergence, Ezequiel Reynsos Esparza from PT, Javier Corvera Quevedo from PRD and Patron Montalvo "hashil" against the reform of the Constitution, as it states.
This reform, repeated, begins "bapartism", because now it will be two persons from the same number of parties who will rule Congress.
These four Members, together with Gloria Margarito Santos Aquilar, the coordinator of the PRD, were the only ones who voted against the Council led by Salvador Lópezem Britem by PAN (Partido Action, Czech "National Action Party") and Luis Cárdenas Fonsecou as Vice-President.
Corvera Quevedo stated that these reforms institutionally create political marginality on the part of PRI (Partido Revolucionario Institutional, Czech "Revolutionary institutional party") and PAN.
He pointed out that during the next few days, representatives of the PAN and PRI parties will speak to the PAN and PRI to modify the scheme on the basis of political will, and if they do not, they will be re-examined by these two parties, which ended by the opposition coalition.
"When she's here (opposite coalition), I look at it because we're out of any decision, they don't even want to consider the views of others."
Felipe Manzanez Rodríguez from Convergence stated that PRD, PT and Patron are in agreement and will therefore form a plurality group.
It's not possible to allow Congress to continue after what was monopolial, now it's double.
The ambition of the reform of the law is not to be an endless bipartism in Congress.
This group starts with five legislators and its members are now talking with other colleagues and colleagues to get more votes as Felipe Manzanez Rodríguez added.
Ezequiel Reynos Sparza from the PT explained that Congress has now become a "use" of two - in an attack on the PAN and PRI.
"In the past, she ruled only one side, divided by two today."
Mr. Montalvo asked for respect for the staff of the delegation to be given place at the same table.
"To see us five Members who are likely to be nine, but right now see us at five, we are not left because of the sworn agreements outside each other's group, we have met to find a place at the same table, because the problem is that in the reform that they have created and agreed, we stand outside, and we do not agree with this reform."
It looks like another 200 thousand pesos for "supplier"
The office in Mazatlán will pay another check by the owner of the company supplying electricity.
Another check on more than 200,000 pesos was sent to the workshop Lorena Guadalupe of the Camacho Palace.
The amount paid by the owner of the supplying power company in this second half of the year shall amount to 1,200,000 pesos.
According to the website of the workshop’s transparency, this last check of number 9258447 was issued on 16 November of this year, was issued on a weight of 200,144,56 pesos and as its subject, "equivalent to unpaid payments".
Co-founder Luis Miguel López Moreno noted that this supplier, which was followed by the State Audit Office for sale at high prices, will be paid by the municipality.
What has not been said is the total amount of money she still owes her, and how many checks will still be sent in favour of Camach Palace.
"There was nothing purchased now, only what we owe to her, as well as other suppliers," he said in one conversation.
The last checks "revealed" in the last quarter of the year: 24 September, 2 October 15, 19 October, 29 October and 16 November.
Although this undertaking has not yet been published in the Official Journal, as it provides law in the case of a company audited by the State Audit Office in order to ensure that their services are used by other administrative authorities, the Registrar has ensured that the service of the service provider has not been re-used by the Board.
In the past, following 25 July, Noroest published a check review to its suppliers, who claimed that during the three-year period of George Abele Lópeze Sánchez, the city of Camacho Palazuelos paid more than 10 million pesos between March 2008 and 9 July 2010.
It also carried out transactions with Jumapam, where it recorded checks on more than 3 million dogs.
Tourist places need maintenance
Tourist managers complain about the accident of a foreign tourist because of the bad situation of Sáncheze Taboady in Mazatlán.
After the fall of a foreign tourist into deep on Sánchez Taboady's words, the authorities require a tourist sector in Mazatlán to pay attention to the areas and places that are in the wrong state and do not show such presence in good light.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, president of the Association of Traders in the area of Zone Dorada, recalled that they repeatedly asked for the idea of destination, and what the tourists here find is to be replaced by new activities or routes.
He pointed out that the bad situation of the streets and the pedestrians is affecting tourists who are passing through here and see an irregularity, which suddenly affects nearby businesses.
"Politics don't know what it is like to close it for one day, and they don't have any idea of markets that they avoid, otherwise they wouldn't have solved these concerns so long and without proper planning."
Hotel José Ramón Manguart Sánchez said that the tourist fare has caused a lack of preventive measures and maintenance by the workshop.
"The Council will have to take over responsibility and replace it with something like that to repeat it, it will have to grant preventive maintenance, not just fix existing arguments," he said.
We would like to enjoy a clean city because not only because we are a tourist area, but also because as citizens we deserve a clean place, the workshops should change their urban maintenance strategy."
There are also other places that appear to be vulnerable and poor, such as the Mazatläm and El Venadito (a monument, socha jelena - see also.).
"In today's time for tourists to come, regardless of the promotion alone, it is necessary to offer a good product, so a city that is cleaning its beaches and streets where constant maintenance of tourist attractions is carried out," he said.
"There was no need to pay attention to this and these facts highlight something that is well-known, the lack of maintenance.
He spoke of a number of places to be organized in cooperation with the council, saying that the priority must be to keep the city clean and in order to be attractive because it has a tourist potential.
Raúl Llera Martínez, Deputy Tourist Promotion, said that the conservation of tourist sites in Mazatlán is inexhaustible because they are not used properly and do not have a good idea.
The luck of Mazatlán offers many historical and cultural goals and space, however, which will need to be arranged first so that we can attract these places and bring them into the list that we have for the promotion of this destination."
IP requests for results by Congress
Mr Dávalos, President of the CCE, would like the Members to take a great responsibility for their example in looking for better Sinaloa in the various challenges facing the state.
The parliamentary period is full of decent work and without agreement between the parties and the State enforcement requires the business sector in Mazatlan, as Sinaloa is absent from the crisis and faces major problems.
Since yesterday, the 60th parliamentary period, consisting of seven political forces, 19 MPs PRI, 13 from PAN, three from the Party Nueva Alliance, two from the PRD, one from the PT, one from Convergence and one from the last from the PVEM, which includes up to 40 national representatives.
The list of expected new members of the Congress is to be able to implement sound guidance, commitments towards companies and different areas requiring responsible legislative work and will not be repeated by the same party and patriarchal employers.
Eduardo Dávalos Zamora, President of the Coordinating Council of Enterprises (CCE), proposed that the recently elected 40 Members of the Congress take great responsibility and set out on the road for better Signalo in the various challenges facing them.
"We expect that the Members will actually exercise their right without agreement between the parties, because they usually take measures to promote their own interests and become group leaders and leaders of parliamentary groups."
Therefore, he spoke of the need to confirm the commitment to establish a necessary transition which would lead to the rule of law.
"We want them to take a decent job and are primarily committed to companies and sectors, because they were citizens of Sinaloa who gave them their voice in previous elections of confidence."
José Ramón Manguart Sánchez, president of the Tres Islas Hotel Association, said that one of the greatest challenges for 40 national representatives would be to gather all the efforts to achieve the economic growth of the country, as the current economic situation is very complex.
The most important thing is to promote economic growth in order to create investment and infrastructure initiatives, which will support in some way the creation of jobs."
As regards travel, he requested that new legislators give him greater weight in the framework of the state budget and support the Ministry of Tourism.
"I have learned that it is a ministry with the second lowest budget, which is not due to the fact that it is an important economic activity, bringing money and investment which is also directly opposed to agriculture."
In addition to providing funds for initial tourism projects, Congress should help to add the State to security and help with alcohol law which was unable to resolve in the previous parliamentary periods.
The Three Kings Are Searching
Pancakes, cars and coaches are together with other players on the list of expecting children in the Coronad Valenzuel family.
For their parents, it will be difficult for the future of the Three Kings to fulfill their representations, since their home is read by just 12 people and one baron.
However, Adelaida, Isabel, Jesús, José Alfredo, María Guadalupe, Isaiah, José Juan and Miguel do not lose hope that Kašpar, Melichar and Baltazar will wear toys and clothes that are so tight.
The family lives in a humble shelter in the city of Colonia Salvador Allende in poor conditions, as the father does not have a permanent job.
"So sometimes it's hard because my husband doesn't have any luck, but we're selling mandarins and brobs... and I'm going out with "plebeks" on the street to sell on the street," said Cayeta Valenzuel's mother, Andrade.
The four-year-old Adelaida is ahead of the girl or the wheel, while her third sister Isabel would like Miss Barbie.
If it were about 10-year-old José Alfreda, he'd like a "monster" car for a while, and for his eight-month-old brother, Jesuse, Cayeta would wear a dress in size for one year.
"He told me (Josse Alfredo) 'I'd like this monster car', but I told him 'we'd see a son' because it was very expensive," recalls Cayeta's grief.
For older children who were just at school, it would be perfect clothes and shoes.
María Guadalupe, who is 11 years old, has a 12-year-old Isaiah size 10, where eight-year-old Miguel has an 8-year-old size.
Forty-year-old José Juan's lack of technical skills, so he's got a couple of sizes of five and a half or six.
If you want to help fill out the dreams of the Coronad Valenzuel family, you can participate in the campaign "Look for Three Kings" and bring a present or money in cash at Noroeste's reception.
14 drug dealers who were arrested
Ten visits were carried out in Estonia, in the middle, in the context of network liquidation on production and sales of an index coin.
Forty persons were arrested and faced with various charges.
Visits were made in Sherbrook, Orford, and Stoke, mostly in places that served as drug production.
"About 750 tons of Indian concrete, four kilograms of hashish, money and equipment that served to produce were fun," said Louis-Philippe Ruel, a speech police officer in Quebec.
A total of eleven men and three women were arrested, both of which were considered by the chief of this network, two men from Sherbrook.
Detained persons had to be brought to the Court of Justice in Sherbrook next after their arrest.
They could face charges from the production of an Indian concrete, its holding with a view to trading with it, spying and stealing, among others.
These visits followed a long-term study that lasted almost a year.
"It was the information we had received from the public that allowed us to access this prison," said Mr. Ruel.
This police operation was attended by 70 police officers of the regional police station investigating the city of Estrie State Police Quebec, the State Police in Sherbrook and the Sherbrook Memphremagog Police Department.
The illegal migration will be able to continue without problems.
The proposal of a law of conservatives who, according to the government, should regulate the problem of ships imposed by illegal immigrants will obviously be overcome , while all three opposition parties in the middle have stated that they cannot support it.
"To a great extent, I'm sick of Chart."
"I stand right on the side of the party that was building a hole under your feet," said the chief of Liberals Michael Ignatieff, surrounded by Members after a week's meeting of the week du caucus.
The Liberals insist that the draft law, as proposed, is a law which would allow any person coming from ships identified as a ship carrying illegal passengers to violate the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedom.
The chief of Quebec's block, Gilles Duceppe, also pointed out that he could not support the proposal of the law because it leads to a wrong purpose.
"We are against, and it seems that all opposition parties are against, we will see what the government will do," said Mr. Duceppe.
The NPD critic on the issue of immigration issues, Olivia Chow, rejected the criticisms that they want her side not to be strong enough in terms of illegal immigration.
"The non-democrats agree with the fact that we have to take measures against the illegal migrants and that is what we consider to be part of another proposal of law, C-35," said Ms. Chow.
"We do not support the proposal of the Conservatives' Law because it accepts the guilt of refugees and includes children in prison for at least one year," Mrs. Chow explained.
Minister of Immigration Jason Kenny accused opposition parties.
"Canadians jointly inform the Members that they do not tolerate this kind of illegal migration, these criminal operations that take Canada to a man and treat her like a pathologist."
They expect Canada to take further action, Minister Kenny responded.
The government has not declared a vote on its proposal of law, which could lead the country to vote in favour of its refusal.
However, one conservative told the QMI Agency that the government would ask for a vote in order for any messenger who is opposed to to respond to his position before his or her voters.
A new unit does not mean unity
Despite the announcement that it is possible to create a permanent anti-corruption and collusion unit, many observers continue to require the creation of a public investigation committee for this problem.
Minister for Public Security Robert Dutil is working to ensure that this opinion is not forgotten: Québec agrees with the New York Department of Investigation to discuss this issue in the winter of next year.
Metropole has been available for permanent anti-corruption unit since 1870.
That's why the morning announcement of one of us was surprised.
It should be noted that, at a meeting of the Standing Council for Police Services in Quebec on 29 October last year, this measure was not implemented even though Robert Dutil was present.
More than that, it was not necessary for public security criticism, PQ Stéphane Bergeron's website, to evaluate this announcement as "the king of the block" and "amateur solution put on his knees".
Minister Dutil himself replied to those who fear that political power has too much impact on the potential future of the unit.
"They're calm with confirmation: you'll see the result when we announce it."
"We are aware of this problem."
For the CSQ President, Rejeana Parenta, there is nothing that can reward the hearing of witnesses in public speaking.
"In addition, Mr Charest is determined not to create this research committee, and people think, like you and me, that something is hidden," he explains.
"The only means to achieve the creation of an investigative committee is the dementia of Jeana Charesta," explains Yves Boisvert, professor of ethics and politics in the Institute for the Education of High State Officials.
In order to get out of this dark street, he proposed Quebec to give special strength to the General Inspector-General so that he could investigate fraud and corruption.
"We must be able to extend the mandate of the Inspector General," he decided.
It is also because Quebec could give inspectors the same powers as Commissioners that allow people to testify.
The creation of a permanent working group is not the only proposal in the letters of Charesto.
Quebec would also after Ottawa to change the Third Law so that he could be better equipped for this type of criminal activity.
This requirement would come from the aid for the operation of Marteau (Kladivo), which Minister of Justice Jean-Marca Fournier informed that the case-law in this type of investigation is not explicit.
Federal Minister for Public Security, Vic Toews, confirmed that his judicial colleague, Rob Nicholson, is right in favour of some amendments related to this letter.
During the operation of Jaro 2001, which reached a Biker Group, although the Third Lawyer had not yet been managed, 131 persons were arrested.
Otawa then allowed for amendments to the Gangsterity Act.
Say under strict surveillance.
A number of water flows were under strict control due to strong currents falling from the afternoon in several regions of the province.
In the middle of the afternoon in Shawinigan, Mauritius, came to the bottom of the ground.
Two houses were prevented from being evacuated.
The evening came to another quake in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, Lanaudière.
The road's off.
Between noon and midnight, a number of regions were struck by severe storms, which ranged from 40 to 70 millimetres.
From 20 to 40 other millimeters were not expected from today to Thursday evening, according to regions.
The results in the north of the river and in the Outaouai valley were most affected.
It could fall up to 100 millimetres.
If we count these conflicts with this snow collected in some sectors, we can be afraid of the water currents in some sectors.
The rescue service of Quebec issued a warning in the middle of the night before the danger to the Oueau and Achigan rivers in Lanaudière.
The words in the north, in Saint-Jérôme, in Les Laurentides, and in Chenea, in Lotbinière, have become the subject of water supply and undisputed controls.
In the area of de Lanaudière, there have been strong disturbances of some lakes in Sainte-Julienne, Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare, as well as in Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte there was a temporary bridge set up as a result of heavy rain.
Two residences had to be evacuated.
In Outaouais, the passage of some lakes from the shores led to the closure of some roads, especially in the town of Mansfield-et-Pontefract.
The rescue service is ready and is responsible for the situation in this area, Annik Bouchard, Security Adviser.
The Quebec Water Prediction Centre issued a warning in the middle of a series of strong waters for several rivers, in particular Maskinongé, Assomption, Ouearau, Achigan, Batiscan and Loup.
Dupont partially blamose
The Quebec voter, Stéphane Dupont, endured a partial failure before the Canadian Council for Radio and Television Standards (RRTV) because of controversial social assistance products and the Haitians and, as a result of the harsh expression during the broadcast.
The Board of Appeal and Television considers that Mr Dupont and his group from CHOI 98.1 FM had the right to express their views, but some products contained "unexplained information on social assistance and inappropriate negative treatment of the Haitians with a gross expression which does not correspond to the consignment sent during the day".
The Council also concluded that the discussion on suicide, including sending names of both persons who took their lives, did not break the rules for voting.
The Board of Appeals and Television has had several difficulties with the comments made during the submissions sent between 2008 and 2010.
The first decision was taken following the difficulty of the Community Front of the beneficiaries of the social support of Quebec.
The group complained that the amounts indicated in the consignment were inaccurate.
Modifiers must provide reliable information, not false.
As far as suicide was concerned, Moderator Stéphane Dupont thought suicide was an emergency gesture.
Most of the Commission members concluded that the report was such that suicide could not be understood as a solution to the problems of everyday life.
"Most of the Commission is of the opinion that the controversial episodes of the "Dupont's morning news" have been dealt with in a non-discriminatory and appropriate manner with the delicate subject."
There was no training against him.
The last argument was about a statement that followed after the earthquake in Haiti.
So Stéphane Dupont and Jean-Rene Dufort went into the media shooting that caused a lot of reactions.
The CHOI Modérator declared that he did not send any gift to help the Haitians because we cannot be sure that the necessary money will be delivered.
The Commission considers that these comments were not incorrect, but that their cumulative effect does not necessarily create a negative image of the Haitians.
"I've already opened my class release."
"My record is intact for one and a half years," declared the moderator.
In all decisions, the Commission shall refuse to use harsh expression.
In any case, the CHOI-FM voter collaborated "on the basis of its responsibilities".
For stations which will have to notify, inter alia, this Decision once during the main transmission within three days, the consequences are minimal.
King of the Queen of Montreal.
The citizen of Montreal, originating in Algeria, Nacerddine Earth, has an extremely special period.
Atlet, which results in "sang-fu" (kung-fu "full contact"), "kickbox" and "Thai Box" enters on dads and ringers around the world and is looking for new challenges.
"I started with martial arts such as kung-fu and kickbox 12 years ago, in Algeria, I explained the land that has lived in the capital since 2008 to teach in professionals."
"In my case, I'm looking for sports so much everywhere, because for those who don't like playing in the country that appears in combat sports, competition in North America is rare."
Recently, this man who works as a protector and assistant to UPS just added to his competitors the bad news when he won two gold medals at the World Karate and Kickboxing Association (WKA), from 23 to 30 October in Edinburgh, Scotland.
"I won a kickbox category full of contact and Thai box, he said."
"At present I am preparing for China for the World Cup in San Shaw."
"There were called opponents who ended the first four in the last world's masterhood in every category."
"In Toronto in 2009, I won a bronze."
"In 2005 in Vietnam, I ended my eight."
"In 2007 in China I ended up in a tournament on Friday morning, while in Toronto in 2009, I finished the third, adding."
"It's interesting that I've made some progress in every competition."
"This time I'll be the first year or the first one!"
"san show" or "sand" is a discipline coming from China where there are punches and fists, as well as gardening on the ground, allowed.
The tapes are traditionally played on the surface and are more rare in the ring.
The most famous boxer, derived from this form of war, is the American of the Vietnamese origin of Cung Le, well known in the world of war art.
As long as Nacer Earth has only one result in his career, he must confirm his participation in the Super Tournament "King of Sanda", Super Bowl in kung-fu.
"This competition is the highest and most prestigious in China, explains a sympathetic guy."
"It's so slightly equivalent to the City of Lumpinee (the largest stadium in Thailand)."
"It was a great experience."
The country won its first game in semi-finals category (80 kg) before it suffered loss in the final.
"The one who beat me was a real pro. He analyzed."
"There are four categories of competitions (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg et 90 kg)."
"Victory semi-finals are in the finals of their category."
"Then the winners of each category are running to be crowned by the only champion, the king of king-fu."
450 million contracts without public competition
Hydro-Québec agreed after a mutual agreement of 450 million in contracts with companies providing electricity to Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert.
In the heart of this valley, more than 100 contracts are a consortium created by the company BPR, Dessau, Group SM and Axor, which obtained the most significant contract, to run the entire project at a total level of $295 million without public competition.
This Consortium, called Energy Guarantee, was supplemented in 2004, together with the selection of Hydro-Québec to entrust its responsibility to the private sector for the management of this major hydroelectric project of $5 billion.
At the beginning of 2005, the Energy Guarantee Consortium received a lucrative contract without any public competition statement.
For the Quebec side, the complexity of the business consortium lies ahead of us a serious issue of ethical nature, which risks the exclusion of competition and causes price increases..
"It's a new way to realize colleges and eliminate competition."
"This means that people no longer do foreign agreements secretly, they are doing them openly today," PQ Sylvain Simard announced yesterday at a press conference.
About something earlier, in the morning, Mr. Simard asked this question to the National Assembly, because he says that the burden is how public interest such sales can be.
Minister for Natural Resources, Nathalie Normandeau, she decided this afternoon, in a different way, that it would go into this collusion contract.
"I've got my own way," she smiled and claimed that PQ was "not correct" and "distributed accuracy."
She said "it would be the least" to apologize to the PQ.
The recipe for the creation of a concert is a common practice all over the world.
It is usually an alliance limited in time that allows two or several companies to acquire their mutual expertise so that they can respond to the challenge of offering a complex project.
The Eastmain project is very complex with regard to the content of the work.
The situation is already running and must be broken down by 2012.
However, the contract was accepted without competition; it was a trade.
It is also necessary to recognise that the form of the consortium is no longer available in Quebec, nor in relatively simple projects.
As Le Debor left last week, the form of the Consortium in the field of engineering is the subject of an investigation in the government.
If we move through the quick commercial registers of Quebec companies, we will be able to discover more than 200 concerts, some of which seem to be created.
Such Dessau works in partnership with most of its main competitors; we call it CIMA+, Genivar, SNC-Lavalin and Roche and Tecsult.
Every combination, and they're 10 of them, leads to one legal person, and that's Dessa.
With regard to the Energie Guarantee Consortium, Minister Normandeau stressed in particular that "the territory of La Baie James is a typical special dynamic of labour forces and that Hydro-Québec has been responding to it since the 1970s".
The main owner of the Eastmain project, Réal Laporte, from the Energy Society of Baie James (SEBJ), provided an explanation that will lead us to conclude the fact that the project management agreement was concluded after mutual agreement.
"If you go to public competition and there are few participants in the tendering competition, your prices may be higher."
"You have two options: that is, you gather people who figure out the ban as participants in the competition, and you say, "Let's make an agreement at peace and at a good price."
"But the main idea is that it's not important to be priced, but to the competence of people," Mr. Laporte confirmed.
This contract awarded to the Energie Guarantee Consortium is part of a long list of contracts for more than $50,000, which was received by the Party of Quebec.
The contracts were concluded by Hydro-Québec or SEBJ on the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
Following the verification of Le Devor, he calculated 109 contracts for engineering advice concluded between 2002 and March 2010 with companies or their branches, in particular with laboratories carrying out soil samples analysis.
SNC-Lavalin won 22 contracts, from which Genivar won 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, without having a share in "Energy Guarantee".
All contracts were closed.
The total is $449,783,344, including the contract with Energie guarantee company at $295,131,564.
Sylvain Simard pointed out that the four companies that are part of the Consortium (BPR, Dessau, Group SM and Axor) are "very well known to the Liberal Party of Quebec".
Minister Normandeau sent a report that PQ is also linked to companies that "finance it" before it has been clarified that one is more about its managerial staff.
Barometer responsible for consumption - "green" label does not inspire confidence
More green, but obviously skeptical.
The Quebec consumer is very little dependent on actors for sustainable development, but also by "foreign" signs and environmental certification, in order to conduct themselves in the selection of products.
The worst thing is that even if we buy in the medium universe that is up to us and offers us more responsible consumption to society, this medium universe says that there is no reliable information, a failure to fulfil the obligation that even qualifies as a bridge for its commitment, Barometer shows the responsible consumption of which the first article went out yesterday.
Although the consumption of so-called Community-owned products increased in 2010, the people of Quebec who are trying to sell them are still too faithless.
In fact, two thirds of us say they don't believe in the promises of a company dealing with the environment, simply because the green advertising company finds out the measuring tool developed by the University's Supervisor for Consumers at Sherbrooke.
Other findings: half of consumers doubt the likelihood of official certificates submitted to so-called fair products, but also the likelihood of products and signs identified as ecologically responsible, Barometer states.
In the same way, policy debate on this issue is adopted as a serious 14.6% of Quebec's population.
However, the information on the appropriate consumption appears to be a priority for stimulating this website’s current recovery of nearly a third of Quebec consumers.
Indeed, vacuum and suspicious nature of information would reduce over 46% of consumers.
This is the second bridge identified by Barometer, at the highest price of these products.
Finally, a third of Quebecese citizens are mistrusted about the data on the products or "green" services we are looking for to let them pass through our hands.
On the other hand, in 2010, almost half of consumers were willing to change their habits and in particular change the sign of one or more products that would respond to their beliefs.
The total 61% of them prioritised the purchases for traders from their quarters and gave priority to the purchase of food produced in their region, says Barometer.
More "green" and responsible - the index of responsible consumption reached 64 of the maximum 100 for this year - , Homo consumption Québek is pleased to present itself as a king of recycling, which seeks at least the impact on the environment by caring for animal protection.
But their social and environmental conscience evidently remained outside their vehicle, says Barometers: in 2010, nearly 28% of Quebec residents indicated that they use transport together or recommend the use of at least two people to drive in order to protect nature.
The race and circle also supported 39.1% of the participants in this extensive study of behaviour that used this cell.
State loan for purchase of a kin eXcentris complex
The government of Quebec, which we have requested for financial participation in the purchase of the kin complex eXcentris Angus et le Parallèle, agrees with the participation, but only to the above loan.
The development company "Angus et le Parallèle", which spent up to seven million dollars from the Ministry of Culture on the purchase of a cinematographic complex at the Boulevard Saint-Laurent, which demonstrated its mission as a lovers of film art, did not receive what she requested.
The government accepts the fact that it will be included in the documentation but under its own conditions.
Rather than the expected gift, the government of Quebec proposes a loan that would otherwise be lower, some of which would have been an initial expectation that could lay the basis for a viable solution under the favourable conditions and with resources coming from the state.
The first action plan and demand for 12.8 million had already been rejected by Quebec Loni on the market, but the applications had already been reviewed for reduction.
The proposal and plan of action were sent by the Minister of St-Pierre, President of the Society for the Development of Cultural Enterprises (SODEC), François Macerola, which runs a cinematographic project eXcentris.
The final report was sent ten days ago.
But the government's opposition came to SODEC on Tuesday.
Le Parallèle et Angus has time until 31 December to answer.
However, it appears that the mortgage of the State must be rejected.
Note that the Union of Chinese owners and cinematographic centres in Quebec was opposed to the State's direct investment in order to support the purchase of eXcentris, using the fact that the Minister of Culture does not have to finance the property project if he has not done so for other cinematographics.
However, a number of participants in the debate requested substantial economic support.
Daniel Langlois, the owner, got into his kin's space for ten years of film art after he himself financed the construction of a complex, which could be a reason for the change by the state's financial council.
The lack of rooms for independent films is critical in Montreal, and eXcentris was able to get a permanent customer.
Angus et le Parallèle, with Christian Yaccarini in his head, runs the campaign to release financial resources into the private sector, believing that it will amount to $700,000 for the prosecution.
Since the spring of 2009, one of the three film companies, Le Parallèle, continues to distribute films for eXcentris.
The objective of future buyers is to reopen all three halls on the 27th of February of the following year and to offer the most beautiful film Xaviera Beauvois Men and Gods.
But Christian Yaccarini didn't mention Le Debor and he ignores himself with his group of ideas about the reductions made to him.
A known resistance to Canada as a whole...
The new American diplomats mentioned in the statement by WikiLeaks reflect what the United States considers to be a complex minority of Canadians against the Americans, but the team also express its sense of sovereignty over Canada as the last mentioned.
American diplomats are therefore surprised that every Canadian voter is in the heart of Canadian-American relations when he comes to vote and believes that President Obama's visit has helped the conservative government to adopt its 2009 budget!
The four new messages between the American Embassy in Ottawa and Washington, issued yesterday, provide more sensitive details to get "under the skin" to each other.
The Communication dated 22 September 2008, i.e. between the electoral campaign, shall specify in detail which paragraph is not part of the quotas discussed by the political leaders in the United States.
To the great surprise of the American Embassy in Ottawa, David Wilkins.
Mr. Wilkins is providing some explanations on this situation.
"The Canadian minority complex, almost convincingly, has enabled possible political leaders to talk about internal borders, rather than to realize that these elections are also relevant to the United States (as in the 1988 Free Trade Campaign)," he writes.
"The United States is, therefore," he concluded, "the subjective elephant in these elections is, however, too dangerous, but potentially too dangerous to talk about them."
The Ambassador understands this "silent silence" less that both countries maintain intensive political and economic relations.
"It is logical that the ability of the candidate, the party or even better the head of the party to direct these important relations should be a key factor that lovers have in mind when they go to the elections."
Another expression of this importance can be read in the report sent on 22 January 2009 by Terry Breese, Chargé d'affaires in Ottawa and Ottawa, preparing President Baracka Obama for his first visit to Ottawa.
"Your trip will help to ensure the government's maintenance of confidence in the beginning of the union's federal budget, which Canada will publicly recognise its first deficit for more than ten years, due to a recovery plan of $30 to $40 billion," says Mr. Breese.
There is no mention that the government had to reject the pre-session of Parliament so that it could not be defeated by the coalition and that the opposition parties would be subject to their survival to the quality of the proposed recovery plan.
Another report from January 2008 and signed by Ambassador Wilkins warns that Washington continues to be the most negative image in the United States that is being played by the dramatic series sent to the CBC.
The Ambassador is concerned about sending Borderer, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, in which he may not be able to observe too much references to the Maher Arar, "No-Fly-List" or on charges for violent statements by the CIA.
Another report refers to the fact that at their first bilateral meeting, Hillary Clinton asked his French partner Bernard Kouchner whether Europe was ready to accept some prisoners from Guantánamo.
Mr. Kouchner replied yes, but on the basis of the principle of "the case".
At the conclusion of the meeting, it says here, "He passed some paper on Omar Khadr, 15-year-old Muslim of Canadian origin, state secretary."
"The secret has come to the conclusion that the compound will be remedied."
Finally, let's say that the people who deal with WikiLeaks will get involved.
Tom Flanagan, former adviser very close to Stephen Harper, announced on the CBC waves that the person responsible for this massive accident should be "destroyed".
That's what happened and what happened to Mike Huckabee in the United States.
A World Light-up Plan
In Cancún yesterday, the UN proposed a plan to restore domestic lighting, trade lighting and industrial space in 100 countries with a view to achieving a reduction in the greenhouse effect (GES), which corresponds to almost one third of the other restrictions that have to be set for the climate stability of the planet from now on to 2020.
This ambitious plan is at the stage of major specific projects that the UN wants to launch in Cancún in order to compensate for the absence of difficult commitments to reduce industrially developed countries.
According to the proposed plan yesterday, if frozen cereals that are still monopolised by 50 to 70% of the market are replaced by flukom-compliant or, better, with electroluminescent diodes (DEL or "LED" in English), the basic amount of 1.8 billion tonnes (Gt) of GES emissions on the planet would be discarded due to lighting.
The lighting is responsible for 8% of world emissions.
It's equivalent to 70% emissions from the car park across the planet.
In the long run, large countries with an important share of emissions such as the United States, China, Europe and other, including Canada, have launched voluntary plans to reduce GES global emissions from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
But this balance will need to be calculated 5 Gt more to achieve climate warming stability by 2020 at 2 degrees Celsius so that it can be excluded from control.
In frozen cereals 95% energy is dispersed in the form of heat and residues, i.e. 5% is a product of light.
With flucom-impact cereals, energy consumption is reduced by 75% and with new cereals with DEL, we reduce this consumption twice more.
The flukomactants last between 6000 and 10000 hours.
New ones with DEL, such as those who brought this week into the production of Philips - this company has probably participated in the study of the UN - have a projected life of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than the harvested cereals, which gives us the idea of a possible delay in the plan of rewards that would apply in 100 countries.
All these new mushrooms can also function with residues and emit less heat.
And they don't contain any food.
Several experts expressed the benefits of flucoma-compact cereals because they contain mercury and should be classified as hazardous waste, which is still not possible in developing countries, although producers would be able to organize the assemblies.
As the report points out, the main source of mercury emissions on the planet is not a flukom-impact heater, but rather a heatless electricity that releases a lot of mercury needed for the production of electricity pumped into diluted fuels.
Only in the United States do these centers increase to 25,000 tons of corn annually.
The report also details the benefits that each country would receive from this international programme.
For example, Indonesia would save billions of dollars annually for the purchase of electricity and eight million tons of CO2, equivalent to 3.5 hot electricity, whose construction would be 2.5 billion.
The edge of the elephant is impatiently expected for the results of the pollutant results.
The General Secretary of the UN, Ban Ki-moon, requested the immediate publication of the results of presidential elections in the Gulf of Slovenia after the deadlines set.
"The Secretary-General underlines the need for the independent electoral commission to complete its work and to report the preliminary results without delay, highlighting the speaker of the UN. "
"It calls on all parties in the Gulf of Slovenia and institutions to prove their sense of responsibility and to hold any initiative until provisional results have been announced."
Even through pressure developed by some foreign governments, the Electoral Commission has allowed the maximum date - midnight - to expire without publishing results, three days after the Sunday ceremony.
About forty minutes before the launch of the CEI President on television confirmed that the Commission "continues to work" to report the results.
In the middle of the world , the challenges have been multiplied so that CEI will finally announce the name of the second car victory between Laurent Gbagbo and Alassan Ouattar opposition member.
However, the Gbagbo camp is dependent on the annulment of the Constitutional Council for a "substantial" vote in the north, which is being organised by the former rebels of the New Army (FN) since the failed coup in September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, director of the presidential electoral campaign in the Gulf of Slovenia, confirmed that the malevolent threats of voters who practiced the UN (New Army) in the north of the country were hired by the competitors of the President of the coast of Slovenia to go.
The elections could be cancelled if the Constitutional Council took into account the difficulties Gbagbo had given.
President Gbagbo's opposition is that the country's highest court is not neutral because it is led by Paul Yao N'Dré, a very close political alliance with President Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattar, a man from the north who demeans any connection with the former rebellion, condemned the detention in the announcement of results as "admissible" and asked Gbagba to respect them but did not go so far as to seek victory.
Its allies confirm that Gbagbo is blocking the publication of results because he knows that he has suffered loss and that giving the Constitutional Council trouble after preventing the Electoral Commission from issuing results would be illegal.
The second round of presidential elections taking place on Sunday was considered to coordinate the process of reunification and reconciliation of the country, which has been divided into two and a half years.
The United Nations has warned the political party of the Gulf of Slovenia that it could be held responsible for any violence.
Laurent Gbagbo finished his first round, on 31 October, as a 38% win with votes against 32% for Alassana Outattaru, who received public support from former President Henri Konan Bedi (25% in the first round).
The unemployment rate remains stable in France in the third quarter.
The unemployment rate in France, according to the International Labour Office (BIT), remained stable by 9.3% in metropolitan France (9.7% including coastal areas), as shown by the INSEA's provisional data on the correction of seasonal derogations (CVS), published on Thursday.
The number of unemployed rose to 2,631 million in the metro.
Data from the second quarter were confirmed to 9.3% of the active population in the metropolis and 9.7%, including maritime areas.
The unemployment rate shall be increased by 0,1 per year.
In a broader audience, 3.4 million people in metropolitan France do not work in the third quarter, but they would like to work, whether or not they are available for two weeks to be able to work, and whether they are looking for or not.
The situation of young people on the labour market has continued to rise with a new increase in unemployment rate of 24.2% in metropolitan France (+0.9 points in three months, +0.5 points in one year) and 25%, including maritime areas.
In the third quarter, there were 637,000 young people between the ages of 15 and 24.
In the case of seniors, they recorded a moderate increase of unemployment to 6.4% in metropolitan France (+0.2 points in three months, as in the year), which is 482,000 persons from 50 years old and 6.6% including maritime areas.
Only the 25-49 year-old population recorded benefits from unemployment stability to 8.3% in metropolitan France (-0.1 points in three months, +0.1 points in one year) and 8.8% in France.
Insee no longer publishes the monthly unemployment rate since 2006, which is after the issue of its method of calculation.
Eurostat, the statistical agency of the European Union, in contrast, continues to develop monthly statistics and announced an increase of 9.8% for France (including DOM) in October after 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guérini is accused and is involved
Alexandre Guérini, 53 years old, one of the heads of waste management companies and a brother of the PS Board of Directors Bouches-du-Rhône, was accused and imprisoned in a prison in Luynes, not far from Aix-en-Provence, as part of an investigation into the matter of public procurement, apparently badly acquired.
Alexandre Guérini was charged with the abuse of the property of the company, the abuse of public funds and public property, storage, payment, receipt of charges for the purpose of affecting the office and detention of the gun, says his lawyer.
"Alexandre Guérini is a fighter and is committed to clarifying to the judge all the questions that this is going to ask him, and no offense."
"It's easy to track her for many embarrassing reasons, but another thing is to prove it," said his lawyer, Florence Raul, before his client's hearing.
Mr Guerini informed his lawyers through his lawyer that he had sent the judge before his hearing a short message to explain everything.
One of his neighbors, Philippe Rapezzi, was also accused and imprisoned in the middle of the night.
According to his lawyer, Lucian Simon, his client never did anything else than to ensure the operation of the locker he was supposed to fix.
When it came to the award of a ban or the allocation of funds related to their operation, Simon never knew anything about it.
In this regard Daniel Pinna, former director general of Auglomeration Aubagne, was accused of using public funds and complexities, and left him free, under judicial supervision, of the ban on contact with protagonists of all affairs.
"My client has been able to explain to him all the facts that have been taken away from him."
"The investigating judge monitors and leaves her free," said his lawyer, Mr. Yann Arnoux.
The other four persons were accused and released on the night of Wednesday at midnight, with two of them under trial, brought to trial the representative of State Governor Michel Raffin.
Michel Karabadjakian, the representative of the President-General with an elegant Marseille Provence Métropole (MPM), is committed to the adoption of fees for the influence of the office and for passive corruption".
Two Agglomeration Officers from Aubagne, Michele Duval and Christophe Bingier are accused, one for "pressure and exploitation of the property of the company", the other for "competence in the use of public funds".
Finally, a trade partner, Alexandra Guérini, Jeannie Peretti, was accused of "inventing the abuse of company property".
Among the persons who were confronted with Mr Guérin is Stephen Brunengo-Girard, who was recently accused of subversive public bans on Corsica.
Investigators suspect his company to help earn money from widespread gangstery.
The investigation was carried out in the context of several open-ended investigations against X in April 2009 following the adoption of an anonymous letter relating to the alleged inconsistencies in the opening of public contracts, in particular in the case of waste.
From the source of a close investigation, the search focuses in particular on the conditions of the allocation and operation of the warehouse in La Ciotat, which collects waste from Aubagne, as well as from some cities of the city of Marseille (MPM).
The case of Clotilde Reiss: The Elysian palace crossed the Syrian media
For more than ten months, from July 2009 to May 2010, Klotilda Reiss, a young research worker imprisoned in Iran for "spionage", collected views in France, introduced diplomacy into the war preparedness and highlighted relations between Paris and Tehran.
It's all carefully monitored by U.S. diplomats.
American documents obtained through WikiLeaks and consulted with Le Monde reveal some of the consequences of this crisis.
They describe how the Elysian Palace explained its strategy to the Americans, which went so far as to advise them how to handle such cases of handicraft in Iran (a small group of tourists).
They show how the leading French representatives tried to convince Washington that the release of young French people was not a compensation for the release of Majida Kakavanda, Iran, imprisoned in France and sought American justice for the sale of material in favour of the Iranian nuclear programme.
Finally, they shed light on the way the French Presidency tried to manipulate the media to convince the idea that the Syrian President, Bachar Al-Assad, played a central role in the liberation of Clotildy Reiss.
Actually, he didn't do anything about it.
The diplomatic telegram signed on 12 August 2009 in Paris has the title "Iran:French commentaries on how to solve cases of handcuffs".
The Council of the Elysian Palace for Strategic Affairs, François Richier, presented by the Director of Quai d'Orsay for North Africa Middle East, Patrice Paoli, is speaking to the representative of the American University of Allegron.
They explain the French method.
They recommend that Americans do the same for being transported back to their own state officials by violence held in Iran.
"Be quiet," they say, "keep your voice loud" in the media "man's fundamental human rights", "infinity", "incarceration".
It needs to be brought into the hate Iranian regime, sensitive to its image.
"Do it the more they will ask you to stop it."
Because attempts have been made to merge through discreet channels, "silence doesn't solve anything", Iran is "mixtures on escape maneuvers".
Mr Richier recalls that the arrest of foreigners is "an Iranian family tactic: arms arms for the purposes of "political expression".
It states that the liberation of Klotilda Reiss (which will take place on 16 August, on the day when the French Embassy provides it with a relief) "is required to pay the high financial amount of the Iranians" (expression of EUR 230 000).
And we note that the Elysian palace anticipates cases of handicraft, a phenomenon that "will become extinct".
Iran's "in future they could arrest another 1800 French people living in Iran," he says.
of 28 August 2009
Klotilda Reiss has already left the prison 12 days ago, but remains blocked in Iran.
The information is spread: Iranian Majid Kakavand, about which the United States declares that he has been awarded an illegal trade in electronic material sensitive to Iran, is released in Paris on the basis of a decision of the judge.
The American Embassy, like many observers, is asking for this disturbing agreement.
For Washington, which is following an illegal Iranian network to obtain material intended for a nuclear program, Majida Khakavanda is spreading bad news.
Did France agree to the contract?
Freedom of Iran to free a young French youth?
During another conversation with Kathleen Allegron, September 4, François Richier makes sure it's not.
The Elysian palace, as it says, was not only "inspired by this decision by the judge", but he was looking for an opportunity to stand against it.
"The talks between the Presidential Authority and the Minister of Justice" (at the time, Michele Alliot-Marie), but "the French Government cannot change the decision of the court", he notes.
Mr Richier also wants to demonstrate that Majid Kakavand is under "limited" surveillance by the French judiciary.
The Council of the Elysian Palace shall issue a telephone number, increase the phone number, and then inform the American diplomat that Iran is currently in the Parisian buildings of the Iranian Embassy."
During the prison in Klotilda Reissov, Iran, the Elysian palace develops efforts, unites, through the communic and organised "union" media to convince Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad to play "medium" and "influential" role "mediator".
The Americans observe this activity no matter how ironic it is and find that manipulation brings its fruit, since several articles in print reflect the French official version.
Telegram of 25 August 2009 announces the media "bless" of French official authors".
Assad's statement to Mr Assad is based on what such a measure of "thanks" is based on, it is asked by the Ambassador of Paris.
"Even with their declaration full praisers of the French authorities in private admit that they have only a serious idea of what the Syrians have actually done."
The document then contains the reasons why the Elysian palace had to pay in this case.
Intensification communication "directs the validation of the policy of President Sarkozy's opening with Syria", analyzes.
Policy implemented in 2008 "was observed by many critical voices in France and abroad and marked as premature and undeserved".
By "how to move to the Syrian role", Paris tries to "demonstrate Syria which praisers can serve when playing constructive role in the field".
The goal is also to "get rid of the conflict between Syria and Iran".
The U.S. embassy knows this from a very good source.
On 11 July, François Richier believed him: "Of course we don't know if the Syrians did anything, whatever it is."
"But we still thanked them."
"It should at least bring confusion and misunderstanding between Iran."
Klotilda Reiss will return to France on 16 May 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy is taking her to the Elysian Palace.
In the communiqué he thanks the Presidents of Brazil, Senegal and Syria for their "active role in the benefits of our country's liberation".
End of online here after midnight for young Koreans
The South Korean government will adopt a law called "Peciválský", which will prohibit teenagers from playing online games after midnight, by blocking access to them, by introducing responsible government actors.
The bill will be submitted to Parliament in December in order to request companies operating online games to block access to this game by 16-year-olds after midnight, by the representatives of the Ministry of Culture and the Ministry of the Family.
"Many children play these games all night and then have problems learning at school and are not able to live a normal life during the day."
"We have the fact that this law is necessary to ensure their health and their right to sleep," AFP Jo Rin, a leading author of the ministry that has a proposal for an old-age law.
Online games will be available again from 6 o'clock in the morning.
The company will have one year to prepare for the application of the law.
The government also assumes that it requires companies to allow each day to have access to this game for young people whose parents require it to fill the staff responsible.
It will also make available to people who want it, free programs that can limit time spent on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the most "encumbered" countries, and daily printing brings regularly different facts related to intensive use of the Internet.
The country is also an undisputed master in global competitions in online games.
In November, South Korea won four gold medals at World Cyber Games, which is made up of 58 other nations.
World skills in the years 2018-2022: Fifa is setting up a host country.
Full of concern about corruption concerns the Fifa Executive Committee established in the fourth quarter of the World Heritage site in 2018 and 2022, a highly motivated political choice, where the fight against influence and lobbying is at risk of putting technical criteria ahead.
It is certain that the Fifa Royal Competition in 2018 will take place in Europe , a traditional heritage of this discipline (4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal, Netherlands-Belgium).
The mission in 2022 will be much more exotic, with the International Federation hoping it will be able to obtain a new territory (Qatar, Australia) after the 2010 Prime Minister on the African continent, or continue to be established in the United States or in the Far East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of persons participating in the delegation (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, Prince of Qatar, heads of government of Belgium and the Netherlands, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) provides an opportunity to create an image of the world's economic and political forces.
Coalition in the backyard is at risk that they will last up to the last minute.
For the rest, it is difficult to establish hierarchy by candidates.
According to Fifa's assessment reports, the documents in English, Spanish-Portuguese (18) and American (2022) contain these best arguments, as well as the documents of their competitors.
But these reasons will not be too much for the 22 members of the Executive Committee within an hour designated for the vote.
Sunday Times at the beginning of the investigation leading to suspension of two EC members /European Commission?/ for corruption (Reynald Temarii et Amos Adamu) may thus have destroyed the chance of his country, a bunch of bastards that have been hosted by the World Championship only once a year.
The BBC established the crown on Monday when it issued a document which "pressed on the pen" three influential EC members (European Commission?), Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
How to make Fifa uncomfortable and bring into trouble an English leader with David Cameron in the first row.
The President of the Government hopes that he will be able to reverse what his predecessor has done for Tony Blair , who was assigned to London in 2005.
Will this intensive activity be sufficient for England to add a new lesson to its name to the EC (European Commission?)?
Nothing is less certain because the two Spanish-Portuguese do not miss the drums of the already prepared stadiums, its well-being (The World Championship in 1982 in Spain, the 1992 Olympic Games in Barcelona, Euro-2004 in Portugal) and their football culture.
But the grim economic and financial prospects of both countries could give this ambitious study gap.
The appropriate defence measures against the English and doubts about the payment capacity of Spain and Portugal only increase Russia's position, which was outsideside and above the mestres in its documentation (the stadiums, hotels, transport).
However, the President of the government, Vladimir Poutin, decided that the mission did not move to Zurich and publicly declared "the same competition in the preparation of the vote", in words only a few of the charges against the members of the EC (European Commission).
"We're going to get them into trouble, we're trying to compromise them," said Mr. Poutin.
For 2022 they appear to be the United States' logical favorite with their major experience since 1994.
The world's highest economic performance, the headquarters of the chief sponsors of Fifa, seems to have a great impact on Japan and South Korea, which, in turn, prepared a beautiful project.
But these candidatures appear to be temporary for both countries which jointly conducted "test" in 2002.
Another threat: the award of the 2026 world's art of China, which has been horribly passed by Fifa, has made an Asian chance for 2022 free of charge.
With Katar, who pulled out of hand a large seo in the form of futuristic stadiums, and Australia, Fifa would continue in its expansion into new countries, but these two countries pose more risks than security.
Australia, like Japan and Korea, could pay for chat fees (on the basis of the time line) paid by European countries, creating a hybrid force for Fifa.
Other mandate: apparent (true)
De Gaulle really cares.
Mitterrand raised a feeling of weight.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac didn't play at least.
And Nicolas Sarkozy is less than they are.
To send the Elysian palace to call someone else.
The current Head of State will therefore be a candidate in 2012.
But obviously it's not in good agreement with the secret part connected with the presidential function.
So it's supposed to be as if there's no doubt that it's going to last.
In the same sense.
In 2006, before it could be believed, friends of Jacques Chiraca made promises not to be excluded from the third mandate.
On 15 November, Nicolas Sarkozy, with a serious expression, said that "it will sometimes be decided by mid-2011".
As reminded before the members of the UMP Parliament in the middle of the evening in the Elysian Palace, the prospect of "two mandates" is a little hot.
Was it an official announcement of his candidacy?
He wasn't far away from it.
The President simply recalled that the revision of the Charter in 2008 had reduced the number of five-year functional periods to two.
It was just a discovery, not a notice.
It's not the first time she remembers the humorous tone of presidential vote at such meetings.
"In the worst case, or the best case, you have seven and a half years ahead of you," he passed in July 2009.
Rebelie in May 2010: "Don't think I don't care about another stage."
His previous years will not make her candidate more than the previous day; they will not make her candidate less.
If they make comments, it's because they're two truths.
Speeding up the way to the PS candidate, on the one side.
But it's not going into the Ségolan Royal's cabin, which forces Nicolas Sarkozy to testify.
It is however because its candidacy in 2012 is evident that many in the PS want to be organized into combat groups more early than expected.
Wrong investigation on the other side.
For the first time, right-holders would prefer Françoise Fillon's candidate before Nicolas Sarkozy's candidate (46% versus 44%, according to BVA-L'Express).
"We have a candidate and we don't discuss this with UMP," responded immediately and showed people from the nearest government environment.
"If he believes any winner, he won't run," says Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
"He'll still believe he can win," says Alain Juppé, quoted in a statement.
Euro: The Central European Bank is forced to continue in its procurement of State securities.
The last meeting of the Governing Council of Central Governors in the year should be an opportunity to clarify the conditions for the discharge of the crisis or, at least, the notice of the cessation of a large number of extraordinary monetary policy operations to be completed by the end of this year.
The crisis of European researchers is committed, and the paper issue institute will certainly not be able to be so categorical under the threat of worsening the situation in European securities markets today.
In such a case, the political price would be higher.
Yesterday's press conference by the French Ministry of Finance Christine Lagarde played an active role that the European Central Bank plays in resolving the crisis of European states.
She didn't mean to say whether she thought the bank could do more, for example by raising its program of buying out the bonds.
"I express my opinion to my European partners (...) "
The evening before, in Brussels, the President of the European Central Bank, Jean-Claude Trichet, in his opinion of the Commission on Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament, did not appear to be more explicit when it came to his purposes and agreed that the programme for the purchase of state securities on the secondary market "continues" and that we "see how we decide" during the meeting held this Thursday.
The only certainty: the Central European Bank will keep its basic constant rate of 1%, its historical lowest level since May 2009.
In fact, the purchase of a bond from a portfolio made by the European Central Bank will double over the last week to almost EUR 1.35 billion.
And because of the lack of understanding of the investors on the market yesterday, new purchases of Irish and Portuguese bonds were made.
Total central banks purchased the Eurosystem at EUR 67 billion since May 2010.
There is no doubt between the prospectus on the market for the continuation of the purchases (see page 29).
Even economics do not expect any significant change in the course.
If the loan operation for more than three months has already disappeared from the European Central Bank's arsenal, the latter shall be able to provide unlimited liquidity under the major conditions and for a period from one week to three months.
Economics today expect this mechanism to be extended for several months.
"I can't imagine that she would change her programme in a significant way."
"If not, it would mean taking the risk of calling for a short-term new pressure," says Michael Schubert, economist of the Commercial Bank.
"Progressive output announced during the first quarter of 2011, seems to be more likely," says Norbert Brams, an economist at Sal.
Oppenheim.
To plan its public debt market intervention, "the European Central Bank should maintain the volume of purchases of its bonds in order to revive the soft market", adds Norbert Brams.
Given the exposure of European banks to markets with the debt raised in the euro area, there is nothing more to choose than to keep its presence on the market.
"There is a need to compensate every price for the lack of investors on the market and to act in such a way as to prevent the planning of the state's payrolls, which are among the most common," said a significant bond manager yesterday.
Because if the rate measures were to arise, the states would be more concerned about this in order to reduce their debt rather than stabilize it.
It's saved the euro for this price.
In Italy, the government of the Berlusconi back
After the beginning of the week for Italy, the situation was slightly calmed, and yesterday it was back at the compulsory rates for 10 years.
Go back to your temporary rest.
At the end of the meeting with the Prime Minister for the economy of the regions, they said that they heard Giulia Tremonti as he qualified as "indistinct" and expected "unforeseen" weekend, which was then demented.
In any case, in the absence of a long-term German interest rate, a recorded 210 basic points and the price of a contract covering the risk of bankruptcy (CDS) decreased to 263 points, resulting in a certain breakdown in Rome.
In the Council of Ministers, Silvio Berlusconi noted that in Spain there were more than 400 basic points of difference with German levels.
But his right hand, Gianni Letta, said he's "too busy" "in the destructive development of the markets" and perhaps because of the origin of Ireland.
"The good news is that Italy, the third euro area economy, is not like Greece or Ireland."
"The bad news is that it's like Portugal," explains Irwin Stelzer, an economist at Hudson Institute.
Clearly and unencumbered, its problem is the absence of growth and unexplained tax revenue, which goes hand in hand and poses a risk that it will not be able to meet its financing needs.
The last projections of Brussels were for the government's cold shower.
Italy's growth is currently expected to be 1.1% in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012... while the budget available to the Senate for its analysis is 1.3% and 2%.
Under these conditions, the European Commission estimates that the public finances deficit will still represent 4.3% of the gross domestic product in the next year (compared to 3.9% of the government) and 3.5% in 2012 (over 2.7%).
A new set of supplements to the proposal for a state budget which could be included after the holidays, amounting to EUR 7 billion.
"If it is necessary, new urgent measures will have to be adopted," said Commissioner for Economic Affairs, Olli Rehn.
Italy is currently supporting international institutions.
"The basic stones of her economy are fine and her calculations are correct, we repeat this for a long time," says Arrigo Sadun, a member of the Italian Governing Council of the International Exchange Fund under the pressure of Italy to the International Exchange Fund.
"There is no immediate problem, neither short-term nor long-term, because, through its considerable debt (119.2% of gross domestic product 2011, NDLR), it is efforts to stabilize the needs in Italy less than the efforts required by other countries," notes Pierre Carlo Padoan, the main OECD economy.
The remaining issue of political instability.
On 14 December, Silvio Berlusconi will face a proposal to express his mistrust in the honourable Member and then to organise the elections with which it is calculated at the end of March.
It would be such a period that it would not be appropriate for a decision to be taken in the event of a serious crisis.
Europeans are thinking about strengthening anti-crisis mechanisms.
Christine Lagarde once again highlighted this yesterday at a press conference in Paris: "I think that Europeans demonstrated it on Sunday throughout the day and night, are obviously very solidarityary decisions, commitment to defend their currency and their exchange area."
Despite all the relative, yesterday's marked expansion of the European state bond has brought water to the mill by governments and the Central European Bank.
But we can't talk about the beginning of normalization.
The Standard & Poor's notation Authority announced that it could downgrade the record of the debt of Portugal, the objectives for which various speculations are most concerned.
"Because in May there is a real lack of transparency and a clear policy, which is mainly based on banking systems," says economist Exane BNP Paribas.
More than that, "political time runs less than market time."
The knowledge of this fragmented relationship and the dangers that are hidden stimulates the European countries' discussion, leading to the strengthening of existing crisis mechanisms.
Informal consultation between finance ministers, most of the problems involved, and their G20 challenges are being developed in a broader way.
With regard to the meetings of the Eurogroup (Eurogroup) and Ecofin from the beginning of the next week.
The Central European Bank meeting will take place today.
The programme shall include judgments of non-conventional measures in support of the euro area country with a market focus (see above).
In the case of the European Fund for Finance (ESF), its Executive Director, Klaus Regling, ordered Singapore a trip to Asia on Tuesday, with the aim of informing investors from the Far East about the development of the crisis in Europe.
If the purpose of this journey is not to raise funds, it shall prepare the soil for achieving this objective.
The first issue of the FESF securities is expected to be next month.
Yesterday, the U.S. official representative told Reuters that the United States would support the possible increase in mobilised financial resources by additional direct engagement in the IMF.
The countries concerned in the first line, Portugal and Spain, are preparing to adopt structural reforms, particularly in the area of the organisation of the labour market.
Reforms associated with urgent action with rapid action.
Lisbon and Madrid are another route than Greece and Ireland.
Both countries want to avoid, at any cost, asking for international assistance before they apply their own budget corrections and before they decide on structural reforms necessary to regain their permanent confidence.
The capital participants in the European funds are finally talking about options available to speed up the process of normalisation of markets with concluded bonds.
On his way to Paris on 24 November, Axel Weber came up with an idea whether there would be no EUR 750 billion of Europeans and the International Monetary Fund, the Union would not be able to reassess the value of paper.
Economics from Barclays Capital, which is the actor of the first business plan with European targeted searches, argues that the contribution of about 100 billion euros would be sufficient, "better" in the form of direct financial liquidity.
The means exist: this is the European Financial Stability Mechanism, which is devoted to this day to EUR 60 billion.
The Council, which has every opportunity to be tested in European capitals.
Especially when market conditions deteriorated.
Snow and snow: 24 countries have orange ready.
Snow supplies are still causing problems in transport, especially on the second-class roads in Britain, and there is a risk of damaging some economic activities.
Twenty-four periods have from today's orange readyness due to the risk of snow and are due.
L'Eure, l'Eure-et-Loir, les Deux-Sèvres and la Vienne, joined in 20 periods that have already been reported as orange ready, 18 since Wednesday afternoon and two, La Dordogne and La Gironde, later at night.
According to Météo France, the snow caused problems in the north of La Gironde and Les Charentes and low snow in Ile-de-France.
Snow cover from 2 to 5 cm, places from 7 to 10 cm, is expected in the relevant periods and covers from 1 to 3 cm, places up to 5 in the Paris region.
They are established during Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côtes d'Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, of Poitou and the Basse-Normandie, Ile-de-France and Limousin.
The effects of snow are too large to cause problems in transport and to disrupt certain economic activities, Météo France predicts.
On the coast of Côtes d'Armor, some periods have banned heavy freight transport - over 7,5 tonnes of traffic with the route Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac.
The road traffic on the second-class roads in Britain is very difficult and the police recommend driving their vehicle only if it is really necessary and the traffic of some trucks has been cancelled for this day.
School connections were banned in Picardia on Thursday.
In the middle of the evening no special measures are envisaged to limit freight transport.
"All drivers call for the greatest attention on the roads and the adaptability of driving".
The Directorate-General for Civil Aviation (DGAC) requested airlines to cancel their flights on Thursday 25% on the Paris airport of Roissy and 10% on Orly due to expected snow charges.
DGAC recommends that passengers who use air transport services be contacted by its company.
In Great Britain, until the fourth quarter, Gatwick airport is closed in south London and Edinburgh airport in Scotland.
Metro Grand Paris: first financial proposals
Since the debate on modernization of transport to Ile-de-France has been in full progress, the first billion.
At least during the discussion.
In particular, we remember 23 billion on the Grand Paris metro, which is to set up the Society du Grand Paris.
In order for this building to be released, it was announced that the grant would amount to EUR 4 billion.
Clearly theoretically, this is the part that allows the GSPs to use on orders part of its two-source funding.
We're finally getting to the first supplements today.
The Rectification Act 2010 which examines the National Assembly's National Financial Committee today contains the mechanisms set out to ensure these resources.
There are two: creating special tax from equipment and raising tax from the office on Ile-de-France.
First, we read in the text of the proposed law, Article 15, says "in the interests of the public institution Société du Grand Paris".
It is calculated: "The output from this rate is EUR 117 million per year."
The other is the restructuring of the fees for the office that already exists, "to be modernised to increase its profit and to bring this increase to the company of Société du Grand Paris".
How much would that cost?
Too crazy.
It's not listed in the text.
We've got up to four billion.
"It is clear that these fiscal resources are connected to EUR 4 billion from the capital contribution that will be mobilised by the State and put into the Society du Grand Paris under the project," we can read in explanation of reasons.
We don't seem to be shocked by this system in the SGP company.
"Since we've created revenue (both taxes, etc.), we can hide the study for three years and then dig up to 4 billion, it explains."
"It will be included in the budget and used as necessary."
The GSP considers that 4 billion will be allocated up to 2013 for the 2014 budget.
This mechanism, in which 4 billion promiseds still belong to non-appropriate subscribers, is at risk of triggering some serious parliamentary debate.
The first public meeting will be held on 7 December.
Moisture hackers and triggerers
The case of WikiLeaks is of secondary importance.
On the one hand, there is an obvious scandal, a scandal that appears to be scandalous only forms in the form of cover which governs relations between states, citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it refers to major changes at international level and predicts the future of a controlled regression.
But let's do the order.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is to confirm the fact that each document composed of a secret service (any nation) consists exclusively of print drawings.
"Extraordinary discovery" Americans about the way of sexual life of Berlusconi are reporting what each could have read in any newspaper (all except these two Berlusconi owns), and no cartoon profile Kadáfio has been long for barbaric artists for skis..
The rule that secret documents may only consist of reports already known is essential in the dynamic of secret services, not only in this century.
When you go to a library dedicated to esoteric literature, you will see that every work is repeated (from Graal, the Background of Rennes-le-Château, Temples or Zednaries) exactly what has already been written in previous works.
And it's not just because the author of the occult texts doesn't like new information (not even knowing where to look for news about non-existings), but because those who believe in occultism believe only what they already know and what they confirm what they've learned before.
It's a success mechanism for Dan Brown.
It's also paid for secret documents.
The informant is a line, and a line (or a limited spirit) is the chief of secret services (and if not, it could be, as I know, the editor in the Freedom News), who is convinced that only what he admits.
The information about Berluscon, which the U.S. Embassy sent to the state resort, was the same that Newsweek published last week.
Why, then, has it become so common around the distribution of these documents?
On the one hand, they say what every cultured person already knows, and indeed, the majority, at least from the end of the second world war and from the time that the heads of states can call or fly on a plane at a joint dinner, they lost their diplomatic function and, except for a few small exercises in their representation, were transformed into a Spanish center.
Any viewer watching films about research is very well aware that only because of licentiousness it seems to be ignored.
However, the fact that this is being publicized, it ignores the obligation to cover up and brings about this evil light on American diplomacy.
Secondly, the idea that any hacker can obtain the most accurate classified information from the most powerful country in the world represents a strong impact, no matter how unfavourable, for the prestige of this state resort.
The scandal affects both the victim and his "executors".
But let's get out of here for the deep truth about what happened.
Sometimes, in Orwell's time, it was possible to take all the power, like some Big Brother who controlled every movement of his people.
Orvell's prophecy has been demonstrated since that time, thanks to the ability to control every move through the phone, every transaction carried out, a hotel visited, the distance used and so on, became a citizen of a simple sacrifice of power.
But if we demonstrate how it goes now that even "robbers" with the most intimate information can't resist the influence of a hacker, then the control message is going to be one-way and becomes a trainer.
Very controls every town, but every town, or at least hacker - chosen as a citizen's patron, can know all the secrets of power.
How can you keep the power that no longer has the opportunity to keep your own secrets?
It is true that Georg Simmel has already said that true secrets are unconcealed (and unconcealed secrets will never be discovered); it is also true that all information about the character of Berlusconi or Merkel is really a secret secret because it is derived from public life; but discovering, as WikiLeaks did, that the secrets of Hillary Clinton are unconcealed secrets means to take away all power.
WikiLeaks made no mistake in Sarkozy or Merkel, but he did something big for Clinton and Obama.
What will the effects of this wound be so important?
It is clear that in the future the states will not be able to send online sensitive information - this would be equivalent to its publication on a poster on the street.
But it is also quite obvious that modern technologies are essential to the hope that they can keep up with the text on the phone.
It's nothing easier than to find out if and when the head of state was on a plane and she got in touch with one of her colleagues.
How will they be able to be preserved in the future in secret and sensitive reports?
I know that at this point, the prognosis belongs to science fiction and is therefore fantastic, but I have to present myself to the government actors who carry out discrepancies on uncontrollable tracks and carry only those messages that know to remember or otherwise hide rare information in the bottom of the bottle.
The information will be stored in unique copies of closed keys: the entire reason why the attempt to spy into the Watergate affair was less successful than WikiLeaks.
I had an opportunity to write that technology is now moving forward, which means backward.
One century after a wireless telegraph marked the revolution in communications, the Internet rehabilitated the telegraph based on wires (telephones).
Videocasettes (analogous) have enabled lovers of cinema to film the film step by step, to move it forward and back and discover all the secrets of the installation, while now CD (digital) allows only to jump by chapters, which means by macroports.
We will arrive from Rome in Milan in three hours, while on the way to the airport and transport that includes three and a half hours.
It is therefore not unusual for politicians and communication techniques to return to vehicles on board.
Last note.
Jindy tried to understand what was being done in the secret of high school.
Now these are the majority of people who ask for reliable press information.
Climate: how France hacked its funding promises
The year after the Kodana Agreement is the time to try to keep promises on fast-blocked financing (called rapid start-up or early) carried out by developed countries.
And the great French hacks were removed.
In the Kodana Agreement, developed countries committed to provide $30 billion in 2010-2012.
The European Union has committed EUR 7.2 billion for three years and France EUR 1.26 billion (that is 420 million a year).
At the start of COP16, the EU has taken a big step to convince its partners of the reality of its commitment to finance fast start: a report covering the actions of its Member States, a press conference, a large side event, distribution of brochures...
A transparent operation is invaluable and evaluated at its true value: the land-rich and civil society would like all the land-rich and civil society to do the same and the same degree of precision.
The EU announced that in 2010 it released EUR 2.2 billion, which led it to the correct path to its promise of 7.2 billion in 2012.
But if we focus on the details, we'll find that things are much more complicated.
These financial instruments are "new and additional" under the Kodana Agreement in order to ensure that the increased burden is realized without public aid for development.
I'm sorry, there's no match in what "new and additional" means.
While the European Commission has proposed harmonisation, some Member States, including France, have blocked the process.
Today, everyone selects this reference that best suits him.
For example, the European Commission considered 2009 as a reference: international funding has been maintained and it still contributes 150 million to the fixed start of funding for three years.
Other countries have chosen similar references to the annual payment periods or to the level of public development aid.
On the contrary, France believes that funding for "all new projects" in 2010 is "new and additional".
In other words, there is no reference to the expenditure of the previous period or to the global level Public aid for the development of d'Aide publicique au development.
In particular, France's overall support for the developing country may remain unchanged (or even reduced), should fulfil its commitment to financing "new and additional" ...
Another decisive factor is the distribution of gifts and loans.
There is no rule there yet and everyone chooses their own method of calculation.
Some, such as France, believe that 1€ borrowed is equal to 1€ given.
Of course it's hard to show: the effort is not equivalent.
If the use of loans can be made for some investments that are profitable (often related to emission reduction projects, which are based on more effective technologies), it would be foolish to present one euro that we receive as equivalent to one euro we give... , but as a loan price for a credit country (i.e. the equivalent of interest rates).
But France can only give such justification: "contains" its commitment to EUR 420 million, making 91.5% of the loan (389.8 million) and 8.5% of the gifts (EUR 36.1 million) - see the EU document so that you can verify it yourself.
It is the only country in the Union which uses the loan in such a way.
Germany has requested 46% from it, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovenia (including others) fulfil their commitments by 100%.
In other words, when a simple majority of the European Union gives 1€ in terms of fulfilling its promise, France only gives 10 cents and considers this effort comparable.
A beautiful Caucasian shirt!
On the one hand, France is working with two companies in its "fast start" funding: on the one hand, with the development of action in time and on the other, with real financial burden.
Although it only issues EUR 36.1 million, it can convince itself that it issues EUR 420 million "new and additional" in relation to its promises.
The finance minister's manipulation (because it seems that although it is Bercy who made such a decision), it could have a double negative impact, at the same time within the EU (why would Member States continue to make a donation when it is enough to borrow) and when it is agreed that the developing countries are not completely naive...
The chapter on early financing is only a small issue, relatively short-term, in relation to the climate debate series.
But it could be a bunch of sand in addition to the huge machine UNFCCC is.
Let's hope that's not our case.
In any case, it is necessary to collect information from this first year of provisional financing.
First of all, France should notify the change in its way of conducting accounting evidence for 2011 and 2012, in the spirit of compliance with its obligations and obligations and integrity and justice towards other countries of the European Union.
But above all, France should discuss deposits in long-term financing (other key chapters currently under discussion): we do not ignore the question of "additiveness" or how to account for loans.
France should change its position to become as progressive in these deposits as in others.
I hope everyone will join the new Ministry of the Environment, Mrs Kosciusko-Morizet, who will come to Cancun next week.
The surprising announcement of France's fast start and its "additive" vision and the use of loans could lead to an increase in international trust necessary for further discussion.
Warning about pesticides that children watch.
A 10-year-old looks at one day 81 different chemicals, according to one study published in this medium, from the Association of Future Generations (ex-Hunting for Law and Conservation of Future Generations).
The association, which warns that its results "have no significant statistical value with regard to the low number of samples analysed but are characteristic of the problem processed", bought between July and the end of the food normally consumed in four meals and one easy meal as an easy meal for a 10-year-old child in the supermarkets in L'Oise and Paris.
These typical foods, including official recommendations - five juices of pure fruit and vegetables, three milk products and 1.5 litres of water daily - like sugars, were analysed by research laboratories on chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals and other pollutants.
The balance of the plate is striking: 81 chemical substances, of which 42 are listed among carcinogens, possibly or possibly, and five are among the clear carcinogens, as well as 37 substances that could be used as raw for internal mixtures (PE), according to a study of several institutions such as the International Cancer Research Centre.
"Even if in almost all cases the legal limits for each chemical are not individually adopted, in our research we clearly see that the reality in consumer exposure to pollutant substances, perhaps carcinogen, and/or PE is infectious," says the association.
For breakfast butter and milk tea contain approximately ten residues with possible carcinogenic effects and three demonstrated as certain carcinogens, as is the case with approximately twenty residues that could affect the hormonal system.
Jablko, from Brazil, the study referred to as a small pig, contains the proportions of six chemical substances, including the prohibited fungicide in France.
It is also paid for green beans from Kenya, including food, in which the study revealed the rates of strong insecticides prohibited in the EU.
In addition to bifthek from the soft meat, tuna in the faucet and even cows and chickens were sprayed with pesticides and other chemical substances.
In water from the coheutc analysis, the presence of particles and chloroforms was detected.
Steak from lososa to dinner was "the richest" with 34 discovered chemical residues and even the analysis of the plastic plate used to burn food in a microwave tube was not excluded from analysis.
The final risk for consumers of this "contaminant cocktail" is likely to be underestimated," says the study.
The Ecological Europe Green (EEE-LV) Group proposed " creating in the face of an emergency" a moratorium on the use of pesticides to stop "the occurrence of civilisation diseases".
In July the European Food Safety Agency (EFSA) study examined the presence of 365 different pesticides identified in fruit and vegetables in Europe from 76 in cereals.
