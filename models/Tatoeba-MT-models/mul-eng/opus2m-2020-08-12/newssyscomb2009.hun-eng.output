The victory of the best populists in Austria is 29 percent
The two sides of the educational elite were able to feel the discouragement and significant strength of the right-wing populist parties, according to the first preliminary results of the Austrian parliamentary elections on Friday.
The Ostrák Népárt (OVP), where the current President, Wilhelm Moreer's position, suffered a particularly severe loss.
On the other hand, the President of the Association for the Future of Austria (BZZZ), President of Karintia, Jörg Haider, is preparing for a successful return to national policy.
On the basis of the previous results, the country's most powerful party to the Social Democrat Party (SPÖ) remains with 29.8 percent of the votes, but it lost 5.5 percent of the votes in 2006 for the last election.
Even worse has been the OVP, which loses nearly nine percent of the votes by 25.6 percent.
These two large parties have achieved the worst results in the post-war history of Austria and, above all, in the words of Néppart, the result is disastrous.
At the beginning of July, when the ODP Coalition emerged, the people had a significant advantage in front of the SSP, according to public opinion studies.
However, the voters were apparently punished for letting the government collapse.
In the first response to the results, speculations have already been made about the possible release of Mr Wilhelm Multer's partner and current acanceller.
Observers believe it can be held this weekend at the special session of the Party.
This development would probably facilitate the ever more likely outcome of the selection result, namely the renewal of the SSP and the ODP.
In view of the strengthening of the two groups of right-wing populist parties - the Ostraca Freedom Party (FPÖ) first received 18 percent of the votes and the BZU 10 percent of the votes - but at the same time, social Democrats were afraid of the re-establishment of 1999 when the Peoples' Common Government (the FPÖ was still united in 2005, which also provided for sanctions from the European Union.
Haider, who has already announced that he is ready to cooperate with any party, and I suppose he can return to the national policy of Bécs, obviously depends on this solution.
The Green Party, however, has come to Parliament from a somewhat lost population, and from the third from the political parties of the districts, has gone back to the fifth.
None of the other parties went beyond the four-hundred-one limit and did not come to Parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Indian relations can be excluded
If he could not solve the problem of Czech scholars reported for the illegal collection, Mr. Karel Schwarzenberg said Czech Minister of Foreign Affairs could lead to some interference in Czech-Indigenous relations.
The Minister made this public in New York after meeting with Pranab Mukhérdzs, a partner in India.
"If this doesn't work out, then yes, there would be a certain relief," he said after the meeting, which came out of encouragement.
Mukhérdzsi said after the trial that the executive might be unable to intervene in court cases.
However, he noted that in the case of Petr Švácha, who was convicted of a crime and sentenced to trial, the central government could deal with the local administration of Darjeeling, which is governed by the law of the case.
"His problem could be solved," said the minister.
According to Mukhérdzsi, he was sentenced to three years in prison for Emil Kučer, however, it would be best to enter the Supreme Court.
Then he could ask for a place of freedom against the guards and wait for the trial to be held free, he explained.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his partner had likewise ended up in the course of the negotiations.
"He offered to appeal to the Supreme Court, then it would be possible to rescue him," said the Czech Diplomatician chief.
The only way to get involved in the whole case is by offering "competent legal support", said the Indian Minister.
At the same time, he said that the Indian side already provides them with such help.
"We are most interested in maintaining the best relations with India with the many years of independence.
The Indians also recognize this," Schwarzenberg said.
In the same way, as the Czech Republic said, it stressed to its partner that the Czech Republic plays a very important role in the problem of Czech entomologists.
"We are in fact serious trouble with the conviction of these Czech scientists and the prosecution," he said.
The question is whether the Indian party has received a promise to deal with the case, the Minister has issued the answer.
"How many promises have I received," he noted.
Czech judges in the war on the seabed
There you go to the field electronic map where Australia and the surrounding maritime areas can be seen.
But it doesn't matter, but it's a point that disappears in the ocean.
"The river belongs to Australia and also to the nearby seas.
In the area, as you are on the continent," says Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, who belongs to the Third Working Group on the UN Division on Ocean and Maritime Affairs.
Chief, Václav Mikulka, head of the Division, takes note of the explanation that sometimes heals.
He's in charge of work and entertainment here.
The seabed is rich in natural resources, so far it's almost a known world.
This may be accompanied by oil, coal and other toxic substances, but at the same time, unknown living organisms, such as cancer medicine, may be the key.
More seabeds on the coast
The Parties are actively seeking new areas under the new sea in our days.
According to the United Nations Convention they are implementing the same rights as they were established at the Jamaican Montego Bay in 1982.
First of all, the so-called continental policy is on the ground, which often goes hundreds of miles from the countries concerned.
Such a country has the exclusive right to all sources of continental policy under the Convention.
"Simplify the continental principle of the part of the seabed and of the level below which is the natural continuation of the underground area under the sea.
On the shores of the shores of the party, there are often two hundred meters of the sea. It is just beyond the economic zone," explains Mikulka.
The application submitted by that country to the Committee on the External Borders of the Continental Standard should be supplemented by a number of detailed scientific and technical documentation based on cost-effective research and measurement.
This is the result of many years of preparatory work.
"One of our tasks is to provide legal and technical assistance to the Commission.
The Commission has so far dealt with five requests, Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
Only the last three countries mentioned have been successful," adds Mikulka.
In the world, Australia has recently succeeded in expanding its coastal country.
But New Zealand has also won - about 1.6 million square kilometers of seabeds allocated to the Commission, or six times larger in the country.
In both countries, research has invested more than a million dollars.
The future gains from the use of the seabed will be irreprehensible, according to their expectations.
Other countries continue to submit their requests.
This may be done within ten years of the moment of ratification of the Montego Bay Convention.
Where the Continental Standard is completed, the area of ocean declared "the common heritage of mankind" is beginning by the Convention.
There's no place left for one country anymore.
The right to manufacture in this area is granted by the international institution established by the Convention.
"The seabed, however, is not Klondike," says Director Mikulka, adding that "some areas have been legally surrounded and we have a contract established."
I'll see you on the Pacific Ocean.
The seabed is also part of the Czech Republic today.
This once-out block is divided into other countries within the common "Interoceanmetal" organization.
According to the Convention in 1991, this organisation received its status as "travel investors" as investors in some other countries.
It is entitled to be produced in the area of ClarionClipperton, which lies between Mexico, Hawaii and Kiribati, in the Pacific Ocean.
The area examined by the investor is somewhat larger than in the former Czech Republic.
The seabed is there. It's about the other side of the Tátra.
"All of this can be extended in 75 000 square kilometres.
The area is rich in oil, rice, cobalt and manganese polymetallic crops," says another lawyer, Hindu Pakshi Rajan.
Rober Sandev, the division's team's work is another example of a concrete one.
He remembered a castle or a little fantasy about the miracle of life in Golem.
German special forces have been present at the tax relief
The Egyptian government asked Germany for help in solving the tax burden, and experts came.
When the situation became serious, the special units were ready to enter, but it did not stop.
There are more details about the release of ten European tourists from Egypt.
According to data from the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of the Interior, German special forces were also involved in the rescue operation.
In addition to the German Federal Army experts, GSG 9, the Federal Police Air Force, and the Federal Criminal Service, as well as the German Technical Service's logistics experts, were at the point of release.
According to the Ministry's spokesmen's weekly information on the German forces, however, they did not need them at all, since the terrorists allowed their prisoners to run and then escaped when they recognized the signs of violent torture.
The Egyptian government accepted the aid offered by Germany to install it as a support force.
"This isn't about luck," said the head of the Federal Ministry of Environment.
On September 19, the attackers kidnapped a group of five Germans, five Italians, a Romanian woman, and eight Egyptian explorers in the south of Egypt.
After the invasion of the territory of South Egypt, the tribes of Egypt, Libya, Sudan, and Chad were defeated there.
The existence of tax collectors remains unclear, such as the details of the exemption of taxes or the possible exchange rates.
They arrived in Cairo in the summer of the time they were released.
Steinmeier announced that the released taxes are under the protection of German succession.
It has not been published in the details of the authorisation.
There was no information available in Berlin before when they returned to Germany.
According to the "Build" agenda, five tourists and special forces from the German Air Force Airbus are welcome to Germany.
The U.S. Secretary of State will refuse the rescue package.
The U.S. Congress Lower House has provided a small majority of $700 billion for financial markets.
The Down Jones is in the middle of nowhere.
By 227 votes to 206, the U.S. Secretary-General rejected the government's rescue package for financial markets.
U.S. President George W. Bush and both political leaders did not receive a majority of the programme, which wanted to reduce the gap in the financial markets.
The supporters have no doubt designed to convince critics of the need for a $700 billion package during a dramatic action.
Barney Frank, one of the Democratic Party's negotiators, spoke up to support the representatives, even if the plan is still not popular.
"It's hard to get political support for something that hasn't happened yet," he confessed.
The Dow Jones was still more than 6 percent or 600 points in the vote.
Investors were concerned that the State rescue package could be damaged.
The index increased shortly before the vote was finished to be rescinded after the failure to make public.
Experts count on further serious turbulence in international financial markets.
In order to enter into force of the programme, both the Office of Directors and the Senate must be approved.
The organizers are registering more and more.
It's a good time for German travel organizers.
According to one study, the traffic in travel for the next few months has increased significantly over 30 percent over the last year.
Despite the weak conjunctural appearances, German travel has not failed according to the study.
In South-West Reserves, travel offices recorded 31 percent increase in sales for the previous year - they identified the German Travel Union (DRV) in Berlin last week.
According to the GfK Market Research Institute, the number of savings for the past few months has increased.
Traveling offices reported the DRW on October 2007 with 11 percent of their sales in October.
These results are based on GfK's data, which evaluates the monthly booking data of the 1200 German travel agency and then extrapolates it to the whole market.
The Authority took into account the trips made by the end of August 2008.
Because of the low dollar flow, particularly travel to the United States - he announced the DRW.
The number of reservations here has increased by one-third.
The Germans are particularly interested in their travel objectives, as well as in Spain, Turkey and Greece, as well as in their home countries.
I've been looking for an organized road, said Klaus Laepple, president of the DRV.
Because of rising energy and food costs, in the event of organised roads, the costs "can be better calculated for passengers than for single organised trips."
He added Laepple to the list of reservations or offers, including offers.
The employment rate for the summer months was also very good, so there can be a further increase in sales for the previous year - although another study suggests that the number of German tourists is lower than that for the previous year.
The first October
Uncoloured ballermann sludges, literate cross-sectional springs and diazin derndlit springing fames.
Debt at Wiesnen.
Susanne Kronzucker and I are not much like each other.
He's a hot guy. He's a televisor, and he wears a sweater.
My hair is dark, I'm a student, and I got my clothes in the truck.
One thing, however, has been connected with us: We are in Wiesnen for almost three minutes, we are already destroyed by the photos and killed their memory cards - very welcome, and all my first visit to Wiesnen.
That's how we can make friends.
It looks like the cheapirdli is making it available.
As Wiesn-tourist in the north of the white collar, my comfort is still limited to the population.
But I'm coming to Theresienweis, it's not that late.
Almost everyone wears shirts or leather shirts; no one looks shy or aggressive - it's all right.
It's just my dirty tie.
A mining woman calls my attention to having badly tied the tie: "You're free, you're free in the middle, you're better off, you're right behind your back."
In secret, I tied the mask to the left.
"That's all right," she says, and her name.
Others cut less surfaces around fine flooring techniques, and they're just wearing a "I'm too part of it to upload" with the "I'm too busy to pick up," and they're not asking me to show off their dark background.
The exhibitionists are called young Bob, and he first visited Octoberfestre.
What you find very fantastic has long been aaaaaaaaaa.
After all, he's telling me that he's free from the contents of his old-fashioned corset.
Right next to one fire department that looks like everyone's eyes.
That's why Bob was one of the famous "drinkers."
Others are not so lucky that they can get rid of alcohol this way.
At eight o'clock in the night, the rescuers are finally on their way to the station and care for the poor couples.
The patients always appear in the team - once on four shoes, they have a covered neck.
This works as in most Wiesn-visitors: arrive empty, take a long walk.
That's not what it looks like when it comes to drinking alcohol under the pot.
"These are those who are completely ready," said one of the senators to my question, and then in the market.
The police called the victim of the accident.
The police named the 63-year-old lady who hit an Essex car and died in the hospital.
The Brentwood office, with the residents of Chelmsford Road, was held on Friday afternoon with Carole Paulson in Shenfield Road, the city.
The Romford Queen's Hospital was transferred to the hospital, but later he died.
Following the accident, a 51-year-old man was arrested with a suspicion of ill-treatment.
Since then, they've been released from prison.
Diplomatic horizon of Turkey
Before Turkey was able to join the European Union, the European powers were eager to enter the country of Turkey.
On the east side of Bosnia, perhaps 20 steps from the European border, is one of the largest religioses of the broken office.
The Hydarpasha train station is built by two Germans, Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu designed in neo-Neronesian style.
At least the travel books write that.
The building surrounds the end of the bridges, on one of the top corners of each tower, and looks like a German rural town.
The stone's hot.
The whole building's kind of on fire.
However, in view of the internal nature of the replacement label, it was the most reasonable business.
The state of the German Consortium, Anatolia-Baghdad Corporation, opened in August 1908.
Germany, the "afterward future" of the games from Damascus through Baghdad, wanted to help the driver of today's Szaúd-Arabia to achieve his ambitions to secure the Middle East.
The German bombings were brought together during World War I.
The roads were attacked by the Arab Lawrence and the Arab Party.
There was a significant decline from the surrounding regions, which caused the cold war borders.
The British military forces were expelled from Egypt and reduced their troops and German allies from Palestine and Syria.
Hyderpasha's condition didn't get better.
In 1917 he broke up a forward conveyor and destroyed the well-formed roof of the building.
According to Turkish sources, there has been a sabotage action.
It's been falling apart since then, and it's been quite over my story.
At the same time today, like Anatólia and the entire eastern region, you serve as a diplomat in Turkey, at least in a symbolic sense.
The ruling Justice and Development Party - the AKP - has developed a completely new foreign policy for the country.
There was a significant decline from the surrounding regions, which caused the cold war borders.
The new policy is about commitment.
It is worth noting that the Turkish Government has good relations with Israel and Syria, Hamas and Fatah Palestinian groups, Iraq, Iran and of course with the European Union and the United States.
I wanted to measure the new foreign policy parameters, so I moved to the Turkish capital, Ankara, at night to visit one of AKP's leading foreign policy experts, the Turkish parliamentary representative, Suat Kiniklioglut.
The next morning, about ten and a half hours after the earthquake, which gave the famous documentary about the old world, the "The Night Mail" rhythm, I also arrived in the capital of Turkey.
However, the AKP's paradigm with the medium-sized Islamic gurus represents a paradigm change in the turquoise consensus.
This has raised some doubts in the peace, especially in Washington.
I went with taxis to the AKP's office, an ultra-modern, rock and steel, which is clearly designed for this purpose - which is located in a developing out-of-town neighborhood, half-ready shopping centers and coffee shops.
Suat Kiniklioglu would have included a better-friendly politician in any other European country.
He's dead, he's wearing a tie, and I'm sure he's got another Blackberry with him.
"The party's foreign policy is aimed at helping Turkey's reintegration into its immediate environment.
"The cold war broke the order," she said.
Turkey has disappeared from the Netherlands.
He had to turn out now and then.
He couldn't choose one of the two.
We both had to open it.
"But it's possible that you're forced to choose ahead of time?" I asked.
"Turkey has never wanted to answer."
He then emphasized what everyone I spoke to here was going to say again physically: Turkey's relations not only with the Middle East but also with the Caucasus and the Black Sea countries are in favour of Europe and the United States as well as Turkey's.
It is as if they want to convey the message that - in a sense - Turkey, together with all of Europe, can come to Asia and the Middle East on the east road.
When I was back at Hydarpasha's station, I thought about Mr. Ritterre and Mr Conura, the two German gentlemen who reviewed the construction of this expensive building 100 years ago.
How wonderful it would be if they knew that the European Middle East ambitions are now in the hands of Turkey.
And while I was waiting at the door for the compromise to return to Bosnia, it was thought at that time that Turkey was called a "European Patient".
At least then there was no question as to which part of the land was required for this exciting country.
Memorable lives: Vernon Handley and William Woodruff
Mark Brown writes: Since 1962 he has led the Guildford Philharmonic Zenkart and Körust as director of the Guildford song "Tod" Handley (necrologger, September 11).
On the basis of the city’s music plan, Proteus founded a wonderful youth choir next year.
It could have been only for 21 years, but when Proteus died in 1979 - many of us were in our late 20s - we were simply not willing to change the course.
The name "Proteus" (the mythological variable name) was in line with the difference between the disease and its ability to cross with any book they were doing - whether it was on the matrimony or a cross in the Messiah; without prejudice or great arrogance.
Such a young patient’s multiplicity of music was often bamuted and always exciting, and we could thank the people who have been inspired by our attitude toward music for years.
How often did Tod tell us "Let's talk about the music."
He always said, "The performer knows what he wants.
It's all in the box.
So sing out!"
Karmesteri's technique was always completely understandable and accurate, but never dictatorial or excessive.
Whatever it was with the music, he always got on it.
John Frayn Turner wrote about:
If he had ever lived as a knight who was supposed to hit a horse, it was Vernon Handley.
I was well acquainted with your two-year-olds who led the Guildford Philharmonics from 1962 to 1982.
Over 100 concerts last year, I wrote a critical review, but I never had any family history, and I was often disappointed with them.
Tod Handley was together with greatness and love, which was very rare.
He hated the cowards who - living with his words - simply "two well-known poets were finally caught up in the whole world."
We're gonna miss him.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
According to your neurologist William Woodruff (September 25, 1946), "his studies of economic history continued in Oxford, and in 1950 he was promoted by the Houblon-Norman Research Institute... while he was still preparing for basic diploma, master's diploma and PhD title."
This is from Woodruff's artist's list of "Beyond Nab End", but it's late.
Between 1946 and 1953 the economic history taught at Nottingham University and at the same time under the leadership of Professor J. D. Chambers completed his PhD dissertation from the British rubber industry, which was then issued under the title "The British rubber industry" in 1958.
In 1950-51, he was actually in the United States with a Houblon-Norman promotion, and in 1952 he was in Illinois, New York and Harvard universities.
He finally left Nottingham and moved to Illinois in 1953.
You can't tell Woodruff why he's been enjoying this time.
J. Vicente Resino on the Skullskaron
I suggest the exhibition "J. Vicente Resino "Flamenco and Life" because black-white, documentary-style photographs are amazing.
The simplicity and strength of them, as well as the people involved in the photos, have brought me to their attention.
This exhibition is being passed on by emotions.
Resino's for a wonderful moment."
Second time sales record from Hondjan
In November, Honda starts the second generation of Jazz.
True, his past was quite large, but the development of the new model's internal area was even more difficult.
It is equipped with all the refined machinery that makes it easier to drive and to increase the maintenance of fuel.
Cannot initialise Evolution's mail component.
That's how second generation Honda Jazz looks.
Although in the new Jazz vision it is very similar, many internal changes have been made.
These include, for example, innovative designs, new cartsiers, larger sizes and new machinery.
But before we get to know the new model in detail, we have to say that the new Jazz comes six years after the first generation's market collapse.
So for the first time, we can bet that Honda has been able to update this model for a shorter period of time than other manufacturers.
In Europe, the same Jazz is less known, but other markets decide sales records.
This market, for example, was Japan, where in 2002, and this year in 2008, Jazz was the most wanted car.
In Japan, for example, some one million dollars have been paid from Jazz since the start of the market.
The second market was the Old Continents, for example, about half a million people under six years.
However, Honda wants to continue to increase trade in the area with the new Jazz.
In 2007, while Japan had total sales of 83,000 Jazz, it was expected that it would sell 100,000 cars in 2009 which would result in a 17% increase in the European market.
Since 2002, Honda has sold 8,000 dollars of Jazz since the Spanish market, which accounts for 6.7% of the total sales of Honda in Spain.
In the case of a new generation, the managers of the Spanish subsidiary are calculated by example of 2000 released during a year.
In fact, the arrival of new Jazz will greatly reduce the return of Honda to Spain.
The company's representatives are pleased with the same 22,000 issued by the end of this year, which is less than 4000 data in 2007, i.e. a reduction of 16%.
Despite the sales conditions, Honda increased its share of the Spanish market, which increased by 1.6% compared to 1.8%.
In 2010, I would like to increase this share by 2%.
According to Honda's hopes, this can be achieved by introducing a new model.
This would be Insight, a five-size and compact - 4370 mm long - hybrid, from which the Japanese company would sell 200,000 tarotto annually in the world market.
According to Japan’s producer, the US would make 50% of the share of the Insight market while the remaining share between the Old Continents and Japan.
The introduction of Insight’s commercial activity shall take place in the first months of the year following the official Valencian exhibition planned for January.
For the first generation, the new Jazz has become more comfortable in all respects.
The length reaches 3300 mm (five centimetres longer), the width 1690 mm (two centimetres higher) and the sea level increased by five centimetres, i.e. 2500 mm.
In contrast to its properties, 1520 mm is unchanged.
In addition to the sizes, the track has become more tighter.
The largest inner area is in part the new cart series, and the middle of the fuel storage guarantee - this solution is already known from the former Jazz.
He also grew up in a complete pack pack of 399 litres, or 19 litres, over the capacity of the first generation.
Although the abovementioned size applies to the type of 1,4 engine, the same type of 1,2 Honda Jazz pack is 379 litres.
Some external changes can also be detected, such as the rear-facing lamp or the optional panorama window, and the back seating is easier to approach.
In addition, the opening of the doors for the last sittings was 80 to 80 in contrast to the first release of the Jazz 67.
The second generation jazz engines are new.
At the start of the sale this small model can be equipped with two, two, two, two and 1.4 litres.
Due to i-VTEC technology, both use of energy is preferable to the previous model, as well as lower emissions of carbon dioxide and excellent mechanical compatibility, while the engine provides excellent performance in all respects.
The output of 1,2 litres of power is 90 litres of 6000 vol and the maximum printing is 114 Nm 4400 vol.
This engine - which was 78 liters in the former Jazz - consumes 5,3 litres and 125 grams of CO2 emissions.
The other engine that produced 83 litres for the previous generation is now 100 litres.
The 100-loored 1.4-inch Jazz consumes an average of 5.4 litres and its emissions are 128 grams of CO2.
The attacker's "inflicted"
In order to develop disaster prevention technologies, Nissan is now in the process of developing a new invention from nature, precisely from the world of honey.
The Japanese company has designed a robot that is responsible for the damage caused by the plague.
The bio-mimetic Car Robot Drive or BR23C may be the first step towards the development of pre-fired technologies.
The Directors of the Nissan Motor Co. Development Technical Centre of the so-called Tokyo Development Unit in collaboration with the Scientific and Technological Research Centre, built this small robot in Japan.
According to Kazuhiro Doi, the Director of the Technology PR and Research Development Market, BR23C means further extension of Nissan's four-level safety guard tower.
The robot is more capable of attacking the company's products.
During the flight, every time you fly out your oval personal area, which is very similar to Nissan's safety shelter.
However, the role of the brain is much more important than that of the person who is composed of the brain, which sees more than 300 eyes in each direction. Consequently, the brain can easily be packed in its own personal area.
To remove the complex eye function, the engineers designed a laser Range Finder.
In a 180-foot view before the BR23C, the device identifies the obstacles within 2 metres, calculates the distances, and sends a signal to the transverse micro-processor immediately following the operation to avoid the attack.
"As soon as the obstacle is observed, the small robot, following the movement of the brain, immediately changed its direction by moving the legs in a smaller or larger direction in order to avoid the attack.
The system is mostly different from the currently available tools, which in this case are completely detached.
If not, the robot could not respond quickly to the obstacles," explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Laboratory and project manager.
In contrast to the mesh, the mesh can not be directed up or down, and not directly, only in two dimensions and only towards the ability of the legs, i.e. not in an infinite direction and way, as in the case of mesh.
That is why Nissan used a rotational function in the robot to avoid attacks, besides speeding up and down.
"This structure needs to process and respond to the data every few seconds.
There is no need for data storage or intuitive logic based on previous data, so it can operate only a few thousand KB memory without interruption.
This may sound amazing, but it's not really a gigaby, but we're not talking about megabyte big memory.
This is the first step towards the development of the technology to prevent immediate shooting, which can be introduced into the production cars within ten years of Nissan's assessment.
The robot works with lithium polymer accumulators, which are easier and more durable than lithium ion.
In the future, the integration of the unit with the GPS operational navigation system can be an opportunity for further application in order to avoid obstacles to the end.
I'm afraid of the sign.
We need to know that the U.S. Kinkstari Division has more than enough funds to invest, but they are not well aware of it.
In view of the crisis, and so that the Americans would not be able to question their taxpayers, they created a fun and informative net game at the Bad Credit Hotel.
It's the Bad Faith Hotel... i.e. her daughter-in-law.
The hotel and mainly the picture of the reception bus home suggest it, let's think about it once again, twice, a table, or more three times, actually now is the time of the loan.
And most importantly, where we need to believe, because it's probably the goal.
The information available on the website is actually useful, but is less detailed.
It's more like talking to kids than it's about the big community.
But what happens if we add up the game?
For example, in the hotel you can see our bedroom.
Actually, it's something, because we can't dream of buying a apartment.
Morgan Stanley will open his head for the MUFG
Morgan Stanley announced that he would have a share in his capital for the Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG). The largest Japanese bank pays $9 billion for the company's capital by 21% after the Morgan Stanley shares paid a high price on the stock market.
One week after the opening of the advance agreement, the two banks said that the MUFG would purchase 9.9% of Morgan Stanley's shares at $25.25 unit price, i.e. total $3 billion.
The accepted price shall remain at more than 19 % of the value of the securities as set out in the book of August 31.
The MUFG will purchase additional $6 billion for transferable securities, which will provide 10% of imports and exchange rates of $31,25.
According to Morgan Stanley, the global transaction is based on an average of $29,8 per cent higher than the current price.
However, according to Morgan Stanley's share rate of greenwichi between 17 hours, it was 6.79%, and it closed at $23.07.
"This strategic alliance gives Morgan Stanley a great opportunity to speed up the change in his bankholding company," explains John Mack, director of the American company.
Morgan Stanley left a good new status last week to diversify his activities while under the control of the Federal Reserve.
The agreement with MUFG reaffirms once again that the current financial crisis requires greater caution from Wall Street's registered companies.
Another of the conditions stated on the weekend is that the agreement has been amended in the last days: last week Morgan only announced that its share of 20% would give about $8.5 billion to the Japanese company.
"A week ago we still thought that participation would be made up of all ethnic groups," explained Toshihide Mizuno, director of the MMFG in Tokyo.
"However, because of the current market and economic situation, we would be able to minimize and avoid possible risks."
With the weighted average, MUFG pays more than 7% of its book value for Morgan Stanley shares.
As a result of the transaction, my contribution to a share decreased by around 20%.
On the basis of the agreement, the MMFG may transfer its primary shares over one year, where the last trading price exceeds more than 50% over a given period of time, i.e. around $47.
Morgan Stanley thus ensures that he can use his investment options, improve size and increase his liquidity resources through MMFG.
However, the group’s spokesman did not want to provide accurate information on the two new related strategic plans.
Following the MUFG hit, Morgan Stanley is expected to increase its payable rate by about 15% according to Tier I, which will be one of the best in its own sector.
Morgan has stated that his measure has been "determined" since the end of August.
In the past few weeks, a great effort has been made to the group, as the price of its members has fallen on them while the cost of insurance against non-payment risk has been high.
This cost rose by week, but still remained high at around 12%.
One of the largest investors' banks remained behind after Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers were bought by Merrill Lynch. This was Goldman Sachs, who announced that 15 billion dollars last week: a part of this comes from Berkshire Hataway, Warren Buffett's company.
Rafael Correa weekly statement, Quito
The re-establishment of the public in the spirit of socialism of the 21st century.
This is a joint plan for Venezuelan Hugo Chávez, Bolivian Evo Morales and Ecuadorian Rafael Correán.
Following the example of its presidents and friends, Correa opened her new constitutional ideas on Friday.
It was successful because 64% of the voters voted in favour of the referendum according to official results of 80% of the votes.
According to the population, 28% did not vote, 7% did not vote, while 0.7% were left unattended by the voters.
For the adoption of the draft Constitution, 50% + 1 vote was required.
On the other hand, two studies conducted by a civil body at the end of the ballot papers on Sunday proved that the "yes" votes were high by 63% or 70%.
As a matter of fact, Rafael Correa has already discussed the victory over the constitutional plan of the week, which will turn into a week-old.
"The Constitution gave the first victory," she said, and thanked the Ecuadorans at the government branch in Guayaquil, 180 kilometers south of Quittól.
As it turned out, Mr. Chavez, Mr. Morales and the President of Chile, also congratulated Michelle Bachelet.
According to the report of the United States Observer Mission (OAS), the vote was held in a calmer atmosphere. The main theme was a 444-point text, which included the principles of "new socialism", which were protected by the President.
The proposed Constitution establishes the State's power to serve the economy, subject to the State's right to "development planning" for a country based on the production of oil by foreign companies and foreign exchanges.
The Correa draft chosen in 2006 also reaffirms the power of the State-based authority, which may receive a mandate for at least two consecutive periods and has the right to divide the national collection.
Correa has already announced that she wants to live with this opportunity and will be back in February 2009 for the main mission.
The Constitution also included the freedom of health services and education. The President has already begun to bring it into a country with 13.9 million inhabitants, and the population lives below the minimum.
Finally, the Constitution prohibits the presence of foreign groups in the country, which can conclude with regard to the use of the Ecuadorian facility based on American drug-free measures.
They were released in the 19th century.
The Egyptian commander struck him on the shoulders of men who had spent ten days trying to destroy dozens of tourists and eight of them.
The hostages are now in Cairo.
Eleven European tourists and eight Egyptian explorers were held in the wilderness for ten days, from which they were transported safely to the capital of Egypt on Sunday.
In the course of the day, a Egyptian commander was released from prison in Csad.
Apparently in good condition, about half of the afternoon they arrived at the Al-Maza military base, directly connected to the international airport of Cairo.
The terrorists were banned from preaching to the press, and immediately they were transferred to a hospital in Maadi, Cairo, where they were examined.
The taxes are "healthier", and the kidnappings are "unpaid" - declared Egypt Minister for Foreign Affairs Zoheir Garanna at the airport.
On September 19, the towers were destroyed at the foot of Mount Ouanat in Egypt, Sudan, and Libya, where territorial safari took part. The group then fled from one of the 35 unknown towers to another.
The group consisted of 11 tourists (five Italian men, five German men and one Romanian woman), and eight Egyptians: two foreign leaders, four drivers, a border guard and the head of the Egyptian travel agency organized by the Safari.
According to an Egyptian security commander, a 30-member special commander came to the scene at two helicopters directly before the strike.
"There has been a fire between the teams. The men have killed him, the others have been killed," said a leader in charge of hearing the name.
He further said that there were 150 special classes sent from the Egyptian Villam Brigadier General to Sudan, where they were filled with German and Italian commanders.
Franco Frattini, the current Italian diplomatic leader in Belgrade, stressed the role of secret agents and special Italian action groups.
"We need to know that this outcome could not have been achieved without the professional and effective intervention of our people and action groups without further details."
He also admitted that the tax would have been paid for the tax.
On the previous day, the Sudanese army reported that they had been arrested during a police raid by the kidnappers, killing six of them (including the military commander) and arresting two of them.
According to the military, the prosecutors were in contact with a DARF organization in relation to the Sudan Liberation Movement (SLA-U) which was immediately taken into account by the organization concerned.
Lettres - The culture "silent majority"
There is currently a debate on funding for culture in the centre of the media and the ongoing electoral campaign.
That's all we can do.
But our cultural life continues to be forgotten.
Who will raise his voice to shed light on the great number of small museums, libraries, ancient monuments, and national historical monuments in the south?
What political cause is there to remind the federal government that it is not interested in its works and buildings that are part of its cultural heritage?
Or does it mean that there are no laws in Quebec or Canada that really ensure the effective protection of our cultural heritage?
Did you know that the French government only sold three and a half million euros for the restoration of the Chinese castle in Loire River?
The Constitution of our fellow Americans also states that the protection of cultural heritage is part of American culture and that it must be protected in a coherent manner for all citizens, all elected representatives and all government bodies.
Within the framework of the édération des société d'histoire du Québec, the Association of Québecs (Fédération des Societété d'histoire du Québec) is responsible for more than 40,000 voluntary research into the history and for the preservation of the vast number of private archives and archaeological works, with a minimum budget.
These organisations usually protect our wealth with respect to our property, and they oppose our last reach when property developers and decision-makers lead their investigations into our old buildings and our forgotten tombs.
When will someone be appointed to protect historical and cultural heritage?
State the Fortis bank part of the Benelux governments
In particular, Benelux states are helping to support a financial and insurance institution with the interests of Hungary, which is supported by a total of EUR 11.2 billion by the three countries as a result of the impact of the US credit market crisis.
The Belgian, Luxembourg and the Dutch Government agreed at the highest level on the case at the end of the week, including the President of the European Central Bank and the responsibilities of the European Commission.
In the euro area, decisions made by the Fortis Bank in the first major crisis in the valleys in the context of a year-long international financial crisis can therefore be regarded as of some priority.
In the light of the decision of the night of the day, all three states will purchase the bank's property in close proportion (49 percent).
The bank is definitely selling a part of its interests, including, above all, the activities purchased from the Netherlands by the United States of America - mainly insurance.
The Fortis's shares began to melt during the past week, and on the other side of the week, serious crises had already been reported by the institution.
However, analysts agree that 85 billion senior employees are too large to allow the bank to go into trouble.
The company's papers were only about 12 percent on Friday, 14-year-old deep points.
Since January, the value of the shares has declined more than twice.
The total market capital of the group is around EUR 14 billion, but corporate managers say that this is not real.
On the other hand, the company has raised doubts about the adoption of the US US $700 billion package plan in order to wipe out Fortis shares.
The paper has grown a lot since the weekend.
On Friday, Filip Dierckx was appointed a new director for the bank's life.
The money institution also sought out private buyers, but no one has reported any significant offer so far.
The Belgian government has already indicated that investors should not be discouraged or wasted their money.
There's no panic around the bank's clients so far, the boys haven't been cheered up.
In Hungary, Fortis has self-employed boys, and he has also bought license companies.
Rhoca in the stomach
In the United States, health insurance companies often refuse to agree with the applicant on the basis of the data on the purchase of medicinal products for human consumption.
Data protection experts believe that the data market would become uncontrollable.
"There is a data protection programme which relates to the use of medical data in any event to the contribution of the person concerned.
This should be done independently, especially in the rock of Typhoon" - Idiot Richard Dicke, a developer of the Washington Post medical research program.
Insurance companies shall rely on the health status of the present customer on the amount of the insurance fee and damages and shall not be bound by insurance if they consider the risk too high.
They were sent to a previous medical examination, and the contract was concluded only in the light of the results of the examination.
Dick has found a much cheaper procedure for ten years: based on the customer's identification number, he easily gets what medicine he bought in the last few years, and this program has resulted in what he is suffering from and what his health is.
For example, if you take a high dose of cholesterol reduction on a regular basis, it means that your blood level is practically untreated, which is rapidly higher in risk.
The programme also has several changes in turnover, some of which also identify a risk source number, so the insurance provider will be able to stay out of paper, even though they may be difficult.
Some medicines may also be used for several purposes, such as migraine or heat waves, but also for depression.
The latter is a significant risk-increasing factor from the point of view of business assurances, not their predecessors.
In order to obtain and process data, special companies have been invited to collect and process data, and before receiving the necessary information from the medicinal products, please refer to the patient.
They are now obliged by the authorities even though they have not been punished for their eviction.
Some companies are already processing the results of laboratory tests and are connected to drug use data, thus providing a more accurate picture of patients' health status.
A number of companies add data, and monitoring the use will be increasingly difficult.
There is a special health data protection law, but it only applies to healthcare providers and insurance providers.
The Congress has before it a legislative proposal which also confers control on the authorities over the data services companies.
Dick Richard concludes that this is not enough: therefore he has developed his program that would contribute to the data transmission.
Another question is how the person concerned can refuse the contribution, and in particular the insurers are not bound by a contract with it.
So the guys are still on the way to the rock well-being.
Global Marseille Summit
Making trade easier for the European Union and India
As the European Union and India's trading partners have been engaged, this issue has also been governed by the agenda of the 19th anniversary of the global problem.
Today there will also be French Indian holes where it will mainly be about nuclear cooperation.
The European Union recognises that India has a high democratic power to give greater attention to international affairs, but it has not yet been able to reach a common name for the Member States to support the Permanent Member of India in the UN Security Council.
This question was not raised in Marseille yesterday, and it was almost nine o'clock in the morning.
Mr. Nicolas Sarkozy, President of France, as President of the Union, as well as President of the Commission José Manuel Barroso, and Mr. Javier Solana, Prime Minister of Indian Affairs Manmohan Singh, who also agreed to delay trade for five years, namely, hundreds of millions of euros.
In view of the 25 billion increase in sales between 2000 and 2007, this is not too ambitious.
In this respect, the second civil aviation agreement with India, which may also be a source of air traffic, has been legally incorporated into the future.
India wishes to sign a free trade agreement with the Union by the end of 2009.
Sarkozy promised to speed up the deal.
The aim is to balance the fact that while the EU India's first trading partner, Renewalhi only plays its ninth role in the EU's partners.
The castle has focused attention on global affairs.
The situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan, as well as terrorism, has been overhauled in all its forms and has been accelerated by the United Nations Conference.
The completion of the Doha trade revolution was also slowed down, although both of them had a large share in the educational failure.
The EU has confirmed that in addition to its energy and climate programme, it would like to reduce waste emissions by at least half by 2020.
India also agreed that the future climate conference should be linked to a global agreement and that the production of greenhouse gases should be measured by five percent by 2050.
I would also like to stop the increase in food prices, and they supported the challenge of international interest in the review of the financial crisis.
Today, the Indian Prime Minister is going to France’s capital, where the second meeting is about the peaceful use of nuclear energy.
In Paris, they are confident that the French companies will earn hundreds of billions of euros of credit for building Indian nuclear reactors.
According to the Agency's reports, the agreement would last 15 years.
More than three hundred Italian bookmakers in Frankfurt
The Italian exporters are represented in a strong field at the International Library of Frankfurt.
More than three hundred Italians will be present at the most widely available international contractors' legal meeting, at the 60th Buchmesse.
The Interim International Library of Frankfurt is expected to hold 7000 exhibits from 101 countries, on a four-foot base of 171,790, where more than 403,000 books will be shown.
The Italian Government, Francesco Maria Giro, the Ministry of Cultural Affairs and Activities, represents the state-owned position of the Italian Ministry of Culture and Activities: Italy is the same, by establishing a single Italy Point, with 264 square metres of exhibition area.
The holiday opening will be followed by the information on the location, trends and appearances of the Italian bookstore in the "Room Structure" of Buchmesse 5.0 Pavilion.
According to the data, the Italian retail market continues to reduce the share of foreign contractors, particularly in the area of adult and youth publications.
Found a year's missing billionaire, Steve Fosset's plane.
The remains of the billionaire's Steve Fossett aircraft were found, which appeared on 3 September 2007.
It was located on a 3,000 - foot - high hilltop overlooking the Sierra Nevada mountain range between California and Nevada, near Mammoth Lakes.
No human remains were found inside the plane.
John Anderson, Madera's sheriff, has all the doubts that we still have: "We sent out a team after finding out the flight situation, and now we can be sure that it's about the machine that Steve Fossett flew off on the day he disappeared," he reported in a press release.
The sheriff further confirmed that no human remains were found on the plane or in the surrounding area.
The 63 billion years were announced dead in February.
The U.S. Transport Safety Authority (NTSB) announced that several hours after the discovery of the tyres, an investigation committee was asked to identify the engine and found that it was actually about Bellanca 8kcab, which appeared on 3 September 2007, on the day Fosset launched a three-hour flight from the Nebian Yerington.
At the California level yesterday, not far from the country border, a couple found Fossett near the home of Mammoth Lakes.
Two, a lawyer named Fosset, who was appointed by the Illinois Association Air Force, some cash and a pool.
After one month's disappearance, they gave up their search for Fosset.
The billionaire has set up a number of pieces that have led you into history.
In 2002, for the sixth attempt, he managed to fly the earth for the first time: two weeks of private flights.
Three years later, he flew off the ground without a landing.
Several records include the overflight of the Andoks at a height of 15445 metres, which was completed by a second pilot.
GLK, amplifier advertising
An unusual, yet determined, formal, well-defined favorite therapy, with large surfaces and lattices.
In a few words, both Mercedes-Benz's most recent "territory of the company", by which the German car industry tried to bring fresh air to the market.
That is why the traditional content of the presentation from October 17 will also be surprising and unusual for the SUV GLK launch campaign in Mercedes-Benz.
The same advertising software that tries to show a new vehicle is still alive with an unknown media communication tool, including 3D posters that have not been used in Italy.
The Oriyasplaka action, which is from three stages, will be governed by the central purchase route of Milan, Corso Comót .
This new type of media communication starts at the first stage with the introduction of the vehicle coverage, which will be available in the form of the new SUV, with the help of special channels distributed around Corso Como, almost in real sizes and three-dimensional form.
The viewer of the picture will feel like the car will get out of the plate.
Thereafter, using innovative Elumina8 technology, the new GLK can be seen in detail in order to form a single image.
Without a doubt, Mercedes with this promotion is trying to put something new into the advertising world of the car industry.
Is it possible to raise the interest of the low-cost buyers?
I'll show you who the Italian football team is.
Triveno's kids, they're probably getting rid of them.
But who is this 150-200 boys and girls who are now ashamed of all of Italy? The members of the "Ultras Italia" group who have been following the election for years and who, in fact, has not yet caused too much trouble.
They've never met the enemy's surgeons.
The team's working on it.
The main organizers are coming from Trivento.
From Verona, Padua, Triesz and Udin.
These were joined by smaller groups from Campania and Puglia in Sofia (in fact only a few units).
Olasz had been released from prisons in which the parents of the mourners were buried: on Saturday they were taken away so that they could not be identified.
They're following the example of English surgeons.
In Bulgaria, they were looking at a true national team of surgeons with the prints of Levski.
The Italian Football Association has awarded 144 tickets to Italian cruisers. These were names, so it was easier to check the team.
The Ministry of the Interior also checked everyone: there was no one who would have been dealt with in the process, no one who would have been prevented from attending the stadium.
Four Italian swine fevers, who have a prize for the robbery, have been denied the ticket and exit.
The Ministry of the Interior is currently waiting for reports from the Finnish police and will then take the necessary measures: those who have been arrested or identified during the siege can also be sentenced to five years' imprisonment.
It is an international ban on visiting not only Italian but all of Europe's stadiums.
So our football team can't even put our feet in the single football game.
Good luck.
But we also need to keep in mind that the missing are found among the followers of Christ, that is, that of this almost a hundred others join.
"You have to put this fire out immediately, you don't have to save someone who behaves like this," the Ministry of the Environment said.
So it's better if we keep our eyes open, mainly because it's close to Wednesday's choice day in Lecce.
In Puglia there is the same little oil that supports Italian ultrasounds.
Tomorrow, the Supervisory Service will be held and the Sports Safety Safety Committee, which may also be included in a part of the internal security service, will be involved in secret services dealing with school behaviour.
"Duce-Duce's scant and silent war under the Italian heavens?
This led to the idea of possibly unfortunate Domenico Mazzilli, who was named after the Ministry of the Environment for a few weeks (the post by Francesco Tagliente, and before he was arrested by Felice Ferrizzi).
Mazzilli had previously served as chief of police, Triesz, whose city has been operating since 2002 with a seat in support of the Ultras Italia team.
What Mazzilli stands for is that in Bulgaria, it's not safe to live up to the Ducét, but even from this attitude of the 150-200 succulents was shameful.
I'm not sociologist, I've done the first person to watch the service, but the crime has to be handled in the country where the prosecution is located.
So far, this group hasn't caused a problem, but we need to examine exactly what happened and take it seriously.
But let's talk a little bit about the collapse of the Italian heavens: there's no crime, but if I say so freely, there can't be any good name..."
