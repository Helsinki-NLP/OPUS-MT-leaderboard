The Welsh National Assembly members are worried about 'beautiful like drawing' trees.
Some MEPs are surprised to change their name to MWPs (Worse Parliamentary Member).
The situation arose as a result of plans to change the name of Parliament to the Welsh Parliament.
Members of political parties are concerned that they may be laughing.
A member of the Parliament stated that his organization was worried about "the meeting with Twp and Pwp. "
For readers other than Welsh, twp means stupid, pwp.
A Welsh MP said that the organization was "not happy" and proposed alternative programmes.
A Welsh security officer stated that his organization was about to change its "openness" attitude, but he noted that a short step from MWP to drawing wood was just on the head of the system.
Under this kind of word, the voice of Welsh characters is similar to the sound of Jack's letters.
Parliamentary committees are currently drafting legislation to propose a change of name, which states: "The final decision on any description of the name of a member of Parliament is of course decided by the members themselves."
In 2017, "The Welsh Government Act" granted the Welsh Parliament the right to change its name.
In June, the Committee announced the public's results of the proposal, and found that public support was widely supported by the House of Lords as the Welsh Parliament.
With regard to MPs' names, the Committee will focus on Members of the Welsh Parliament or WMPs, but MWP will receive the highest support in the public sector.
Parliamentarians clearly suggest that they choose, but their efforts to reach consensus may cause Parliament's President to feel pain, and he plans to submit a draft legislative amendment in a few weeks.
The legislation on reform will include its changes in the way it deals with the way it works with parliaments, including the rules governing the abolition of membership and the design of the system of committees.
In the debate legislative process, parliamentarians will finally address what should be called the issue.
The Macedonians filed a referendum on the change in the name of the country.
The voter will decide whether to change the name of the country to "The Republic of Northern Macedonia".
The establishment of a referendum to resolve disputes with the Grecian people for decades, the province of Macedonia, Greece, was also known as the province of Macedonia.
For a long time, Saudi Arabia has believed that its representatives of the northern part of the country resided in their territory and repeatedly opposed the accession of the country to the EU and North York.
Macedonian President George Ivanov, who changed his name from public polls, said that he would not vote.
However, including those in the House of Lords, who are in the public favour of Prime Minister Solantev, believe that the change is only due to accession to the EU and the North.
The hour of the St. Martin Church in Harlin's Church has come to an end
Mr. Adams said: "From history, I have spoken to the elderly, each corner has one bar and the same church."
"And at home, they're both hungry."
He says that alcohol waste can be understood.
He said, "And the family's social way of life is different."
"The bar is no longer the place where everyone goes."
With regard to the church, he was concerned that the money he spent on sale would not seem to lead to continue as expected, "he would soon return to his place of origin."
He added that the church could be replaced by a apartment building and that people in the apartment were not willing to help the rest of the city.
"The vast majority of the people who bought the apartment in this building are white people," he said, "so the church will soon close because most people who move into the apartment are not very likely to be members of the church."
The two churches were built by whites before the Black City community in Harlin in 1870 and after the decade.
The first white health council to move from the 20th century to the 1930s.
A black person who has been working around for a week will have all the rights to build.
John Howard Johnson, the leader of the Church of St. Martin, led a campaign against the 125th Street retailer, a major mining town in the district of Harlin, who refused to hire or hire black people.
A fire in 1939 caused serious damage to the building, but when Father Johnson's church residents developed reconstruction plans, he made this clock.
Father Johnson, the successor of St. Martin's Church, is Professor David Johnson himself called this journal "the hour of the harvest".
In July, an expert in the drama was also known as "Cultural Cup" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
Professor Tijuni Ng of the University of Michigan also noted that this world's first concert was held by a black musician, Dionysius A. Linde, who moved to the church 18 years ago.
Mr. Melissa said that St. Martin's church replaced him.
In the past few months, the Church of St. Martin has been a collection of stories about the construction of teachers and contractors, a set of non-religious leaders of the church, and a set of churches.
The church councils will be composed of non-religious leaders - who wrote in July, concerned about the establishment of the "Church Law" Committees of the Church, and the Board of Trustees of the Church will not participate in the construction and contractors sent to the Embassies.
A friend of mine complains about the lack of transparency in the church.
The 13-year-old boy in Gaza was hit by a shark when he was caught by a shark.
Officially, a 13-year-old boy was attacked and injured on Saturday when he opened his day-to-day fishing in San Francisco.
The attack took place at 7:00 a.m. near the Becken seaport of Encinitas.
Chadhamel told the KSWB TV in Santiago that he and his friend had been drinking water for about half an hour on Saturday morning, when he heard this boy get well and then threw a boat off the same group and helped get him out of the water.
Hamelkana, who at first thought he was caught only in the wild, but then he realized that he was in a lot of trouble, 'I'm hurt!
I'm hurt!'
His entire bone was pulled out, "Hamelton, he noticed a boy coming by the side of a boy.
"I'll tell everyone to get out of the water: 'There's fish inside!' Hamel added.
The boy was transferred to the Redi Child Hospital in Santiago, which is listed as a dangerous situation.
The species of fish that caused this attack are unknown.
A number of weeks ago, a fish was found in the area, but it was not a dangerous species.
Jules adds half the victim's injuries.
For the purposes of investigation and security, the official has closed the 48-hour route from the Boto Sea of Casabland to the Swami Lake of Esinitas.
There are more than 135 species of fish in the area, but most are considered to be safe.
Seinsbury is planning to enter the British American market.
Seinsbury is currently working with Boja, the supermarket and the Debneham War, and is developing a beautiful way of business and equipping professional assistants.
The market continues to grow as part of the 28 billion United States market for real-time promotion, while the market continues to grow, and more beautiful acquisitions will take place in 11 shops throughout the country, and if it proves successful, it will run in more shops next year.
While investing in beauty, the supermarket is looking for ways to use the previously charged television, microbodies and domestic computers.
Seinsberg indicated that it would double the size of its beautiful products and reach 3,000 species, including the cards of Louis, Jesse, Dishman and Dr. Magua.
Europe, the current series of products of bees and bees will also receive more space, similar to that of the card sector in stores such as Bojo.
The supermarket will re-launch a series of speculative products to make most products belong to a friendly type of food - a little more and more of the needs of young people.
In addition, the oil retailer's Finnish store will try to operate in two ports in Seinsberg, one of which will be opened on the week of the first store in Creeden, south of London, and the second half of this year in Selina Ock, Berlin.
The change in purchases of low-cost food on the Internet and on the day-to-day shifts in local relief shops means that the supermarket needs to do more work to convince visitors.
Chief Executive Officer McCuppe of Seinsberg said that after a more service and non-food-consumer attempt to keep the chain over the market, Aldi and Lidder will become more and more like a shopping mall.
After two years in Seinsburg, after the two binders had been acquired, Agosolitz had been established in hundreds of shops and had moved into a building. The company suggested that the sale of the store was more profitable than it had been before.
The attempt to change the door of the department of beauty and medicine in the pre-city area failed.
In the early 21st century, Seinsberg tried to establish a joint venture with Boje, but there was a conflict between the shares of the Bojo shops in the supermarket and the cooperation between the two sides ended.
Three years ago, in Seinsburg, the owner of its 281-storey apartheid factory, Seresio, sold it to the Jadeveloppe Hotel.
He said that Lloyd would play a role in the design and add a series of protective cards to the four-door portals, including the Labyrinth.
Seinsbury Business Manager Pauls-Hix said: "I have changed my moods and feelings on the way to improve the customer's environment.
My employer asked me to provide advice to his colleagues who had been trained in specialized training at the same time.
My card series is designed to meet all kinds of needs, and the environment and the easy position of the customer means that we are surrounded by a beautiful place of interest and that our family has an interesting purpose to challenge the old way of feeding. "
Peter Jones withdrew from the 11 million-dollar deal in Hollyville.
After the new contract with the Marshal and the independent TV show, Hollyvillei, who was the director of the television show, resigned from his business in his way of life with 11,000,000 British dollars.
Willoby is a homeless man and his family living with his wife, Kattroy.
Two of them had been sold as a gift card from Gwynnispatrol.
This 37-year-old "Handy" guy on Instagram announced he'd leave.
Hollyvillee recently retired from his career in the life-cycle of his life, focusing on a new security contract signed with the Marshals and the independent TV show, and ordered the three husbands of the "Steers" St. Peter Squadcher.
It is reported that on Monday, at a press conference at the headquarters of the Royal Bank of Belarus, a woman named a television station admitted her new contract - worth up to 150 million pounds - means that she would no longer have enough time to enter into her home with her partner, Carlos "very angry about it".
It is thought that it will bring about 1100 million pounds of wealth back to Veloby.
When 37-year-old Veloby announced on Instagram that he would leave Trolley when he was on his way from England to his vacation home.
There was a message: " So far, the first mission of Trollis Holly.
This will shape his long-term future, which will last for decades to come.
His decision to leave was surprising to everyone.
People can believe what happened on Tuesday, leaving the city too close.
The capital of Morocco has a warehouse full of goods ready for sale."
Experts believe that, as one of the most valuable stars in the UK, the departure of the owner of the "Court" could lead to the loss of millions of companies this evening, as the company's investment in products such as clothing and home furnishings is very large and there may be further delays in the city.
And it may mean the end of a long period of friendship.
The mother of three small friends Willowby and his husband, Dankod, have been close to Jones for ten years and his wife, Tarakap.
Veloby was established in 2016 with Kappy, a 52-year-old company, and joined him as Director in March.
For the first time, Jones had a 40 per cent share of the TV company in Bodden.
Veloby will become the M&S card agent and will replace Antmepalin as the "I'm a person" television director.
A newsman from close to Jones said last night, "I would never discuss his business. "
"And then I got into a love stream."
He joked that he would be criticized by the media because he declared himself "non-president" as well as the attitude of Korean leaders.
How much did President Tranquo give up?
Tran has been used to simulate the sound of "the news director."
"I'll give up anything."
He noted that China was interested in the second meeting following the first meeting held in Singapore in June, which was a major step towards nuclear non-nuclearization in Korea.
But the non-nuclear talks are in the process of breaking down.
After the Singapore Summit in June three months, the Korean Supreme diplomatic officer Leigh was speaking to world leaders at the United States Congress on Saturday, and he was reluctant to accept any form of speech. The United Nations General Assembly indicated that Korea had not seen the "responsibility" of the United States' early disarmament action.
On the contrary, he noted that the United States was continuing its sanctions in order to maintain sanctions.
Tranpe took a more positive view of his meeting talks.
"I'm doing good on Korean issues," he said.
"I'm going to fight with Korea.
Millions of people will be killed.
And my house is very good."
He stated that he had achieved a positive outcome in his efforts to improve his relationship with Kinyon – ending fire tests, helping release persons, and repatriating American soldiers to the United States.
He was also protected by a variety of practices he had taken during his discussion with Finn.
"It's too easy to be president, but it's not easy to get a million people into this underground training facility without trying to get into it, and then make about 200 people stand at the edge," said Tranpus, pointing to the crowd in front of him.
The Indian Ocean and the earthquake destroyed an island and resulted in hundreds of deaths.
For example, after an earthquake on the island of Liu, foreign non-governmental organizations were informed that they did not need it.
The Ouija board has more than 10 per cent of the population displaced but has not announced national disasters, which is a prerequisite for international assistance.
Ms. Sammy said, "Unfortunately, in many cases, he has made it very clear that he does not ask for international assistance, so it would be challenging," she said.
Despite the fact that a group of children were being formed in Paul, he had not yet established whether foreign workers could work locally.
Mr. Sudopo, a national disaster agency speaker, said that members of Indonesia were assessing the situation in Paju to determine whether international agencies were allowed to make sacrifices for assistance.
In Indonesia, the country's natural anger is still insufficient.
Although building a sea resort in Asia, it is not common on other coastal lines.
Despite the fact that the warning has come into effect, Paju is a clear warning to the seabed, one of the causes of the loss of life.
At best, travel between many islands in Indonesia is challenging.
Natural disasters are more complex.
A medical ship on the island of Ouija board is on its way to Paulu, but it will take at least three days to reach a new disaster site.
President Sokoviero will improve the infrastructure destroyed by Indonesia as the central element of his election activity and invest large amounts of money on roads and roads.
However, the lack of funds has always been difficult for Mr. Soko ' s Government because he will meet next year.
Mr. Zhoko, co-founding the pressure of religious tensions from Indonesia, has already adopted a more conservative form of faith.
As a result of the use of swords in the streets of Christian and Muslim groups, more than 1,000 people were killed and millions were forced to leave their homes.

The Crenville image of Parliament was the most recent event of "reforming history"
It is more symbolic for the dispersion of many British cultures and religious art to believe in his burning Taliban.
However, Crewville's suggestion is that Mr. Crick's advice is "foolish" and "the intention to change history."
"The removal of Oliverville from Westphalia as a goal is inevitable in the current debate.
The worship of saints in the British internal war was neither directed by Creenville nor by him.
Or the wrong Crenwell will be killed because of what his grandfather Thomas did in the last century.
Sir William Hamo Sonicrovt has confirmed the 19th century's view of Crenwell's painting and has been a part of the history of people who deserve to be admired.
Mr. Gordon Smith told him on Sunday: "Many people specialize in what they think will be the way against the outside pressure of the Crewville Council at the end of the 19th century, of course he did. "
In fact, this group is a very precise statement that remains the subject of post-historic discussion.
A certain set of conflicts in the 17th century has led to the development of our country, and Creeville has been a representative of the other side of the conflict at the time.
Its success as a public protection is also worthy of our attention and memory. "
A Chinese farmer was killed by a cat.
According to the local media report, a farmer in the southern part of China was killed by a dog in the market.
According to the report on Sunday morning, the man's name "Shu" was found in a market in six water cities in the state of Ouija board, where he died in a severe earthquake.
On May 30, 2005, a dog farmer in the West Bank of China, China, was preparing an injection vaccine in a dog's feed site.
He was going to sell 15 pieces of meat to his cousins from the village of Junun for three weeks.
The next morning, his brother discovered his body, and he found the door of the dog's back door opened.
According to him, there's blood in the dog's mouth.
According to the report, the law doctors confirmed that this head of 550 tons of chickens died of foot-and-mouth disease.
"On the night of your report, call the dead's brothers to be born," my brother's feet were amputated to the flesh.
The surveillance footage shows that someone entered the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday morning.
About an hour later, his body was discovered.
The dog that killed a man's name is not only owned by someone or his brother.
The market administrator told the news during the night that this giant cat had been arrested in order to prevent it from attacking others, while the police gathered evidence at the scene.
Some families and market managers say they're complaining about some dead people.
There's no record of this attack on humans, though.
In 2016 a cat attacked a woman and her husband in a farm in the state of Masao-Seare, where her husband was seriously injured.
Earlier than 10 years ago, a 650-pound cat had pushed a Welsh farmer down the ground until the farmer's wife had pulled the cat off her head.
After the meal of a farmer in a Russian state in 2012, a farmer from the province of Manitobara and CBC will usually not show aggressiveness, but the smell of blood will be as good as a guide line.
"He just wanted to play.
He's just a dog, a wonderful dog... and they're not a killer.
You just need to show him proper respect," he said.

Explosive floods are likely to occur because of the nature of the dispersion of hot water in situations where conditions are deteriorating.
It is strongly recommended that we do not travel to the desert by accident under heavy rains.
The torrential rains will lead to floods of rivers, which will lead to floods and hurricanes.
The low air pressure on land will be brought to a high level in the southern coastal region of the country.
The amount of rain can be up to half an inch, leading to small rocks and narrow roads.
The current rains will be the beginning of the rain season in the area.

Frank and his friend Democrats confirmed him by the speech of the MP Chris Cuenns.
After speaking with Kön and a number of parliamentarians, Fréck made a decision.

The Macedonians filed a referendum on whether to change the name of the country.
On Sunday, the Macedonian people held a referendum to decide whether to change their country's name as a "Northern Macedonian Community", which would resolve the conflict with Greece for decades. Greece had already prevented them from joining the EU and North York.
Greece has a province called Macedonia, which he maintains that its name is a representative of the northern Hemisphere and decides whether to join the North and the EU.
The new name proposed by the two Governments reached an agreement in June on the basis of which it was proposed, but the anti-nationalist thought that this change would destroy the ethnicity of the majority of the people of Macedonia.
President Olki Ivanov stated that he would not vote in public and that the opposition movement would question whether the voting rate could reach at least 50 per cent of the effective public investment required.
The issue of citizens ' vote: " Do you support the accession of the North European Union and the EU and accept agreements with Greece? "
In the context of the change in the position of Prime Minister Zhujev, one of the countries that came out of Macedonia after the dissolution of the Yugoslavia, the system is considered to be worth paying for the damage suffered by the system in order to support institutions such as the EU and the North.
79-year-old Oliver George Yeevska, in Skopje, said: "I am today voting for the country's future and voting for young people in Macedonia so that they can live freely in the EU's protection, as this means that my life will be safer for all."
While law enforcement is binding, there are enough members of parliament to say that they will follow the outcome of the vote and make it decisive.
More than two thirds of parliaments need to be renamed.
The National Electoral Commission will state that no report on irregular conduct is available at 1 p.m..
However, the voting rate was 16 per cent, while the vote rate for the last parliamentary election in 2016 was 34 per cent, at which time 66 per cent of the voters were registered.

"I live in a poor country, but I have respect for it.
If he does not want me to be a Macedonian, I can ask for help from other countries, such as China and Russia, to become part of Oia's integration.
Prime Minister Véyev said that accession to North York would bring the necessary investment for Macedonia, with over 20 per cent unemployment rate in Macedonia.
"I believe that the majority of people will succeed because more than 80% of my citizens support the EU and the North," Kev said after the vote.
He said, "The outcome of "the future" would be a guarantee of my future."
A public-interest survey conducted by the Macedonian Institute of Policy last week shows that between 30 and 43 per cent of voters will participate in the polls below the required voting rates.
Another study conducted by the Macedonian TV series Tealma shows that 57 per cent of the visitors are planning to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70 per cent would vote.

In the middle of the game, before the competition started, Argentina received a football game.
He ran through three B.C.E. and then walked to the airstrip.
Aguillo found himself surrounded by four battalions.
He went through a backyard and went over a number of people in the Brayton district.
Then he'll take the ball to the left, get to Sterlyn.

Tranpe's meeting in West Virginia.
When the President spoke of the importance of the vote of the Common Party in the mid-term election, he referred to the situation of the candidates for the Supreme Court, Jérét Cavano.
"All I do will be threatened in November.
One of the most important choices in my life was five weeks away.
This system is very, very important -- I'm in the election, but I'm in the election, so I'm fighting for a good candidate," he said.
Tranunpur continues: "You're in the middle of this very, terrible democracy movement, and you're in the middle of it.
He is determined to withdraw his authority through any necessary means, and you are in danger of falling down.
He doesn't care about harming the side, he doesn't care if he gets power and control over the side of death, but he wants power and control, and I don't want to take it over."
He said that the mandate of the Democratic Party was "restraint and deterrence".
He said, "In the last four days, you can get to this point," and he called the Democrats "frequency, anger, contempt and falsehood."
He mentioned that the Court of Justice of the House of Commons would be nominated by the First Democratic Party, a representative of the parliament, Diana Amistan, and caused a great deal of confusion.
"Do you remember his answer?"
What are you exposed to by the system?
No, no, no.
No problem, no, no problem, I'm like a -- really closed language -- I've seen the most closed language."
The Labour Party is no longer a large church.
He cannot be patient with those who tell him what he thinks.
It was not unusual when I was forced to vote in the local party.
In fact, in a number of parliamentarians, I am the latest one who has been told not to be welcomed - because I express my opinion.
My Parliamentary colleague, Mr. Ryan, has been treated similarly because he has decided to try and oppose anti-Semitism.
As far as I am concerned, the House of Lords has condemned me to not agree with the view of Jeremy Colton.
With regard to the importance of responsible economic policies, with regard to national security, to European security, and to similar issues, Jeremy did not agree with former leaders.
"I wish that the meeting would be inclusive and effective" was announced at the 5th Eastern London Labour Party meeting on Sunday.
In my eight-year term of office of local parliamentarians, the GC meeting on Friday evening was like this.
Unfortunately, today, the foundation of many of the meetings, "best, greener and more" political commitments, has been forgotten, if they really started.
More and more clearly, the same views are not tolerated within the working party and each opinion must be ruled out on the basis of whether or not the party's leadership is guided.
This situation began several years after Jeremy became a leader, because I thought that my colleagues who had similar political views were beginning to expect me to turn 180 degrees into an independent position in the EU single market.
Every time I make public statements - in fact, it's not important - there will be a vote on social media, calling for the removal of elections and political dividends, I shouldn't join the labour force.
And this uniquely complicated thing happened to me.
In fact, I know I'm happier than a colleague because my argument is often political.
I am very afraid of a professional spirit and determination with which he daily faces sexual discrimination or the humiliation of racism, but he will never give up.
This political era is one of the most disappointing, and the extent of damage has been normalized.
Jeremy Kolkan called this week that the Labour Party should develop a culture of tolerance.
In fact, I no longer associate with a broad church, following changes in every "untrusted" movement or electoral rule, and the party becomes more tolerant.
In the past two years, I have been given many suggestions, and I have been encouraged to do something low, to make a big statement, and then I'll "do it."
But I don't want to get involved in politics.
32 years ago, I joined a small student who, because of the absence of the Government of Zülle, had been in my joint school and since I joined the working party, I have been trying to get the best public service I need since I became a member of the government.
I will never hide my political position, including in the last election.
In the eastern part of Noden, there is no doubt about my political position and the differences between me and the current leadership.
With regard to those who are motivated by a five-week campaign, I just want to say that when countries are trying to get rid of Europe, it will damage families, businesses and public services, I can understand the point of spending time and energy on the faithful issues of my leaders.
But in fact, I want to send information to a non-computer and to my voters, regardless of whether he is a non-computer: I am proud to be able to serve you, and I assure you that no matter what the threat of rejection or political rights I have to act in accordance with my belief that you are in the best interests of all people.

El38 - 17 Melros: A failed Elden
The next two attempts may lead to a different outcome, but there is no doubt that El has won a victory in the beautiful Tanut supercomputer contest.
He lived in the capital, the only failed team in the 10 teams.
In the end, he won excellent defenses, as well as a better chance of winning the Master's win, and he enjoyed the privilege of training Peter Mucchi.
"I've been tested so far in the race and I'm still not successful, so I have to be happy," he said.
Melrose's Ron Christiana said: "He's going to win El, he's doing better than I can. "
Grant Anderson, a 14-minute attempt by Frédéric Cremod, led to Al first, but he was fired by the Army's chief of the Soviet Union for a short period of time by the army, which allowed Melross to take over the air on a number of people, and Jason Baggett took an undistributed attempt.
Cremo used a bit of a ball as a priority for El, and then when it ended in half, he was able to do it with a single attempt, and when he rested on the middle floor, he would replace Al with 17-5.
But Melros was wrong in the next half, and Patrick Anderson's attempt to break the gap to 5 minutes was broken by Baggett.
After a long time after the serious injury suffered by Ruarid Note, El was again led by Cremod, following further attempts by Taford McDoor.
After being punished by the sword, General Bryel McFerson, Melros reimbursed the troops, and after severe pressure was put to the test by Bruus Colven.
The master's team returned, however, when Starlan Harrison was punished without a ballast with clemour outside the ball line, and McFerson was assigned to the rear of the previous Algebra.
At the base of David and Amsterran, Cremo was placed on the scene at the scene of the Gallo-Royal. After his fifth attempt, Cremo was reappointed almost once again from the start of the game.
The "Still Game" movie star seems to be ready to start a new career in the food industry.
Still Game appears to be ready to enter the military hotel industry and has previously been appointed as director of a well-equipped food company.
The 56-year-old actor, Jack Lewis, played in a popular BBC show that he was the editor of, along with a long-standing concert with, uh, Greg Hemshill.
This will be the last day of the ninth season of the show on the upcoming joint announcement, followed by the life of Kilnan after the two-year design of Cregrand.
On the basis of the official record list, he is the manager of the Alf Moren limited company.
The actor refused to comment on the story, but the "Sugrene Sun" reporters indicated that Kierna wanted to participate in the "Watering" in Grasco.
"The ocean is mine": Bolivia, which is surrounded by deserts, hopes that the Tribunal will reopen its path to the Pacific
The seamen are under surveillance at the command of the Navy, which is located in Rabas.
A blue flag on the top of the public building.
"The law of the sea is the law of the sea for all of me.
Restore is the responsibility."
The desire to travel on the Pacific again, under the Bolivian countryside, seems to have been like a life-saving memory of the seabed in the 19th century's bloody conflict.
This wish may have reached the highest level over the past few decades, as Bolivia will decide on 1 October following the five years of the International Tribunal for Foreign Affairs.
A Bolivian diplomatic officer, Robert Carlsadian, said: "Bolivia has a sense of humor, of organization and spirit, of course it's a pleasure to look forward to the outcome."
The whole country will have many Bolivians taking over the decision of the International Court of Justice through the large screen, hoping that the Hague International Arbitration Tribunal will support Bolivia's claim - which has been suspended for decades - Chile is responsible for ratifying an outlet for Bolivia's jurisdiction.
Evo Moreles, this powerful Bolivian country president, is facing a major election war that last year is full of disputes, and there are also many decisions on Monday.
He once swore at the end of August: "I will be able to return to the Pacific again."
However, some analysts believe that the Tribunal will not make a decision that will benefit Bolivia, even if there is no change.
This position in the United States institution of the Netherlands governs Chile's jurisdiction, and it is determined that it will not turn around to the possible outcome of the conversation.
Paz Zarate, an international legal expert in Chile, made a decision just six months after the final debate, explaining the situation "and not complicated".
And in the past four years, not only has the majority of countries moved to Bolivia, but it may have been blocked by this plan.
Zárate says: "The Bolivian Government has seized this problem in the sea."
He believes that Moralez's challenge has been justified in killing all the good intentions of the rest of the Chilean people.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to talk at some point, but it will be very difficult to continue the discussion after the trial.
In 1962 until now, both countries have joined diplomatic officers.
The representative of Bolivia in the Hague Court of Justice, former President Eduardo Rodríguez Bellsa, and the Tribunal, was one of the ways in which it was decided to act at an unusual speed.
He spoke on Sunday, which would lead Bolivia to a very difficult opportunity to open a new series of Chile-related talks and a "co-interested debate for 139 years".
Calzadira, one of the most welcome presidents in Latin America, still claims that Moreles is politically dependent on the issue of the sea.
He adds: "Bolivia will never give up its right to the Pacific."
"The next decision gave me a chance to understand why I needed to go away."
Korea claims that nuclear weapons will not happen unless the United States can trust it.
The President of the Republic of Korea always said that if his country did not trust him, he would be the first to eliminate nuclear weapons.
On Saturdays, Lee spoke at a convention in the United States.
He asked the United States to continue its commitment to the two leaders at the Singapore Summit.
He published this debate because the U.S. National Council of State in Singapore and Kinyen, Korea, appears to have been reopening the nuclear diplomacy that entered the Senate three months later.
Leigh, thought that continued sanctions and the United States refused to declare that the end of the Korean War would be possible for Korea to become an "ideal" place.
If peace has not been exercised in the first place, the United States has a cautious attitude towards the declaration of consent.
King and the United States both President Donald Tranpe wish to have a second meeting.
However, it appears that the country of Korea is the only way to guarantee its own security, and it is generally doubtful whether it will be willing to give up nuclear weapons.
The Bupeo project will be held next month in the spring and will be prepared for the second Winter Summit.
Paris's clothing shows the latest flow of large hats, i.e. entering the market next to you.
If you want to fill the area where you hide your hat or if you want to complete the sun, you will not be able to do so again.
The designer, William and Tom Bron, introduced a series of S.S.19s of large-scale superpowered chips on the T-Tai, which led to a great discovery of the abbreviation of the week in Paris.
This summer, an inconsistencies in Ins, and the designer will send his inspiration to the table.
The most outstanding work of the Waldensian slave is a large blue hat, a leather ring, on the head of the model.
Other supersize products include silk, which is covered with silk, and even one piece of paper -- but it is not designed to protect your head.
Tom Bron also shows that the series of cross-sections is unique – that it is a good way to get the Holy Scripture.
Many of the five-coloured, six-colored surfaces are on the top of the mouth, like Hanniy Lecter has been wearing a similar high-level watch.

John Edwa: Language skills that are important to the world's citizens
The segregation school in Sugland maintains an outstanding academic performance record, while the record continues to be followed by another great test in 2018, which is only shared by individuals and groups in sports, art, music, and other organizational efforts.
There are some 30,000 students in the school throughout Scotland, represented by the SCIS Committee of the Single School (SCIS), who are committed to providing the best quality services for their parents and students.
The aim of an independent school is to help students adapt to higher education, to the work they choose, and to become a world citizen.
As an educational portal for the design and implementation of the school plan, I believe that today’s language is still an acceptable and needed one in school.
Nilson Mandrakan: "If you talk to each other in a language that you understand, the content of the conversation will be left in his head.
If you talk to him in his language, the contents of the conversation will touch his heart."
This is a strong reminder that when I want to build a relationship with people from other countries, I cannot rely on English.
Since last year's trial, the highest rate of transition in the language of the independent school has been on the list.
A higher level of A is reached in a total of 60 per cent of students learning foreign languages.
Data collected from 74 SCIS-based schools show that 70 per cent of students obtained higher A levels in Chinese sciences, and 70 per cent of students in German, and 60 per cent of students in French and 60 per cent in Spanish.
It shows that the single school in Sugland will support the important skills needed for children and adolescents in the future.
The language is selected as a primary learning course and has the same focus as the STEM (Scientific, Technical, Engineering, and Mathematical) program in individual schools.
In 2014, the British Labour and Skills Commission found that 17 per cent of the problems arising from the lack of language skills were caused by the lack of job vacancies in the capital.
To prepare young people for future work, therefore, language skills are increasingly important.
As more future job opportunities require multiple languages, skills are very important in a globalized world.
Regardless of one's choice of employment, if he can learn a second language, he will benefit from the skills of his partner in the future.
It is possible to communicate directly with foreigners, and it is the first time in the struggle to get to know people who speak multiple languages.
According to YeuGov 2013, a public survey conducted by more than 4,000 British adults showed that 70 percent of people were unable to engage in foreign-language dialogues. French is the only language of more than two percent of the users and up to 15 percent of them.
That is why, for the sake of raising children today, investment in language is very important.
In particular in developing economies, having multiple languages can give children a better opportunity to work more valuablely.
In Scotland, the language of each school is different.
Some schools will focus on more traditional languages, while others will be viewed as the most important language for Britain by 2020, such as Chinese or Japanese.
In any case, your teenage daughter's interest is that she has a wide range of languages available in an independent school, and there are experts in the area who are working as a teacher.
The Swedish independent school is committed to providing a learning environment for children and equips children with the skills they need to succeed, no matter what the future may be.
It is undeniable that in this century, a globalized business environment is still important for a country ' s future, so this must be reflected in the field of education.
The modern language should be considered as "International Exchange Skills".
The independent school will continue to provide this choice, which has been multi-racialized and successful for a young generation in New Zealand.
It's got to be done.
John Edwa was president of the Independent School Committee in Sogland.
Lebrano started his first race on the island in Santiago on Sunday.
The first game in the Lourdes Lake was to be fought by the Lone Cyclone.
Luck Walton's teacher announced that James would be out in the premier race on Sunday in St. John's Day, which was the opponent of the show's board.
But it's not yet decided that he'll be out in a few minutes.
Walton's official website on the lake team said: "The time of departure will be over 1 minute less than 48 minutes."
The number of minutes that James was likely to arrive is limited, as was the case with the Italian journalist Mike Trudell.
During his early training this week, James asked about his plans for the sixth season of the race for the Lakers.
He said, "I don't need to be prepared for the summer's work at my next job. "
At the time of the election of Traunup in the state of West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Tranpe started an extensive election in Vienna City of West Virginia tonight.
The Trannon-Pierre is a five-day event held next week, this time the first in five places, including a friendly place in the state of Tanzania and Mississippi.
The Supreme Court's elected Supreme Court has already held a secure vote, and its next goal is to win support for the next mid-term election, as the Common Party may well lose control of the national parliament in its November vote.
How many events will Tranpe be held at the elections in West Virginia tonight?
Tranup organized the election at 7:00 p.m. on Sunday, 29 September 2018 at the United States Eastern Time.
You can download the following Tranpus online through YouTube through the direct selection of the media in West Virginia.
At the hearing of this week's hearing, Brit Kavano, appointed judge of the Supreme Court, may be accused of misconduct on the basis of the confirmed vote of the House of Commons in one week, while the FBI is involved in an investigation, and the matter begins to become tense.
However, the first goal of this popular election is to help the parties to make the elections that will come in November.
According to the road transport report, thus, the five-week election group of President Tranup is called "encouraging volunteers and supporters, as the common party needs to work towards preserving and increasing the majority of seats in the House of Commons and the House of Commons".
One of the speakers in the Tranup Group who did not want to reveal his name to the street community said: "I've already entered a busy electoral period, and it's very important for national control in the presidential plan, and he's going to as many states as possible."
According to West Virginia Metro News, tonight's election in Wesbanco Sports in Wesbanco, Vienna, will come from "supporters from Russia and Hong Kong, as well as media leaders from Luxembourg".
The Saturday will be the second time in the last month in Toronto to visit Virginia, where he has won over 40% support in 2016.
Taranup is trying to help the candidate, Patrick Morrisi, who is a member of the Confederate of the People's Conference.
According to the media report, political scientist Simon Haeder of Northern Nigeria called "the presidential bill to help him in the public investigation, which is a good sign for Morrisi and is not a good sign."
2018 Red Cross: U.S. Army shows his determination to get into a single-day race to keep hope alive.
After three rounds of competition, four of those who were under six weeks of competition may already have been needed for Christmas.
The activism can be a complete concept of sports, but it is a real commitment to this approach, especially to the belief that there has never been before in the race.
Where's he and his family going to talk?
When Jordan Smith walked away, he said, "The first six minutes before he left, and the house was four, so I think there's a little bit of space on my side."
Europe, of course, is excellent and has led four and more than twelve in the events that take place.
However, as Spice said, the U.S. Army felt it was good for him because he had a lot of trust, including a full-time competition between Smith and Justin Thomas, and three-thirds of everyone.
Spice has always been a good example in golf.
On his way to Spyth, he followed a key in the race to the fourth. He was more impressed by the popularity of the party's calls than by the fact that he had made two mistakes with Thomas.
When he was 15 years old, he won the game and won the same prize. You know, he believed that the US army had not yet won the game.
She said, "You really have to work hard to focus on your own competition."
The same is true of all drivers.
It can be achieved by 18 holes.
In the past two days, the only player in the region over Spit and Thomas was Francisco Morenaly and Tommy Freytwood, who was an undisputed façade.
Europe has a strong and loving association, winning four games and always making mistakes.
In spite of the second half of the last five weeks, the fifth is the Saturday, "Morivud" is the only group of over-ones.
The first show of his power appears to be moving back and forth to the enthusiastic audiences. He is a winner of the festival on Sunday, and when the sun shines at the National Golf Club, he can gain the victory of Europe, except for Flywood and Morenaly.
It is best for both parties to coordinate on the same number of holes.
This statement, however, is still early in the history of Europe.
Barba Watson and Saber Simpson were the winner of the competition between Alexander and Sergio Gasia, who is now the hero of the four games.
One over-a-half of the above-mentioned attacks led to the fall of Spain and Sweden, and it was difficult to return.
Even if it's Sunday, everyone can help you get back to your place of work.
Four races and four competitions were excellent because there was an interaction between them, and the advice he had received, as well as the change in the strategy of war, was worth the effort.
To date, Europe has been better able to fight as a team in order to make it clear that the final day of its successful entry into the competition, but in the same race as the United States of America, it has shown itself that it is at least a part of it, especially in the United States, that it has always been suspicious.
The European army first entered the final day of the race with 10-6.
The European army will enter the final day of the Red Cross after the 4th and 4th games on Saturday, with 10-6 leading US teams.
Encouraged by the film, Tommy Felitwood and Francisco Morenaly, who won two victories in the Battle of Skull, distributed their prizes to four minutes at the national golf club.
On behalf of the European team, Thomas Biann intends to take back a gift missing two years ago in Hazeltine, a US team that won 3-1 war in the 4th of the morning.
While the United States Army has won two positions in the four matches, it is still able to change the way it does.
If Jim Forrick wants to keep a present there, he will have to win up to 8 per cent in the 12th individual contest on Sunday.
Flywood was the first European winner of the 4th European team, and he won the 4th in the first 4th in the history of the Red Cross after a week of campaign with Morinally's "Morivud" group.
After winning a four-winning match with Patrick Reed, he won a five-and-a-half-a-half-a-half-a-year match with the new US soldier Buzson Dechanbo.
In the past six weeks, Vodzo and his wife have had an excellent performance, but he spent 19 in four races and 29 in 29 matches and 7 in seven.
After a four-square break at the top of the game, Justin Ross once again won the first and third World Cup in 2 and 1 of his films, Henry Schiung and Brock Kopka.
The European army is not a phenomenon in the south of Paris in the wind and the sun.
The three winners, John Spietz and Justin Thomas, have already set up a two-part base on Saturday, U.S.A.
He returned to the race after his 2&1 victory in Spain, John Ram and Ian Bolt, who had been defeated by the 4&3 division by Pault and Roy McRoy, in the event of the first two losses in the four races.
Although Freck, who owns a gift, is able to keep a gift as long as it can be compared to a gift, there are only two games in the history of Ledde can be converted into a single race from four to four.
However, both of them were scheduled for the second day of the week, and their opposition to them seemed impossible.
Korea's claim that trust in confidence is absolutely possible in the least possible way.
The President of Korea informed the United States on Saturday that continued sanctions were increasing the confidence of Korea in the United States, and in such a case, it might be possible for Korea to abandon nuclear weapons on its own.
Leigh informed the United States annual United States Congress that Korea has taken outstanding good action in the past year, such as the end of nuclear testing and the pilot test, to eliminate nuclear testing sites and promises that nuclear weapons and technology will not increase.
He said, "But I didn't see any corresponding response on the part of the United States."
"If I have any confidence in the United States, I will have confidence in my country ' s security, and in situations like that, I may have to start ridding myself of arms first."
It is not enough to repeat the Korean version of the U.S. Code, which has been gradually denuclearized by Korea, but which should not be seen without the progress of this "stage" movement. Its speakers are concerned about the fact that it is not a practice that has always seemed to be a good match for nuclear weapons.
Lee refers to a joint statement that was published at a high-level meeting held in Singapore on 12 June, the first of which was held by the US President and Korean leaders, and that was the time when the King John's guarantee would begin to "innovation" on the Korean peninsula, while Taron was committed to security in Korea.
Korea has been seeking the end of the Korean War between 1950 and 53 years of age, but the United States must first abandon nuclear weapons in terms of peace.
Wyai also opposed the call for international sanctions against Koreans.
"The United States has continued to ‘non-nuclearization’ to achieve its objective by increasing its sanctions force, even refusing to ‘the end of the war’."
"The idea of sanctions can make me subject to the will of someone who doesn't know me.
However, the problem was that my continued sanctions increased my mistrust.
Leanne referred to any plans for the second session of the United States Summit on the United States that focused on leadership.
On the other hand, he stressed three meetings held by the leaders of the country during the last five months, saying: "If non-nuclear participation is a country other than the United States, non-nuclearization of the Korean peninsula will not be a part of the Council. "
Even though it is, Lee's speech has had a great deal to do with the old age. In the United States, he once said that after "Mr. Tranqum is a "fireman" in a suicide mission, the Korean rockets are inevitable for the United States.
The old Armenian threat of "complete destruction" of Tranpus, Korea, this year in the United States, calls for the courage to take action on disarmament in high terms, but he still has much work to do and will continue to hold sanctions until the present non-nuclearization of Korea.
On the third Sunday, Tranun announced that he had a time frame for this, saying, "For two years, three years, or five months -- there was no problem."
China and Russia suggest that the United States should take action in the area of balance.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Bonpeo told the U.S. Security Council: "The sanctions of the Security Council must continue to be enforced without any error until I have the complete final proof that they are actually nuclearized."
The Security Council began to act unanimously against the sanctions of Korea in 2006, with the aim of disposing of funds for the elimination of nuclear and ballistic missile plans.
In the United States, Pumpeo met with Lee at the U.S. Congress meeting, hoping that he would be re-examined for the second session next month.
Pumpeo has visited Korea three times this year, but it is his last move and failed.
In July, when he left the palace, he announced that he had made progress, but that he would be responsible for "the same demand for the same stream" in Korea within hours."
This same month in Korea, if the United States takes "a similar initiative", Korea will destroy a leadership site with the same nuclear unit.
He had already told him that the "comparation" he sought was a security guarantee in Singapore before Tranpe and a normalizing act.
Harvard students' progress towards getting enough rest
This year's new program, Harvard University, ordered him to learn more about all his sciences with a view to combating a growing number of coffee-based hardwood cultures that are used to produce "Tondadan".
A scientific study found that students in the world's first-class university were always unaware of the most basic knowledge they had.
Dr. Charles Czeisler of the University of Harvard, who is a sleep doctor at the University of Women's Hospital. He believes that this is the first time in the United States.
He started a door-to-door discussion about sleep deprivation and the effects of learning.
"At the end of the meeting, a student went through a conversation with me and said to me, 'What do I know when I'm four years old?'
He always said he knew how important it was to sleep, which made me very surprised. "He told me about it" every day."
The first part of this year's program explains to students the good sleep habits that enhance their physical qualities, as well as the practicalities that contribute to scientific research and events.
Paul Barreira, professor of mental health at Harvard University and executive director at the Harvard University Health Centre, said that the school found that school students were missing from the opening of the door on Sunday until Friday after having decided to launch the program.
The process lasted one hour, including a series of interactive missions.
One of the surroundings shows a picture of a living room, a student tapping coffee, a window, a walker's shoes and books, and the effect of coffee with a light line, as well as a lack of sleep, and the importance of rules on time.
In another environment, participants were told that long sleep deprivation had increased the risk of heart disease, respiratory disease, diabetes, and cancer.
A school map with an interactive map encourages participants to think about their daily life.
"I know that this will not change the practice of students immediately.
But I think he has the right to know -- it's like you have the right to know that if you choose to smoke it will affect your health.
He spoke of a culture that continued to exist for "nightly night" and added to modern science and the increasing pressure on students meant that the lack of sleep problems would become more and more serious.
He said that guaranteeing adequate good sleep can be a student's resistance, and a "secret weapon" — even can avoid hunger, as sleep deprivation leads to extreme hunger and causes him to become hungry.
Professor Czeisler, 19-year-old Raymond Suo, of the State of the Institute of Physical Biophysics, who worked at the University of Zheisler for the past year and then worked on the project.
He talked about the program and opened his eyes and offered to propose it as a course for the entire school.
The next step, he hoped that all these scientists would complete a similar study before entering a prestigious university.
Professor Czeisler's advice to the Council on the setting up of the alarm for sleeping and the dangers of the "blue light" released by electronic screens such as LED, which will lead to your biostimulation, leading to difficulty in sleeping.
1-0 Livinston runners: Joining the Ball in the morning and defeating the Jérade team
One of Dolly Minga's legs was shot by a 1-0 Stifin Jérad's team in Lewiston, and the flooders were in a state-of-the-art situation.
After reaching 4-one victory in St. John'ston in February, Ebrox has always tried to record his first victory on the road, but he has been ordered by Gali Holt's team to defeat Jérad's second 18th match, which has succeeded in defeating his team with an 8-minute victory in Haze.
Mingaka entered the ball seven minutes before the end of the semi-finals, while the flower's lack of air is not at all at the same level.
In fact, it was the first time in the world that I was born in the United States, and I was born in the United States. I was born in the United States.
Moreover, there may be more than one cases of anxiety such as that caused by the head injury, Kalinm Stunsie, which is clearly overlooked by the customer.
Jérad has been able to make eight changes to the team that joined the Confederal League in the middle of the match.
Holt, on the other hand, continues to hold on to Lewiston's 11th anniversary, which was part of the victory of Haze last week. He was able to kill his opponent every time he was trained by this excellent team.
The fans have an opportunity to control the game, but Livinston is more than a professional player.
He was able to get into the game within two minutes of the launch, and was the first to launch Scott Pitt of the game before the start of the game at Aran McGreg, but this video player had been using the wrong wrong plane.
After a long flight from the Crimean Jubbets to the Creeg Harkot Army, his defense file was dropped only in the rear.
The control of the displaced person, however, appears to be a great deal of faith in his expression in the context of the ban.
Alfredo Morelosley, of course, believes that there should be a penalty at the time of the 15th minute, when he and Stephen Wallis faced an encounter, but he rejected the request of this Colombian footballer.
In the latter half of its efforts to achieve two real targets, however, Liam Korei, former prime minister of Ebrox, said that Lasan Kuribanna's headball and Ovie Aria Plywood were almost inconceivable.
The first 34-minute entry into Lebanon seems to be deliberate, but it is the only effort he has made to express his admiration and no one can deny that he is worth it.
Once again, the explorer lost Kobus's remote location.
When Dekran Garah passed the defense line, Scott Afield responded, while Scott Rowell remained calm and chose to be the last easy-to-do player in the game.

Juvenile calculator developers
The following is the contents of my "Saturday News" page: on 30 September 1882, 136 years ago, and today, there was an increase in the time of the future physicist Johannes Wilham "Hans" who was born in Germany.
He discovered a method of exploration and mass radiation, which eventually produced a device called a motion calculator.
Since then, the competition calculator has not stopped playing in the middle of the scientific community, but has also become a leading leading culture, and in the 1950 film "The Hour of Coralado," a similar feminist, Roy Rogers and John Iwans:
The man said, "What's that?"
Rogers: "The engine of the projector used to set radioactive material, such as lead.
You can hear the sound of the atomic radiation released on the earphone."
I said, "I'm talking, but the house must jump!"
Hans died in 1945 when he was 63 years old.
However, this invention of his name has continued to spread.
New cancer vaccines can teach the immune system to treat "bad cells"
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to treat "bad cells" and then destroy them.
The vaccine immune system recognizes that sexual cells are one of the cures.
The method includes the removal of immunization cells from the patient's body and changes take place in the laboratory.
He can then be injected into the patient after the protein that is commonly seen in many cancers.
Tests show positive effects on various cancer patients.
A woman accepted this kind of teaching immune system after recognizing the treatment of sexually transmitted diseases, found that her breast cancer had disappeared for more than 18 months.
This method involves the removal of immune cells from the patient's body and the transformation of the immune cells into the laboratory, which led him to a protein called HER2 commonly seen in many cancers and then re-inject him into the patient.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Research Institute in Beseda, Milan, said: "The results of my research show that I have only one very long-term vaccine. "
Professor Berzofsky explains that HER2 "will contribute to the growth of several types of cancers", including cancer, cancer, cancer and cancer.
In patients, immunization cells are taken from their bodies, teaching them to search for cancer cells such as vaccine cells and similar operations have already been applied to treatment of a type of white blood cell.
Kanye Lester was wearing a MAGA hat after "Six Nights of Week" because he was attacked in support of Tranquo.
It's okay.
Canyester was voted in a film, where he held an unknown performance in "Six Nights of Week", called the US President Donad Tramp, who himself attended the election in 2020.
He wore a title "Resurrection of the United States" on his third night song, Ghost Town, followed by a party against democracy, reiterating his support for Tranunpur.
"I've been planning a lot with white people, and he says, "You're going to know Tranpu? He's a racist spy."
Well, if I'm interested in racial discrimination, I've left the United States early."
"Six Nights of Week" invites Matt Damon to play a silent little show for a show, and in a small case, the well-known star Bret Kavano was a witness to the case of Christine Blessie's alleged violations before the Court of Justice meeting.
"Seg ID="8" "Despite the fact that most of the star's anger is on the street, it's a popular actor, Chris Lock, who posted it on social media.
I don't know. Locke didn't want to make a joke.
Lester complained to the audience because his head was not happy at the back.
According to Detective Washington, he said, "He's got me in the back.
He's saying, "Don't wear your hat out."
He bit me!
And then he woke up and I was in a wet area."
Lester continues: "Do you want to go down to the bathroom?" And he'll hit my superhero, because it means I didn't let you teach me how to do it. Do you want this world to continue?
Try using love."
At least two of the audience's voices were prompted by his words, "Six Nights of Week" by the performers, "Six Nights of the Week," and "Shit" were directed by people at the scene: "As a filmcase, into a dead body."
Lester was a well-encouraged singer, Elena Grant, who died several days earlier.
In the "I Love it" performance, the "I Love it" was played by many people in Paris, making their name famous.
Lester was supported by TPUSA's head of the security team, Kandis Turner, "with the most brave soul: thanks to you and the united opposition."
However, the president of the House of Commons, Carolen Huntt, announced to the House of Commons, "It's just to make himself, very good."
"But I would never choose this person (by buying his music and clothing or by supporting his 'art') who I think is a toxic idea to my community.
He is free!
I'm all right. "He's going to add.
Before the show, the singer announced that he had changed his name in the tweet, and his home was "the official existence of Kanye West."
He was not the first to be named after Didy, but he was also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P. Diddy as the public.
One of the singers, Snobby Dogs, used the name Snobby Shoe, of course, had lost music – the king, changed his name to a symbol, and then came to the famous artist king.

"A game of power" by Starbird Harpton hits a man's mood.
Kid Harpington is known for his role in the HBO-full-of-the-art series "authority game" in the middle of the century.
However, the 31-year-old actor recently struck a piece about heroism, and he spoke about the role of acting in the afterlife as he felt that he had to be very much respected.
Kid said about "Taise's cultural week," which he thought was a mistake, and the problem could be solved by the negative male moods that appeared in this #Meto era.
The most recent co-operational star in the "authority game" – as well as the 31-year-old Kide, who is married to José Leslie, admitted that he felt very strongly about the issue.
He said, "I feel too strong for myself and my family, and I'm confused about men's feelings?"
"What problems do I face at home, and in the development of my husband?"
Kitt believes that the role of so-called male on television may contribute to the rationality of a toxic male mood.
He went on to say, "The universe is a kind of universe, and the universe is a kind of afterlife?
TV teaches TV and TV on the street seems to be talking about teenagers, and a man is a model?
I think, in my generation, it must be one of the major problems — what do I think I'm going to do about this change?
It's like there's a lot of noise in the back of the baby.
During his visit, he also made sure that after the end of the summer, he would no longer play any previous or more role in the "authority" game, if he himself had fought with horses.
Starting in October, Kitt was the leader of the "True West" in the "True West" of Sam Schupd's "True West", a story told by the film producer and his brother.
In recent times, a member of the actor's family has come to see José as the best thing in his life during the film "The Game of Authority".
"In the process of filming "the game of power," I met my wife, who was in this paragraph, and I had my future family and my new life would begin from this point of view," he said.
In an american television series, José plays a character in Yokott — Kitts actor John Snow.
She married her husband in June 2018, at a place in the family castle of Sogland.
HIV/AIDS: China reported a 14% increase in the incidence of new infectious diseases
China reported an increase in the number of people infected with HIV and AIDS by 14 per cent.
My country has more than 850,000 people infected.
In the second quarter of 2018, there were some 40,000 new cases of infectious diseases.
The vast majority of new cases of sexually transmitted diseases indicate that they have changed.
In a traditional sense, HIV has spread rapidly through infected blood into parts of China.
In a meeting in the province of San Juan, Chinese health officials spoke of a reduction in the number of people infected with HIV in this way to almost zero.
However, by comparison, the number of people infected with HIV and AIDS in China increased by 100,000.
The problem of transmission of HIV through sex is very serious in the LGBT group in China.
China's gay system was legislated in 1997, but there was widespread discrimination against the LGBT group.
My country's traditional viewpoint is that 70-90% of men and women have eventually chosen to marry.
In many cases, there is insufficient sexual protection in this relationship.
Since 2003, the Government of China has admitted that the universal acceptance of HIV therapy is part of a major problem.
Macsin Wotts denied the data of his staff members who challenged GOP's statements and attacked 'hazardous lies' as well as 'proposals'
A member of the U.S. Women's Parliamentary Commissioner, Macsin Woods, has been responsible for sending personal data from three U.S. parliamentarians to the petitioner's Viki-Sko website.
Lao Democrats say that the term "right-wing" has been spread by experts and websites.
Walters, quoted above, declared: "Speaking big, speaking big, and even more embarrassing lies."
Public information is reported to include the address and phone number of U.S. parliamentarians in Linz-Greem, South Carolina, and Michael Lee and Olyn Hachi, U.S.A.
The four-weekly data published by the National Assembly is hidden on the website and during the period of hearing a small hearing of allegations of misconduct against the President of the Supreme Court.
Three MEPs were asked what happened after Kavanaugh.
According to the "Getway Pundit" report, a media report such as "Gateway Pundit" and "RedState" are related to the IP address of the source office and the Voices office and discloses information to a staff member of the Wotz.
"This kind of accusation must be entirely false and absolutely false," Walters continued.
"My staff is his identity, his personal data and security have been affected by false and false allegations of fraud and fraud, and his true disclosure of the data is totally irrelevant to him.
Such accusations are all false and are absolutely false."
Vots' comments were quickly criticized online by netizens, including former White News Secretary Ari Fly.
It's kind of angry, "Fly talk.
"It is clear that he has a reputation for being a member of the National Assembly.
For the wounds that have been inflicted, others will be punished and punished.
You can't challenge him.
He can't question the motive of the prosecutor.
He must be calm."
Fries seems to be more likely to react to the opposition of Kawanos than the Democratic Party against Judge Kawano, and the debateer appears to be angry with Kawano during the four-week hearings.
The joint candidate, Omar Navaro, participated in the midterm election to make the Watts stand, and he expressed his feelings in tweets.
"If it's true, it's a big deal," he said.
In his statement, Watson's office warned "the right organization and the law-enforcement organization to keep its eye on fraud.
"I'll make sure that the lawyer is informed," he continues, "that he will follow his legal responsibility because of his actions against me and all the workers or as a threat to his safety."
"Section Agent 3" is a joke by Ron Ainson.
From a traditional point of view, it is now the search for a new film to focus on the significance of Britain, which seems to apply to the replaying of a series of films "School Agents", which began in 2003, while "School Officer 2" was released in 2011.
Can the content of self-adhesive self-esteems of the subject be re-accepted by viewers?
How, "Storage Officer 2" continues to obtain permission for the second time, and Mr. Huang has large eyes, face-to-face appearances, and has always been rich and beautiful, and his name is more popular than in English.
Of course, he was the stupid secret agent, although he was surprised at the quietness of his show, and there was a sound like that of Crew. He was very much impressed by the fact that at the opening season of the 2012 London stadium, he was the one who played a song by a band called "The Fire Race" on the theme "The Fireball" in London.
He was born in Ainson, where he was born as a passenger and an international secretary at the Barclay Credit Card, who was forgotten at home. He was born in the United States after seven years of age.
It's the latest JE outpost, with two good heads.
I am pleased to see Johnny Engley wearing a series of middle-century snowflakes near a helicopter, which he and his head rotates together for a short time.
Ainson showed that he was a good speaker, but quiet enough, and a lot of fun, such as the 007 and the "Smooth" movie card himself, which is now a great integration of the element of entertainment.
Such silences seem to fit into the circle, and are suitable after birth, and to me, Johnny English laughs at the fact that all of us are experiencing a new and powerful smile, not like Ainson's voice in the movie.
It is said that the British are in serious trouble with the issue of hot debate.
A netizen blackmail enters the UK's top secret network and reveals the identity of all British field officials, making it surprising to the General of Ben — which is not enough for Kevin Elden's weak forces to return to this situation.
For a famous and four-performing Prime Minister, this is the last piece of paper that will give him the benefit of political loss: Emma Thompson's efforts to re-examine the role of Tresa and Mee, but the book contains content that can help to spread.
He knows that all alive officials are exposed and that he has to bring a retired agent to his office.
This means Johnny English himself, who is a teacher of a traditional school, will provide a form of informal work as an employee of the Grand Duchess, adding a smile, as England opens a door to a "School School"-like conversation.
England returned to the White House, attended the emergency import report, and reconvened with its former bandboy (replayed by Ben Miller).
Boye is married to a married man and married to a grandpa who plays a very interesting role, where he and his wife are unable to perform.
Thus, in the "007 queen's queen's envoy", he re-commenced the case and met a beautiful woman who was killed by Ofilia Brotova, who had been executed by the O'Connorland.
At the same time, the Prime Minister is in danger of entering into the hands of the four powerful sciences and fortune-tellers, who claim to be able to solve the problems of the British computer: the evil (Jack Lucy) Jason Walta.
England and Boy began their ridiculous journey: he dressed himself as a servant and burned a French meal; he made a mess and stole himself into Volta's Huguenot; England tried to use the real estate capital to introduce himself to the house of Walta, where he was now causing confusion.
It's the last round of efforts, but the whole process is full of fun and fun, but there's still a child television taste.
It's a good idea.
I don't think that the British film community can't create a really great role for Ainson?
The Labour Party denied that it was planning a four-day work week for the British but earned five-day salary.
Jeremy Colton considered an exciting project that allowed British people to work for four days a week, but earned five days' wages.
It is reported that the employer of the company wants to pay the employee money that fell through the industrial revolution (AI) to allow him to rest for a long day.
A full - time worker can enjoy three days of rest a week — but still has the same income.
The idea of "conforming" the business agenda and plans of the Workers' Party to benefit the benefit of the countries and workers.
The change in working days for four weeks gained the approval of the British Trade Union because this method has benefited workers in economies that have not changed.
A high-ranking party said "Saturday Times News" and said: "The project will be the result of a policy survey by the end of the year.
"The plan will not be implemented immediately, but one week's work system is a wish to conform to the working party's methods of reassessing the benefits and economics of workers, as well as the entire industrial strategy of the labour force. "
The Labour Party is not the first party to support such an idea, but it has been a four-week workday in the major electoral event in 2017.
However, it should be hoped that the employer will gain full approval at the moment.
A speaker from the Workers ’ Party said: 'For four days working and non-party policies, the parties have also considered this issue.'
The Prime Minister of the Interior, John McDonald, used last week's workshop to describe his view of the economic socialist revolution.
According to Mr. McDonald, he decided to withdraw his authority from the public service company's "named director" and "professor" hands.
In addition to the plans of the Minister of the Interior, the current share of the water company may be used to cover all its shares, since the Government of the Labour Party may have "detention" shares because it finds that it is not appropriate to act.
He also confirmed that members had been admitted to the Board of Directors of the Company and had established an Inclusive All-Right Fund to transfer 10 per cent of the shares of private companies to members, which would earn up to 500 pounds per year.
Lindsay Graham and John Gandy said "60 minutes" and the Federal Investigation Board would change their mind about Kavano's investigation.
The Federal Investigation Board investigated the charges against Judge Jérét Kavano, at least one week of the final vote of the Supreme Court judges, and presented the results of the investigation by the Authority, whether any joint parliamentarians had been affected by the withdrawal of their support.
In a visit on Sunday, the "60-minute" newsmagazine Scott Pelly asked the Co-Chairs, Lindsey Graham and John Gandhi, if the Federal Investigation Board could find any clues that would change his mind.
Gandhi seems to be better off than his partner from South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," said Gandhi.
"At the hearing of the evidence, I have already spoken to Judge Kavano.
After this incident, I accused him of being a spy, and I called him, 'Did you do it?'
He's determined, determined, and rejected the country."
However, Graham’s vote did not seem to change.
He said, "I've decided to lower the U.S. Kavano and need an explosive charge."
Professor Fort, I know what's going on here, but I know what's going on here.
"Every one of the ways he mentioned has proved this to be true.
It's 36 years old.
I found any new evidence."
Is it global citizenship? This and the reduction of poverty are linked?
On Saturday, the Council will hold a year's event for the Global Year of Music, which will be held at a large number of star exhibitions, which will be devoted to public affairs; to eradicating world poverty.
In the seventh half of the world's population, thousands of people went to the central park on the ground floor, and a performance by Janie Jacksen, Kadi B and Sean Mondze, aimed at helping people to realize the importance of eliminating extreme poverty in the year 2030.
Global citizenship has been an extension of global poverty since 2012. Global poverty is a leading international organization, which hopes that more and more people will be actively involved in the fight against poverty and eliminate poverty.
In order to obtain free-of-charge votes from the music community (except if you would like to pay the VIP gate), a regular audience must complete a series of tasks or "actions", such as voluntary services, send e-mail to world leaders, telephones or any other meaningful way to raise people's awareness of their poverty goals.
But how successful can global citizens be when the real goal is still 12 years?
In order to provide a genuine appeal for action in a free-of-charge music society, or in another kind of "internet activism" — by signing a petition or by publishing a statement of appeal on Twitter to make people think that its action is really worthwhile?
Global Citizen spoke, since 2011, he has recorded more than 19 million supporters' actions, encouraging many different goals.
Global Citizen, which has led world leaders to announce an agreement and policy of $370 billion, which will affect the lives of more than 22.5 million people before 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the organization was to list 390 entries from its actions and announcements, of which at least $100 billion had been paid or collected.
To date, the funding received has been directly affected by nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Part of the important commitments include The Power of Nutrition (the headquarters of the United Kingdom investor and executive cooperative) to "help children to develop their full strength" after receiving over 4700 copies from global citizens, to provide Rwanda with $35 million to help eliminate malnutrition in the country.
"With the support of the British Government, the donors, the governments and other global citizens like you, I would like to make the poor society unequal in its history," The Power of Nutrition Ambassador Terry Elman spoke at London's current concert in April 2018.
It should also be noted that after more than 5,000 initiatives by the United Kingdom to improve the nutritional situation of mothers and children, the government announced an item of the Power of Nutritio, which will provide food for five million women and children.
"Do you understand that I can eradicate extreme poverty?"
The global citizen replied, "This will be a long and hard way -- sometimes I'll fall down and fail.
However, like the great civil rights movement before me and the anti-racialist movement, I will become stronger and more successful.
Janie Jacksen, Wicken, Sean Mondez, Cady B and Joganie Munny are participating in this year's event, which will be chaired by Jópola-Le Fônez and Hécmann.
The U.S. Minister of Home Affairs has called for the use of the "Muslim" Russians to block their energy exports.
According to the Washington Observatory report, the U.S. Interior Minister Ann Zink announced "if necessary," Washington could use the Navy to stop Russian energy from attacking the Middle East market.
Zing announced that Russia's participation in the action with Julia, particularly at the invitation of the legitimate government, was the key to the development of a new energy market.
The report said: "I think his stay is the cause of the Middle East, and he's the only one who wants to become a person in the middle of energy, like the practice in Eastern Europe and in southern Europe."
And, according to this official, there are many ways and means to solve this problem.
He said: "The United States has this capacity, which will ensue my marine forces, to ensure the openness of the maritime routes, and, if necessary, to block them and ensure that their energy approaches enter the market."
Zink spoke to the audience at the event organized by the non-profit Energy Union to mark himself as the "Energy Consumer" of the United States.
He compared how Washington dealt with the problems of Russia and Iran, noting how he actually handled them.
"The choice or use of and replacement of fuel for Iran and the Russian economy has been made," he said, while referring to Russia's economic situation with regard to fossil fuels.
In the light of this statement, the Taranup Government has been committed to increasing its exports of natural gas to Europe in order to replace Russia (with a more favourable choice for European consumers).
For this reason, including U.S. President Donald Tranpus, a member of the Tranpe government in the interior, tried to convince Germany to withdraw "an inappropriate "Northern 2" line entry, a report by Dutranpus, which makes Berlin a "Musco" ring.

The Russian Minister of Energy, Alexander Novak, met in Moscow in September with Mr. Rick Perry, Minister of Energy, who said: "I believe that I recognize that both energy and energy cannot be a force tool and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers."
The position of the United States led to strong opposition from Germany, and Germany reaffirmed its commitment to the item.
Germany's main industrial union (BDI) called for a bilateral agreement between Berlin and Moscow on energy policy for the United States away from the EU.
The President of the German Industrial Union (BDI), Dieter Kempf, recently met with Prime Minister Angela Mercel and President Frakimirovic Putin of Russia, said: "When the third country interfered with my energy supply, I had a serious problem."

The candidates for the Supreme Court judge, Janet Kawano, are accused of numerous sexual assaults, and many of the parties are still in high-level protection for him, analysing the warning of the person who will be severely opposed during the mid-term elections, particularly by women.
The awareness of the situation was very high, and the majority of the partners indicated their intention to make a statement.
In an article published on Saturday, Grant Reeher, Professor of Political Sciences at Maxwell University, Snow City, told "The National Assembly Report" about the practice of witchcraft.
Reeher said he questioned whether he was the last time he asked the Federal Investigation Board to investigate whether it was sufficient for an angry voter.
A report from the Dwarfton District reports that the movement's previous high-level survey and the national speaker, Caroline, said: "Women will not forget what happened recently, they will forget what happened, and they will also forget what happened in November."
Mic reports that on Friday afternoon, due to the fact that the joint board of the Court of Justice has been monitoring the statement of Fort, the opposition has chosen to proceed with the nomination of Kavanaugh, and the protestors have responded to "Noveh!" on the run of the House of Commons.
A non-participated political analyst, Scott Rosenberg, revealed to the press website: "The zeal and motivation of the Democratic Party will break the record.
"The voting rate is very high; indeed, it is true.
However, the voting rate may be higher, especially for female voters in the area and for young voters from 18 to 29 years of age who are not willing to vote for the President, but for the general vote."
Even before Fort's public testimony on his sexual assaults against the candidates of the Supreme Court, the analysts showed that if the joint party progressed in its nominations, strong opposition could be overcome.
According to the NBC news report, the former President of the National Committee of the Co-Parties, Michael Stile, said earlier this week: "It's been seven years since the joint party was attacked."
"This matter is not related to the Committee's vote or the final vote or whether Kavano has been appointed, nor to the way the joint party has dealt with the matter and how he has been treated," the organization of the Democratic Party has said to the press.
However, after Fort and Kavanaugh's testimony, it is clear that Americans are concerned about the issue of belief and that more and more support the latter.
A new public survey by YouGov shows that 41 per cent of the visitors are certain or likely to believe in a positive statement, while 35 per cent of them are certain or likely to believe in Kavano.
In addition, 38 per cent of the people said that Kavanaugh was considered to be a potential or certain talk, while only 30 per cent spoke to Fort in the same way.
The report is under the appeal of Freck, and the Federal Investigation Board is currently investigating both Fort and at least another prosecutor, Mr Ramirez.
Fort was a member of the Court of Justice of the House of Commons on Sunday, when he was 17 years old when he was raped by a Kavano drunk.
Ramirez claimed that he was a member of a party during the 20th century, during which the candidate of the Supreme Court revealed his reproductive powers to him.
An online project designed to create a new Internet challenge song with Facebook.
Tim Burns-Le is creating an original company, trying to create a Facebook, Amazon and Hong Kong song competition.
Inrupt is a company based on the Solid Open Platform of Bernes-Lei.
Solid allows user to select the location of his or her data storage on the border and allow the user to visit the border information.
When Benez-Ley received an invitation to visit the "Special Company", the idea behind Inrupt was "Management World".
Speaking of this home company, he says, "I have to go home and get my hands on it."
"This is a historical time."
This section uses Solid's technology to allow people to create their own "personal data storage" or POD.
He can include contact lists in your task lists, calendars, music libraries and other individuals and professional tools.
Like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify, you can use a browser at the same time.
The only unit where personal data is stored is that the user is able to visit the user's website.
The company is called "the power of a person through data".
According to John Bruce, the company's chief executive, Inrupt, the idea is to provide the company with resources, processes and appropriate skills to help everyone make good use of Solid.
The company is currently composed of Bernes-Leather, Bruce (who established a security platform in the past) and is a member of the project's development team as well as a volunteer agricultural community.
From this beginning of the week, technical developers around the world can use the tools provided on Inrupt website to create their own centralised applications.
Benez-Leigh, he agreed with the group on whether the "Facebook and Song" negotiations would bring about a change in his business models as a whole.
"I ask for his consent."
Inrupt "Inrupt" is an article published on Medium by Bernes-Leather VI, which explains the integrity and quality of the new network built on Solid."
In 1994, Bernas-Lei established an Internet-based association at the University of Non-Professional Industries and changed the Internet.
In recent months, Bernas-Ley has been a powerful influence on the popular voice in the online central debate.
Even at the time of the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the Internet Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
Burns-Leath adds: "I am very pleased with the future of the network.
Bernard Vann: The celebration of a Russian Orthodox priest during a war in Victoria · Global Voices
The only church in the United Kingdom was the priest who won the Victoria Cross during the first major war in the world, and he was at home for the celebration of the festival 100 years ago.
Colonel Bernard Vann was sentenced on September 29, 1918, to the instigation of the attack on Brangelis and Le O'Course.
Four days later, however, he was killed by his own hands, and he had always known that he had won the highest military rank in the United Kingdom.
It is in the Northampton Castle of Rachden, where two of her daughters celebrate their holidays.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, was remembered as the hero of his grandfather's grandfather's grandfather's birthday party, which was celebrated 100 years later, "extremely remarkable".
According to the London Conservatory, on 29 September 1918, Colonel Vanne led his team through the cannon, which led to a violent attack by wild warplanes and machine guns through the Holy Canal.
Then came the front line, "Engageless" led the team to the front, and the three of them were attacked by wild themselves.
Colonel Vann was the one month before the end of the war, which was killed by a German gunman on 4 October 1918.
At 72 years of age, Michael Vann spoke, his grandfather's actions are zero "I know there's no way I can do it, but I'm going to maintain respect for it."
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also took the lead in the race after the end of the race.
Michael Vann says, "It's a pleasure to be able to take part in this event," and he adds, "The real hero's courage has won the support of a lot of people."
The MMAs want to spend the night Bellator 206, and the result is "Little Peach."
Imagine, you've been thinking about Bellator 206 all night, and you've been told that your house is headed for the main game.
The newspaper comes from St. Joseph's gate with 13 matches, 6 of which are on the main stage and is broadcast all night in the UK.
At 6 p.m., Gigade Mosses and Rory McDonald were preparing PK, and the British audience were surprised to see that the picture he drew became "Little Peach".
It's especially so there's someone who's been sleeping for the first night of the game, so it's all over the place.
A folklore on Twatt turns into a child movie called "Some kind of evil act".
Dave Schwartz, Vice-President of the "Bellator", was asked about the time when the issue was being played: "The government determined that the contents of the 6th play will be changed to the children's show.
"Little Pecker," "misleading."
Belator, President of the Bellator company, Scott Cooke, will be the feel of the British audience in the future programme of work.
"When I get back to the game, I think I'll probably solve this problem."
"But it's about six o'clock on Sundays, and I'll wait until Sunday after work, and one week after work, he can solve this problem.
But I'm still trying.
Believe me, when he changed his picture, there was also a lot of good advice.
I'd like to correct him, and I think this is a technical failure.
But this time, this is a government issue.
I can assure you, it's never gonna happen again.
I'll keep the game in five places, not six. I'll set it up as a regular practice, and I'll give you more fun, as a result of this.
The situation is good."
Insulting: Tom Daley is embarrassed about sex
Ossetian water jumper Tom Deley said that he felt that he was being selfish of others because of his sexual orientation, but he also became successful.
This post-24-year-old boy, until he graduated from high school, was willing to learn that everyone is as good as he is.
Lauren Raffon spoke on the "Study Song" in a four-day show, where he spoke openly about the right to homosexual rights, with hope for others.
He argued that it wasn't much of a victory after the local parents won the chancellor.
Long-term actor John has been on television for several months because of his illness.
In the first part of a show in Délicel Laffon, a man who appeared to be a nice abandoned person, he said that he felt that others had grown up because he and his girlfriend were not accepted by society.
He said: To this day, I have no sense, no feeling, no sense of real wildness, and no power at all to my success.
When he finds out about his sexual orientation, he doesn't want everyone to be disappointed and wants to prove that he's a useful person.
The two sports card owners have become known as a well-known sexual actor, and in this year's Australian United Kingdom event, they have called for more countries to legislate against homosexual acts.
He said it was because he was lucky that he could open up and have no effect on anyone and hope to be disappointed in others.
This third world champion, who loved American film production as Dustin Lance Brooke, was introduced to him in 2013, and I was surprised to hear that.
Dali married more than 20-year-old Oscar, but she never had any problems with her age.
You will have to spend more time with him, and at the age of 14, he attended the Chow O.A., and three years later his father died of cancer. He found it difficult to pass through a similar high and low village.
This has changed his view of his wife's parents, Robert Rey Brock Dley in June.
If you ask me about my age, I'll tell you I need to win a gold medal.
You don't know why? Because there's a lot more important money.
I've got my car ticket, Robbie.
His uncle was named Robert, and Robert was diagnosed with brain cancer in 2011.
Dali's father did not accept the fact that he was about to die, and he wanted to sit in front of the 2012 London Stock Exchange.
He said I couldn't tell him where you could sit in front of the show.
When he was about to stop breathing, I held his hand until he really stopped breathing, he died, and I finally realized that he could fight.
The second year, Dili attended the 2012 O'A's event and won a prize.
He told me that I still knew that there was water in the front of the O.R., and that I had a dream and a feeling of worthlessness that could be replaced.
He was also inspired by the song "Hesser Smoll's Song", which he was born with during the event, but still commanded him to raise his skin.
At 1115 hours of the British summer, the British broadcasting company broadcasts four shows on Sunday "Sun Island Songs".
On Saturday, because of Michaelson's poor condition, he's been on a baller next to Leed's party.
U.S. footballer Phil McCarson will create a new record at the 47th Ladet contest on Sunday, but he is determined to change his situation.
Michaelson participated in the 12th two-year two-year game to create the new record, which was held by the team after the G. Jim Forrick on Saturday.
This five-year-old winner seems to have always been in the center of the game as he used to be in the United States as an effective match, and he spent all his time as a leader of the Lara team and his own game, hoping he could fix his own shortcomings.
The 48-year-old fighter was the most successful in his career, and he did not fit in with the golf club of the country where he was asked to compete, as long-term violent training usually punished the wrong ball.
If there is no fear at all, he won four matches this week with Newcomy Flywood in the British public championship for the ninth game on Sunday, Francisco Molina.
If the U.S. forces begin the 12th game at 4 minutes after the fall, there will be a good start, and the game will play a decisive role.
Forrek had confidence in his men, but the others were too proud.
He said he knew exactly how to play the sheep today, how easy it was to shoot my back, how he was ready to listen to me.
He has confidence in himself.
He was a member of the so-called House of Commons, and earlier this week, he was a small member of the team.
I'm guessing he's gonna play two games.
I get more, but as a result, I get more and more of it, and I think it's the right way to go.
He wants to go out, just like everyone else.
Nick Fardo created the best competition record on Sunday, but the record will soon be broken.
This may mark the end of Lede's career, but his personal record is still far away.
Seven and a half times as many as 18 years ago, Michaelson won a 20-year-old. Even if Forreck's orders to the ball were issued, he had a new turnout.
He explained that he was very interesting, he liked suffering, he was smart, he was funny, he had a good teammate.
I've been with him since I was young this week. It's really fun.
He's got a lot of money. He's not stopping the game.
The European team leader Thomas Biann knows it's not going to take the lead soon.
With the European army leader Thomas Biann, the previous experience, on the last few days of the game in Ledde, was very intense.
Dean was the first to compete in the Valdremberg in 1997, when the team was headed by Sef Balestros, who was the leader of the U.S. team for five months, but finally won the smallest disparity at 14.5:13.5.5.
After the five-thirds of the first five to three-day 2018 series of games, you will never forget that I took the lead in the Valdelama people. I had both won and lost in Brooklyn, but I won in Valdalama, but it was only a chance to win, before I woke up.
That's why the story tells me every man I know about this team is not finished.
You're gonna have a good day.
Go out and do what you need to do.
You're on the blackboard all day long, and it's not over.
I've got a goal and I'm going to win this prize back.
I've always said that I'm interested in 12 members of my team, but I'm all aware of the biggest players in the world.
Biann also expressed his joy at the golf course in which he was suffering. I will never go beyond myself in this regard.
Listen to other bastards.
Every day, we listen to a person's performance and we also listen to other things that we want to do.
If this is the case, it's good to get out with your partner, but if you're alone, you can try to make it all your capacity as a golf player.
If you want to do your best on the day of the hearing, this is where you need to transfer information to the football team.
At home, you need to open your file, and he needs to work hard to do the best he can.
As far as Biann is concerned, he wants to be better off when his team members are alone in the game, but Jordan and Justin Thomas are except if he has a total of four.
Freck won the final victory on the last day, he once won the victory of a major Brooklyn team, but after the fact of the "Medianc miracle" in Europe, he failed to report it.
When asked about the final day of the race at the end of 1999, President Ben Crenson clearly remembered each word he answered.
On the day I heard 12 important matches, but you're going to look like you're down in Brooklyn, like you're going to start fast like you're down in Madianak.
When the unit's forces are moving towards the housing direction, the pressure in the center is high.
I'm just trying to sort out my sense of humor, and I'm just going to make it feel like I'm out of time. You know, we're gonna listen to magic.
Thomas is primarily responsible for taking the lead against everyone, and he will compete with other European voters, such as Rory McCroe, Paulo Cassie, Justin Ross, John Ram, Tommy Freewood and Paul.
When Biann arrived at his own competition, I went out in line with this order with the crew because I thought it was a process.
Germany's army is again extended.
According to the local media report, Germany's most recent defence forces should be used in 2014 to replace the age-old wartime battle, but they can be used until at least next year because of the system's obstacles and costs.
The German "Time Week" calls for a military speaker saying that the pilotship "Lebanon-Pupfaze" of the New Baden-Separatorship of New Baden-Separator was delayed until the first half of 2019.
The wild-ass ship was to join the Navy in 2014, but the problem remained standing after the purchase.
In 2007, the Navy will replace the four Baden-Minburg Prefectures of the Old League.
As soon as he knows, he will be equipped with a large shield, a series of air defences and anti-aircraft pilots, as well as with self-containing techniques such as reducing radar and radioactivity.
Other important features include longer insurance periods, and the latest protection should be available for two years at a distance from the mother's port.
However, the German Times weekly noted that the delay meant that Germany allowed the first military entry force to power off the sea in service.
In the old years, the unfortunate F125 defence officer appeared on the news when the German Navy refused to investigate him and sent him back to the Bloom-Fos ship in Hamburg.
This is the first time the Navy reconnaissance the ship.
The citizens knew little about the reasons for the withdrawal of the ship, but the German media called for the left-wing key factors such as software and hardware deficiencies, which led to the use of the military in carrying out military duties.
The lack of software is particularly important because there are about 120 members of the Baden-Symburg Prefecture and only half of the old Lemme Guards are required.
In addition, the ship is clearly too large to reduce its capacity as a ship, limiting the capacity of the Navy to increase in the future.
It is believed that the weight of this 7,000-pound ship is twice the weight of the same ship used by Germany in the second world.
The quality of entry, including the training of crew members, is a factor in addition to the difficulties that have been encountered.
It is estimated that from the first 22 billion euros to the most surprising 31 billion euros ($36 billion).
Given the recent slowdown in the strength of the German Navy, it is particularly important to address the problems facing the most recent defence forces.
At the beginning of the year, the German Parliamentary Defence Committee, both President Hans Peter Batters, acknowledged that the Navy was actually "no longer capable of deployment"
The officer said that the problem was becoming increasingly serious in time, since the old ship had been decommissioned, but the new ship had been repatriated.
He was able to join the Navy in the defense camp in Baden-Minburg.

In the course of a new study, a garden in the Sugland Highland is being conducted with a view to discovering that land is used as a food source.
It is hoped that this discovery will provide new guidelines for the actions of such unique flying mammals and will help guide future environmental protection activities.
This post is part of our special coverage of the World Trade Organization (UNICEF) and is part of our Web site.
The special records will be placed around the hotel using a follow-up event.
The National Health Agency will be able to prepare a telephone survey using the handshake.
A professional audio analysis will determine the volume of voice calls and the quality of the voice.
A free space map and reports will be produced and will include a detailed map of what he does.
The Sugland National Council for Natural Care asked Rob Duwa, hoping that the results of the study could show that the most important side effects are breast-feeding, as well as the use of all kinds of herbs.
The design of the forest will be better protected by the forest than by other related forest types, which will be useful for the purpose of ensuring the smooth management of the forest.
In the last century, there was a significant decline in the number of mines in Scotland and the United Kingdom.
They are being threatened by buildings and development work and thus affect the rest and the loss of rest.
The power supply of electricity and lighting poses a threat, such as chemical treatment of paper and paper construction materials, as well as attacks on cattle.

There are 38 major gardens with 76,000 square kilometres of land, which are very important for the protection of more than 270 historical buildings throughout the country.
There are ten trained experts who regularly carry out research, check the resting place, and sometimes rescue.
The organization has even established the first conservation area in the Srivet Garden in Tunfris and Galocau, and eight of the ten species of Srivets live in the area.
Local economist David Thompson points out that this garden is his ideal place.
He spoke in Sriv, and I had a very suitable place.
I've got an old building, lots of old trees and all the good restrooms.
However, there are a lot of things I don't know about the fungi, so my work here and elsewhere will help me to better understand how they need to grow.
He emphasized the importance of rape before it took place in a physical society, since it could lead to the death of more than 400 babies and children or to the death of children in all places.
The protection of the immune system is illegal when it comes to the capture, seizure, seizure or destruction of its respiratory tract.
Elizabeth Ferrel, a member of the Sügland Foundation for the Protection of Trust Fund, urged the public to participate and help.
He said, "I still have much to learn about farmland, but only for many species, I don't know what it's like.
Ronaldo was charged with rape because the lawyer was going to charge the German magazine.
Christiano Ronaldo claims to rape his real false news and wants to make a public announcement using his name.
His lawyer began to accuse the German press of the charges of this crime.
This former Portuguese-Yuventus was accused of rape by a woman named Catherine Meoga of the United States of America in the Las Vegas Hotel.
According to the "Fifth Week" report, he paid $37.5 million for a woman at the time and was unable to track it.
After a few hours of reports from Soo, Ronaldo spoke to the left in a live video about the 1.42 billion-dollar posters and attacked the news reporters' false news.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
The five-billion-dollars were told by the owner of the settlement, and he was told by the newspaper today.
He wanted to praise himself with my name.
It is normal to feel some stress when we are given special attention.
He wanted to name me because he wanted to name me, but it's part of the system's work.
The player smiles at me and says I'm a happy man, and it's good to see you.
According to a road news report, Ronaldo's lawyer was starting to accuse him of being "inadvertent" and he accused him of being "unacceptable news about suspicious practices in the private area".
Lawyer Christian Shelter pointed out that this member would call for a "degradation" and a significant amount of physical damage", which could be the most serious violations of human rights in recent years.
According to the event, it occurred in the summer of June 2009 in a hotel in the Raswigs Park.
A document submitted by the local court in Clarke, Nevada, showed that after a meeting with Ronaldo and Meoca at night and then returned to the club room, he was raped.
Meoca claimed that Ronaldo had been killed after the alleged incident, and he said "99 per cent" as a good person, but "1 per cent" had disappointed him.
The document called Ronaldo's recognition of sexual behaviour, but both sides agreed.
Meoga also complained that she went to the police station to compare her injuries to those of the hospital, but later because she felt that she would be compensated and worried about being publicly humiliated, she agreed to make peace outside the court.
This 34-year-old woman said that she was looking for a reconciliation agreement at home because her heart had not been affected by the incident.
Ronaldo was planning to sign a contract with the U.S.
The United Kingdom is going to regret losing its car manufacturer forever.
The Minister of Commerce Greg Clarke said that if the British were to lose the position of the world's car manufacturer after leaving Europe, the British would always regret it.
He told British companies that if Britain leaves the EU under unaccompanied conditions, it would stop production near Deby, which is very disturbing.
Mr. Clarke said I needed to reach an agreement.
The Japanese car manufacturer says that if the UK does not reach an agreement, the negative effects of the border extension may lead to unemployment.
There are nearly 150,000 cars in the production of old-time Berneston cars, which are produced by Australia and Einstein, 90 per cent of which are exported to other parts of the EU.
Mr. Marvin Cooke, President of Berneston, said that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, my employer will stop.
Other British car manufacturers, including China, have been concerned about the cross-border operation of the EU in the absence of an agreement.
For example, Mammal manufacturers say that after Britain leaves Europe, it will close a month of small business in Cosin.
The main concern with the car manufacturer is related to the supply risk mentioned in the context of the Council resolution.
The production chain of the country is run at the time of production. The suppliers of the United Kingdom and the EU supply details every 37 minutes using the production car.
If Britain leaves the EU in a situation where it has not reached an agreement on 29 March, the border may be disturbed, as it were, by what is called the internal market, which may lead to an increase in error and a lack of detail.
The company indicated that there was no possibility that the stocks in the Debian factory could not be more than a few days, and if the production of the plant would stop.
Clark stated that Teresa Mee had a left-wing school in the future with the EU in order to avoid a border inspection post.
I just need to reach an agreement. He's with BBC's fourth electric show today, and I'm looking forward to having the greatest interests, without interrupting the current success, and ordering us to take this opportunity.
There is evidence from other producers that I really need to continue this very successful supply.
The country is unable to speak about the specific time of the stopover, but since long notice has been issued, increased costs will reduce labour force and ultimately lead to unemployment.
Peter worked for 24 years in the Berneston factory and gathered in the Union, and his colleagues became more and more concerned: With my experience, after he lost his job, he would never return to his place of work.
A Government speaker said: I have already presented a clear and credible plan for the future relationship with the EU.
The White Paper states that the meeting with Tranup and Cuchistan is likely to be postponed again.
The White Week showed that because of the ongoing trial by the Supreme Court of the nomination of Brit Kavanou, Donad Tranup and Vice-General Inspector General of the High Risk Meeting of President Rod Roxistan may be delayed for a week.
The Special Legal Supervision of Russia asked Robert Muller about the work he was doing in connection with Russia's election, the association between the Trannuts and the Russians and the actions of the President that might interfere with justice.
Tranup will not release the Deputy Chief Inspector General for employment in order to jeopardize the independence of Muller, a language spoken in Washington, Washington, D.C., for several months.
In the first month of the month, "The Hour of the Covenant" report, the Russian Federation discussed the left-wing online record of dialogue with Tranunpur, and the possibility of the President being exempted through Amendment No. 25 of the Act.
The report was rejected by Russia.
But last week, he went to the White House, and there were reports of his work.
On the contrary, Thursday announced a meeting with Tranpus in the United States at the time.
At the hearing, Kavanno and Dr. Christine Brassie Fort, both of the women who were accused of sexual misconduct, said that he was willing not to expel Rosanstan to avoid a dispute with the Court of Justice.
On Friday, the Federal Investigations Board ordered a weekly investigation into the alleged events of Kavanaugh, and gradually postponed the full vote of the House of Commons.
The Secretary of the newspaper Sala Sanders of Tranpu appeared on Facebook on Sunday.
He was asked about the Day of the Russian Congress: It is possible that this week, taking into account all the other cases of the Supreme Court in the course of the week, I think it would be possible to postpone the week.
But if I'm going to fall, I'm always trying to get the media to know the latest situation.
Since September 10, Sandes has never made a press release.
The president, Chris Walley, asked for an explanation.
Although he spoke to Sands about a lack of information and didn't agree to his point of view because of the hate TV reporters:
The direct link between Tranup and the media will then be increased.
He offered proof that there were more presidents before the president's polls. I've read the number.
Sands' presentation is still going to be done, but if there is an opportunity for the media to contact the President of the United States directly, it would be much better for him to join me.
I've been trying to do a lot, and you've been doing me a lot in the past few weeks, when you can talk to the President of the United States and tell me you're going to have a press conference.
Tranup is often questioned when he leaves the White House or attends a public meeting or a press conference.
A few newspapers will be published.
This week in New York President might prove to be a point of order in front of the press, and sometimes it's strange.
The Secretary of Health wrote a letter to the EU member of the National Health Services Association of the United Kingdom.
The Secretary of Health of the United Kingdom wrote a letter of appreciation to the EU members of the National Health Services Association of Scotland and hoped that he would continue to stay in Scotland after his departure.
The President of the Finnish Parliament, Janine Freeman, sent a letter to the European Union not for six months after leaving the United Kingdom.
The Government of Scotland has already paid for the application for residency of EU citizens working at the Ministry of Public Service's Ministry of Lower Affairs.
Ms. Freman wrote on his letter: In the summer, Britain and the EU continued to discuss the issue of withdrawals, hoping to make a decision this summer.
However, the British Government is also more prepared to prevent a situation that cannot be reached.
I know it's a very disturbing time for everyone to talk to you.
This is why I want to reiterate that regardless of their nationality, I pay very much attention to the work of every member.
The experience and technology of the EU and other countries have been enhanced and improved in the provision of services, and the benefits of my services are enjoyed by patients and communities.
I'd like to see you stay here.
Cristian Abbey's head was injured.
According to a report by Michael O'Argen, Denmark, a former member of the D'Aberctian Abercungbi's D'A's D'A's D'A's team was injured on Saturday 31-27 and was subsequently subjected to left-wing emergency surgery.
Professor Rod Reed spoke of injuries that occurred in the middle of the day.
Leed says he's on the edge of the game, and there's a hole in it.
The trainer and the doctor took Abbek from the field of oxygen at the end of the game and then picked it up and brought it back to his step-by-step check.
Chris Haresz, a prominent member of the state of Denmark, spoke at the University of Washington, D.C., and performed left surgery at the Medbilt Medical Center.
Harris also added that there is no information on the type/level of injury that is currently in progress in the state of Denmark.
He was a two-year-old student of the Red Cross in Abkhazia, the first season of the race in the state of Ilynoi.

Mr. Kolkan announced that the reform recommendations for the series of comments, including rental control and closure of the strike, were not wrong.
He also hoped that the Assembly would have greater power to build a new house.

It's because they're arguing on the Internet compared to Mom's and Grandma's.
A breast-feeding company has launched an online debate on the basis of an announcement of mother-in-law relationship with breast-feeding.
In order to produce a voice called "the first silently dressed infant in the world," consumer technology company Elva published a short video of the opening of a live music show that features the freedom of the new nurse to bring her mother to her.
Four real moms sang in the cornfields and sang: "It's wrong, I'm smoking my own milk, but you don't see it at the end of the day," and "If you don't know it's milk, I'll tell you that it's my milk."
The deputy continues: "I'm going out, I'm going out, I'm going to go out, I'm going out, I'm going out, I'm going to hang out my milk."
However, when the notice was published on the company’s main page, the online conversation was raised.
The film has a total of 77,000 visitors and hundreds of comments, and many people have a similar reaction. Many people have easily described the "blackness of the dairy industry".
"The product is not published with milk in a wise decision.
It's like I'm pregnant, and he needs to have an abortion before he can have it, unless his baby is born. "There's one person who's been arguing.
The algae can be placed in the breast of the breast.
There is another argument: "It's easy to understand that it's harmful to the mother and the baby.
But is it wrong to understand that this sucker can feed his beautiful mother?
There are also people who add: "It's a fact-finding warning."
There's someone who's trying to protect it, and a woman says she thinks it's funny.
"I think this is a good idea.
If I'm breast-feeding, I'll buy a return.
I feel like I'm a cow.
It's a little crazy, but I'm afraid I'm going to go get his own stuff.
It's a divine product." One comment.
Another argues: "The announcement is interesting, and he wants Mom to feel like "a cow" when she is breast-feeding (usually in the place of a place of work or a place of work).
He is not a lawyer or a critic of the dairy industry.
At the end of the short story, a group of women revealed that she had been taking a baby dance in the heart of the text.
The idea behind the movement is that women who use a lot of drugs feel that they have a deep sense of how they look like cows.
However, the algae can do a complete silence, shut down any electronic channels, and be carefully inserted into the breast of the breast, free of women's activity, hold the baby, and even get out of the streets when it is breast-feeding.
Anna Baralin is a mother's partner and creative supervisor: Elfi is a product that has a new meaning and is worthy of great effort and effort.

However, Mualim stressed that the agreement had "a clear period of time", he said that he hoped that military action would bring an end to the fighting against the Holy War, including the Nasla fighter who was associated with the base, who would "get rid of the ground".

Mualim suggested that the Government of Georgia should join the new committee, saying that the new committee's working arrangements "check the rules of existing law," while warning that it could not interfere with other matters.

In response to Bret Kavano's testimony to the Court of Justice in the House of Commons, Pelosi said: "I am impatient, and if a woman has ever had a similar performance, she will talk about 'Siding'."
Bret Kavano strongly denied his sexual allegations of sexual abuse, Christen Blessie Fort, when he was born after his daughter-in-law.
Kavano was very active in the opening period when he talked about his family with high school students, at the same time with high school students and at the same time with high school students.
He made it clear that he was a member of the Commission's Democratic Party and that his accusations against him were "the murder of a man organized by Freeman", which he was disappointed by the failure of Hilary Clinton in his presidential election in 2016.
He argued that Cavano's testimony proved that he could not serve in the Supreme Court because he had a preference for those of the Democratic Party.
He said, "I think that his speech and his way of attacking women and Democrats had been qualified to serve in the Supreme Court."
When asked if the Democratic Party has more seats in the House of Commons and if Kawano is sure he will try to shoot Kakawano when he tries to shoot him.
"What I want to say is, if he does not speak the truth to the National or Federal Investigations Board, he will not cease to be qualified to serve the Supreme Court and the Supreme Court of the House."
Kavano is now a judge in Washington, D.C., who is a patrol of the Court of Appeal.
In addition, as a democratic party, he was concerned about the possible decision made by Kavanaugh on "the Equal Treatment Act" or the Roicade case. Henry Wood is considered to be a judge in a custody unit.
At the hearing of the evidence, Kawano avoided the issue of raising a decision of the Supreme Court at the council.
"Perosic: "In a house in the middle of a desert, someone who has a prejudice to go to the court to wait for me to speak to him, not to be good?"
The lady needs to run it.
This was in a kind of justice, and for months or even years of anger, he broke his mouth.
Mrs. Steinam told me 45 years later: "When I'm out of my mind, I want to cry. "
I think this is unusual. What do you say?"
He went on to say, "A woman who once served as a senior officer in a certain place helped me a lot, he said, when he was very shy and then didn't become a skill, when he started to cry, he would say to someone next to him, "I'm tired, and you think I'm not happy?"
"I'm in a good mood."
And then he kept walking.
I think it's good for me.
Eyewater is a form of propagation allowed, some of which has been misinformed since its beginning.
I used to be at the office of a man's leadership position for years, and I was impressed by the depth of the way he was used to express himself in the language that he was very proud of, when a year later a woman grabbed my back and dragged me into the building, where he was the manager of a cold winter business, and I was amazed every day.
He said to me, "Kick knows you're crazy!"
He doesn't know you're in a lot of trouble.
Because he cares about you, he'll feel sorry for you.
Paul Schlod, a member of the Democratic Party of Colorado, once cooperated with him in the presidential election of Gary Hart.
In the summer of 1987, in a ship named Monkey Business, Hatter found himself out of wedlock. He resigned from the election. He felt that it was a shame to think that he had abandoned the presidential election for his reasons.
He laughed at me after 30 years, saying, "It's not a wise decision."
There are seven candidates who have won the election, and they don't need more than one.
He's called "The White Prince and seven little boys."
The matter has been called for a vote and his vote has been postponed, so he swears, unless he has reached $200 million, if he does not participate in the election.
This place is in the valley of waste.
He found that his salary was $1,000 for men, but his salary was $250.
He said, "I don't think I've got a headache?"
When he announced in his speech, he would no longer launch official electoral campaigns, and he would share his feelings – he was shocked – thanks to the fact that it was very difficult to pay tribute and not on behalf of the electoral board, and that he was very disappointed at the fact that he was not represented.
Sherwood reacted to her voice and said, "Do you think I'm on the line?"
You all think it's nice to be in my company to help.
I'm in the middle of the day. He'll write a poem on my graveyard.
"Is he crying?"
In the Central American War, he had a lot to say about China?
Experts say that the outbreak of the Great War in Central America has not ended, but in the long run, divisions between the two countries may benefit from China's development.
In the early part of this year, US President Donald Tranpe issued the first warning against the use of solar panels, solar panels and lead and lead in China's main export products.
On this week, the price of a new product of US$2,000 billion (U.S.) was high, and the price of a new product was high on the market, which actually accounted for half of the US exports from China.
China collects 5 to 10 per cent of US-US$ 600 billion goods on a daily basis with similar control measures.
China swears that it's going to take over the United States, and the world's second-class economy can take a step in a short time.
The United States is like a waste, but it is too small for it to be sold to the United States in public.
While experts say that if China can handle the cards there, U.S. military forces may go through a reduction in the interdependence of two economic bodies and long-term talk to China about a number of them.
A new U.S. Security Center, an expert in Asian research, a political decision taken by Abigail Greesco, the United States or China, may lead to an economic downturn for these two countries, leading to an economic downturn, which is actually more dangerous for the spectators.

There are still 600 million people living in the country, and there is a need for humanitarian assistance.
Mualim spoke of the right of the Government of Syria to direct the reconstruction of the ruins of the country.
However, he stressed that he would not receive assistance from countries that supported the rebellion.
The Europeans fought in Paris.
The Red Cross was held at the golf course outside Paris, France, and the European team was finally defeated by 16.5:10.5 compared to the United States team, and the European team arrived at the Red Cross Championship in 2018.
The U.S. Army has now continued six losses in European competitions, and since 1993 it has been repatriated to the Red Cross in Europe.
The Danish team leader Thomas Biann defeated the US team by 14.5 compared with the European team. The European team reconnaissanced the army.
In most of the time of this competition, U.S. St. St. Michaelson did not show much good, especially during the 16th triangular hole, he jumped into the water and lost Francisco Morenaly.
Morinary, a golfer in Italy, has been well behaved in these circles since 1979 and has been a winner of the five-part game since the turn of 1979.
U.S. footballer Jordan Spietz, compared to 4:5, lost the lowest number of Danish players in the European team.

I don't cry when I'm at ease, but I can't stay out today.
And in a year of hard work.
Well, Thomas chose to believe me.
I'm so happy to take it back.
After crossing the European Union into the army, Garcia said excitedly: "It can help the team, and I'm really happy."
He launched a fire by his colleague John Ram, Lam, who won 2 p.m. on Sunday in Led's contest with the U.S. golfers Teg Vuz.
23-year-old Rampane says: "I win Tigg Woods, I'm really proud of myself and he's grown up with me."
Vuz has won 4 matches in France, and he currently won 13-21 matches in the Red Cross.
In this remarkable data, he was one of the most successful players in history, and he won 14 championships and was one of Jack Niklaus.
In addition to Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas, Tony Frenn played a high-quality role in golf, and other members of the United States team worked hard to win the race for the weekend.
His team's performance was disappointing, and U.S. team leader Jim Forrick said: "He's been working hard and I'm proud of him."
For a while, I've put pressure on Europe.
We cancel.
Tomas.
He was a good leader.
He's got 12 players doing well.
I'll reorganize it, and I'll work with the U.S. professional golf team with the Red Cross Committee, and move forward.
I'm very pleased with 12 members of the team, who can take the lead, and I'm happy.
You're going to give him honor by lowering your hat.
I'm out of my mind.
