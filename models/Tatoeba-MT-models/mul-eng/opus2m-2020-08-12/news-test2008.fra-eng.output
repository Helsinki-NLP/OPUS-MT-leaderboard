Inflation in Europe has depleted on food
Accelerate inflation, measured in the euro area, is mainly due to rapid rise in food prices.
In November, price increases in the 13 countries of the euro area were more important than forecasting, after an inflation rate of 2.6 per cent in October, an annual inflation of 3.1 per cent was recorded, indicated the European Community's statistics office in Luxembourg.
The official estimates indicated only 3 per cent, reported Bloomberg.
Unlike the United States, British and Canadian central banks, the European Central Bank (ECB) has not reduced the rate of direct interest by saying that the decrease in interest, with the increase in prices of raw materials and the decline in unemployment rates, would lead to the generation of an inflationist spiral.
The ECB would like to maintain the inflation rate below but nearly two per cent.
According to one analyst, the ECB's catch 22 is: "it needs to be dissuasive" inflation so that it can no longer intervene on this issue.
In Germany, the inflation rate of 3.3 per cent is a record over the past 12 years and in Spain, it has been raised from 3.6 to 4.1.
Inflation in the euro area has resulted in a rapid increase in food and energy prices.
The end-market rates of cereals have increased by 88 percent and the soja course has also reached its highest value since 1973.
The price of food oil and dairy products also increased considerably in 2007.
This year, the global oil price increased by 52 percent, and in the last month, a gold barrel cost almost $100.
According to the ECB, in 2008, the inflation rate will go from 2.1, this year, to 2.5 per cent, but in 2009, it will fall to 1.9.
According to analysts, the inflation rate of 12 months remains around 3 per cent, however, in the next 3 to 4 months, the average annual rate will be 2.1 per cent.
At the same time, they expect the ECB to decrease its direct rate twice in 2008.
Gallup indicates a government crisis
After a long stagnation, the number of participants in the Fidesz (Aliance des Young Democrats) has increased significantly early in December. Thus since 2002, it has now had the largest number of participants, while Gallup (Institution Institute) has never seen such low socialist support, namely 13 percent.
For the faithful electors, the difference would be more than two thirds (71 percent) of support from a fifth (20 percent) to the Hungarian Socialist Party because of the largest determination of the opposition electors.
According to the survey, the MDF (Hongo Democrats Forum) and the SZDSZ (Free Democrat Alliance) are below the parliamentary threshold: their support is 2 per cent in the entire population.
On some faithful voters to vote, the number of participants from both parties increased by 1 per cent.
The economic climate has continued to deteriorate as compared to the previous lowest point, the proportion of those who thought that the country's economic situation was particularly severe has never been so high, which is 41 per cent and 46 per cent additional.
Following the more optimistic prospects of the past spring and summer, families are again more pessimistic about their financial situation.
For the next year, the majority of the population is planning an increase and only one tenth is planning to improve the situation.
In December last, 71 per cent of those interviewed, namely a majority of those who had never seen before in Gallup's previous surveys, felt that the Prime Minister was doing his job better than good.
13 per cent of respondents have confidence in Ferenc Gyurcsány, while 38 per cent support Viktor Orbán.
54 per cent are not trusted by the Prime Minister and 27 per cent by the President of Fidesz.
One of the indicators of political change is the ratio of society to think that the satisfaction of the Prime Minister can be treated without change of government.
While 35 per cent of the candidates wanted the Government and the Prime Minister to remain in office after the last October elections, this rate is currently only 20 per cent. The relative majority (33 per cent) believe that holding new elections would be the solution to this situation.
In the matter of the intention to vote, 60 per cent of the respondents replied that they would probably vote and 20 per cent of the additional said they would probably vote.
In order to make the comparison, for a "legislative election to organize next Sunday", only 55 per cent of candidates would certainly participate and 15 per cent would probably participate.
74 per cent of people would not be entitled to enrollment in higher education, 79 per cent would not be available for consultation costs, and 84 per cent would not be available for hospital stays.
When we only look at the same proportions among the people who have expressed their intention to vote in the referendum, 81, 84 and 89 per cent of voters would reject the introduction of registration rights, consultation fees and hospital residence fees.
Auchan is the cheapest, Tesco has increased its prices by nearly twenty percent
The hypermarkets implemented in the Budaurs trade triangle maintained the average increase in prices of 16 per cent in the last year to the difference that this year's VAT rate did not increase.
Article de Napi Agriculture (Economie perday)
This year, in the Budaörs trade triangle, the usual Christmas pane has also increased by 16 per cent on average, with a net increase of over one thousand barrels in all hypermarkets.
The prices, "which were already involved" in the large food stores in last December, were no longer significantly increased compared to the previous high base.
However, consumers are obviously shocked to see that the articles bought in the course of less than nine thousand dollars last year now cost more than ten thousand dollars.
The daily Panier in the ordered hypermarkets has exceeded 91 forts, at least the psychological threshold of ten thousand forts.
And the highest value of the panel was 10,573 forts.
(In 2003, this value was 6,800 units.)
The prices of the Union and living fish remained almost at the level of last year, but the prices of the ring ring, neck and tail have increased considerably.
In stores, the price of bread and bread followed the data of the KSH (Central Institute of Statistics) but, at Auchan, bread was found from a kilogram of bread to 139 pounds per day.
Competition has not reduced the price of the product below 200 barrels.
It was also surprising that in this hypermarket, the price of two litres of Coca-Cola was below 200 litres, so it did not cost 257 litres of the marked bottle.
It does not prevent this year, in the end of Panier daily, Auchan was the most expensive and Cora was the least expensive.
According to our calculations, Cora increased the price of her daily Panier by 15 per cent while Tesco and Auchan increased them by about 18 per cent and 18 per cent respectively.
By comparing the closest panel of the last year and the smallest panel of this year, we find a difference of 12 per cent while the difference between the smallest panel of the last year and the closest of this year is 21 per cent.
Prices increased by 1,480 per cent.
Last year, prices increased by 1,206 averages, while knowing that the impact of the increase in VAT rates had already been noted in Christmas prices last year.
This process has made trade simpler, hypermarkets could not clearly determine which margin to apply on products as long as they were unable to predict the impact of the change in consumer prices.
(If a trader calculates the rotation of a product, he is likely to lose a significant profit on the margin adapted to the intensity of the trade.)
As a result of the change in VAT rate, the increase in the prices of the daily Panier has soared so much that the closest panel was over 1,720 for the 2006 value of that for which the difference between the smallest panels was not more than 844 for the 844.
This year, the difference was not so extreme because the highest value of the panel was over 1,630 forts over the last year and the lowest forts also increased from 1,284 forts.
As Christmas approaches the two seasons, we have seen a catastrophic increase in prices, which has increased by more than 30 per cent in the hypermarkets in less than 20 months.
(This does not necessarily confirm KSH data: for some first-time foods, the Institute of Statistics has found a price increase of more than 30 per cent in 12 months.
This is the case, for example, of flour and bread.)
According to the Last Day Panel, this seems almost absurd because the price level of this product has already increased by more than 10 per cent over the last year compared to the base.
According to the indicators, flour suppliers occupy a stronger position than eggs suppliers because they have been able to accept the brutal increase in prices also by multinationals.
In the commercial gold triangle, hypermarkets do not complain, they constantly record good years.
According to our experience, most customers no longer look at prices in the three hypermarkets.
They buy everything in quantity, they take long-term food by pallets.
Wednesday mornings of important issues were formed in the case of three hypermarkets as the number of customers increased sharply.
However, according to our information, the number of business is less important in the province, and many multinationals complain to polling companies not only that the number of business planned is not only for food but also for sustainable consumption.
Many hospitals make the economy of disinfectants
This year, more than a thousand infections, mainly caused by the misuse of antibiotics, have been registered in hospitals.
The health conditions of hospitals, the number of beds, the overrun of medical personnel do not help to block infections, says the doctor at the National Centre for Epidemiology.
Many hospitals also provide the economy for disinfectants
There has not been a long time since an MRSA infection has been diagnosed with the hospital’s traumatology service of János.
The antibiotic resistant bacteria have been detected in a hospitalized man following a serious accident.
The disease has been isolated.
At the beginning of the year a similar infection occurred in the same place.
The injury of a serious car accident is from the hospital but soon after it was returned because of an MRSA infection, and since then the doctors have not been able to perform an important operation because of the bacteria in her body.
Up to 10 December of this year, 1,094 hospital infections caused by a multi-resistant pathogen have been reported to the national system of economic surveillance, Karolina Böröcz, a doctor at the National Centre for Epidemiology.
To know that this is the number of infections caused by a multi-resistant pathogen agent that has actually been registered in hospitals and for the rest of us, we have no information.
About two thirds of the infections (683 infections) have been caused by the MRSA, which is said to be the gold staphylococcus resistant to methicillin-oxacilline.
A third of the people are carriers of Staphylococcus gold (SA) bacteria in their noses without developing a disease.
SA infections (such as angina, amygdalitis, skin infections, traumatized infections) respond well to antibiotics, which are easily cured.
However, if antibiotics are used excessively or inappropriately, the bacteria, which reacts well to antibiotics, will develop a highly resistant bacteria that will rapidly spread into adverse hospital conditions.
In the event of temporary or prolonged operation of the immune system, this bacteria may cause serious hospital infections such as traumatised infection or septaemia, on elderly patients, small weights or having a weak organism.
According to hospital director János, there is nothing special about MRSA infections, these infections are part of the hospital's daily routine.
In particular, there is no need to confuse the infection with the epidemic, there is no MRSA alone or no search for it, Tibor Nyulasi said.
SAs are resistant to antibiotics.
"These diseases are isolated, the care staff wearing rubber gloves and protective masks and we have antibiotics suitable for their care," said Tibor Nyulasi.
In the first place, hospitalised patients are examined if they are carrying MRSA, but the infection cannot always be avoided.
The sampling is not in mode
The vast majority of infections caused by MRSA could be prevented, but current conditions and circumstances are not favourable in Hungarian hospitals to prevent the development and proliferation of multi-resistant pathogen agents, says Karolina Böröcz.
As this infection occurs mainly in hospitals and in the residential areas of elderly people, hospitals should control hospitalized diseases and immediately isolate MRSA carrying diseases.
However, microbiological removal is not in fashion in Hungarian hospitals.
It should be noted that the National Social Security Fund does not finance these reviews.
Most cases see the day only if MRSA infection is detectable on the disease, the doctor in charge of the epidemiological center told him.
The European Union has strict recommendations on the appropriate use of antibiotics in human medicine and there are also Hungarian guidelines for the treatment of certain infections and diseases.
Efforts should be made to target antibiotics, that is, microbiological examinations should be carried out in order to prevent drug resistance, but hospitals do not always take it into account.
The implementation of microbiological removals is even more rare in ambulances and basic care, Karolina Börcz reported.
Many hospitals make the economy of disinfectants
Scientific evidence shows that MRSA spreads from one disease to another most often through medical personnel.
It is therefore essential to wash your hands, put your hands and your protection masks. However, important defects are also detected in hospitals.
The MRSA is spread by infection transmitted by inhalation of gouttelettes and by contact. However, due to conditions in Hungarian hospitals, contaminated disease cannot always be isolated.
In addition, rooms are often full, beds are often too close to each other, while patients should be kept away from each other at least 1.5 metres.
Unfortunately, we also note that hospitals, in a difficult financial situation, are making savings on disinfectants, lack of nurses, there are many diseases, and the risk of contamination is even greater, Karolina Böröcz said.
According to Karolina Böröcz, in hospitals or preventive measures, the number of infections is less demonstrated or the spread of the pathogen may be blocked.
Government project against MRSA
The treatment of the MRSA infection represents exorbitant expenditure for social security cases, which is why we are fighting this infection everywhere.
In England, for example, the Government has set up a programme to prevent or reduce the impact of MSAs.
According to the published data, this programme is effective and MRSA infections show a growing trend in England.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) shows among its priorities the prevention of the incidence of multi-resistant pathogens (such as MRSAs) and the prevention of hospital infections caused by these pathogens.
The Commissioner, the author of a fatal accident, was not in a state of irritability.
The official record of the fatal accident caused by the Commissioner of the 22nd round was drawn up.
It may be excluded that the Commissioner of the 22nd rounding, decommissioner of his post since, who has been excommunicated by his last Tuesday's death, would have been in a state of irritability or shock, communicated to the saleswoman Attila Morvai, spokesman of the public ministry of the capital after the relevant finding had been established.
The finding confirmed the first result of the investigation that the former Commissioner had not consumed alcohol before the flight.
Last Tuesday, the former chief of the 22nd round commission broke a 55-year-old man who was facing him when he turned, with his personal car, into the 22nd rounds street of Kossuth Lajos. The man wanted to cross the road without passing through the passage for pedestrians.
(In addition, the fact that it crossed the road outside the passage for pedestrians does not constitute a disturbing circumstance, according to the Road Code, a vehicle which starts a crossing must let the pedestrians pass.)
The peton died after being transported to the hospital.
Following this incident, the Commissioner resigned from his position and asked for his retirement because, according to the police report, the accident was very disturbing.
The investigation on this case is carried out by the Budapest Investigations Park.
Attila Morva also mentioned that the former Commissioner had cooperated from the beginning with the judges responsible for conducting the investigation.
EUR 400 million additional for infrastructure
János Veres, Minister of Finance of Hungary, and Marta Gajecka, Vice-President of the European Investment Bank (EIB), signed three agreements on a total value of EUR 400 million on a credit line to support education, transport infrastructure and the environment and energy.
In 2006, the European Investment Bank (EIB) adopted a budget of EUR 300 million for the financing of the Hungarian transport and environmental projects from the Cohesion Fund with a loan of EUR 100 million already signed by the parties.
The Euros 150 million credit agreement also concerns the budgetary financing of education projects.
The EIB has approved a total of EUR 300 million for Hungary, the remaining EUR 150 million will be used later, following the extension of the credit contract.
The parties signed a 50 million euro contract for innovation, and the state budget will use this envelope first in the context of the Debrecen University research and development project.
During the negotiations, draft line 4 of the Metro was also addressed.
The parties agreed that they would discuss the possible amendment of the initial contract when Hungary would finalise the details of the metro financing with the EU.
According to János Veres, this could be done in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, EIB has allocated EUR 8.4 billion to funding 113 projects in Hungary.
The EIB shall grant its appropriations at the interest rate related to EURIBOR, with a period of 8 years and without a commitment committee.
Bulgaria, EU real estate market paradise
The evolution of the Bulgarian real estate market is spectacular, and the attention of all of Europe is turned towards this country of the Balkans not mentioned by the past.
What, or who has bought on this EU market that is still the least expensive but will soon become expensive?
Analysis of the Bulgarian division of Re/Max.
Currently, in the real estate, Bulgaria is undoubtedly the most popular destination in Eastern Europe with its ski apartments and houses on the market.
In the mountains, the most popular regions are Bansko, Borvec, Pamproo and Vitosa and, on the seaside, Albena, the "Sables de'", the "Sale of the Sun", the old Sozopol and Nessebar, but more and more are looking for a building in the Kavarna and Balcik region as well.
According to the analysts of Re/Max Bulgaria, soon or later, the central region of the country, known as Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, Triavna, will also be aware of the interest of investors and they are also more and more to buy in the very small corner of Russia.
Sofia, the capital, offers attractive opportunities as well, trade and office surfaces promise the highest rate of amortization.
Bulgaria is on the best way to become one of Europe's most attractive golf paradises and thus to be a priority destination, after the summer season and the winter season, also in the other two seasons of the year.
More vigilant investors are already buying large numbers, for example in the Bansko neighborhood.
According to analysts, people who buy an apartment in Bulgaria are looking at the same time to change their lives, their lifestyle.
Most buyers are English but others come from France, Belgium, Spain and more from Romania.
Maltese and Cypriot investors are also present. Along the Black Sea and the most famous ski resorts, we will traditionally meet many Russian buyers.
Foreign buyers are divided into three groups, says Georgik Jankov, Regional Director of Re/Max Bulgaria.
People who are able to install buy renovated buildings, at a price ranging from EUR 50 to EUR 100 billion, or old rented houses, at a price ranging from EUR 5 to EUR 15 billion, which is then renewed.
The criteria are easy access and communication opportunities, the proximity of a large city, stores and generally that of a local doctor.
The second group includes secondary residents purchasers (since December last, Bulgaria has been mentioned among the first 10 holiday destinations in Germany).
The third group consists of commercial investors who buy in hopes of achieving a higher average or long-term value.
The price of capital property increases without interruption from the fact that a demand for more and more strong is being applied.
In the European Union, real estate prices are the lowest in Bulgaria, but in the last five years, they have increased by 21 per cent per year.
The increase in real estate prices is essentially more than the increase in wages.
Fodor and six percent Hungarian
According to Gábor Fodor, Minister for the Environment and Water, the meetings of professionals will end on Tuesday, but Wednesday, after the official opening, negotiations of ministers on the post-2012 international climate regime will continue.
Experts and political men from 192 countries around the world will discuss the Bali Roadmap designed to define efforts to be made after the emission reduction period defined by the Kyoto Protocol until 2012.
At this time, lively discussions were held between developing countries and developed countries.
The United States also reported that they did not currently want to discuss accurate figures, but they were ready to sign an agreement on reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 from 25 to 40 per cent compared to 1990 levels.
Another important issue of the Conference is whether developed countries are committed, without reducing emissions, to providing financial and technological assistance to countries in need.
An agreement was also signed on assistance to developing countries.
The aid fund defined by the Kyoto Protocol will be managed by a Governing Council composed of 16 members likely within the framework of the United Nations Global Environment Fund (GEF), communicated to Piac ê Benefit (Markhe and profit).
The six percent of Hungary
On behalf of Hungary, Gábor Fodor, Minister for Environment and Water, reaffirms the EU's ambition to maintain its role as an Arab ship in global efforts to protect the climate and to encourage the signing of the new international agreement before 2009.
The Minister explained that the EU was committed to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 20 per cent by 2020 compared to the level reached in 1990, regardless of the success of the signing of the 2012 Agreement, and was ready to reduce them by up to 30 per cent if other major regions of the world and/or developing countries were also ready to take appropriate commitments to their responsibilities and capacities.
Gábor Fodor recalled that in 1997, the Kyoto Protocol's signatory countries had totalled a 5.2 per cent reduction and a total of 15 EU members at that time had committed to 8 per cent less.
Hungary has undertaken to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 6 per cent compared to the period between 1985 and 1987, our country will fulfil its commitment, recalling the press release of the Ministry of the Environment.
The challenge is large in Bali because the long-term international climate policy agreement must be put in place within the two-year period, unless the entry into force of the agreement would certainly be postponed after 2012. In this case, the commitments to reduce below the values provided for in the Kyoto Protocol would not be immediately followed by a new international emission reduction system which was highlighted in the new IPCC report, which received the United Nations Nobel Peace Prize for Climate Change.
The reduction in emissions would be delayed and the increase in earth's average temperature of more than 2 degrees Celsius could no longer be avoided, which, according to scientists, would have extremely serious and irrevocable consequences.
British Army recruited on YouTube
The British Army units communicate, on the video sharing site, recordings made during their operations in Iraq and Afghanistan in order to become popular.
First of all, it is the British Air Force (RAF) that has been passionate about YouTube: the special units in Afghanistan are playing a key role in the video sequences of operations against the Taliban since March 2006, announced the BBC.
These recordings, taken with the help of small cameras mounted on the deck, are controlled in the general area of air force operations in Kandahar and are then transferred to London or the co-owners of cash on the Internet.
The political message is inconceivable
Air Force soldiers have already spent 139 sequences on the net this way and their "chain" has been seen by more than 75 thousand people.
The British Department of Defence was registered as "defence headquarters" in spring 2007 and reported videos on operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, while the Ministry of Commonwealth Office and the international peacekeeping forces in Iraq (MNFI) also have their own channels on YouTube.
Mission and Afghanistan
According to the original goal of the Air Force, the videos were passed on the net to recruit. According to the Ministry of Defence, they were also used to make known to the public the real objectives of the presence of the army abroad.
The propaganda published by this road is practically nothing compared to the usual advertising on television, communicated to BBC Gordon Mackenzie in defence. On the other hand, it also inevitably carries a political message because it provides special justification for well-founded military operations decided by the government.
The Americans made a game
The army is embroiled because, despite carefully composed and censored videos, amateur videos are passed on the distribution site that also present the death of soldiers: in the "officials" propaganda films a bit of hypocritics, officers do not avoid talking about losses but never present the bloody side of the fight.
In addition, many videos have already been on the web presenting operations areas in Iraq and Afghanistan that have been carried out on a real mission, but the British army has only been in charge of these videos since recently.
The Americans are recruiting a little differently as they serve the American's Army rifle game free of charge. In this game the player can put himself directly into the position of soldiers in a more or less real simulation.
Tombala Christmas and benign in departments
Monika Lamperth, Minister of Labour, does not seem to be sensitive: instead of celebrating Christmas, she will hold a final annual meeting with her colleagues who will say goodbye to 2007 by taking beigenets and coffee.
Another department will organize a live music party, another will enchant staff with a tomola and offer wine to create an atmosphere of Christmas.
Festival, Christmas ambiance, concerts and buffets, thus enjoying power.
Public authorities also prepare Christmas.
This year, Christmas's biggest festival will be organized by the Ministry of Defence, but it is not the employees of the Ministry who will be invited.
In Noël, the Orphelins, children of the fallen soldiers will receive gifts for the missionary Christmas, members of the family of the soldiers currently serving in foreign missions are invited and a press reception will also take place.
The Department provides for a budget of 25 million dollars to create an environment for the end of the year.
In comparison with other departments, the National Development Agency (NFD) and the Ministry of Economics and Transport (GCM) will celebrate.
The GKM festival will be held in the Future House with a total budget of 4,320,000 forts and, of the six hundred large employees, three hundred and fifty are expected.
At this festival, Christmas's environment will be harsh, there will be actors and also a tombola.
The NFIC Christmas cost 4,700,000 units and was organized Wednesday in the National Justice Council building (OIT) with concerts and dinners.
The rent of the room cost one million dollars, the rest was spent for more than four hundred guests.
According to our information, an NFU service is invited to another Christmas festival organized with European money by the National Centre for Economic Development, a supply management company.
The building of the Theater of the Gate was rented for these purposes.
This information was not confirmed by MAG Zrt because we failed to join the responsible.
The custom is not mandatory
The ILO building not only welcomed the NFU but also the Ministry of Justice and Police who, instead of a Christmas festival, organized a ball on the occasion of Saint Luca on 7 December.
The ILO has not paid them the use of its rooms.
That value was five hundred people.
The festival began with the Minister's welcome words and the dinner was followed by a dancing evening on live music.
Answer to the question of [origo]: having dinner was not mandatory at all.
Ministrys of Health, Work and Local Communities are preparing an over party.
The Ministry of Health will organize a show and party for its employees, in its walls, for 400,000 forts.
On the other hand, Monika Lamperth, Minister of Labour, does not officially invite his colleagues to a Christmas party but to an annual work meeting.
One hundred and twenty people are expected to be invited to take a coffee and eat beegets, reported the press service, and the party will not cost 350 000 people.
Gordon Bajnai, Minister of Local Communities, will simply invite his colleagues to take a glass in the hall of the Ministry of Local Communities and territorial management.
The Ministry of Finance (PM) will hold a Christmas festival in its large hall where 436 employees are expected.
It has to spend 2,500 forts per guest including a buffet and a glass.
Since the arrival of János Veres, PM employees celebrate Christmas each year in the same way.
The official nature of the holiday is strengthened not only by the Minister's exhibition but also by the time of the holiday that took place in the afternoon.
The Ministry of Agriculture will host a reception on January 20 to celebrate the new year, and Christmas will not take place.
The reception will be held in the Vajdahunyad castle, located in the City Woods, and according to the department's communication, 1,000 units per person are calculated for hundreds of guests.
According to the press service, this will be a very simple cocktail where only accredited foreign diplomats in Hungary will be invited.
These cocktails, organized every year, are accompanied by a few words of welcome from the Minister following a modest meal.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Education and Culture do not celebrate anything for Christmas.
The press service of the Ministry of the Environment did not know the price of the official Christmas festival.
However, more than four hundred people were invited to the event organized at the Decorative Art Museum.
The forces of the wicked are gathering together
The trade union unions of the League and the National Association of Workers' Councils will, on Friday, constitute their crew committee which will be responsible for coordinating the strike for an indefinite duration of Monday.
Saturday, a general meeting of protests will be held and Monday, on the day of the final vote on the Health Cases Act, the strike will begin.
This action will certainly result in important gaps in the movement, as rail traffic will be stopped almost entirely and BKV wages (common transport company) will also be severe until 13h.
The Link Syndicators will meet on Friday afternoon, the details of their Monday strike, organized with the National Workers' Councils Association.
The LIGA-MOSZ strike committee will also be formed and will serve as coordinator for Monday's actions.
Saturday, a general meeting of protests will be held and organizations joining the strike will stop working for an indeterminate period if they do not reach agreement with the Government.
This means that the date of the end of the strike, from the day of the vote in Parliament on the Health Cases Act, is not defined.
If the National Assembly does not adopt the Health Cases Act, trade unions will immediately withdraw the appeal to the strike.
On the contrary, if the law is voted, the Committees of Appeal will meet and then decide to take action.
Under the order of Monday of the National Assembly, the vote on the Health Cases Act is likely to take place late at night.
Due to Monday's strike, major gaps are planned in the movement: railways will stop work for an indefinite period and during the morning part of the joint transport in Budapest and more than half of the Volan companies are likely to be arrested.
At the same time, at different points of the country, half of the road will also be blocked.
Many trade unions and civil organizations joined in the appeal to the strike, the list of them is kept up-to-date on the League website.
Some organizations report that the strike has taken place for an indefinite period, others have declared a temporary termination of work.
Until noon after the MÁV (Hungro Iron Chains) and the Free Cheminot Syndicat (VDSZSZ) failed to reach agreement on minimum services, gold, near Christmas celebrations, more and more are those who take the train.
According to current communications, joint transport from Budapest will take place from the start of service until 13:00, Budapest Airport between 7 a.m. and 9 a.m., the Industrial Energy and Thermal Energy Syndicates of the League will take a four-hour strike, the Syndicat of Professors and the Democratic Syndicat of the Professors, respectively, for 2 hours and 2 to 8 hours.
The National Association of Doctors will be arrested in all countries as an alternative, the Health and Social Sector Syndicate (EDDSZ) attached to the SZEF will be a two-hour alert.
The most important four claims made by the League require that the Government withdraw its proposal on health reform and submit a new concept to the social debate.
The second claim requires that the new method of calculation of retirement to be implemented from the coming year be introduced in several stages.
The third claim is a guarantee, in respect of retirement leave before the legal age, which would enable the system to pass on the functions it deserves before 2010.
The fourth reason for the action is the rejection by the Free Cheminots Syndicat (VDSZSZ), attached to the League Syndicats, the Ministry of Economics and Transport's proposal on secondary rail lines and the expectation of another proposal.
Political Capital: Hungarian Guard increased country risk
According to the Risk Analysis Division of Political Capital (Risk Analysis Division), the activity of the Hungarian Guard, which took place last August, with the support of the Jobbik Magyarországért Mozgalom (Movation for a Better Hungary) increased, in several respects, the political risk of Hungary and the region.
In its "risk warning", the company notes that, in relation to the activities of the Hungarian Guard, the biggest political risk is already that "in the short term, aggressive ethnic confrontations can result in the worsening of the already existing ethnic tension between the population of the Tigian and non-Tigian regions of Hungary".
The Research Institute added that the Hungarian Guard's policy strategy, which is likely to lead to this situation, is the main reason.
As they say, this is explained by one of the main shortcomings of Hungarian political actors: "The public actors have had the public debate on Roma affairs to representatives of radical and extreme political groupings which have based a political strategy on the difference between the Turks and the Hungarians."
The problem is compounded, normal dialogue becomes impossible, extremists see increased and aggressive conflicts are more likely to occur, they say.
However, according to the research institute, the increased attention of the Hungarian and international media to the activities of the Hungarian Guard "has significantly deteriorated Hungary's image abroad, in particular with regard to the country's confidence in the stability and democratic maturity".
They recall that, following a larger publicity given to the reorganization of radical and extreme rights groups in Hungary since the autumn of 2006, many associations have been established in Hungary since the summer of 2007 with the name ‘national self-defence association’.
"The common treaty of these meetings is that they are defined as a civil organization while they publicly declare the preparation of their members to defence missions (distance, national defence, defence of order), armed if necessary, to the extent necessary, by referring to police, military, or statelessness."
They reported that everything was going on according to the method that, based on the background of policy society and parties, seeks to deduce different political ambitions in a civil way.
The emphasis on civility and the status of association is therefore not only to avoid legal barriers to the registration of such associations in court but also to be a political strategy.
The analysis indicates that the activity of the Hungarian Guard is a factor which also increases the risk of neighbouring relationships.
"In recent months, many neighbouring countries refer to the Hungarian Guard as a potential source of risk and the ultranationalist political actors of some border countries want to justify their anti-Hungary policy by referring to the Hungarian Guard's constitution.
This affects the political stability of the region," they added.
According to the research institute, the composition of the Hungarian Guard is not a unique phenomenon in Central Eastern Europe, political risks have increased across the region.
As they say, the operation of the Hungarian Guard, for example, is similar to the activity of the Bulgarian National Guard, which was declared by the Bulgarian National Union (BNU) in August 2007.
The many problems of Rome that have emerged in a village of Sofia (Kraszna Poljana) are the origin of the Bulgarian guard.
Taking advantage of these events, UNB has decided to be a guard by saying that the organization's objective is "national self-defence".
According to them, for the past 17 years, the Turks have "terrorized" Bulgaria, but the state has remained inactive and neutral, recalls the Political Capital.
They added that the initiative had led to lively discussions in the Bulgarian public opinion.
As they say, the statement by some Bulgarian Roma organizations on the establishment of their own resistance guard indicates an increase in the risk of ethnic confrontations.
The operation of the Hungarian Guard showing similarities with that of the Bulgarian National Guard does not include the fact that the Hungarian Roma respond to the threat in the same way by organizing their own self-defence, can be read in the warning of the risk of Political Capital.
Attila Juhász, the research director of Political Capital, said that the risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.
As he said, their risk analysis is published every year and if events could have an impact on the risk change, they will inform the public of their opinion, as in the present case, by publishing a risk warning.
The party is not marked in red everywhere
In Hungary, the law is precisely defining holidays and, around the holidays, it has become ready to reorganise working days whose number will decrease next year.
Festivals are no longer uniform in the EU and in the United States.
Hungarian legislation distinguishes national and state holidays as well as holiday days.
Holidays are often associated with religious festivals or important historical events.
In Hungary, we celebrate the new year, the last day of the year that ends, and the first day of the new year are also days of rest, which is so much more so that the rebels can rest quietly.
In addition, in one year, we have eleven red holidays.
The 15th March is a national festival, in memory of the 1848 revolution, as well as on 23 October, which is the anniversary of the 1956 revolution.
On August 20, we celebrate our status, May 1st is the work party, and November 1st and 2nd, we remember our family members and our dead friends.
In addition, we have two days at Easter, Pentecost and Christmas.
The days of our state, national or other religious holidays are rarely on a weekend-end, according to the calendar, it has become likely to reorganise working days in cases or only one working day before or after the holiday marked in red.
It is true that we pay the price of the long weekend by working or going to school on Saturday before the long weekend.
For many years, the Minister of Labour has been in a special regulation on the days before or after the holidays.
The law applies to all employees and to all employees, staff and persons working in the public service.
It does not, however, apply to service companies, institutions become uninterrupted and in service, by their vocation, and also for rest days.
This year, the working days will be changed only around the end of the year: from 24 December, life ends almost throughout the country because, according to experience, most people do rather than spend extra hours or take vacations that they have saved for these purposes in order to spend the days between Christmas and the day of the new year.
The next year many holidays fall into the middle or end of the week, resulting in fewer changes to the working days than that year.
The calendar will be reorganised for the first time around the work party to allow employees to stay with them for four days.
Saturday, April 25, will be a day of work to have a day of rest on Friday, May 2.
Another change is planned for October 23rd: Saturday 18th October will be a workday for Friday 24.
On the other hand, the next year, the end of the year is announced under the sign of the holidays because from December 24, the whole world will take a stand-up even if the day of the new year falls on Wednesday.
Six futile things that can be terrible to your colleagues
E-mails that we forget to send, voice messages that we never receive, innocent lies that almost touch us more: these are things that "beautiful" every day at work.
The question is whether we are accustomed to these injuries or we are faced with the challenge and we deliberately avoid the situation of ambiguity, causing harm to others.
Examples.
"I'm sorry, I forgot to tell you that you were called from the marketing service," a colleague told you.
What did you miss a date?
It is best to apologize and try to arrange things by calling the marketing service to tell them that he has forgotten to pass the message (the least current solution).
In most cases, the matter is arranged with excuses.
Before you have criminal explanations, it is helpful to think about how you can cause unpleasant moments to your colleagues and make efforts to avoid them.
You're buying something you don't belong to?
There is nothing more energizing than wanting to take a file, an office tool or a phone and you find them nowhere.
You remember when you saw her, you put her on the desk, but she disappeared the next morning?
Did you find out by your hairard style that you thought you lost on your colleague's office?
You don't take anything from your colleagues without asking them unless they're right to be angry at you because they're doing their best.
Don't make stuff, put it in your pocket because it can be boring because it's gone and you need it all the time.
You're a member of the private life of your colleagues?
There are no good ways to stop the forces that are spreading.
Who did what, with who?
Why?
Don't tell everyone your information (suppositors) about your colleagues' private life!
If a colleague shares his intimate secrets with you, don't be afraid of him!
Do not discuss the shared information with your colleagues in his absence, even if your colleagues are also present.
You said you were sick with no reason?
When you call the office and you declare yourself ill under the pretext of a headache, because you feel bad or you feel you need some rest this day, think that your work, your urgent business, your final missions must be carried out by someone else at your place.
Don't make fun of your colleagues!
If you know in advance that you're not going to work tomorrow or that something can happen that would force you to stay with you, don't forget to prevent your boss and your colleagues from being surprised by your absence tomorrow.
Fredonment, recuperation, telephone
You're stuck in your job, but how much do your colleagues' wealth really cost you?
Did you become a witness to a phone discussion that you would have done better if you hadn't listened?
Don't bother your colleagues with fraternizing, singing, high-voice discussions (which you handle above their heads), foot-and-mouth baptisms, big words or discontent expressed with high-voice voice.
They can slow down even if your colleagues are not involved in a project (editation, design, organization).
You blame the others for a mistake?
If your work is not done for a fixed time, you forget to send an important e-mail or message, don't charge anyone for this forget!
Don't put it on account of any chaos in your office or your ex-girlfriends!
Know if you have made a mistake and if this has caused inconveniences to others, fix the mistake!
Ask how you can fix your mistake, fix your neglect!
Are you feeling too much at your office?
Setting a jogging and shoes is comfortable at home but they don't fit into the office!
Don't put comfortable jogging even if your function allows it!
Don't be neglected, respect your colleagues and yourself by dressing you properly, and if your job requires it by wearing beautiful and elegant clothes, to go to work!
If you want to respond to expectations, you're no longer interested.
We slowly move in the usual mouth of the morning.
At the same time, a particular melody is heard on the radio: the voice of a violin whose electronic effects are associated.
I'm going up.
The rhythm change music and the low comes to accompany the tone of everything at the time, then a female choir joins it like a real bull.
Mr.2 broadcast the song Wings of Love from Zagar.
The Hungarian music life has not been a source of pleasure for us for a long time with an electronic pop of good quality.
But now it seems that the mouth becomes different if you listen to Zagar's new album.
Yonderboi's appearance, some of the new interesting productions born from the Hungarian digital underground start little to change the overall image and, despite the new way of the garage rock decanting the guitar, the Hungarian electropop shows that there is a new under the sun.
Balázs Zzözer arrived from Pécs and he played himself in the Yonderboi group before he left on his own way, perhaps because "there is no place for two feet in the same shoe."
His project (Zagar) and his music, a jazz alliance, electronic dance music and pop, began to be known when he was entrusted with the composition of the recorded soundtracks (e.g.
The season of Ferenc Török).
The training initially played in small clubs began to be known by a larger audience when the magazine van2 cited their first album in 2002 among the fifty most important discs of the Hungarian market and announced to Zagar, with Yonderboi, almost the only producers of the Hungarian trend that would also be competitive in the west.
Zagar and his whole group became inconsistencies "trendy" but no one asked them if they wanted to bring this label well.
The group has reacted as it should, it has come up with a new and better disk.
The album entitled Cannot Walk Fly Instead, recently released, can open up new ways for them, although the title wishes to represent continuity with the years in Pécs.
It was a line from the old group of Pécs de Balázs Zzözer.
We are well with the reference to flight but next to air music now appears, following the spirit and trend of the time, the stronger guitar, the impact of rock and roll.
György Ligeti, a singer currently working in England with The Puzzle group, showed his talent in these songs during the first album in the Millennium Park.
On the album, there is a real tube for the radio, Mr.2 Petõfi, which has been broadcast since the popular music of the morning and evening, began to introduce Wings of Love music recorded with six Hungarian songs.
It's all right (?).
hvg.hu the posé des question by Balázs Zzózer.
hvg.hu: This new tube makes me ask a question: Is your music well preserved for a certain layer?
Zzör Balázs: The term of music for a certain bed doesn't tell me much.
For me there are two castles in light music; not mainstream or underground, not alternative or pop but commercial music and pure music.
Music is alternative, underground can also be media and made for sale and thus commercial.
But a good pop song can be sincere too.
The attitude of reception also works in this spirit regardless of language or borders.
hvg.hu: Do you see a difference between the Hungarian and foreign audience, is one or the other more open to your music?
Zs.B.: In abroad, especially in the west, the softer music has older traditions.
There, people go to concerts and not only young people in their teens or 20s, but also older ones.
They pay much more attention to the changes in light music because they believe it is also part of contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What is the public's role in your work?
Are you interested in knowing who, or how many people listen to your music?
Zs.B.: I am obviously pleased to see people come more and more to our concerts.
However, we never made music for the market.
For us music is not made to achieve a goal but for a specific reason.
The public's role is more important to concerts or the mutual influence already works, but it is only perceived in the inexhaustible changes of the moment.
But I noticed that if you wanted to respond to public expectations, you wouldn't be interested anymore.
hvg.hu: Do you want to follow Yonderboi's example?
He worked alone and got a career in the West instead.
Zs.B.: We do not really follow his path even if some sometimes try to find traces in our music.
Instead, we are team players who trust the other's musical presence and the release of the songs.
At first, it was quite unlikely that our music would be compared to Yonderboi because we are a couple of people to leave his group and take another path.
hvg.hu: On Mr2 Petõfi's palmarès, Wings of Love takes the first place.
Many are those who heard the name of Zagar for the first time through this song.
With this more popular style you've recently opened to a wider layer?
Zs.B.: We did not intend to make a tube to sell the disc.
This song means more than anything.
We wanted it at the end of the album to try to learn the origin of sound and the most difficult themes addressed on the whole disk.
hvg.hu: How did you choose the six songs?
Why were they - what was the line of guidance?
Zs.B.: The idea was to have a choir of the kind of gospel.
We had the idea of making this choir of good soloists from the Hungarian music scene.
The choir was thus composed of six members, namely Sena, Edina Kutzora, Judy Jay, Bori Peterfy, Enikõ Hodosi [Neo], Juci Németh, who was then baptized Underground Divas.
hvg.hu: Did you want this song like this or did the girls change it a bit?
Zs.B.: This piece has been in an instrumental version for a long time and then when we composed the album, we thought it was missing something else in this song.
The follow-up of agreements attracted the voice of the song.
I sang the same song the night the girls learned later.
I've had it almost immediately and everything was terriblely spontaneous.
I remember that it took me a while, but of course we needed Divas.
With my voice, she wouldn't have had the same force.
hvg.hu: On the disc and concert it also seemed to me that the girls were in the background.
There is no solo (with the exception of a single single Judy Jay), they don't have a single role, they sing all together and they don't sing much more than music, so music makes only to accompany their songs.
They were behind the scene too.
Is it your will?
Zs.B.: The fact that they were behind is only technical problems.
On the other hand, what was voluntary is that we did not want to distribute soloist roles.
The song also says that we must forget our ego, forget where it comes from, who goes or, just let these wings, the wings of love, carry us.
I wanted others to feel this euphoric state that we felt when the song was born.
hvg.hu: Which songs did you most work?
Zs.B.: In fact, no matter what the musical creation process, we had more difficult pieces during the mix.
For example, with Dorian Gray's Dilemma, or I play a concert piano, or with Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls, or the crowd didn't want to work long enough, and then, little by little, everything was set up like a puzzle.
hvg.hu: What is your favorite on the new album?
Zs.B.: This changes all the time with the concerts and the fact that I've already "lost" this disc.
At this point, these are Prophet Is A Fool, Escape From The Earth and Never The Same.
The trader is at risk of billions due to its inferiority complex
A dissimulating fraud.
This is how his former employee is appointed by the French general Society, owner of the Czech Bank Commercial Bank.
The bank lost almost EUR 5 billion.
But it seems that Kerviel is just a big player who wanted to be equal to his colleagues, and who, in addition, cannot be considered impossible at all.
Unlike all the big bank houses, it recognized the crisis in the US mortgage market.
"He's fragile," they let him hear his superiors who charged him to the police.
However, if the position of Kerviel reported by the French media, including Le Monde, this man's transactions have resulted in a profit of EUR 1.6 billion at the end of last year.
The crisis goes beyond the United States
"All I wanted was to make money for my bank," he said in the deposit.
The last summer, he managed to take advantage of the US crisis to win half a billion euros.
In fact, he has heard of the occasion since the beginning of the year.
Information began to emerge in February where the assumptions "sub-prime", given to low-income clients or those who had encountered the problem of reimbursement in the past, would have problems.
But this crisis should not affect the whole economy.
Kerviel didn't believe it, and he did it well.
At the end of the year, its benefits amounted to EUR 1.6 billion.
"Since I won my first half billion, I didn't know how to announce it," Kerviel says, adding that he didn't hear anything for himself."
In all the questionnaires, it has been mistaken for reports to be avoided.
He managed to slow down his superiors, although the Eurex race began to take an interest in his transactions.
Who is at risk of nothing
Was he afraid to be discovered?
Not at all.
"I thought the simple fact of getting 1.6 billion for the bank would satisfy them."
Where's his willingness to risk so much?
He got to his post only gradually.
He had started working at the General Society in 2000 just after finishing his studies at Lyon University.
Its annual salary was around $51 billion.
Two years later, he was already a trade assistant and in 2005, he had to be treated independently with an annual salary of $90 billion.
However, he knew he would never win as much as the others.
"From my first interview in 2005, I knew I was much less considered than others.
With regard to my university course and my professional and personal course," Kerviel told researchers.
But soon after his entry into service, he wins his first big success.
Thanks to Allianz's actions, he won half a billion euros by lowering this title during London's attacks.
And the mechanism was down - it wanted more.
As long as you win, we'll leave you alone.
"It was like a snowblow effect," he told the police.
But the superiors were aware of everything, or rather, they doubted.
"As long as I won, they seemed to close their eyes."
And that's when it comes to the beginning of the year.
He's lost a billion euros in one day.
In mid-January, after weekend, he decided to hide the sum.
Monday, when he gets to work, he's no longer employed by the bank.
A few days later, the bank announced that it had lost EUR 5 billion because of it.
And how did we find it?
He became suspicious of his resignation.
"Last year, I only took four days off.
A trader who doesn't take vacation is a trader who doesn't want to leave his book to another," Kerviel concludes.
Czechia for 365 billion
Yesterday, the Czech Government's ministers signed nine operational programmes with representatives of the European Commission, which could, in the coming years, bring 14 billion euros (about 365 billion Czech Koreans) to the Czech Republic.
It is almost half of the total amount that the Czech Republic can obtain from Brussels in the years 2007 to 2013.
Nearly 125 billion crowns from seven operational programmes will be allocated to the Czech regions.
Czech companies will be able to obtain about 100 billion crowns under the Enterprise and Innovation Programme.
The transport sector will benefit most, up to 150 billion.
The Transport programme is the most important operational programme and represents up to 22 per cent of the financial means available to the Czech Republic in the context of these projects.
This money will be the source of an increase in the budget of the National Transport Infrastructure Fund, which will manage a total of 90.8 billion dollars next year.
The Entrepreneurship and Innovation Programme, for SMEs and entrepreneurs, must provide financial means to encourage innovation within the company.
Entrepreneurships should be provided with financial means for introducing new technologies, research in industry, but also for introducing new more efficient management methods.
So far, the Czech Republic has been among the new members of the EU's most successful beneficiaries.
The Court confirmed the 20-year prison sentence for the former president of Nicaragua
The Nicaraguan Court of Appeal confirmed the 20-year prison sentence for former President Arnold Alemán, where he was convicted in 2003 for a fraud of $100 million (about 1.8 billion).
Later he was released and was assigned to live in his hacienda near the capital of Nicaragua.
If the former head of this Central American state, operating between 1997 and 2002, will or will not be again imprisoned, according to the AP agency, it is not clear.
According to the President of the Court of Appeal Ileana Pérez, all will now be dependent on prison officials, either they will let Germany end its punishment with him, or they will be again in prison.
Four years ago, the Court found that Germany regularly transferred government money to foreign companies accounts in Panama.
It was fictitious companies and accounts were actually owned by members of his family and his closest partners.
A part of this money went into funds created by Germany to finance its electoral campaign in 2001.
The budget was adopted
That's right.
The state budget was adopted.
What is this budget exceptional?
This is the first budget drawn up by this government and accepted by the majority of governments without the support of the opposition.
This year has passed a year ago thanks to the support of the Czech socialist party - ČSSD, as it was Minister Sobotka who had prepared it and ČSSD could not afford to refuse it.
Contrary to the debate before the vote of the Government's defence statement, this time no drama.
The House of Deputies has adopted this law without any problem which, although most influential, is a habit of neglect.
There's a sort of paradox.
Whether we want it or not, each chapter and each article is the beginning and end of every government.
The budget is part of the policy, which is hidden behind the competition for power against government and opposition.
This latter is more mediatically attractive and that is why more attention is given to it in the media.
The debate of political men is much more interesting than the total figures.
The national budgets of the past socialist governments suffered from three malaises that the current budget was not adequate to regulate at the same time:
The first is the important part given to the costs of the mandate imposed by the law, consisting not only of pensions but also of social charges, adopted last year by the silent "coalition" grouping the ČSSD and KSCHM parties.
The second is a weak economy, resulting from the first evil.
The third obstacle is the lack of public finances, i.e. the lack of cities and communities.
However, this is not the deficit of the state budget which represents the largest one.
This is public and relatively controlled.
The real later bomb is the lack of cities and communities.
Many of the mayors often issued obligations, in rounds and rounds, gradually ending their municipalities, in order to obtain the money from taxes, tax duties and bank credits, from new sources of investment.
In the past years, they have been able to compensate for these debts by the mass sales of distribution systems, including energy from the State in privatization.
Today, they no longer have this source.
If it is only official and verifiable facts, it is found that:
Our economy has been through for many years, like the rest of the world, a phase of growth and ČSSD is not missing.
It was a unique opportunity for successive governments of this party to regulate public finances.
Instead, they were more and more of the State.
Other countries, including some exceptions such as Hungary, Albania or Egypt, have managed their affairs in a far more reasonable way than our republic.
It is a monstrous shame that falls mainly on previous governments.
We are part of countries that are, at the global level, the least threatened by poverty.
So we do not need any massive social programmes that are, just in recent years, unfortunately unaffected.
Although it has succeeded in eliminating part of the absurd population expenditure approved last year before the elections, if a decline in retirement age, and a reform of the retirement system will not take place soon, then any policy will cease to exist in this country and whoever will be in power, it will only be managed.
In extreme punishment, it can be said that political men in power will become bureaucrats who mechanically distribute the majority of the money imposed between retirement and social benefits.
That is why the current budget can't be revolutionary, but it can only suspend the mechanism which makes normal costs rest at the cost of mandates.
The deficit of 70 billion for 2008 would be absolutely useless if previous governments had not spent all the money they could.
If we really do not want power policies to become mere bureaucrats, we must be patient and grant this fragile government coalition, aware that the State can only spend on what it is doing in taxes and tax rights, the peace necessary for the preparation of new reform laws.
There is no need for those who will gradually achieve a balanced state budget.

Banks want to resolve the crisis
The U.S. Federal Reserve Bank, the European Central Bank and the English, Swiss and Canadian central banks have decided to combat the financial market crisis as a whole.
More than $100 billion will be placed on monetary markets through cash.
It will be for banks to sell, by means of a system of deposits, interest rates which they are willing to borrow from money.
For example, the United States will send $40 billion in cash and will also provide 24 billion to the European Central Banks and Switzerland.
This is the first time since the attacks of 11 September that the Central Banks of Individual States have decided to take action to prevent the effects of the financial crisis.
"This approach tends to address the major problems of the economy, namely the growing lack of free capital that banks could lend," writes Bernard Baumohl in his report to customers of the Economic Outlook Group.
"The concerted action of the Central Banks has reduced the likelihood of a recession in the United States from 65 per cent to about 50 per cent," Baumohl added in his report.
Banks have already lost $60 billion due to unpaid loans, especially in the United States.
Analysts are still waiting for other losses in billions.
"If the Central Banks have chosen this course, it is that they must really understand what can still be learned," say economist-in-chief of ABN Amro Kieran Davies.
"It seems that the situation is really bad," he added.
The central banks fear that if banks themselves have difficulty access to loans, they will lend closer to their customers.
This would reduce consumption and put the US economy in a recession that could affect the economic growth of the world.
The Central Banks made this choice after it failed to reduce the interbank rate of London, called LIBOR, used to borrow on the interbank market.
This meant that banks were always afraid of mutual loans, although the Central Banks of the United States, Canada and England had reduced their interest rates several times during the autumn.
"It will have the same effect as a new downturn of interest rates," said Reuters Greg Salvaggio of Tempus Consulting.
Some analysts do not believe that the move of the Central Banks will not contribute to the crisis, as it does not address the main problem of the fall in the real estate market in the United States.
President Klaus: The discussions of ecologists are incredible
Global climate change is particularly intense in developing countries.
President Václav Klaus once again spoke about the problem of planetary warming.
This time, the criticism was addressed at the United Nations International Conference on Climate Change in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book The Blue Planet, not true, he stated that the discussions of ecologists were incredible.
According to Klaus, this is not only the structure of the conference, consisting of a curious mix of representatives of governments and non-governmental organizations, which is unacceptable, but also the fundamental difference between the rhetoric and the reality.
"The debate is not structured at all, it's just a set of words, putting solutions to current problems," Klaus said.
The Czech President stressed in the presentation of his book that his subject was of great importance to him, and that is why he is so committed to it.
He also expressed his satisfaction at what his book also appeared to be in German translation, because he said, "I often meet only the characterization of my opinions."
Today, interested persons can read their positions without being deformed.
Klaus recalled that although he was not a climateist, he still felt that he had enough provisions to edit such a book.
It is indeed a academic able to monitor and appreciate scientific treaties, it has the practice of statistics and is also an economist.
The major conclusions of the book are, according to him, the following topics: the climate changes continuously, its changes are normal, so there is no shared opinion shared by all researchers on planetary warming, the effects of current changes are neither too important nor too serious, therefore they are no threat and, finally, efforts to influence climate change are useless, ineffective and unacceptable.
More than having the experience of a comprehensive regime, he considers it unacceptable to impose unverified opinions on others, which he feels as a dangerous threat to freedom.
In response to the people's questions, he explained several times that it was not against "a reasonable protection of the environment, but against an integrated environmentalism which does not take into account the relationship between the costs and the benefits they bring."
In Vienna, Klaus had already discussed this matter two months ago at the Hayek Institute.
600 million people have failed to renew their driving permits in time.
Six hundred thousand drivers have been allowed to spend time and have failed to renew their former driving permit, whose validity is reached at the end of the year.
We are the last day when people can still ask for renewal, so that authorities can deliver them a new permit before the end of the year.
However, the Ministry is not afraid that hundreds of thousands of drivers without a valid permit will run the road.
According to the authorities, they have not renewed their driving permit, especially those who no longer wish to drive.
While the municipalities report a decline in the number of applications for renewal of the permit, the authorities in the capital are in charge of applications and the number of applications for renewal of the permit has increased this week.
Mary met about 2000 customers per day.
There's a half an hour to almost.
In Prague, nearly 140.OOO drivers have not yet renewed their driving permits.
The release of a new permit takes 20 days.
However, it is possible to apply for delivery within a short period of five days.
In this case, the driver pays an additional five hundred crowns.
Vehicle drivers who will not be able to perform the mandatory renewal of the driving permit by the end of the year and will start the road without a valid permit will risk an amendment from January.
The spouse will be obliged to pay at least two thousand crowns.
However, the police can also deal with the crime by resorting to a friendly approach.
In the case of an administrative offence, the fine falls to 2500 crowns.
According to previous information, it was possible for even a person who did not have to travel.
It could be forced to pay up to 30,000 crowns.
The Ministry had called on the authorities to conduct moderation and to impose no more than 1000 crowns.
However, according to the Department of Transport's spokesman Karel Hanselka, no one is at risk of tens of thousands of amendments.
The driving permit is, according to him, a document which people can decide whether they wish to have.
This is not like the identity card that, she must be valid without exceptions.
People who no longer wish to drive should be allowed to drive.
It is sufficient to provide it or send it to the municipality concerned.
The driving licences issued between 1964 and 1993 will cease to be valid at the end of the year.
On the other hand, vehicle drivers are also obliged to progressively renew other types of driving permits.
Persons with documents from 1994 to 2000 have three more years to carry out the renewal.
The validity of driving licences issued in the years 2001 to 2004 shall expire in December 2013.
According to Hanselka, it is about 2.6 million other documents.
The Court has reduced the fines of the detectives agreed with Berdych
Josef Opava and Petr Konerík, former police officers accused of conspiring with David Berdych's gang, will be sentenced to thirteen years in prison.
The Supreme Court of Prague has thus condemned them definitively by reducing their penalties by 1 year and 2 years respectively.
Initially, the Department's detectives for the fight against organized crime were sentenced to 14 and 12 years in prison.
It is no longer possible to appeal against the judgment delivered today, only one appeal to the Supreme Court is admissible.
Although Berdych is also charged with this case, he does not wait for the first instance's verdict.
However, he has already received other sentences of more than 16 years in prison.
He can't get more.
In January, the Departmental Tribunal recognized that there were 19 persons involved, and today the Supreme Court dealt with 16 appeals.
Since the initiation of the investigation, most of the accused have referred to the charge by claiming that it was a manipulative case.
According to the Central Bohem Court of Justice, police officers, after an agreement with Berdych, transmitted information from police sources to criminals, covered the various holdings and helped gang members avoid criminal responsibility.
The gang placed 30 per cent of the larcin in Opava and Konerík.
In the case, it is a question of the criminal activity of the gang between 1999 and 2001.
Essentially, military flights that are the victims have, in most cases, serious health-threatening but also the abuse of power by a public agent and the arms embargo.
In domestic investigations, the police have, in effect, discovered unlawfully detained pistols, abuses with a steel knife, a direct laser or a missile.
According to the charges, the gang has been enriched by tens of millions of crowns.
On the other hand, close to twenty people in this process, the courts have already recognized other flights to Berdych and a number of other persons.
Other men in the vicinity of Berdych are still explaining themselves before the court in another trial, some cases have not yet been brought to court.
The main audience has for the moment avoided Tomáš Póta and Maroš Šulej who are currently in detention in Ireland, where they await the final decision on their extradition in the Czech Republic.
The price of child substitution: 12 million
Igor Veleba's stepfamilies' lawyer wants to obtain a downgrading of 12 million more Koreans.
Three million for each mother, two million for parents and one million for each of the children.
The hospital offers a maximum of 200,000 for each parent.
That's why the lawyer at the Ondřij Dostal Hospital is absolutely not in agreement with Veleba's proposal.
"We refuse such a claim, which is very high," Dostal said at the end of the hearing.
"To be able to make an opinion on the counter-proposal, we need the expert report which the opposite party ordered.
We'll check if he has an explicit value.
But we continue to think that the total sum should not exceed hundreds of thousands," Dostal stressed.
The amount should, according to him, be fixed between 100,000 and 200,000 Kč for each of the four parents.
At the beginning of the case, the family of Jablonov requested a million crowns for each month where she could not raise her biological daughter.
Veleba used the expert report, prepared for him by the University Hospital in Prague-Motol, as a document in support of the demolition negotiations.
According to psychologists and psychiatrists, parents suffered psychological damage and were subject to stress at different stages and deeper levels.
The stress situation has been better handled by men, although they have been faced with overcrowding that they have not prevented the replacement of new generations.
Women, who remain less serene before the current life of traumatism and what is happening precisely at this time, have summarized the contents of the Veleba report.
Veronika and Nikola were replaced by nurses at the hospital of Trébić on 9 December.
Last week, children were returned to their biological parents - Nikola at the Čermák in Príbiyslavie and Veronika at Libor Brož and Jaroslava Trojanová in Jablonov.
The governor of the region Vysočina Miloš Vystrčil returned to each of the 100,000 Korean families for reimbursement of the expenses incurred by the error of the Třebić hospital managed by the region.
All hospitals in Czechia are subject to civil liability insurance law.
In the event of a lack of resources, they must be in the reserve fund, except that they can ask for assistance from the manager.
So far, the courts have recognized relatively low damages, the amounts calculated according to the tables were of the order of hundreds of thousands, except millions.
Polivka and loss of the Kingdom of Valaisska (not Kingdom of Valaisko)
Bolek Polívka lost his dispute on the issue of the Valášské Kingdom brand (Royaume de Valášsko).
According to the judge of the Ostrava Regional Court, he was actually used for the first time by King of Valášsko, but the project was initiated by the team around Tomáš Harabiš, the former co-worker of the actor.
Polivka was not present at today's hearing.
But, according to his lawyer, the case is probably not over and his client will call.
"The dispute relates to the fact that Mr. Harabiš and his team are protesting about Bolek Polivka's popularity," Polivka's lawyer said after the trial.
According to him, the words of the Kingdom of Valaško refer to this actor and comic book right around the world.
Harabiš is from the same news.
"We've been working for almost ten years.
He said about money research and events."
He thinks it's the money that's the cause of the dispute.
"After years they realized that the project was successful and that they could benefit from it.
They want to stop on our job," he added.
A lucrative business
According to the court, Polívka used for the first time the title vałaský král (King of Valášsko) in his television broadcast.
Actor Radoslav Brzobohetý had crowned him king in 1993.
At the time, however, this had nothing to do with the project of establishing a fictitious kingdom.
A few years later, Harabiš came with the idea of making the passports of Valašské Království appear.
From a humorous action to the original, it resulted in a lucrative business and business activity, followed by the creation, by Harabiš, of the company Valašské království.
In 1997 Polivka agreed that her name and signature would be mentioned in the passport and even offered to pay holders at the price of her farm visit and her theatre shows.
Who's gonna sit on the throne?
Today, the judge also mentioned that Harabiš has made use of the new idea, published by Polívka in the management issue, for commercial purposes.
"The popularity of Boleslav Polivka has certainly helped the project Valášské království," the judge said.
However, she added that the spirit of the project was composed by Harabiš and his team devoted to the project in an intensive manner.
The collaboration between the parties today was continued until 2000 when Harabiš organized an official coronation for Polívka in Vsetín.
But since then, conflicts have begun to accumulate between Polívka and Harabiš, who have culminated in the deposition "of King Boleslav 1th election forever".
The ruling role in the kingdom was then, under the inspiration of Harabiš, taken by the singer Jarmila Šuláková as Queen mother.
Then, in 2002, Polívka filed a complaint against Harabiš and his company, asking that the court be rejected today.
What could make the matter clear is the tour for the throne and half of the princess.
He should be a new king.
He didn't want details and dates.
"We don't want to go fast enough.
it would be something like the falcon of kings in Slovakia.
The King would be elected for some time.
Even Mr. Polívka can obviously register," adds Harabiš.
Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi: disappearance of prejudices
In fact, I've never been a big fan of Peugeot 206.
Its quality of driving was nothing extraordinary, the quality of speed change, conduct and also the quality of manufacturing could, in any case, be below average.
But now there is on the market its successor the Peugeot 207 which, she is much better.
As much as the combination called SW is going further away, I can only think about it.
When I tried the classic Peugeot 207 hackback, I complained for example about the space for the head on the back seats.
While there you end the complaints because the combination of carrots means that even the great devil will be, in this respect, easy.
Let's see soon.
I'm going to call the inside too fast so I don't repeat too much.
It's a little about success, but it's the only thing I notice on the central tunnel that looks poor.
There, I would have liked a little more inventive design, since the car is so elegant.
The seats are comfortable, and the time when we could complain about seats or too short folders is a revolution.
The lateral leadership has also improved significantly according to model 206.
As far as space is concerned, the increase in the dimensions of the road is also sensitive.
The combination can also disappear the lack of space above the above mentioned head.
A safe in the safe
The most important thing about this vehicle is its luggage base.
I need to evaluate it as very readily available (also thanks to the background pivoting ice) and a rather easy reach.
The blind spaces are mixed with arrest elastics that constitute an ideal compromise.
It is not boring and can be extended while it is able to hold enough heavy objects.
But we're gonna stop at the volume.
According to the tables, 428 l in the basic configuration, this is a relatively average number in relation to competition.
Apart from the Škoda Fabia Combi, the most sold vehicle of this category in Czechia.
If we compare 207 SW to the new generation of Mlada Boleslav product, we find that Peugeot remains very sensitive behind it, the difference is 52 litres.
When it comes to leaving abroad or carrying a purse, this number is almost critical.
However, if I had to make out the benefits, I would mention the bottom of the remaining drop after reversing the back seat files perfectly, or even a very low margin.
120 horses on four cylinders
The vehicle we tested was equipped with an Otto four cylinder engine with a volume of 1.6 l and a power of 88 kW.
And in fact, that's what should be like a 1.6 that makes a family hackback walk.
He's quiet, he's a little consumed and, above all, he's doing well.
If I compare it with the equivalent produced by Čkoda which often gives the impression that there is a door of escape opened by a serpent, then I can only be enthusiastic.
Prices along with prices
The price of the vehicle is not accessible by all.
However, we must be aware that we have tested a quite well-equipped car with a space interior and a very good engine.
The basic price of a vehicle with an Otto 1.4 litre engine up to 329 900 Kč is still affordable.
The vehicle we tested cost from 410 900 Kč, which is already enough.
The premium equipment, also tested, increases the price of 80 000 Kč.
But we have more head airbags, automatic air conditioning, automatic glazing, automatic command of the back windows...
In fact, the vehicle costs at the end of account 531,900 Kč.
It's a lot, but try to add the extra equipment to Fabia's price and you'll get a very similar number.
So there's more to choose the brand.
The integration of Slovak students into British schools is bad
The number of children originating in Eastern European countries in British schools is growing, which is causing concern to the rest of the population about the evolution of local education.
The integration of Eastern Europeans is currently facing a series of obstacles.
British schools even note cases where conflicts between immigrants and descendants of indigenous people become violent.
The case of the Kent of the North, where persistent and immigrants of Slovak origin are beginning to intensify their opposition, well illustrates the problem of the integration of children from Eastern Europe.
The discussions, the Chinese and the Bulgarians among the students were transferred to parental relationships.
The situation is so far away as the police stopped in Chatham a Slovak woman who had hit a ten-year-old student bar.
The spouse defends himself by claiming that the boy has been insulted by racists.
The police also had to respond to the attack against a two-year-old Slovak immigrant.
Young girls were likely addressed to this man with racist remarks and threw stones at him.
"When we got home, a young man jumped over the bus stop and started to crack us up.
When I told him to stop, he answered with poems and poems and then discovered his fists," a mother of Slovenian students described another unpleasant adventure.
Complaints are made by both parties.
One of the survivors has gone to qualify for conflicts with immigrants to fight for survival.
The above cases show that the atmosphere in British schools between indigenous people and immigrants is beginning to be tended.
70 thousand Slovaks came to find work are registered in Great Britain.
And about 30 thousand Slovenian students attend British schools.
Cuba, the most beautiful Caribbean island
For visitors, it's really an island of freedom.
Everything you expect from your resignation can be achieved if you make a good choice.
Beautiful and white beaches such as the snow, high waves or then a calm sea like a staging.
Palms and everything including with servers that offer you on the beach a pizza, ice cream or really energizing cocktails.
The kitesurfing, the golf course and the wheelchair.
On the islands of the Caribbean, you will not find this list only in its integrity, but rich.
But there is only one island on which you will find more and more and it is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful island of the Great Antilleans.
In the time of the Spanish, Cuba had been the base of its invasion of America.
Christophe Colomb has described it as the most beautiful place the human eye has ever seen.
Havane became the warehouse and trading place for the goods that the Spanish had stolen and transported to Europe.
Then came the American era.
The National Hotel was raised at the beginning of the 20th year.
It was Lucky Luciano, one of the heads of the American mafia, who built it, because everything that was a crime to the United States (especially under the ban) was accepted and supported in Cuba: drugs, gambling, prostitution.
Among his clients, there were, among others,
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In Havana, high-rise buildings also moved cars, belonging to the cult symbols of the last 50's, on the broad boulevards.
Ernest Hemingway bought a property in San Francisco de Paula, near Havana, and, in Cojjmar, he had his yacht.
The stars of the business show and the political men of all America left their signatures on the walls of the Bodeguita del Medio.
So, what about today?
You can leave your autograph yourself on the walls of the Gulf Bodeguita.
In the bar at the National Hotel, a luxury hotel, you will be able to mix your choice's cocktail.
And these cult cars are always around Havana, as the jigoli and imported machetes have long since, in a climate if salty and wet, they can.
Although Havana, especially the oldest part, is significantly depreciated, there are no other parts in its surroundings that are as beautiful as colonial monuments there are.
Other places become more beautiful, for example Trinidad.
Since tourism brings money if necessary, its development has green fire.
In the last 15 years, new hotels have moved not only to Havana but especially to Varader, on the outskirts of Holguín Province, as well as on smaller islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba still offers a fantasy that is unique in the world and will be especially appreciated by small train lovers.
The canne was returned from the plantations spread into the sugars on a narrow road by small steam and engine trains.
Their rolling material has not been renewed for decades and it can be seen in the course of small locomotives that are no longer only in museums.
Where's he headed?
Most visitors do not miss the most famous places.
So there's no need to write long on Varadero or on Havana.
Not to mention that in Hemingway's property, already mentioned, there is a museum and that the writer who loves this writer should not miss the visit.
The Vináles Valley in the west of the island is one of Cuba's most picturesque corners.
An exuberant plant puts it on a calcium soil.
Mogots, calculus balloons and rocks are raised in trade from the bottom of the valley, and, from the fertile ground being caught in their entrances, even its canal rocks are covered by a very dense plant carpet.
The valley is the place where Cuban tobacco is likely to grow in the best quality.
You can find the final form of this product if you visit one of Havana's cigarettes factories.
Someone may also find it interesting that this is where the Chilean episode of Major Zeman was turned.
Trinidad
Ancient town was founded shortly after the Spanish colonized the island.
This is the market for slave trade and sugar that has brought him glory and wealth.
The wealth is rooted in the beauty and character of this small town.
The colonial Spanish architecture, strongly influenced by later French legislators, has almost changed in four centuries.
Trinidad, situated between the sea and the mountain mass Escambray, is a place that is as different as it was in the last 50's, there was no road that would link this region with the rest of the country.
This only allowed him to stay away.
We built nothing, and that's why we did nothing else, everyone was happy to have a roof over his head.
If we have more time than one afternoon in Trinidad, then it is worth seeing interesting places in the surrounding areas, such as the Playa Ancón beach or the Sucrerie Valley.
Then, in the evening, it's customary to go to the House of Music that breathes after the sun's bed and where music is only arranged in the early morning.
Baracoa
Some design this bourgeoisie located in the far East of Cuba as the most beautiful island.
This opinion is probably already influenced by the way it goes.
The two roads that have since Guantánamo have had to cross high and dangerous mountains and cross a landscape almost without signs of human activity.
UNESCO has entered the East Cuba school, thanks to its intact landscape, on the list of world heritage.
There is the best chocolate made, in the church, there is the cross of Christophe Colomb (in fact, it has seen the day almost a hundred years after Columbus' pilgrimage) and since the hill where the old strong chain and the current El Castillo hotel are held, it is seen several table mountains, the most famous of which is El Yunque.
With regard to coffee, rhum, cigarettes, the Sierra Maestre mountain range, the Bay of the Triumphs and the Isle of Pinos, the Tropicana Cabaret, the sanctuary of the Holy Father of Cuba Caridad del Cobre, the Santeria, African religions practiced by the descendants of the former slaves, it could be filled with a number of pages.
However, as we just said, it's better to see it once.
In Afghanistan, alliances are passive, claiming Americans
The lack of troops and equipment required affects the management of the mission in Afghanistan, according to the United States.
According to Defence Minister Robert Gates, NATO should issue a concrete plan for the coming years.
The mission in Afghanistan does not take place as it should, the representatives of countries with troops in the south of the country agreed in Edinburgh, Scotland.
In addition to the growing controversy on the part of the Taliban movement, the eight States involved today are also discussing future plans and the coordination of alliances.
While the United States called this week's Minister of Defence Robert Gates' troops into greater activity, Great Britain sees as a priority the strengthening of the authority of the Afghan Government and the intensifying of development assistance.
"The evolution in Afghanistan is understandable, but military power can only be part of the solution.
The other is allowing residents to start their own new economic and security development," said the British Defence Minister of Browne to the BBC channel.
Forty-eight-ten per cent
The activities of Afghans insurgents are, according to the U.S. Army data, the most intense of these five years.
The number of violent acts increased by 27 per cent over the past year, up to 60 per cent in Helmand Province, located in the south of the country.
NATO countries had some 40,000 troops in Afghanistan, including about a quarter in the south.
According to the United States, however, alliances have reached their absolute limit in the organization and equipment of the troops.
In particular, they call for other helicopters, soldiers and experts to train Afghan troops.
"We must seriously think about the specific objectives for the future period, as well as how to achieve them," said Gates.
NATO Secretary-General Jaap de Hoop has taken similar issues today.
"I am not pleased with what we have on earth and in the air in Afghanistan.
We have almost twenty-five percent of the soldiers and equipment we needed, and that is not enough," De Hoop told the Reuters agency at the end of talks with the Japanese government in Tokyo for three days.
Who's Passive
In recent months conflicts have also existed between countries involved in the issue of whether all alliances are actually doing their best in Afghanistan.
For example, Germany has been criticized for its liabilities.
"The Germans have a relatively large representation in Afghanistan.
But they are engaged in areas where violence is minimal, the fighting requirements they are subject to are not as severe as those in the South and East parts of the country where we operate," said Gates.
The British Sun tabloid has qualified this week the German Parisian soldiers.
"The Afghan fans discovered: the Germans play, while we fight," wrote Sun in a document filled with photos of German soldiers playing table tennis.
The German newspaper Bild has been attacked by publishing the photo of a British team during a rugby match in the southern part of Afghanistan.
The debt of the State will fall to a billion in 2009
The burden of a State debt exceeding 84,000 korones falls on each Czech State.
The total debt is charged at 842.7 billion dollars at the end of September.
The Government had planned to borrow 159.2 billion crowns this year.
As a result of a change in state budget savings better than planned, the Ministry has reduced its budget to 152.8 billion korons.
The debt of the State of the Czech Republic is raised by the end of September to 842.7 billion crowns.
During the nine months of this year, he has thus increased to 40.2 billion crowns.
Since June, however, he has reduced to 13.4 billion crowns.
Today, the Ministry of Finance has thus confirmed its data on State debt since the beginning of October.
The charge of a debt exceeding 84,000 crowns falls on each Czech.
Over the last year, the State has committed more than 111 billion crowns.
"For the moment, it appears that, due to a less important deficit for the next year, there could only be one billion crowns in 2009.
The next year, the debt should be between 900 billion and a billion crowns," said Patria Finance David Marek analyst for the iHNed.cz server.
The forecast of Next Financial Analyst Vladimir Pikor is similar: "There could be more than one billion in 2009.
The precise date will depend on the next budget that we don't know yet.
If the situation on the political scene appeared to change, that policies were ready to save more, the date could be postponed in 2010.
But I don't expect this change," he explained.
Credits to the translators
The debt of the State is made up of central government debt and is primarily generated by the accumulation of State budget deficits.
The State's debt is financed by assets of the asset, income securities, direct loans or, for example, loans to the European Investment Bank.
This year's internal revenue increased by 38.5 billion to 719.4 billion korons.
The State's external debt has increased this year by 1.7 billion crowns to 123.3 billion crowns.
The debt of the so-called negotiable State reached the end of September 803.3 billion korons and since June it has decreased by 13.7 billion korons.
The state debt averaged 6.5 years.
"The total debt has increased annually from the first to the third half of 13 per cent, which is, in view of the current health of the economy, a very high figure.
It is interesting that the increase is mainly generated by income securities where it reaches 20 per cent.
It is bad that debt is growing, but on the other hand it indicates that it will have to negotiate when retirement reform comes," commented Pikora data.
Better than we expected.
It was clear from the State debt financing and management strategy for 2007 that the Government had planned to borrow 159.2 billion crowns this year.
At the beginning of September, however, thanks to a change in state budget savings, the Ministry has reduced its budget to 152.8 billion korons.
The amount is essentially due to the state budget deficit, which is likely to reach 76 billion dollars this year, instead of 91.3 billion dollars originally planned.
It is then the maximum resources available for the Czech Consolidation Agency, namely 13.3 billion korons, the 10 billion reserve for pension payments, the financing of state pension entitlements for 43 billion korons and the reimbursement of the European Investment Bank's loans amounting to 1.8 billion korons.
She'd be compared today to a court in Khartoum to appoint an hour in the field.
The British teacher who was tried in the Sudan for Islamal Injury was sentenced on Thursday night by a Khartoum court to 15 days in prison and to expulsion, stated his lawyer.
Britain was accused of leaving students from 6 to 7 years of age to give the name of Mahomet to an hour in prison, while any representation of the prophet of Islam was illegal.
She was a pain in the ass.
This 54-year-old British institution operating at Khartoum University in the Sudan was arrested on Sunday and charged with violations of Islam and exile under article 125 of the Sudanese Criminal Code, following several complaints from students' parents to the Sudan Ministry of Education.
The story actually goes back in September when this teacher asks her students, 6/7 years old, to choose a name for the class's time in the field.
"Three names come from the children's mouth, including Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed," says school director Robert Boulos.
Finally, after a vote in the class, 20 out of 23 children chose Mohammed as the preferred name.
Mohammed is certainly the name of the Muslim prophet, but above all a very common name in Sudan.
The children then produced a book for the class with the photo of the watch following the legend "My name is Mohamed".
The hour itself did not bear any label with that name, but the problem was simply that of the prophet who was considered an insult to Islam.
One of the Muslim colleagues of Gillian Gibbons, who taught in the same school in Sudan, explained that he knew it well and that he would never have done anything that could be insulting to a religious faith, "I just regret that she asked the children to vote for a name," he said, but it was a "innocent mistake".
Opinion shared by many students of the institute who describe it as "very careful with their students" and "who never speaks of religion in class".
Remember that the name Mohamed is also the second most given name in Great Britain, it is written in 14 different languages.
This name often chosen by Muslim families is a way to honor the prophet (often given to the first child of a family).
But what are the rules regarding the use of this name?
For example, can you give it to a game?
This is of course an interpretation issue.
They did not reach an agreement on the future status of the province at the last negotiations in Vienna.
In the end, I miss him.
The Serbs and the Albanians of Kosovo ended Wednesday morning in Baden, Austria, a sixth and last discussion meeting without having been able to overcome their differences on the future status of the separatist province.
"It is regrettable that the parties were unable to reach an agreement on the status," said European mediator Wolfgang Ischinger at a press conference in Vienna.
Stressing that peace in the region was "in the game", American counterpart Frank Wisner urged Belgrade and Pristina to respect their commitment to preserve peace and dialogue beyond the end of negotiations.
"We do not expect immediate violence but we will enter a very difficult period," he added, relevant to the "existing apparent tensions".
End of the mediation on 10 December
Troika mediators, which groupes the European Union, the United States and Russia, will return one Monday in Serbia and Kosovo.
The future of the province of 90 per cent Albanophones could become clearer when the Russian mediaman Alexander Botsane-Khartchenko presented their report to the United Nations Security Council by 10 December.
Baden's discussions near Vienna were the sixth and last negotiating session since the Troika was charged with a new UN mediation in August last.
Americans and Europeans believed that their mediation would end on 10 December.
The Russians, who have already blocked the Security Council from granting independence in Kosovo, insist on continuing negotiations beyond that date.
"Russia was and remains committed to a negotiated solution, a compromise solution," Botsane-Khartchenko said.
Declaration of unilateral independence?
After eight years of unusual administration of Kosovo, Westerners believe that independence under the supervision of the EU is the only viable solution.
Pristina is prepared to make its declaration unilaterally if the Security Council does not intervene in its favour.
Belgrade insists on increasing autonomy.
"Unfortunately, no agreement has been found," announced the President of Kosovo's autonomous authority, Fatmir Sejdiu, in Baden's hotel where since Monday these "negotiations of the latest chance".
Hashim Thaci, former commander of the Kosovo Revolution and the future Prime Minister of the province, expressed his regret.
But he added that the autonomy plan presented by Belgrade “was part of a past that led to murders and deportations”.
‘Effect domain’
Serbian President Boris Tadic estimated that a compromise was always feasible, keeping the Albanian majority in Kosovo against the consequences of a unilateral declaration of the province ' s independence.
In particular, Belgrade said to reduce a "domino effect" in a region still fragmented by the wars of the 1990s.
"For Serbia, he said, this does not mean that a compromise is impossible."
Tuesday, the Serbian delegation insisted that any decision should be returned exclusively to the Security Council, where its Russian alliance has a veto right.
"The Parliament of Kosovo will have the last word"
"Only a solution within the Security Council is acceptable for Serbia," said Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica.
"The negotiations lasted two years.
They must end up as they began: to the Security Council."
To journalists, Fatmir Sedjiu replied that "the Kosovo Parliament will have the last word on the status", adding that any unilateral declaration of independence on the part of the Albanians would be "contested" with the West.
Bush makes an agreement between Israelis and Palestinians
At the opening of the International Peace Conference on Tuesday, in Annapolis, Maryland, President George Bush announced that the Israelis and Palestinians had finally agreed on a joint declaration.
He pointed out that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas were willing to undertake negotiations immediately in order to find a definitive solution to the 60-year-old happiness among their two peoples.
In the presence of the two men, Bush promised to do everything to help them conclude a "peace treaty" before the end of 2008.
Meanwhile, Palestinians must detonate "terrorist infrastructures" and Israel must end its colonization activities, Bush said, reminding both parties of their obligations with regard to the "road map" for the peace they have accepted in 2003.
The head of the White House stressed that the negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority chaired by Abbas would "conclusion a peace treaty to resolve all outstanding issues, without exception, including central issues".
This call covers the three Spanish problems in the heart of the Israelis and Palestinians: the future borders of Palestine, the state of Jerusalem and the fate of the Arab refugees scattered from their homes in what is today the State of Israel in the 1948 conflict.
Taking the floor after the President of the United States, Abbas insisted that future negotiations be "global and profound" and on all aspects of a regulation, including "Jerusalem, refugees, borders, colonies, water, security, among others".
On his tour to the court, Olmert committed himself to making future speakers "direct and continuous" and "an effort to block them in the 2008 flow".
Bush set the deadline for the implementation of its "two-State vision" by the end of 2008.
Saudi Arabia revealed that she had received a commitment in this regard from Bush before she decided to participate in the conference.
Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis is a success for Washington, is at the root of a plan, worn by all Arab countries, which offers Israel peace in exchange for its withdrawal from all Arab territories occupied during the 1967 war, including Jerusalem-East.
Annapolis marks "a career in the history of the Middle East, especially because it attacks the root causes of the conflict and its central aspects," says Prince Saudi in his interview with Saudi Arab daily capital.
The police are not responsible for the prosecution.
What exactly happened, Sunday?
Like every time in this type of fact, official and Romanian versions are opposed.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the first elements of the National Police Inspectorate's Survey (NGPN), a police car circled on Sunday, less than 17 hours later, Louise-Michel Street, in Villaries-le-Bel.
"It was not in intervention but in patrol, and circled to 40-50 km/h, without gyrophare," explains a police source.
A green motor of the Kawazaki brand, "not approved, so not allowed to travel on the public road" (read below) and piloted by two young people without helmets, circled "to very live forever".
"She lost the police car on her left after a right-priority refusal," says one police officer.
The control of alcohol on vehicle operators was negative.
The state of the car (formerly detonated, starded parent-bricks, arrears) testifies to the violence of the shock.
Very soon, tomorrow morning, the prosecutor of the Republic of Pontoise, Marie-Thérère de Givry, announced that he had commissioned an investigation into "involuntary and non-sustainable murder committed by a person in danger" to the IGPN, cosacia with the Departmental Directorate of Public Security of Val-d'Oise.
In the afternoon, at a press conference, the prosecutor stated that the IGPN investigation at this stage excluded police responsibility.
According to the judge, three witnesses of the accident, heard on Sunday evening, confirmed "the police version, namely that this mini-moto has arrived relatively quickly on their left".
Yesterday, a kind of kidney, doubtless caused by the melting of the feet on the ground, showed that the two vehicles were still locked up when the police car arrived to freeze.
Vehicles have been taken and will be subject to technical expertise.
The bodies of the two victims were autopsy yesterday.
What happened just after?
Yesterday, a roommate moved fast in Villaries-le-Bel, which said the police would have left the places very quickly, thus not getting help from the two young people.
The IPPN, however cautious, would also eliminate "all serious errors" on this point.
"It is a aspect of the most difficult investigation, which requires more research, which must be very careful," stated a police source.
Freedom met with an eye witness from these few incidents that followed the accident.
One of his windows giving it exactly on the scene.
"We're all down from now on, with my cousin who's infirm at the hospital, trying to get rid of them, tells this witness.
There was nothing to do."
He then saw "a policeman completely hagged, who was fighting.
Two others were trying to reanimise one of them, the fourth was talking on the phone.”
Faced with the tension that quickly surrounds the scene, and it seems to be certain that the young people had faced the unexpected situation, the police were driven by colleagues arriving on the premises.
According to this witness, the relief came “about twenty minutes after the start of the police”.
They also practiced cardiac massages, in vain.
"I will not say that police services have not helped young people.
These young people were rescued.
The pumps arrived all the time.
Everything has been done to try to save them," the prosecutor stressed.
The Tension Mounted in Pakistan
The Pakistani police have been repressing the first demonstrations since the establishment of the state of emergency two days earlier by General Musharraf.
In the city of Lahore, in the eastern part of the country, about 2,000 lawyers who were protesting the measures taken under the emergency state were injured by the larymogenous grenades used by the order forces, according to witnesses.
These last ones were attacked by stone jets, hurting the police.
At least 350 lawyers were interviewed.
Similar scenarios in Karachi and Rawalpindi, or police, have been charged and injured by lawyers.
A number would have been interviewed.
In Islamabad, lawyers from the Supreme Court's barge called for a general strike and announced demonstrations, following a wave of some 500 arrests during the weekend of opponents, human rights activists and lawyers.
The streets accessing the Supreme Court were blocked on Monday morning to prevent the assembly.
Other events would have taken place in Multitan (center) and Peshawar (north-west).
The movement of lawyers gathered support for the religious parties grouped in the strong alliance Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal, which the President urged the people to send flowers to judges who have spoken against the state of emergency and to those who have been extremely prepared in front of Musharraf.
"The Muharraf promise no more"
The Supreme Court of Pakistan is directly addressed by the measure of exception announced on Saturday evening.
It should take place in the next few days on the legality of the reelection to the Presidential President, on 6 October, in the indirect suffering of President Musharraf.
The President of the Court, Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, was dismissed and replaced.
'All this is illegal, anti-constitutional and contrary to the Supreme Court' said the teacher in The News.
Pervez Musharraf's promise to leave the army and become a 'no more' civil president after the state of emergency was instituted, said Monday's Deputy Minister of Information Tariq Azeem.
Leaving his military uniform was expected until 15 November, at the end of his first presidential term.
The Deputy Minister of Information also confirmed that the January elections could be reported.
In addition, the Government of Pakistan has deploreed the persistent Roma in the country where President Musharraf had been assigned to reside by his Deputy Chief of Armed Forces.
More than one third of the adults remain unpredictably
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24 per cent) as well as planned or unplanned births.
Today, more than one in three (36%) is not expected today, a study conducted by the National Institute for Demographic Studies (Ined), 40 years after the vote of the Neuwirth Act which liberalized the violation in France.
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24 per cent) as well as planned or unplanned births.

Spectacular repair on the space station
It will take more than seven hours to work in space at Scott Parazynski astronaut and its international Space Station (ISS) crew members to perform the spectacular repair of a dedicated solar panel, which is essential for the continued scientific activities of the station.
A risky output that accumulated the records of its duration, its distance from living modules, its speed with which it was imagined, of "brilled" tools by the astronauts to perform repair.
The problem appeared on Tuesday while the astronauts were downloading from the Discovery ship the Harmony module, a large cylindrical room that was soon to host European and Japanese scientific laboratories (see frame).
This module is a type of docking for working modules.
But they must be able to supply them with electricity.
The second task of the crew was to move an electricity production module by 17.5 tons of solar panels, already present on ISS, in order to place it on its final position.
After moving, the crew started the re-exploitation of the solar panels of the module which had a 76-metre diameter diameter.
And that's where one of the panels, which acts like gifts, has been damaged almost a meter by a cable that's stuck.
The deployment has been stopped so as not to further damage the panel.
Astronauts, who were originally supposed to perform a control exit of the Discovery vessel, then to repair another solar panel whose rotation system was defective, were forced to dedicate themselves to the damaged panel.
And it's Scott Parazynski who was chosen to caraculate at the top of the 30 metres long of the ordered ship's arm added to the station for repair.
This is one of the best "space walker" in Nasa.
Large, resistant, very suitable, it has very developed and long arms.
Thus, at 46 years of age, this trained doctor was responsible for "operating" the "damaged" solar panel.
After carefully inspecting the damages, he cut down the false cable and installed types of "athlates" on the damaged area.
He was helped by a second spacewalker staying near the sand and, inside, by the other astronauts, Peggy Whitson, the crew commander.
The tool he used, an insulating hockey mini-cane, to avoid electrocution on solar panels producing several hundred volts, was designed and "bricoled" by the astronauts on board the station.
Once the operation was completed, Scott Parazynski expected the panel to be fully deployed before making the inventory of his tools and to restore the inside of the station.
Yesterday afternoon, the astronauts took advantage of a half-day of detention before today, seven astronauts do not reconnaissance the Discovery ship for a return to Wednesday's planned land.
The EADS Title fined in Bourse
The EADS action is currently under way at the Paris Round, after the A400M Aeronautics and Defence Group announced that it would have to spend between EUR 1.2 and 1.4 billion in order to meet the A400M delays.
EADS currently loses 4% to 21.96 euros at the Paris Exchange.
The group was obliged to review its operational performance forecast for 2007 following the delays generated by the slow progress of the A400M engine, which requires the inaugural flight of the aircraft.
The cost of the delay in the delivery of its military transport aircraft, announced in October, is between EUR 1,2 billion and EUR 1.4 billion, which is more than 1 billion for Airbus, announced the home of the European EADS builder.
As a result of these charges, EADS will be obliged to announce new operating performance targets (EBIT) for 2007 when its next trimesteral results are presented, adding no more precise figures.
The group also indicates that the estimate of new charges is consistent with the delay of six months.
To recall, the operational result of EADS fell by 86 per cent in 2006, mainly due to delays in another programme, which is the largest A380 carrier.
At first, the group had a first delivery of A400M to the French army in October 2009.
The selection from the status quo
There will be no suspension on Sunday at the end of the uranium: the Russians will make a massive choice for the party of President Putine, Russia.
Confirming their aspirations for stability, that is, authoritarianism, after a very slow campaign.
For three days of the legislative elections, Russian President Vladimir Putine today addressed the voters with a message on public channels, already registered but the content of which is kept secret.
It is made up of Russia's U.S. list head, the pro-Kremlin part whose victory is declared decisive.
Yesterday, the President had nothing to do with receiving foreign embassies, happy to deliver a new charge against the accused West - his pre-election issue during the campaign.
"We know the price of true democracy and we want honest, transparent and open elections, free elections," he added.
In the eyes of the opposition, we are far from the account.
She claims an intense campaign of pressure.
Communist leader Guennadi Ziuganov said that there was "never a fair election, even in the time of Eltsin".
After the repression of the last weekend's demonstrations, the former champion of the world of chess, Gary Kasparov, sentenced to five days in prison for illegal demonstrations, remains forbidden to visit according to his lawyer.
"The Russians have kept the mind of the Soviets"
Two more open issues are being raised behind these unsustained legislation:
- Who's going to succeed Putin in the presidency?
The official newspaper published yesterday the date of the first round of the presidency on 2 March 2008; the candidates met until 23 December.
He was elected in 2000 and re-elected in 2004, Vladimir Putine could not extend a third consecutive mandate.
But there's no successor.
- What role will Putin play after March?
Prime Minister?
Head of the parliamentary majority and of the United Kingdom's most powerful party who would choose the Government and the President?
In any case, to the legislators as well as to the presidential, the power coming out will be triumphal.
It's a tradition.
"The Russians have kept the mind of the Soviets, they do not feel masters of their destiny," estimates sociologist Lev Goudkov, director of the independent center Levada.
The history of Nikolai Kopossov, of St. Petersburg State University, goes further: civil society has been delayed in this Christian country five centuries after Europe; the famous Community spirit has delayed the formation of individualism.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s, "Potine re-examined with the model of a patriarchal state, perfectly accepted by the population as much as this new patriarchalism was not followed by terror, but by some economic ease," says Maria Lipman of the Carnegie Foundation.
Today the Russians are "fully renouncing personal responsibility" which they had briefly proved after the fall of the USSR.
"What's good to think about?"
The phenomenon affects all social layers, including the world of business.
And the administrative elite intends to preserve the status quo: 65 governments (of 85 heads of Russian regions) direct the local lists of Russia.
New freedoms imported from the West are often synonyms of chaos, as in the 1990s.
The opinion prefers stability.
In whose name the Russians will no longer vote for the extremists.
Tamara Tcherednitchenko, 54 - year - old professor, concludes: “What is it good to think about?
Those who are in power are not too bad, why change them? ”
A Deep Memory
After more than 60 years of confidentiality, Bad Arolsen's Nazi archives, which trace the fates of 17.5 million victims of the Hitler regime, are available for free access.
The 47 million archive documents, placed on 27 km of line at Bad Arolsen (Hesse), were available only for a "humanitarian" purpose, i.e. individually and nominatively, on the request of an ancient victim or his or her legal assistants.
The eleven States in charge of their management - including Germany, France, Israel and the United States - agreed in May 2006 to open them to researchers and historians.
The process of ratification of this agreement by all States is over, and the opening has been effective since yesterday.
Sensitible Information
The access of historians to Bad Arolsen will allow research "including on the movement of prisoners, the population of the camps and the health status of forced workers", explains Reto Meistern, director of these archives managed by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICCR).
To date, several States, including Germany, have opposed the openness of these nominative documents, due to the sensitive nature of certain information.
Like alleged homosexuality or mental disability of certain victims of deportation.
The records of concentration camps or arrest warrants established by the Gestapo had been collected after war for a practical purpose: to find out whether nationals were deported or subjected to compulsory work and, where appropriate, to provide them with evidence of their detention, in order to open the way for their compensation.
Still today in Bad Arolsen, more than 300 permanent employees deal with tens of thousands of individual applications.
However, for a part of the scientific community, access to Bad Arolsen is of limited interest.
"There is nothing fundamentally new to wait for these documents," said Mr. Wolfgang Benz, director of the Research Centre on Anti-Semitism at the Technical University of Berlin in 2006.
The EU and India want to reach a free exchange agreement in 2008
At present, indo-European bilateral trade has already reached EUR 60 billion per year.
The EU is India's first trading partner and represents 18% of its external trade.
The European Union and India hope to sign a free trade agreement in 2008, said European Commissioner for Trade Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart, Kamal Nath.
In April, EU Foreign Ministers gave their last Green Paper to the European Commission to undertake negotiations to sign free trade agreements (ALE) with India, South Korea and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean). Indo-European bilateral trade has already reached EUR 60 billion per year.
The EU is India's first trading partner and represents 18% of its external trade.
The EU is also its first foreign investor, but India is only the 9th EU trade partner, according to the European Commission figures.
"A free trade agreement will greatly double the two economies" and "India would improve its access to a prosperous European market of 450 million," Peter Mandelson explained.
Europe represents the first or second market for each of the first ten products exported by India, stated the European Commissioner. Asian and European genes are changing for "47 billion Euros of Goods" and "10 billion Euros of Services", stated this week Danielle Smadja, head of the European Commission delegation in New Delhi, regretting that bilateral trade has not yet "not yet reached its potential". The EU and India are back on Friday for their eighth diplomatic summit in New Delhi in the presence of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and European Commission President José Manuel Durao Barroso.

The Bank of England pays attention to its concerns by offering 10 billion books in five weeks
The Bank of England has been called concerned about the current return of concerns on credit terms, and has announced an offer of ten billion books at the base rate of 5.75 per cent over five weeks, an offer of an unusual duration.
"In order to alleviate the concerns that the financial market conditions will be particularly closed at the end of the year, and to give banks greater certainty as to how they will organize their liquidity positions during this period, the Bank intends to provide an important proportion of its contribution of reserves for the maintenance period beginning on 6 December in the form of a five-week open market operation," she said in a communication.
The Bank states that 10 billion euros (14 billion euros) will be placed on the market on 6 December to 12H15 GMT at the base rate and until 10 January.
This is the first time it seems that the BoE is placing on the market liquidity for five weeks in an open market operation.
These usually take place within a week.
The BoE adds in its Communication that "it is ready to take other measures to maintain interbank loans" on a daily basis with its basic rate.
The interbank rate per day was 5.829 per cent Wednesday.
The three-month rate was 6.6%, higher since 18 September.
Since the beginning of the summer financial crisis, the sums placed on the market by the Bank of England have been associated with an important level of criminality which had prevented banks from making use of it.
According to some Romanians, supported by the evolution of the book course in relation to the euro, many preferred to subscribe to the sums marketed by the European Central Bank at more favourable rates and with more secure discretion.
UMP and NC refuse to review PS proposals on purchasing power
The UMP and New Centre groups refused to discuss articles of the Socialist proposal on purchasing power, which was equivalent to a rejection of the text.
In a socialist "nice" (meeting at the initiative of a parliamentary group), the text drew up a dozen measures taken on Tuesday by the National PS Office, including the increase of 50% of the unemployment premium, the recovery of the floating TIP, a check-in or rental framework.
UMP and NC voted against the review of articles (180 votes to 115), the meeting was brought to a conclusion at the conclusion of the general discussion which led to exchanges, sometimes live, between majority and opposition for hours from Nicolas Sarkozy's television interview on purchasing power.
The Chief of Staff of PS Jean-Marc Ayrault announced that his group would represent the integrity of its proposals in the form of amendments to the draft rectification funding law considered by the Assembly next week.
A New Festival Sees the Day
Following numerous novels on the creation by C3 Presents of a new music festival in Philadelphia, the promoter/producer announces the Wineland Music Festival in New Jersey, in partnership with the Festival Republic of the British producer Melvin Benn.
"For our business, it is an honor to work with someone who has, no more or less, inspired the current movement of festivals in America," Charlie Jones of C3 entrusted to Billboard.com.
C3 produces the Lollapalooza festival in Chicago and the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland, New Jersey, is a summer camping destination.
The festival should be held from 8 to 10 August on a private farm of 500 acres to about 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
Also known as Mean Fiddler, director of the Republic Festival Melvin Benn, is one of the world's most respected festival producers.
In 1989 he took the reading festival to the United Kingdom, which attracted some 80,000 people annually.
In 1999, Melvin Benn added Leeds Festival to his portfolio and in 2006, Festival Republic created the Henham Park Festival Latitude in Suffolk.
Since 2002, as co-owner, Melvin Benn has also been responsible for the production, licensing and organizational tasks of the Glastonbury Festival, which can now accommodate up to 177,500 people.
Qualifying Glastonbury of the "most inspiring event" he has never attended, Charlie Jones of C3 says his company and Melvin Benn are working in parallel to give the region a European-style event.
"Our planes chose Philadelphia as a market and worked together with the Fairmount Parks Commission to create a festival in the centre of Philadelphia," says Charlie Jones.
"Our conversations with the city and the Commission were motivated and excited by this project.
Unfortunately, we have been involved in politics because of the current administration, continued by Charlie Jones.
"Happyly, we were able to discuss with Melvin Benn and we are learning to create a great festival on an exceptional site that will ultimately serve the people of Philadelphia."
C3 Presents resurrected the Lollapalooza festival in 2005 to the Grand Park of Chicago, after being marked in the festival landscape in 2002 with the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
The two events recorded gross revenue of $9.8M and $11.3M in 2007.
These two festivals are held in the middle of the city.
"Melvin Benn's European model is a camping festival, while we do have a place in urban green spaces," says Charlie Jones.
The objective is to merge, in one way or another, the two formulas to give both the impression of a festival camp in Europe and urban America."
Vineland is near midway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
"The community of Vineland, including the mayor, actively supports the holding of this event," says Charlie Jones.
The latter refuses to disclose the terms of the agreement, but says "that they are interesting enough to allow investment in such an event and to welcome a festival which, if you hope, will have a long life."
Charlie Jones says that the reception capacity of this festival is "very great" at the time of the 80 000 people in Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee.
He said that invitations were sent to groups, but that nothing could be confirmed at the time they went under pressure.
"Veneland will be smart rock, but music will be varied, hoping to attract all kinds of spectators," said Charlie Jones.
His C3 partners, who received the award Top Independent Promoter from the latest Billboard Touring Awards, are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.
Montréal facing the Terminator
It's not easy to attract Hollywood film plates in Montreal when there's no other Terminator than...
This seduction mission is part of the delegation's functions.
A mandate - "politically difficult" because California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger condemns "runway productions".
Is it difficult to play in the "Governator" shoes?
"He must be careful, it's the industry that decides where it goes.
If she finds that the conditions in Montreal are favourable, she'll go there.
Our role is to offer what they want to judge the best," he said.
The Course at the Festivals
For the moment, however, Denis Turcotte's priority is the promotion of the film here.
The Oscars race is started.
It will be of all the Western Coast festivals, whether Sundance, Denver, Seattle or San Francisco, the question of presenting Quebec films, putting them in place and ensuring that the performers are interviewing.
The December Age had a beautiful wine at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival, just a few weeks ago.
It will be presented at Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake Hands with the Devil is on display in Santa Monica and will be presented at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival in November.
Québec also presented four long and four short fairs to the American Film Institute Festival this month.
Will there be an end-of-year round? Experts divided by the sub-primary crisis.
In less than five weeks of closure of the financial year, investors are already shaking their hands while waiting for the end of the year's traditional track.
However, this year experts are not as certain as this will happen.
Banif believes that "from a statistical point of view, the month of December in the course generally has a positive attitude.
However, it is not necessary to provide statistical-based only forecasts, as given the current context, the uncertainty of markets is at least short-term. "
Although they are not involved in the fact that the scholarship takes place in the last few weeks of the year, these experts note that "the bourgeois market is fed by liquidity, willing to invest in the absence of guarantees, especially fixed income, affected by the effect of flight to quality values both in long periods and in short".
For this reason, they believe that the race will have a rather lateral behaviour, not excluding volatility "especially since we do not know the impact of the likely decline in the rates of the Fed, given the high level of grossness and the risk of stimulating inflationist tensions"
Javier Barrio, responsible for sales of GDP in Spain, agrees that this is not the right time to say there will be a rally.
"That's not the best thing," says the expert.
Ibex, the Spanish bourgeoisie index, has lost nearly 4% since 8 November when the index has closed at 15.945.7 points.
However, not all experts have such a negative view.
Juan Solana, an analyst at Intermoney, believes that Ibex 35 could close the year to 16,000 points by reorganizing portfolios and traditional contributions to retirement schemes that take place every year during these dates.
However, the expert suggests that things will be a little different this year because he believes that the rally will take place from the second week of December after the end of the Constitution (December 6th).
The analyst does not consider that volatility will affect the market trend.
On the other hand, Federico Olucha, an Inversis Banco analyst, assesses that we are close to technical levels and "that is why we could observe a rebuff of the index that could be caused by information coming from the European Union on the consequences of the credit market crisis".
The analyst hopes they'll be positive.
Analysts agree to choose the values that will be responsible for leading Ibex to new maximum cuts.
Solana, from Intermoney, says that "this year the great values are coming back for him".
The expert would include the two large banks in the portfolio and some builders "because when the date comes, the electricity sector will be very expensive".
While Federico Olucha, of Inversis Banco, ensures that households will be from the bank and industry.
The constructions can also benefit from this street, where they are located.
"ACS has been recovering positions for several months and we hope that other constructions like Railway and FCC will follow the same path," explains the expert.
The cyclical consumption will be significant in the last part of the year due to the increase in sales in the Christmas marketing season.
On the other hand, the expert believes that technology companies will do so well, although there are not much representation on the Spanish market in this case.
Five times in seven years
During the last seven years, only two occasions during December was a month lower.
The genuine end-of-year route took place in 2003, during which bourgeoisie markets emerged from the crisis caused by technology noise.
This year, during which Ibex 35 recovered 28,17 per cent, the month of December recorded an increase of 6,68 per cent.
It will be necessary to see whether 2007 is the fifth consecutive year of gains (for the time being Ibex has increased by 8.36% since January) and whether it has been able to computer on its final year-end route.
The People's Bank will open 200 open offices on Monday 12 a.m.
The People's Bank has decided to renovate a large part of its offices.
In total, 200 banks are located in Spain's most commercial areas.
These subsidiaries, which operate under the Max Popular brand, represent a major change for the bank.
Also for the rest of the Spanish agencies, since it is the first group that decided to start working on the uninterrupted opening of its agencies up to 2030 and to open the Saturday from 10 a.m. to 2030.
Another group has also repeated several times that it would like to extend the hours of its subsidiary, BBVA, even if it has not yet decided to take the first step.
It is about concluding an agreement with trade unions to close 75% of its agencies on Saturday instead of opening a afternoon, but not public.
The results of the experience of the People's Bank will be decisive for other bodies to join this initiative in trade time.
This is precisely what the People's Bank is looking for.
To attract autonomous customers who travel in these areas to make their purchases in SMEs and the trades of selected streets to open.
The Bank wants to open these 200 agencies that have been implemented throughout Spain for about 18 months, as it is not about opening up new agencies but about renovating existing agencies.
To this end, the body will modernise the branches it already has in the commercial areas, adapting them to the customer profile of different streets.
In this way, time amplification is accompanied by a different design from the interior of the basement and a new design, more current, with more bright colors.
The bank's business manager, Angel Rivera, ensures that this renewal does not involve large investments, but staffing, as the number of employees will increase from six to eight or nine by agency.
The agencies, which will also have space for SMEs to meet there, will sell non-financial products.
A positive experience for the group
The People's Bank has already tested its initiative in three Madrid agencies.
And experience has been positive, as explained by Angel Rivero.
The streets of Murillo Brave, O'Donnell and the Grand Vía de Madrid are the streets to be chosen, and with apparent success, according to Rivero.
The People's Bank currently has 2,500 subsidiaries.
And 60 others working under the WorldCredit brand, specialized in the case of immigrants, as well as with very large hours, which open even Sunday and holiday days.
In these PopularMax agencies they will not copy the BBVA model, where many of its agencies have a large non-financial product potential for their sales.
' We do not want to compete with our customers ', notes Rivero.
For the moment, they have reached an agreement with Telefónica to sell mobile phones, with an external staff at the bank.
Telecinco double for the first time the value in Bourse of its Antena 3 rival
We're here.
With this phrase Paolo Vasile, a member of Telecinco, expressed satisfaction at the conclusion of the bourgeoisie market yesterday when he found that the chain he led doubled the value of his rival, Antena 3.
A single aspect terrifies his joy: 'What harms me is not the fact that we are increased but that we are less down' he said.
However, he stressed the fact that on a low market, we ' fell less '.
Telecinco finished yesterday with an increase of 2.54%.
This gain stabilizes its loss to 15.66% in one year.
The value in Bourse of the company controlled by Mediaset (with 52% of its capital) and announced by Vocento (13% plus) thus amounts to EUR 4,488.88 million, according to Bloomberg data.
Its Antena rival 3, which dropped 1,52% yesterday, and which has a decline of 40.5% since January, costs half, 2,193.46 million.
The value of other listed communications companies in Bourse is 3,571 million in Sogecable case; 2,518.53 million in Prisa (the editor of Cinco Días) and 1,779 million in Vocento.
According to Vasile, the comparison with Antenne 3 is that we are talking about two similar companies.
The relative fact is what we are able to do on the same market at what price and how we pay it in terms of hearing. '
Telecinco announced last week that he planned to become the first television channel this year to exceed 1,000 million gross advertising revenues, as provided by Giuseppe Tringali, the Advisor of Telecinco and Publispaña, the branch that manages the group's advertising.
For this to be true, the television channel should record an increase of 3.6 per cent in its advertising invoice for the 2006 financial year compared to 965.4 million.
For its part, the net invoice of Antenne 3 has increased by 1.6 per cent in the first nine months of the year (up to 734.4 million) while net TV revenues have increased by 0.7 per cent (630.4 million).
One of the factors that analysts point to for the best relative evolution of Telecinco in Bourse is the important eastern country that it has maintained so far: in 2006, the company chaired by Alejandro Echevarría distributed 100% of its shareholdings.
Vasile ensures that, although it is quick to make a decision, this ratio could vary after buying 33% of Endemol and in association with Mediaset.
" We have an official commitment to provide at least 50 per cent, although we have always made much more statements.
This year, I hope that we will be able to make our shareholders happy, those to whom we have already given titles with 33% of Endemol '.
According to analysts, the market now gives signs of fatigue.
Lehman Brothers recently reduced his estimates of the benefits on Telecinco in 2008 to 4% and in 2009, to 7%.
This is due, they explain, to the decline in expected income from 10.5 per cent to 8.4 per cent in 2008 and 5.5 per cent to 5.1 per cent in 2009.
This same company has reduced the expected gains from Antenne 3 to 4.5% in 2008 and 7.5% in 2009.

Congress approves the transfer of the Mifid, which entered into force on 1 November
At the same time as its parliamentary form, which has today completed with the vote of the Congress of Amendments incorporated into the draft Senate, the Government has submitted to a public hearing the regulation that will develop the new law with a view to its entry into force before the end of the year.
The representatives of the various groups agreed to highlight the efforts made by MEPs and senators to negotiate and make the best regulation to ensure the protection of investors and to regulate in detail the activities of the agencies for the effective functioning of markets.
The Mifid, which amends the Value Market Act, involves the modernisation of financial markets, while strengthening investor protection, improves the powers of the National Securities Market Commission (NCMV) managers and promotes cooperation between the various European Union leaders.
The new regulation will allow financial consulting services to be provided both for special social reasons and for natural or legal persons and to create a new type of financial services (ESI), financial consulting companies (AFIs), which combine value companies, value agencies and portfolio management companies.
In addition, it increases the number of systems for carrying out financial instruments operations so that it can be added to regulated secondary markets by multilateral trading systems and by international order systems, which are in line with competition from current exchange managers.
The Act also requires investment services companies to disclose on the market information on the key aspects of their business profile, risk exposure and risk management and requires them to keep a record of all operations they perform in order to facilitate the control of the part of the CMMV.
Through the Congress's Economic Commission for Europe, several amendments have been added, including one that points out that the subscribed debt will be considered as a "complex" financial instrument with high risk for the investor, which has been demonstrated by what has happened with the debt of American high-risk mortgages (substantiated).
In addition, they benefited from the transition of the leadership to legalize the functions that graduates in the Economy may have 30 years after they were approved in 1977, the Royal Decree limiting professional functions reserved for economists.
For its part, the Senate has incorporated the creation of new figures in the financial sector, such as that of the mediator, who will work for the account of a company which will not require the authorisation of the CMMV and who will be able to provide its product marketing services and attract new customers to different investment firms at the same time.
The price index for harmonised consumption increases from 5 tenths to up to 4.1 % in November.
This indicator, which is used after Eurostat to incorporate it into the calculation of the inflation rate in the European Union, provides a review of the price developments in Spain during November.
Its publication responds to the policy of Eurostat and the European Central Bank (ECB) by providing comparable data in time and quality to those products in the United States.
The advanced indicator is calculated using the same procedure as the one employed for the Harmonised Price Index, but using various statistical modelling methods to estimate the information on which it is not yet available for the time of publication.
The INE recalled that the information provided by the developed indicator is only indicative, since it should not necessarily coincide with the final data that will be revealed on 14 December.
"IPC will continue at relatively high levels"
The second Vice-President and Economic Minister Pedro Sorbes said that the increase of 4.1% of GDP in November was a "temporary figure", but at the same time he predicted that the price index would continue at "really high" levels in the coming months.
In all cases, Solbes has stated in Congress' colours that "although the number is not good" the difference in Spain's inflation in terms of monetary union continues to be "more or less" than in recent years.
He also explained that in November "there was less surprise" than during the previous month, when the Government did not face such a high increase.
"We expect a figure of 4%," the Minister for Economic Affairs acknowledged in relation to the data announced today.
Virgin planning to recover with Northern Rock 42,000 million euros in three years
The Northern Rock deposits have dropped by more than 50% to EUR 12,000 million (EUR 16,800 million) since the mid-September crisis and had to be used for an emergency loan to the Bank of England.
At the time, it had collected some records of over 25,000 million books, a figure that was gradually falling in two and a half months due to the mistrust of its clients and despite the 100 per cent guarantee of the money offered by the Government and that it would remain until the end of the crisis.
Virgin, who would name the organization with its financial brand Virgin Money, needs to take around one quarter of the British banks' incomes that will be deposited in the next three years to obtain these 18,000 million books until the target of 30,000 million is reached.
The Group of Magnets Richard Branson, known for its advertising campaign in the United Kingdom, intends to spend 50 million books (about EUR 70 million) per year on advertising and marketing to achieve its goal.
Northern Rock named this week Virginia's association offer, where three other companies are involved, including her favorite to save the bank.
The mayor of Totana was arrested for alleged urban corruption
The Civil Guard has today stopped early this morning the current mayor of the Murcian municipality of Totana (the People's Party) because of its alleged relationship with the urban corruption scourge discovered this week.
In addition, one of the secretaries of the municipal council and the chief of police of the municipality was also arrested.
José Martínez Andreo replaced me from May to May Juan Morales, the current lawman, and until then a municipal councillor of the mayor, who, according to the sources of the survey conducted by the SER Channel, could be the 'meiner' of this road.
The officials continue to question the municipal premises and those of the Urbanism Council, and there is no difference between the possibility of new arrests in the coming hours.
In addition, Juan Morales' lawyer, the main suspect of the urban corruption scourge, discovered early this week, was convicted.
As Chanie SER pointed out yesterday at the lawyer of the "popular Party" of Juan Morales, she was arrested from Morales' home with the important documentation in her possession of the tram.
Moreover, according to the sources of the investigation, the subject of the investigation is the alleged failure of Morales commissions to facilitate the signing of an urban agreement with a constructive undertaking in the Galician to requisition 200 hectares of land.
For the moment, there are eight persons detained.
Bono agrees to be the head of the candidate of the Spanish Socialist Party for Tolede and to chair Congress if they win the elections
The former Defence Minister José Bono accepted the offer of the President of the Government and Secretary-General of the Socialists, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, to be the head of the list of the Spanish Socialist Party for Tolede for the next general elections and to be president of the Congress in case the Socialists win the general elections.
The Spanish socialist party's secretary, José Blanco, and Bono also announced it during a press conference following the meeting that took place this afternoon at the federal headquarters of the party with Zapatero.
The Chief Executive has justified the offer made to the former Minister because "it is important to rely on the best" in political life and Bono "is among the best".
Furthermore, he stressed that "yes it seems" that the political man of La Manche will be the candidate of the socialist group that will preside over the Congress if the Socialists win the next elections.
Bono would replace Manuel Marín as President of the Congress, who last made public his decision on 15 November not to present himself to the next general elections and to leave his political career to deal with climate change in the university.
The former Minister acknowledged that the President of the Government has not ceased to insist that he return to the political front since he left it two years ago.
Furthermore, he noted that, although citizens already know who will be the Vice-President of the economy if the Spanish socialist party receives the elections, its party wanted to announce the President of the Congress in a "transparency Act".
If it reaches the post, Bono hopes to transform the House into "a house of respect and not of insult or cry" and "it looks more like citizens".
"Sometimes it seems unfortunately that the only local place in Madrid where we cannot speak quietly and peacefully is Congress, the President of the Government at Senate has been interrupted 26 times."
Similarly, he had words of praise for his current president, Manuel Marín and "I know what to do" and he did not want to do as if he had already taken his position so that he would not fall, as he noted, in what his opponents might consider "a domination".
A Climate Addiction
Given that the movement against climate change is subject to persecution without mercy as well as the scepticities of its predictions as those that give priority to other political and social battles, it must show iron coherence.
It is much more for a leader of the movement who is the President of the Government like Zapatero and who believes that this struggle is more important than Islamist terrorism and who even proposes to sign a "new contract for the planet".
This approach must explain why his Government's action, or action, has contributed to Spain's non-implementation of the Kyoto Protocols.
Those responsible for non-execution, in which sectors it has been produced and why its Government, the one with the agreement with the planet, has not avoided it.
In addition, it must clearly explain to the Spanish what measures it will take to bridge climate change.
What companies will be affected, what habits of citizens will be changed, what individual and collective energy economies will be forced to do, what economic consequences this will cause.
I mean, who'll sacrifice himself and who'll pay for saving the planet.
But there's no explanation and there's no explanation.
Especially because it is to sacrifice and pay.
Measures against climate change, real measures, are unsustainable.
Costable, uncomfortable and threatening for the accounts of companies and individuals.
Until the hundredth of the essence suggested by the Spanish socialist party seemed so dangerous to Zapatero that he was impressed by the snow.
It is to save the planet with nothing, only with propaganda, with live slogans of any real consequence.
With words of impact, commissions, committees, protocols, new posts.
With these contracts with the planet, this gentleman is so useful to the electoral campaigns that he does not speak, who does not complain and who does not demand, impeccate meetings and inspire tension.
This is because it is limited only to a purely virtual contractual part which does not claim that we move on a bicycle or that we freeze with the possibility.
The mayor and chief of the local police of Totana arrested for a alleged state-of-the-art assault
The Spanish Gendarmerie arrested the mayor of the Murcian locality of Totana, the "popular" José Martínez Andreo, the head of the local police, the secretary of the Marie and a suspected hotel contractor for possible urban crimes, have now reported sources of the investigation.
The municipal councillor was arrested at his home and taken to the city hotel, where at the time there were many agents, who were also present to the Urbanism municipal councillor's function and to the municipal management company of the Industrial Sun and Housing.
These three arrests are in addition to the six arrests last Monday in the provinces of Galicia, Murcie and Madrid, in an operation related to the requisition of more than 2 million hectares of agricultural land for urbanization so that the Galician company Nuaria can build 4,000 dwellings after the payment of illegal commissions during the last legislator.
In addition, two other persons have not been arrested, but they are charged with the judicial investigation, which is taught by the Totana Court of First Instance.
The first six prisoners are now brought before a court.
According to sources, the former municipal councillor of Totana and current independent parliamentarian of the PP party, Juan Morales, is targeted by the investigation.
In addition, the ex-wife, owner of an real estate agency currently registered in Totana, was taxed as well as the current co-financed by the former municipal councillor, who lives in Murcie.
The director and owner of the Nuaria Group, the lawyer and entrepreneur of Vigo (Galice) Manuel N.A., were arrested in Nigrán (Pontevena), as well as Pablo José M.G., director of Suelo de Imonauur, agency of the Nuaria Group, and through which the wine powers would have been realized.
The investigation is under the charge of the Urban Delict Group of the Central Operational Unit (UCO) of the gendarmerie, whose agents, in addition to arrests, carried out 11 inspections, the majority of companies related to detainees and located in Madrid, Vigo, Murcie, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (Madrid) and Totana.
Thus, only one person was arrested in Totana, in sum, the owner of a well-known airline company in the region, who might have played the role of intermediaries.
The Nuaria Group was responsible for the development of the largest residential complex in the Murcian municipality of Totana, which would involve the construction of over 5,000 dwellings, a golf course and two hotels with "spa".
The company has acquired 2.2 million square metres of land that have been requisitioned and its project is expected to double the population of the municipality, which currently accounts for 25,000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria Group is made up of companies such as Autesa and Inomonauur, which are engaged in real estate promotion; Conycase, which manages Vigo's parkings in Corunña, Venezuela and Fernando el Católico's place; Hogartel, which deals with direct marketing; Preconiza, which focuses on the promotion, sale and installation of construction elements.
Things That Happen
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
If they want it well, we're going to let the Book of Moses rest, see if during this time it's in the mind of other ideas.
I'm already thinking about something.
Life is changing.
Of course, you are invited to offer inventions.
Two.
Our Finnish correspondent gives us the comment made yesterday in Finland's most important journal (certainly PISA information head above the educational level in the world), the Helsinki Sanomat, which refers to what they published on November 18, the same day when it appeared there, curiously, the criticism of the book of Blackburn:
"The content of the philosophy course reached public opinion as a result of the tragedy of the school of Jokela.
The doubling of the dead, a Baccalauréat student, quoted in his messages the works of Plato and Nietzsche.
The Philosophy Education Advisor, Pekka Elo, asked the professors to adopt a critical attitude towards Plato on what is written in the pages of the Helsinki Sanomat newspaper and said that studying Nietzsche is not necessary in the compulsory basic course of philosophy in colleges."

A colleague provides information on the introduction to the Criminal Code of Crimes on Internet Downloads:
A. Downloading a song would be a crime of a penalty of six months a year.
On the other hand, the flight in a CD Store for a value of less than EUR 400 is considered to be only a mistake (Article 623.1).
B. The flight into a warehouse for a value of up to EUR 1,000 is already considered a crime, but the penalty is lower than the charge (Article 234 of the Penal Code).
C. If you steal a car and make it 40 hours later, the penalty is lower than the charge (Article 244.1).
D. It is less important to participate in a baggage than to participate in the traffic of compact discs.
Participation in a torturer involves a penalty of three months a year (Article 154 of the Penal Code) and traffic of CDs would involve a penalty of six months two years
(Article 270 of the Criminal Code).
E. Sexual harassment at work is considered less serious than downloading a film under article 184.2 of the Criminal Code.
F. The distribution of films protected by copyright and without copyright is more punishable than the distribution of pornography to minors (art. 186).
To end up, if my colleague is in real trouble then someone's exaggerating.
4. (a) What does the Bible teach us?
My doctor spoke to me about one of his articles on foreign research: ' Money produces brain assets, especially if others receive less '.
In other words, the feelings that generate the monthly pay of workers depend on what the colleagues get.
The study was carried out through tomographic magnetic resonances at the University of Bonn, and the results were published in the last issue of Science.
According to Bernd Weber, the study author and director of the neurocognition group of Life &Brain Institute, in Germany: "The strongest activation occurred when the participant responded correctly and his partner failed."
Researchers noted that when the two persons were due to receive the same payment, the activation was moderate, but if one of them received the double, the activation was larger.
I don't know if this conclusion would require so much science.
The Prosecutor of the Balkans
Carla del Ponte has been pursuing for eight years relentlessly the war crimes of the Balkans since the Public Ministry of the Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, which is located in The Hague.
His mandate ends at the end of the year, and Carla will enjoy it, because the main officials of Srebrenica's murder - in which 8,000 Bosnian Muslims are dead - former General Ratko Mladic and former Serbian leader Radovan Karadzic are still free.
Their names are in this list, which the Swiss realiser Marcel Schüpbach takes his title, " Carla ' (2006, not designed exclusively in Spain), with the rhythm of a police kidnapper, who follows the work of the Swiss prosecutor in New York who pursues fugitive criminals and pressures on the governments involved to slow down the circle.
What kind of insurance do I deserve?
Car insurance, which covers the driver's face to the left, involves an important expenditure that will depend on various factors, such as age, sex, age of driving permit, civil status, type of vehicle to be supplied or used, among others.
Having a car is the main thing.
And that, choosing the right car insurance is even more difficult than choosing the vehicle model.
And it is even harder to choose the vehicle model than to choose the appropriate car insurance.
Car insurance is an agreement between an insurance company and the insurance company.
This commitment is based on an insurance contract, which provides that the company receives the value of the first granted and in exchange becomes responsible for the obligation to pay the compensation in case of left.
The premium is the price of insurance, which is determined by various factors such as age, sex, age of driving permit, civil status, type of vehicle to be ensured or used, among others.
Insurance companies set up their prices on the basis of statistics so that the higher the probability of an accident is high, the higher the rate of payment is high.
That is why people over 25 years of age and women must pay lower premiums, as statistics show that these people have a lower left-wing rate than they are aware of.
In the same way, by using censuses, companies have concluded that married people tend to have fewer accidents than single drivers.
The use of the vehicle will affect the frequency, and therefore the likelihood of an accident.
As the frequency increases, the probability increases.
These are many variables that insurance agents take into account when establishing the price of the premium.
This is why the driver must take a good look at the situation in order to choose the car insurance that is best suited to his profile.
We will present here the most significant variables when choosing one or more insurance types, so that, in addition to adapting to the insurance characteristics, it offers a reasonable price.
Young people under the age of 25 must face various disadvantages when entering into an insurance contract at an affordable price, such as low driving experience and early driving permits.
Although the ideal for being well-insured is a risk insurance, there are other more economic options.
The most predictable drivers can choose for insurance any risk with franchise so that they get the cover of insurance at any risk but at a more affordable price.
This form of convention implies that the customer pays part of the amount of the left.
"The portion of the amount on the left that the client pays will be determined according to the value of the premium, which will be higher than the amount will be lower," said Luis Noguera, the first European official in Spain, online insurance mediator.
Another option is third-large insurance so that the customer ensures protection against damage caused to third-party parties, but by those caused by their own car.
In addition, it would be covered against the flight, fires and vehicle loss.
A council.
If you are less than 25 years of age, try to be cautious and avoid left-wings as far as possible, as this will affect the benefit, which may reduce the price of insurance in the future.
A grant is a reduction in the base rate owned by the company.
On the contrary, a penalty is an increase in the basic rate.
"The benefits and penalties will depend on the company and its profit.
If the company had a good year, it could allow itself to increase the benefits ", Noguera made it clear.
For more than 25 years this has become easier for drivers when they enter into an insurance contract, as the left-wing rate is reduced by the accumulated experience.
That is why it is preferable to choose insurance with franchise.
" Young people are normally unable to take advantage of the experience they have acquired after an accident," says the director of the European company in Spain and adds that most of the accidents occur during the second year of driving, once the fear of the news has passed. "
However, if the client is married but has not yet had children, it is preferable that he negotiate any risk insurance, as long as his economic situation allows him.
Marriages with children are considered by the insurance companies as being people with the lowest left rate, as the majority will be weaker.
In this case, the best insurance would be insurance at any risk with franchise (may be EUR 300), or third-large insurance from the third year of life of the vehicle when the insurance has a high level of benefit.
"They have a more detachable conduct and have a greater purchasing power to allow luxury to take on more important amounts of franchises," thinks Luis Noguera.
For retirement insurance at any risk with franchise, it is preferable (which is EUR 150), or a third-large insurance where the insured person has a high level of benefit.
It must be said that car insurance is something important, not only because it covers the driver's face to the left, but also because it represents an important expenditure, that is why it is essential to study the insurance that suits us most according to our personal situation.
Celtic will seek to win a point in Milan to reach the eighth end
Milan AC and Celtic Glasgow were gathered next Tuesday in San Siro to find out what they are missing to achieve their respective objectives in the closure of the Champions League, as it serves Italians to be the first and Ecossais to classify themselves.
The Italians have completed ten points and have already qualified for the fifth day through a zero match in Portugal, while Celtic Glasgow has nine points, but it still needs another point to make sure that Shakhtar Donetsk, who has six, and who receives Benfia who has four, does not pass it on.
These two matches of Group D will take place a week before the end of the sixth day, as Milan AC has to discuss the semi-finals of the World Club Cup in Japan on the 13th of this month in search of a place for the end of December 16.
Thus, this group will remain closed before the zero match at the Josephe Meazza stadium seems to be the most expected result, although the two teams will try to win because the Italians will not want to specialize in them and Celtic Glasgow knows that if they win, it will be the first and will ensure a better crossing in the eight finals.
A lack of Gordon Strachan's team could be sufficient to classify if the Shakhtar Donetsk does not get it, but it will not be able to computer it only because with nine points the game returns to Ukrainians, who lost last week in Glasgow (2-1), but who won (2-0) in the other direct duel.
Thus, the Milanese will try to impose the evening on the Scottish, who hope to classify themselves for the eighth finals for the second time at the League Championships, after having been beaten during the last edition by a Kaka goal during the extensions (1-0).
While waiting for the victory of the 'rosoniers' the triumph would only return to Shakhtar, where Celtic would lose, to classify for the eight finals in order to continue the union of the EAFRD champions.
And it is that Benfia, although it is the last and no longer possible to pursue European competition, could reach the third place with a victory.
20,000 people attend the first concert in Vancouver of the Spice Girls tournament
The Spice Girls began in Vancouver, Canada, with some 20,000 spectators, their first round since the group disappeared in 2000.
' Posh Spice ' (Victoria Beckham), 'Scary Spice ' (Melanie Brown), ' Baby Spice ' (Emma Bunton), ' Sport Spice ' (Melanie Chisholm) and ' Ginger Spice ' (Geri Hallwell) soon announced that the group's meeting was "bright".
About 20,000 people have posted the tickets to attend the concert, which was the subject of a video in which the story of the group has become angry by the end of 1990.
The World Meeting and Tour coincides with the launch of a new album that repeats their main achievements as well as two new songs, Headlines and Voodoo, published by the EMI in Spain.
The five members of the Spice Girls are mounted on stage by showing the bracelets that the husbands of 'Posh Spice' had offered them, British footballer David Beckham.
The sport was in the public that filled the GM Place, even though Victoria had banned it a few days earlier.
Before the show started, Victoria Beckham noted that the British footballer "did not see our costumes so I'm nervous because I don't know what he'll think of the show".
' Sporty Spice ', who was part of the group in 1998, "because of differences between us" and who caused the group to be dissolved two years later, also expressed its nervousness during a press interview, two hours before the start of the show.
"I was scared.
I was nervous, but I saw that people's feelings changed, the feeling for Spice Girls changed.
And I didn't think why, I'm glad to have made a decision" Chisholm said at the group meeting that she disappeared nine years ago.
The singer also noted that in time, "the things are arranged and we appreciate them very much."
But many things have changed since the Spice Girl was shown for the last time in 1998.
To begin with, according to CTV television, the group arrived in Vancouver on a special plane from Virgin Airlines.
When they arrived at the airport, a baby army was waiting for them.
They count her five sons.
After the Vancouver concert, the group will be held in California (USA), San José (December 4th) and Los Angeles (December 5th and 7th).
They will be held in Madrid on 23 December.
The new case of gas between Russia and Ukraine triggers the alarm.
A debate on the price of greenhouse gas between Ukraine and Russia, thus increasing the risk of impacts on fuel exports to Europe.
Most Russian gas exports to the European Union (EU) are driven by pipelines and each pipeline is strictly monitored.
Kiev announced that if Russia increases the cost of fuel, it will increase transit taxes to Russia.
Last year, a change between the two had resulted in a reduction in supplies to the U.S. countries.
The last debate between Kiev and Moscow took place after the Ukrainian Government and Gazprom, Russia's gas monopolies company, tried to find an agreement on the cost of Russian gas provided in Ukraine for 2008.
Gazprom stated that it would increase its prices in Ukraine as it agreed to pay for 2008, up to 50% more for the supply of gas from neighboring Turkmenistan.
The analysts stated that this would result in an increase of 40 per cent of the imports from Gazprom.
"It is essential for us to use all our arguments during the talks, remembering that we are a country through which most of the gas passes," announced Ukrainian Economy Minister Anatoly Kinkh to the Reuters press agency.
"The flow of gas costs would undoubtedly be related to our discussions on transit taxes (to Western Europe) through Ukraine"
The last major change between Moscow and Kiev occurred in January 2006, the interruption of the supply of Gazprom for Ukraine.
This has led to the fall in exports to Western Europe, resulting in price increases.
Russian gas represents a quarter of the European Union's supplies.
Russia has the largest gas stocks, although most of them are still under development.
As a result, Gazprom completes its own supply with gas from Turkmenistan and other nations of the former Soviet Union in Central Asia.
The Ministry of Health must control its foreign employees.
The Ministry of Health must improve controls on its extra-Community employees to check if they have criminal precedents, said the Control Committee.
The general auditor's warning, Robert Black, came after a foreign doctor working in Scotland, was involved in the attack at Glasgow airport in June.
In addition, Mr. Black expressed his concern about the fact that the Ministry of Health had no specific data on the number of seafarers he was employed.
The report also highlights other decisive controls, which are properly conducted on a sample of employees of five health authorities.
The General Auditor-General conducted checks on extra-Community personnel following the attack on Glasgow airport.
Bilal Abdullah, 28 years old, an Iraqi original doctor at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was arrested at the airport after working with his pocket in the main terminal doors.
He was part of the three doctors who were filmed in Old Bailey in October, suspected of being involved in various car explosion attempts in the United Kingdom.
The Ministry of Health will have to carry out pre-employment checks on seafarers in order to be certain of the validity of their qualifications, experiences and working permits for the United Kingdom.
Although the Ministry of Ecosaese Health uses the Ecosaise Disclosure to carry out previous criminal controls, the Agency has no right to access such information outside Great Britain.
Among the many warnings, the General Auditor-General's report now states that the committees are now obliged to deal with the Office of Criminal Pre-Trial Control, thus allowing employers to conduct checks in several countries.
"Although we have found that some information about staff has been well verified, this is not always done." The report announces.
Mr. Black said that the Ministry of Ecosan Health had carried out most of the pre-employment checks that he himself would do, but he also added: "Our report highlights aspects where the system could be improved to ensure that adequate information on certain overseas staff is available to health services.
Mr. Peter Terry, President of BMA Scotland, said that it was "very unlikely" that pre-employment controls could identify employees who could commit future terrorist acts.
He stated that "the report suggests that pre-employment controls are currently being carried out, work well in the ecosystem health system and that it is not certain that these warnings can bring some added value."
The health authorities declared that 1161 seafarers were employed by most doctors and nurses.
However, the General Auditor-General stressed that these figures must certainly be re-examined, partly because of problems with the identification of staff with long-term contracts who could or could not choose to remain in our country.
The investigation showed that the current procedures for controls by health authorities in Ayrshire and Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire and Lotian are in fact appropriate.
These checks are carried out on passports, working permits and qualifications.
The Government of Scotland is currently reviewing its policy and pre-employment control system for members of other ocean health services.
The Secretary for Health Nicola Sturgeon said: "I was eager to carry out this work following the terrorist attack at Glasgow airport."
She added that the Government of Scotland, which is associated with the health committees, would carefully consider the warnings contained in the report that should be published next month, and would undertake to ensure better implementation of recent, and effective pre-employment controls for all employees, including other seafarers.

The climate of Venus could reveal the future of the Earth.
The scientists said yesterday that Venus was certainly a pleasing planet to live.
The data from the European orbital vessel have shown that the planet is probably twice as small as the Earth, contrary to what was previously thought.
Venus is the closest planet to Earth.
These two worlds are practically the same size, with similar orbits, although Venus is closer to the Sun.
Scientists now believe that thousands of years ago, Venus could have had conditions similar to those of the Earth, and it could even have been inhabited.
But the effect of carbon dioxide closes, the atmospheric erosion of solar radiation associated with a slower rotation led Venus to any other kind of evolution.
Today the planet is deprived of water, is flooded by hurricanes and lightning storms, and has a hot enough temperature to melt the bomb.
The findings of Venus Express, the European Space Agency's survey, which studied the planet for a year, offer a sad vision of the Earth's potential future due to catastrophic climate change.
The professor of physics at Oxford University, Fred Taylor, one of the leaders of the Venus Express mission, said: "We begin to understand why Venus's climate is so different from that of the Earth, although the planets in it are practically similar.
"Our new data allows us to establish a scenario where there are billions of years ago, Venus would have been originally identical to the Earth, perhaps even with a living area."
From the rich uranium secreted by the police.
A kilogram of radioactive material, apparently uranium, was stolen by the Czech and Hungarian police yesterday.
A police officer reported that three persons were arrested and that the material is currently analysed.
He did not confirm that it is good uranium, but revealed that the commodity would have a value of $1 million (£480.000).
Open to All
Mitt Romney said not to be high as a candidate to the presidency to answer the questions of a snowman.
Nevertheless, the Republican candidates in the Presidency finally agreed to participate in the debate on You Tube, during which many ordinary voters have recorded their questions, submit them to the candidates.
Wednesday evening, 28 November, none of the issues raised were as ridiculous as it was from another You Tube debate when a snowman asked Democrats for their position on the warming of the planet.
This time, however, questions and answers reflected a great deal on the conditions of the Republican party, candidate for the next elections.
We do not know what criteria, CNN producers, who sponsored the debate, chose You Tube clips to show the candidates.
But the first half hour of the debate, the longest on one subject, focused on immigration.
The subject is one of the strongest subjects for the Republicans.
CNN asked some electors to call when they heard of interesting things: The region noticed approval hearings when the candidates expressed themselves in a large way.
The toughest and longest exchange of evenings was between Rudy Giuliani, leader of the national front, and Mr. Romney, who is head of important pre-elections from Iowa and New Hampshire.
Mr. Giuliani tried to relieve himself of the fact that he was accommodated in the case of clandestine immigration during his mayorial mandate in New York.
He attacked Mr. Romney, accusing the former Governor of Massachusetts, to employ clandestine immigrants at his home.
The two combatants became particularly proud when they were asked whether they would be willing to promote an amnesia ( offering the clandestine a regular status and the possibility of becoming citizens).
Minor candidates like Duncan Hunter, a California congressman, and Tom Tancredo, a Colorado congressman, have succeeded in deepening this subject.
None of them have the opportunity to be elected, but both remain in the race, may be due to the fact that they have begun to fight immigration before and in a more aggressive way than others.
In general, candidates, at least with regard to immigration, have the same opinions: more rigid boundaries and zero tolerance for clandestine immigrants.
This issue, coupled with the concerns raised in particular by the issue of toxic games manufactured in China, or by other fears in the outside world, encourages the Republicans to forget, or to minimize divisions between liberals and Catholic conservatives.
But the debate became particularly embarrassing when other issues were raised.
Mr. Giuliani asked why he had previously supported the arms control campaign.
John McCain and Mr Romney discussed whether to put water into the nose should be considered a torture.
One of the speakers asked whether the candidates believed in the Bible as a whole.
This led Mr. Giuliani to say that the Bible is his favorite book, even though it is not about to believe in the history of Jonas and the whale.
Another participant asked whether Jesus would have been in favour of the death penalty.
We were not expected to see Mike Huckabee, - in his position in Iowa at a recent election, thanks to his long-term Christian preservationism - to declare that the death penalty is painful and necessary.
When we insisted on knowing whether Jesus would have been in favor, he smiled and declared that Jesus was too late to present himself to the elections.
The human race remains inextricably open to everything.
Mr. Huckabee's re-mount in Iowa coincides with recent prognosis of subsidies by liberator Ron Paul, and complaints during Wednesday's debate.
The two are born there, because the two parties are not able to agree on who is the most famous and traditional candidate.
In 1980 and 2000, a candidate unifies the part of good time and convincingly thanks to a successful message on the Americas that approached the leaders.
This time, the party is divided and the result is far from clear.
The Pains of the Workers
Gordon Brown discovered a new hole in which to sleep; even if he was disappointed, the situation wouldn't change.
Given the tendency of British scandals, this is not particularly Jewish.
No decorations sold, no hotel invoices paid by politicians, no extra conjugal footing.
But that's what a revelation shows that a rich man of business would have masked for four years, under false names, his contributions to the current Labourist Party, equivalent to more than £650,000 ($1.3m), which the party would not have declared: A new battle which Gordon Brown would have been successful.
Two months ago, the Prime Minister took a step back in his election project, deliberately insulting British intelligence saying that the polls did not influence his decision, and that he hoped to offer a compact and effective government.
On the contrary, such Vince Cable, the brilliant democratic liberal leader, said that the Terrible Mr. Brown had turned from Stalin into Mr. Bean.
Northern Rock's kidnapping, a hard bank on crack, has shown a lack of guidelines and medical judgement in case of emergency.
Inadequate proposals to change the tax code have led to a coalition of industrial groups against the government.
The loss of 25 million personal data by the tax authorities has revealed an incredible administrative framework.
A three-year-old retired has launched a revolution among the Lords, protesting the reduction of military expenditure: they have declared that being a defence minister is a part-time job for them.
At the present time, the suspicion of foolish donations by David Abrahams; Peter Watt, Secretary-General of the Workers (and his former head of the guard) made them feel obliged to resign.
None of this means that Mr. Brown is on his way out.
However, governments can reach a point where it would be impossible to rule.
People don't like politicians, they don't trust them, but they usually leave their doubts aside when a new government comes to power.
It seems clear that a prime minister can no longer improve matters, nor can he even rule for a long time, when he is at risk of suspension: public administration no longer works; ministers' cabinets are balanced; the press is looking for bad stories; and the government is becoming defensive and without any purpose.
In a sense, Mr Brown's position is particularly difficult because, unlike other political leaders, he cannot be a starter.
Although he would like to review Tony Blair, he was still his senior lieutenant.
The problems related to Northern Rock and tax data, for example, are related to Mr. Brown's decisions when he was Chancellor of British Property.
And even if it is not directly involved in Blair's injuries, such a long investigation into the funds of the party's "money accounting for the members of the House of Lords", voters might think otherwise.
But the difficult situation Mr Brown's short is not so tragic that she's in the air.
The gaffes aren't such monsters as the members of the Tories party believe it.
As in Mr. Bean, there's no victim or scratch.
And the remedy, although painful, could always be to concrete Mr Brown's Stalinian trends in favour of a reliable and slightly brutal government.
The new scandal on political donations is a good example.
Mr. Abrahams, a very special person, who compared his gifts to charity, said that he did not want any public recognition of his welfare.
He may have his opinion, but that's not his decision.
The laws against the anonymity of major policy contributors are clear, and they exist for a good reason: The public has the right to know who contributes to the success of those who will rule the country.
Mr. Watt, who announced that Mr. Abrahams' programmes had been under way without knowing that this was illegal, would therefore have to be questioned, as well as John Mendlesohn, the head of the grant collections that had discussed suspicious donations in October.
But so far, Mr Brown has not been involved: There is no reason to believe that he was in the process of these developments, even though most of the payments made were made following his arrival with the government in June.
So far, the prime minister has done half of it.
He quickly condemned his party's legislative failure, but he did not draw attention to the fact that the decision-making authority is on a course he well knows, to appeal to a committee of inquiry on this subject composed of a widow to the pension and a judge.
In this case, learning lessons are not complicated.
And if the law has been broken, it's the source of the police.
In addition, there are many other things Mr Brown has to do, such as finding a permanent chairman for the Independent Committee on Public Standards, without a leader for six months, and preparing a good reform on the financing of political parties.
This would force the Labourist party, in a moment of weakness, to cooperate with the Tories, which could lead him to cancel his particular financial relationship with the confederations; in short, an American pill for such a party such as Mr Brown.
But he should face some side effects.
The Conservative Party now has a good advantage for the elections; it has two years to reconnaissance voters, and the only way to achieve a victory is to demonstrate an irrevocable integrity and solid skills.
Scrooge of cards.
Would the crisis of mortgages pollute the American credit card market?
When there's blood in the water, it's normal to see excited nags, touring around.
Now that the US real estate market is going through a critical phase, the lenders are looking at the US credit card market.
Goldman Sachs analysts believe that losses related to credit cards could amount to $99 billion if the infection is related to other forms of credit to the consumer.
The signs of tension are clearly visible.
There are increases in the cost and insolvency rates, which measure the non-recoverable balance parts or which are more than 30 days later.
HSBC announced last month that it had taken $1.4 billion in its credit to the consumer, partly due to the shortage of card holders.
It's just too fast to panic.
Costs and insolvency are still moderate.
According to Moody, a tax agency, the rate of insolvency of 3.89% of the third quarter is less than one point in relation to its historical average.
The deterioration of rates is partly explained by technical factors.
A change of laws in 2005 to the United States with regard to personal bankroll caused a sudden fall in banknote archives, which, in turn, caused losses to credit cards; the number of archives (and thus insolvency rates) could increase even if loan conditions were to be used.
In addition to fixed payment rates, the industry announces that consumers have to adjust the monthly amount of income.
and confidence in the security of the capital of credit cards is strong enough despite the parallelisation of other aspects of structured finance.
Dennis Moroney of TowerGroup, a research company, predicted that the emission volume for 2007 would be 25% higher than last year.
The direct links of infection between the mortgage crisis and the credit card market are certain: consumers could prefer to increase their savings now that equity real estate loans have disappeared.
But card issuers pay more attention to the flow of species than to the value of the heritage, so the loss of real estate prices did not necessarily result in a change in the credibility of the buyers.
They could even bring benefits to credit securities issuers.
Consumers' mortgage payments premiums fall if properties cost less than the value of the loan; therefore credit card settlement would become a priority to repay everything.
Card issuers are able to respond much faster than mortgagers and with greater flexibility to such crisis conditions, as they can change interest rates or change credit limits.
This should in theory reduce the risk of rapid recovery of actions.
"We are not going to wake up tomorrow and reassess all the loans." said Gary Perlin, director of Capital One.
If a financial disaster in the credit card market is unlikely, there is a strong risk of falling.
If the lower prices of real estate and a contract in the credit market give America a boost to the recession, the industry will certainly have to face a bad future.
Take a good look at the dorsal nags..
The British bankers complain guilty of the Enron case.
The three British bankers who were to witness their roles in relation to a fraud committed by former financial director of Enron, Andrew Fastow, have changed their statement, complaining about Wednesday.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew were first innocent of seven alleged fraud charges in 2000, committed by Fastow in a secret financial fraud in order to increase the pressure of their employees.
They should be presented to the court in January.
But during a hearing presided by the U.S. judge Ewing Werlein Jr, they all declared guilty of committing a fraud.
The three former Greenwich NatWest frameworks, a PLC group branch of the Royal Bank of Scotland, have become popular in Britain for two years because of extradition procedures.
In the United States, their case remains a matter of suspension for this investigation following the fall of Enron in 2001.
The charges against them in 2002 made Fastow understand that he was the subject of the Government's investigation at the Enron Valley.
The charges against the bankers, called "Three of Natwest", were declared to have come to Houston in 2000, to organize a false scenario with Fastow and his ex-right arm, Michael Kopper.
NatWest Greenwich invested in a company of Enron's partner controlled by Fastow, who was the organizer of many fraudulent scenarios, which helped him call the banking procedures.
At the beginning of 2002, the Bank had estimated its interest in the branch as nothing, but the three British already knew its value.
A company controlled by Kopper bought the bank's interest for £1 million.
Bankers paid $250,000 to Kopper as an interest in this company.
According to the charge, Fastow would have falsely announced to Enron that the energy company was willing to pay $20 million to Greenwich NatWest for its operations in the branch.
But in fact these $20 million are gone into the pockets of British bankers, Fastow and others.
According to the charges, bankers would have received $7.3 while Fastow, Kopper and others would have earned $12.3 million.
In January 2004, Fastow appealed for his active role in two conspiracys in the Battle of Enron.
The British trio was arrested three months later.
Fastow was sentenced to six years in a federal prison in Louisiana.
Kopper is imprisoned for 3 years and one month in a prison in Texarkana.
The three British were released after payment of $1 million each, which obliges them to live in the United States during the process.
Enron, before the seventh largest national company, in the bank in December 2001 after years of accounting calls, could no longer hide its billions of receipts or even offer its bids as profitable.
The collapse has resulted in thousands of licensing, more than $60 billion in market value loss and more than $2 billion in losses for retirement plans.
Enron's founder, Kenneth Lay and former President Jeffrey Skilling were convicted last year for their involvement in the collapse of society.
Skilling was sentenced to more than 24 years in prison.
The charges against the Law for conspiracy, fraud and other crimes have been dropped because of its death due to a heart crisis last year.
You're not alone, you're not out of Moscow.
The cost of a G550 Golfstream aircraft, equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine and with enough fuel autonomy to fly without a Moscow scale in Los Angeles, part of $54 million.
But that's just a little change for some Russians.
"He can transport up to 18 passengers," said Dan Firer, a representative of Gulfstream.
"Even if a person does not really need so much seats that it is more than a family use plane or the president of a company."
Mr. Firer was present at the stand of Gulfstream, last Friday, in the Millionaires Hall, a consumer-incentive organ for four days, held in a huge exhibition centre around the capital.
In addition, more than 200 other exhibitors were present with their positions, hoping to stimulate the interest of new Russians in their various products, traveling from yachts to diamond-filled cars such as those of 50 cent.
Mr. Firer examined a brilliant orange Porsche, exposed to his stand.
"it's a nice car, but nothing comparable to our product," he said.
"After the United States, Russia is the second largest private aircraft market."
"With a oil boom, the Russian capital seems to roll into the black gold, Tel Dallas"
"We have lived the same way in the 1890s when some Americans became so rich and they were landed in Europe where they would be considered materialists," said Marshall Goldman, senior student of the Department of Russian and Eurasian Studies at Harvard University."
Like the Saudis in the 1970s, the Japanese in the 1990s, the Russians are emerging as the world's largest expenditures.
The largest luxury brands are looking for their place in the Klondike.
This week, in another place in Moscow, a conference on the luxury industry enabled Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, president of LVMH, to exchange their ideas on the strategy to be followed for the sale of luxury goods to markets such as Russia.
(The conference was organized by the International Herald Tribunal, which belongs to The New York Times.)
Russia has 53 billion dollars worth of $282 billion, according to the Forbes List listing the richest people.
In addition, two thirds of the wealth is made up of 103 billion Russians who are globally worth $670 billion, according to a study on the evolution of personal wealth in the former Soviet Union by economists of the Economic and Financial Research Centre.
(The World Bank stated that in 2005, 15.8 per cent of Russians lived under the poverty line).
"There are hundreds of millions of people in Moscow, that is why we are all here," said Nicole Marais, a representative of David Morris, a London bijottier.
She participated in the hall for the first time in the company of the Russian distributor Le Bijoutier de Soho.
“ Women are all well prepared and men are getting lucky. ”
On Monday evening, the two real estate agents placed on their 31, Evgenia Yumatova, 21, and Svetlana Turovtsova, 26 declared to be their clients, millions.
"I looked at cars and tried to choose between Infinit, Mercedes and Porsche," said Melle Yumatova, who was wearing her high suit such as a red carpet veteran like Joan Rivers.
The hall seems to focus on the new rich, the kind of Russian brand buyers willing to make the hole in their pockets to come up to a huge store where Cadillac Escalades, platinum canyons, Möwenpick glasses, personalized billiard tables, Dubai apartments and Gund furs.
The public could buy tickets for 30 euros ($44.57).
"The Russians are interested in defining the most expensive brands and the best brands," said Mr. Gijrath, putting himself in the Royal factory factory of Dutch porcelain Delf, in front of a wall table of Raimbrant on blue wheels.
"it is certain that the Russians are more interested in bling bling"
In fact, the sellers have stated here that Russians with old capitals (10-15 years old are too old according to Russian standards) have already passed out logos to a limited edition mark that could not be sold in the hall.
Despite this, thousands of people, millions of people, millions of tourists or tourists, pay for the exhibition every day.
And some buy themselves.
During the first night of the exhibition, last Thursday, Roman Ershow, the PDG of King Koil's Beds, said he had sold two sets of gold coins, cassemery, and gold coins.
During the first night, Mikhail Lyubiumov, director of A1 motorcycle sales, a company that runs cars with last cry alarm systems, also announced that he had sold to a Russian millionaire, the orange orange Porsche shining, for $170,000.
This afternoon, Andrei Karapetian, president of L.A. Connection, a company that personalizes luxury cars, said he would sell three cars similar to Braille for Rolls-Royce Phantoms, at $55,000 each.
He showed a reporter, the wheel of a car designed for the owner of a Russian casino, who wanted it to be decorated with Swarovski crystals so that it looked like a wheelchair wheel.
The seven of four costs $22,000.
"The Russian millionaire who wants roads made of leather, or a photo of his wife made of cubic zirconium, will not drive strongly with such tires," said Mr. Karapetian.
He will definitely keep it in his garage with 30 or 40 vehicles already in it »
Although many of his Russian customers are rich, Mr. Karapetian said that the term "Russian millionaire" is not in the order of the day, given the increase in the prices of the real estate here.
"If you had bought an apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, you would already be a millionaire, at least on paper, if not in kind," he said.
"there is more than you can think"
Those who are not millions can at least feel this emotion when they go to the state of the Continental Alliance, a Russian heritage management company.
The company has raised four stations representing the British telephone booths, full of face-to-face dollars.
Azad Karryev, the company's marketing director, said his team had printed 500,000 fake tickets for the Millennium Hall.
Surprisingly arrested to launch large billboards, they ask their friends of photographers on their cell phone, in the middle of this fake wealth or well pummeling a few million.
“You see, here in Moscow, the world can feel a millionaire,” said Mr. Karyev.
Unsatisfied homicide surgeon in New Jersey
It was thanksgiving's watch when Ronald Livingston watched through the winning bathroom of the restaurant Just a little Healthier and noticed an ambulance that had to stop at the gates of the White Cape Cod on the West Scott Avenue.
Then the police patrol arrives.
and then another.
"Then I saw the medical vehicle stop" Mr. Livingston, a restaurant manager, said Wednesday.
That's where I realized someone was dead.
The authorities would then learn that the deceased was a 41-year-old woman, Olga Arroyo, assistant director of the Newark Police Department.
Now the investigators are trying to determine whether the cause of his death is due to an act performed by an unaccompanied cosmetic surgeon who has not yet identified the police, resident at 212 West Scott Avenue.
The authorities have not yet determined the causes of Melle Arroyo's death, but they are confident that the results of the toxicological tests will take time, but that should help solve this mysterious death that has attracted the high levels of Newark police.
Melle Arroyo was the assistant to the police director, Gary F. McCarthy, since September 2006, and his voice was well known in several departments.
She was loyal, great worker and talented," McCarthy said about Melle Arroyo in a telephone interview, Wednesday. "
"she was like a pit bull"
"She would have done anything to protect me"
Mr. McCarthy stated that Melle Arroyo was married to Jimmy Arroyo, an ex-police officer of Newark who worked for the Alcohol Control Commission, and that she left two children 14 and 11 years old, as well as a beautiful daughter.
Eileen Walsj, spokesman for the Union County Park, Theodore J. Romankow, said the detectives were trying to determine whether Melle Arroyo was killed due to an unauthorized surgical operation.
"It is an opportunity to consider."
"The investigation continues."
The authorities declared that they had arrived at her house at 15 p.m.
and have found Melle arroyo on the sofa.
She was declared dead.
A little more than a week has passed since, and the authorities have not said much about the investigation or even about the owner of the house identified as Flor Margarita Castro.
Melle Walsh couldn't confirm whether Melle Castro was questioned by the authorities.
Researchers are trying to understand whether a part of the house was used as a medical cabinet.
Mercredi, no one opened the door of Melle Castro's house where a fanned rose stands in the closet front, and a Dalmatian left behind.
A blue bead called "Ethyl Vanillin" used as a substitute for kitchen ovens and perfumes, was lying in a hangar, next to a door leading to the ground.
Two cars all over the area hung on the sides.
McCarthy stated that since he arrived in Newark 25 years ago, at the New York Police Department, Melle Arroyo has been very valuable, helping him to sail into the new city and abandon his established political culture.
"she said "you must pay attention to this," he said.
"She was there when I arrived, and still when I shared.
“ It Was Enraging ”
It is the hope that the Federal Reserve will reduce the rates associated with the global exchange rate.
The actions are exploded from the two sides of the Atlantic yesterday, after the market hoped that the Federal Reserve would have tried to ease the terms of the credit, thereby reducing the rates of interest promoted by the suspicious statements of the Vice-President of the Central Bank of the United States.
Boursier markets operate in London, New York and throughout Europe after Donald Kohn, No. 2 after Ben Bernanke, President of the Federal Reserve, stated that those who decide must be "flexible and pragmatic" in their actions in the financial markets.
In a clear effort to reassure the irritable markets in view of these new credit-related tensions, Mr. Kohn stated that the recent turmoil has partly "inverted some improvements in the functioning of the market in late September and October.
In the event that this heavy turbulence was to continue, this would increase the likelihood of further rigidity of the financial conditions for owners and businesses, he said.
These comments appear to investors as a clear signal that the Federal Reserve is ready to inject new capital into US markets and that further decreases in interest rates could stabilize credit conditions.
These notes also allowed to calm down Wall Street with even more bad news on the American economy, such as the largest drop in real estate sales for October.
The impact of this financial turmoil was further accentuated by the Bear Stearns, an investment bank, which announced that it would license 650 persons, i.e. 4% of its staff, to reduce costs to compensate for the losses incurred by the lost pairs of real estate loans.
Only 20 posts are planned in London where the bank employs 1500 people.
In New York, the industrial average of Dow Jones increased by 331 points, or 2.55 per cent by 13.289.40 while the largest index, S&P 500, took 2.65 per cent.
In London, the FTSE 100 index took 165.5 points to 2.7% by 6306.2 plus more than $39 to the value of British companies.
The German Dax index increased by 2.6% and the French CAC40 took 2.3%.
In the past, the recovery of credit difficulties in the markets was based on the strong demand for a sale of three-month funds by the European Central Bank, which has cut these loans to European commercial banks at a high rate of 4.7%, the highest since April 2001.
The pressure on the Bank of England to monitor the ERDF and the ECB and to inject further funds into the financial markets in the London financial markets resulting in credit tensions has resulted in the three-month loan rates "Libor" for the British banks, resulting in their higher growth since September last, at 6.59 per cent after a strong increase since 12 November.
England faces a call for judgment in relation to the criticisms of Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara.
We face two dilemmas, one as difficult as the other.
Who will be the winner No.6 for England in Candy this weekend, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And even more important in a broader context than the first test against Sri Lanka, who will take the decision?
The second issue is important because David Graveney, the president of the voters who were there to help Peter Moores, the Chief coach, and Michael Vaughan, the Captain, make his decision, and because Hugh Morris, the President-General of England, began to fill in the application forms to become a national electoral officer at least partly.
The one who will not be able to win the No.6 dosard will be miserable, but life is often unfair and sport is also.
It is never easy to imagine what allows a man to reach the top of his profession while another will never reach the lower level, sometimes by lack of chance more than by lack of capacity.
There is only a cricket that the selection is difficult because finally the judgment remains subjective.
Is it a good time to wake up Bopara?
Is this just about Shah?
The same could be proposed in another context, which selects between John Edwards or Banerjee 'tubby'?; both, new frameworks having obtained good diplomas, professionals, should be promoted: but there is only room for one of them.
Who has the right to determine the fair level of a critic at least one chance?
The figures are important in decisions, but also opportunities.
Within a team, a cricket must capture the captain's eye, at the same time he must take the door and a batter must be able to touch the cricket for one day.
But catching the eyes of the voters is much more complicated.
Many have done better in the last season, for example, James Anderson, who seemed to play the first test, even though Stephen Harmison was in full shape and was still training himself.
Anderson took 32 first class doors on 33 tournaments to win a place.
Chris Tremlett took only 29 at the same average, but both have already lived their time of glory at the highest level and hope to offer more.
If it's Shah or Bopara who's gonna play in the city of Asgiria, that's just an opinion issue.
This choice could slow down or build a man's career, but it doesn't make a difference.
Four years ago, in Sri Lanka, Garreth Batty played in each test and succeeded in the first, with five gates and 40 useful towers, but it was Paul Collingwood, who also struggled to emerge, who succeeded in becoming the primary critic of the Test, and this despite the fact that his two hundred marked against Australia could still be estimated.
The probability is that Graveney, Vaughan, and Moores, following another discussion after today's session at Asgiria, will certainly follow their conservative instincts and will promote Shah's greatest experience against young Bopara's exuberance.
The two have good arguments.
In favour of Shah, its brilliant and considerable start at the 88th inning of the Test in Bombay, 32 percent of the first grade against six for Bopara, which is seven years younger than 22 years old, and is excellent in launch.
But Shah did not make ten rounds during his two innings in May against the Caribbean during the Lord's test, his city of Middlesex player, and that, immediately rejected by the voters when Vaughan re-formed, he claimed his place for the next match, it seems to have damaged his tracks so obvious in Bombay.
Unlike him, Essex's player is happy to live.
Nothing scares him on a cricket field and he was exaggerated when he recently landed on a 4x4 at a presentation by Volkswagen, Sponsor of England.
He reported only a few injuries, he was shocked, even though the first thing he did was to take his Vodafone and call Alastair Cook, his team that looked away, to ask him if he had seen this?
Bopara is far the best fighter, his fillant age allows him to perform services that he likes, and he has to fight with confidence and professionalism.
Choosing a righteous man is one thing, choosing the right time is another.
Can it be the true art of the selection?
I would like to give her a chance to Bopara, which does not mean that Shah shouldn't apply if, such tea leaves suggest it, it will be him who will play this weekend.
Buses get people to work, and fight al Qaeda.
The first bus full of Iraqi refugees from Syria arrived in Baghdad yesterday, destroying these prisoners without money or visa renewal, or others hoping that the city had recovered normal.
Some have returned to fight the soldiers who have distanced them from their homes.
At the Mansour bus station, even before the arrival of Damascus of 800 persons transported in 12 bus wagons by the official government, the terminal was filled with refugees from Syria and Jordan who returned through their means.
"I decided to go to Syria after they killed several doctors in Baghdad," said Sabah al-Qubaisi, a Sunni doctor.
"I've come back today because I've seen television and read in the newspapers what happened in Baghdad and I've seen that the city is more sure now."
"They say the Mahdi army is no longer committing crimes!" he said, referring to the militia Shia of the Ecclesiastical Military Moqtada al-Sadr, who forced his men to stay away for the moment.
Qassim al Atwani, a 38-year-old Shia teacher in the Amariah area, dominated by the Sunni, returned with her two children because he could no longer renew his Syrian vision and because the regime prevented the Iraqis from working.
His neighbors from Shia to Amariyah called him to inform him that the United States-aided militia had allowed Al Qaeda to land west of the capital, and invited him back.
One of Jordan's new arrivals is the leader of a Sunni and Shia tribe who had to leave his home north of Baghdad because of an attack on the grenade after he forced the citizens to rebel against Al-Qaeda.
But he had to go back to fight.
"Two days ago, some of my friends called me and told me to set up an anti-Al-Qaeda militia in Sleikh, and they needed me and my boys."
"That's why I'm going today," said 62-year-old Sabaah Alu Obeidi.
Many say that they have been attracted by the growing calm of the capital since the arrival of American troops, and for the continued training of well-armed "computed groups of citizens" and working with American soldiers to defend their vicinity.
But others say that it has been forced to return because of the visa problem and the disappearance of the capital of Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqis have been in the past years.
Salaam al-Samarrai, 51 years old, father of three children, expressed the suspicion by all regarding visas for prisoners as Nuri al-Maliki, Prime Minister Shia, who would have asked the Syrian government to limit people to return to the country.
More than two and a half million people would have been from the country due to sectoral deaths.
"We had no problem until Al-Maliki arrived in Syria and encouraged the government to give no more visas to Iraqis, to force them to return to Iraq," Sunni said.
“ I can’t trust a government that supports criminals who burned my home when I’m away. ”
The decrease in violence can be partly explained by the fact that the Sunnis have been cut off from Shia and vice versa, creating places where tension is lower.
It is feared that a Sudanese flow of refugees will not again increase sectoral tensions and put the fighting back on.
Little Sarre, good training.
The smallest federal state is involved in vocational training, and it is also reflected by the international orientation of its higher schools.
It is only in one area that a deficit is due to the Sarrois, similar to that of the rest of the country.
"I explained yesterday for the 50th time to a non-Sarrois, that we are not French" - this is the slogan that the smallest federal state, by self-determination, shows for its 50th anniversary.
At this level, France and Luxembourg play a major role in the training system of the Sarre, which is placed fifth in the training monitor of the German Institute of Economics in Cologne.
Thus, by tradition, higher schools work closely with neighbouring countries.
The university was founded in Sarrebruck in 1948 by the French.
To date, students have the opportunity to complete their studies by double, to see a triple degree.
It testifies to the high rate of 15.6 per cent of foreign students.
The Sarre also leads the children of the country to higher schools than the average - many of them without a Gymnasium degree.
"In Sarre, we benefit from the vocational training system," says Axel Plünnecke, a training expert at IW.
More than one in five students receive their degree in a professional school, so Sarre is located at more than seven points above the national average.
The possibilities of combining vocational and academic training are also well developed.
In view of the number of residents, the double course panel is Germany's second best.
Despite practical training and growing demand, however, the number of graduates in engineering has declined from one third in recent years.
That is why the Ministry of Sharrois Education has required higher schools than a marketing campaign in engineering sciences.
"After the first PISA studies, we held a large number of reforms in general schools," said a spokesman from the Ministry of Education.
The Government has thus introduced comparison tests throughout the federal state.
In order for children to start learning more quickly, the last year of the school is exempt from law - a model that is also copied by other federal states.
Only future comparative studies can show whether students' performances improve permanently.
In PISA studies in 2003, the rate of risk students decreased by 29 to 20 per cent.
In total, however, Sarre has not improved as much as other federal states.
Bavaros are getting better.
And in the great challenge of sharrois, foreign language knowledge is not measured by the PISA studies - we could otherwise win points in this area.
Because the neighbor's language is mandatory in the lycées - even if the sarrois are not French.
Set display type to fixed-point format
In Venezuela, the exhibitions will soon become tic-tac rather than in the rest of the world.
On 9 December, President Hugo Chavez will rebuild the clock in South America for half an hour.
Chavez eventually became a caricature in Spain.
As the official newspaper of Venezuela communicated it, as a new law, the exhibitions will be arranged at least four and a half hours from universal time.
In this way, the South American country has a time zone that does not exist in any other state of the world.
Anti-American Chávez justified his position among others by putting the United States to a standstill in full hours.
In addition, Chávez announced Wednesday (local time) the termination of relations with the neighbouring country, Colombia, as a matter of hostages.
The left-wing nationalist announced that as long as Conservative Alvaro Uribe remained president of Colombia, he would not have relations with the head of state or the Government of Colombia.
"I can't do it already because of my dignity," said Chávez, who has a constitutional reform on which the citizens of the oil country will have to vote on Monday's referendum.
With this reform, it would significantly strengthen its power in the country.
The triggering element of this debate was the decision of Uribe to withdraw the mandate of negotiations on the release of hostages with Marxist rebels in Colombia.
Uribe would have "dear face" in Venezuela with this decision, he had criticized Chávez Sunday.
In Spain, Chávez is also in every door.
A new mobile phone sound is raging in the country: "Why don't you call" (Why don't you stop) is the phrase that has already downloaded over half a million people online.
It was declared by Spanish King Juan Carlos, who, at the most recent Ibero-American summit, was inspired by the constant interpolations of the left-wing populists and who told him of his defeat.
A drop in wages threatens Germany in 2007.
Despite the strong conjugation, according to a forecast, a real low-value wage threatens German employees this year.
Experts have cited all kinds of reasons to explain their predictive pessimist.
According to a calculation of the Hans-Böckler Foundation, wages should be expected in 2007 to a real decrease in their payroll compared to the previous year.
"The deficit is due to low wage development, increased value added tax and increased prices for food and energy products," said Gustav Horn of the Institute for the Macro-Economics and Research on the Future, in the "Build".
New charges could also be involved in insurance insurance for the salary.
The Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück said in the newspaper "Nue Osnabrücker Zeitung" that the projected decline in unemployment insurance of 3.3 per cent for the new year was some correct and reasonable in the current situation.
However, the National Employment Agency no longer has the right to be found in the embargo to request the Federation of Credits or Financial Assistance, according to the SPD policy.
It was Tuesday that the explosion of food and hydrocarbon prices had pushed the inflation rate to its highest level for 13 years.
Overall, prices increased by 3.0 per cent from one year to another.
Venus is the hell of Earth.
Despite its hostile atmosphere to life, Venus is more like Earth than it was thought to be so far: the European Space probe "Venus Express" has discovered lightnings in the atmosphere and wind turbines in the pools, like those that appear in winter on Earth.
For almost three decades, scientists have assumed there are clarifications about Venus.
The European probe "Venus Express" has now provided evidence - it has detected electromagnetic waves at the limit of the atmosphere: the lights on Venus shine to a height of about 56 kilometers in clouds, reports Christopher Russell of the University of California in Los Angeles in the scientific magazine "Naturity".
According to the famous Cyprinian theory, the lights would have made life on Earth appear: the smell would have stimulated reactions in the oceans that led to the formation of amino acids, a stone of life.
This is not the case with Venus: "If there was a life there, it must have been at a very early date in history," explains Sean Solomon of "Carnegie Institution" in Washington.
Today there should be no cure for living things on the surface of Venus: the atmosphere is about a hundred times more dense than on Earth, sometimes at 500 degrees.
"Venus may be the hellhole of the Earth, but it remains a jungle," said Russell.
Why has Venus, which is so much like Earth and sizes, been hit by such a different evolution, is the key issue of the ASE mission.
The launch of "Venus Express" in November 2005 was an important step in Venezuelan research, as no further survey was in progress for the exploration of this planet for the past four decades.
According to researchers, the most recent research results that have now been presented in several articles of "Naturity" do not only highlight the uniqueness of Venus within the solar system.
They also show that the points common to the Earth of our nearby planet are more numerous than originally assumed.
So researchers have found, in addition to the wind turbines already known in the North Pole, a cloud turbine in the South Pole, which rotates much faster.
The phenomenon brings to mind air currents in earth's winter hemispheres, wrote by a team of researchers about Giuseppe Piccioi of the Institute of Astrofisica Spaziale and Fisica Cosmica Italian.
The second planet of the solar system is almost the same mass as the Earth and is, with a diameter of 12,100 kilometers, almost as large.
The well-qualified star planet of the night or the morning revolves around the sun in just 225 days.
However, it turns much slower on itself: a coming day takes 243 days on land.
Although Venus, with surface temperatures of 460 degrees Celsius and a pressure of 92 bar, does not remember the Earth well, scientists assume that the two planets are formed under similar conditions.
On both sides, the water gathered and remained on Earth in ocean form, but disappeared in space on Venus.
And while carbon dioxide is established on Earth in the form of carbon, it is on Venus, the largest part of the atmosphere.
Köhler defends Merkel's meeting with the Dalai Lama.
The President of the Federal Republic of Germany Köhler calls for the end of the parties' rollover on Dalai Lama's invitation to Chancellery.
In indirect terms, it criticised SPDs for attacks against the chancellor after the September meeting.
Federal President Horst Köhler is concerned about Germany's appearance and is the great coalition of cllores about Dalai Lama's reception.
"We must not present a divided nation outside the world on this issue," Köhler said at Handelsblatt.
At the same time, Köhler showed understanding for the reception of Dalai Lama by Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) in September.
"Human rights have universal validity, although I respect differences between cultures," Köhler said.
Everyone knew that Germany should maintain a sensitive balance in foreign policy, he stressed the President of the Federal Republic, but defended Merkel against the challenges she would face in order to develop a new policy of China.
The German Chancellor has not taken its distance with the traditional policy of one China alone.
"China knew it too," Köhler said.
The Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steimeier (SPD) had indirectly expressed his disappointment about Dalaii Lama's reception and had been attacked outside the CDU's ranks.
Steinmeier complained, in particular, of the CDU's "beautiful policy" on foreign policy.
After Dalai Lama's welcome to Chancellery, violent irritations erupted in the German-Chinese reports.
Thus, the Chinese Government not only ordered the German Minister of Finance Peer Steinbrück (SPD), but, according to Spiegel's information, also welcomed the dialogue on foreign ministers' strategy for both countries.
The head of the government of China Wen Jiabao now demands the German Chancellor Angela Merkel to recognize that Dalai-Lama's reception was a mistake.
China denies that European political men receive the spiritual head of Tibet in its official functions, so Wen Jiabao supported the Chinese position.
The words and deeds of Dalai Lama would show that he was trying to separate Tibet from China and other Tibetan regions, including other current provinces.
Schäuble keeps on guard against the emotives like those of France.
Street fighting with the police, shootings, fire cars: Wolfgang Schäuble keeps on guard against threats such as those in France.
All must be implemented so that social dissatisfaction in Germany does not arise in the streets of violence, the German Minister of the Interior has demanded.
Barriers that burn, cops who shoot the police with knives: after the heavy shootings of young people in France, German Interior Minister Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) fears a similar evolution in Germany.
We must ensure that a social explosion is not also home to us and that it becomes violent.
We have to take this seriously," he said to the "Nue Presse" in Hanovre.
All young people would not be able to get out with the rapid transformations of social reality.
The Federation, the Federal States and the Commons had already worked hard to reduce problems, Schäuble said.
This would not only affect the integration of immigrants.
"Integrating summits on Islam, this has already shown its first success."
But it would be too soon for a warning end.
Schäuble points out at the same time that in the German baths there are no sociological problems or the point of view of urbanism as in France.
In the Parisian agglomerations in the north, young people were given serious street battles with the police during the last night.
In Toulouse too, public cars and buildings burned.
The German Government's greater efforts to integrate this is what the President of the Turkish communities in Germany, Kenan Kolat, called for.
In view of the appearances in France, Kolat was careful against "impositional effects".
The situation in Germany would not be as explosive as France.
But there would still be a need to act.
Kolat highlights the fact that the rate of unemployment among young people under 25 years of age beyond immigration would be higher than the average.
There should be more room for training first.
Kolat insisted: "We must give young people a perspective."
However, the President of the Turkish communities added that social control in families was more common in Germany than in France.
Many young people from immigration do not want to destroy what their parents have built here.
Kolat urged: "But we have to be careful."
Young people should "be able to participate in work and training".
Meanwhile, in the Paris fauburg of Villaries-le-Bel, everything remained very calm during the night.
Police units were in place, a helicopter patrolled the area with projectors.
The post authorities have taken part in three arrests, as well as some cars and buses burned.
Since the conference, about 1,000 security forces have been deployed to ensure peace.
The police will intervene as long as necessary, announced by Interior Minister Michelle Alliot-Marie after a visit from Fauburg.
On Tuesday night, nearly 80 police officers were injured during the shootings in Villaries-le-Bel.
The next night, the trouble started in Toulouse.
Emissions emerged after a traffic accident in which two young people had lost their lives on Sunday.
According to the first elements of the Park, the police are not responsible for the death of young people.
In Angela Merkel's empire.
The utopic entry of the chancellor shows that the coalition has finished with the bottom - and there is nothing to wait for.
In which country does this chancellor live to justice?
After its disappointing intervention in the general debate of the German Parliament, which was chaos and poor content, it must be said: not here - not here in the country which, in the end, should be governed by it.
The too much criticism of politics was echoed by Angela Merkel of a harsh and presumptive phrase.
It's provincial, she said it and just showed it that she doesn't want to understand what critics want.
In Parliament, it has become visible to all of us as to the exact extent to which this claim was made.
There was no particular interest or feeling for the country's problems to be felt.
In place, Angela presents herself as a cloud: a politician in charge, who was in foreign policy and who is even there in the near future.
For example, climate protection: in this regard, it is still happy about Heiligendam's agreements, but does not say how climate goals should be achieved in our country.
Even self-esteem - being so modest, the head of the CDU would have rejected it two years ago.
Now it's all about formulas, that growth would affect people.
It destroys its pragmatist image, which solves problems instead of improving the world.
But in the empire of the Angela cloud, internal policy problems are a marginal phenomenon.
Poverty in children and the concerns of low-paid workers?
He's got a few words available to him for that.
In this respect, it reveals the number of times it makes errors when it comes to family housing.
Here, Merkel needs three startings to say a very specific half-word.
She's stuck in an unknown field from the time it becomes a concrete one.
The Attack Branch
In the debate between youtube of Republican candidates to the presidential office, the two favorites, Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney, are given a hard offensive battle - and now they need to fear an outside candidate.
The tension of candidates is already highlighted in the first issue.
He would have made New York a "refugee to the clandestine," blame Mit Romney on his opponent Rudy Giuliani.
This was against her by harsh accusations: "I would say her own house was a treasure for clandestine people" responded Giuliani and complained to the former Governor of Massachusetts that he had employed immigrants without papers.
The candidates are attacked: as the Republican base has no further official benefits, the eight candidates in the presidential are serving discussions on CNN first and foremost in order to discredit their opponents.
The 30-second amateur movies that Internet users have sent via YouTube are more painful than fans.
"It's with this sort of isolationism that we have allowed Hitler to come to power," John McCain launched his candidate Ron Paul, who is the only one in the round to claim immediate retreat from Iraq.
Romney also makes the lesson powerful by Vietnam's veterans when he refuses to condemn as torture what is called "Waterboarding", a method of interrogation where Christmas is simulated.
However, the fact that the major issues of the campaign are intermittently linked to the war in Iraq and the debate on torture is reflected in the reactions of St. Petersburg's joint hall in Florida.
Whether the conservation values are rented or future tax increases are refused, the agglomerations vary in the auditorium.
That's where they show up again where they live the weaknesses of the two favorites.
"I made a mistake at this time," Romney explained, and presented his excuses on the basis and on the TV for having been yet a party to the abortion in 1994.
On the contrary, Giuliani goes into a coma when he is asked how he feels about the literary interpretations of the Bible.
Musharraf ruled for the first time in civility.
One day after his retirement as head of the army, the man of Pakistani power Musharraf was invested as president.
So eight years of command by the army are over.
Pakistan's President Pervez Musharraf was invested on Thursday for a new five-year term.
Pakistanese television broadcasts the ceremony directly to the presidential palace of the capital Islamabad.
Musharraf has sworn to respect the Constitution and to act for the well-being of the United Nations.
Wednesday he had sent his army chief to his trusted Ashfaq Kiyani and was thus subjected to international pressure, including that of the United States.
Eight years after taking power by a potsch without blood flow, the former general now reigns for the first time as head of civil state.
With this withdrawal from the position of commander of the armed forces, Musharraf had fulfilled the main requirement of the opposition and the West.
Another central requirement is the end of the emergency situation that Mustarraf described on 3 November.
Not long after his investment, Musharraf will suspend the state of emergency, according to Prosecutor General Malik Muhammad Qayum, and will thus meet another Western requirement.
The Supreme Court of the country, which had occupied Musharraf after the establishment of the state of emergency with the lawyers of its ranks, had rejected all appeals against the contested election of the Head of State on 6 October.
In the meantime, five soldiers were killed in the tribal region of the North Waziristan region in an attack against a military convoy, and four other wounded.
According to the military spokesman's instructions, a bomb exploded in a street near the border of Afghanistan.
Krautrock's fathers are returning.
The Supergroups in Germany of the age of sixty-ten years have responded: the three members of the Harmonia Group have re-enacted their console in a concert in Berlin.
For their return, records of their great success "Live 1974" have been made.
Already, they were well known abroad.
The intended feeling then occurs in the form of three measures announced at the evening.
Everyone has his little boot in front of him, his cable and all his buttons.
Dieter Moebius, 63 years old, stands in the middle in a white shirt like snow.
He is placed on the left hand side of Michael Rother, a 57-year-old man with a laptop and a guitar.
On the right, observed by the whole audience, Hans-Joachim Rodelius, 73 years old, runs on his console.
Each contributes to the noise, including a Beat.
And sometimes this is accompanied by inadvertentness by a set of traditional music.
This doesn't seem to be too much for mercenaries themselves.
The fact that the Harmonia group plays again has ensured some emotives among Krautrock's amateurs.
We have the right to dismiss it here: targeted surveys reveal that, of course, the name is reasonable in the collective memory of the pop, but in no way as long as this group has been missing so painfully since 32 years.
But why wouldn't Germany have the right to celebrate its live legends in the 1960s?
Much more than what is mistakenly called "Krautrock" has become more and more common in England and America than in the country of origin.
When the music industry announced the Echo prize to the survivors of the Colonne Can group for their work in 2003, the audiences of the German pop questionnaires were seen in the hall.
When the Red Hot Chili Peppers also thanked the groups La Düsseldorf and Neu! in the Panegrian elite, the surprise was no longer limited.
Later, during the concerts, Michael Rother saluted on the scene of the Red Hot Chili Peppers as an old friend.
The problem of ignorance at home and the transformation into ignorance is the only one and only.
The memory is already taken by Harmony, because the trio has existed for only two years and that during this period the impact power felt was much weaker than what was then attributed to it by others.
Moebius and Rodelius had already played with artist Conrad Schnitzler under the very promising name of Cluster.
We play first in the basements down the Berlin scene.
Then in Düsseldorf, for a subsidized label by the church, for financial reasons.
Rutherford had briefly relied on Kraftwerk and was finally named as a guitarist with Neu!, who was at the time perhaps the most radical German group.
In 1973, however, Luther's musicians were in jail in Weserbergland's forests.
There, in an old Weser farm, a ruin of the 16th century, they lived as members of communities fleeing the city.
Less ideological than in the community "Common I", where Rodelius had the right to be tortured as a nurse.
Rather an artistic existence like Spittweg.
It was said that there was a fan of Coral Harmonia Ottenstein and also a name for art.
Many keep Harmony away from that.
The first album is called "Music von Harmonia", and the next "De Luxe".
Because as serene and modicious as music sounded, the group suffered material poverty.
The harvest of the dead tree was not for him alone in his search.
The CD "Live 1974" that appeared was recorded at a concert in Griessem in front of a public record of nearly 50 heads, as well as some people believe it to be remembered.
Rutherford was released at this time and wanted to force Harmony to train himself from time to time.
It was an immoral requirement for Rodelius and Moebius.
The group announced its separation in 1975.
Rother landed in the spheres of esotericism and ensured his existence with albums such as "Flammmente Herzen" (flamming hearts).
Cluster is alive in the twenty-four years and has been more successful than Harmonia has ever had.
We have the Live of Griessem album at Herbert Grönemeyer.
Its Greenland label is designed to maintain Krautrock as an inherent German contribution to contemporary music.
No! It had already been destroyed on this occasion as the personal work of Rodelius.
Harmonia's physical resurrection takes place at the World Cultural House in Berlin.
Publicly subsidised under the Waldtronics Festival.
Julian Cope is here, British, old punk and author of the "Krautrock Sampler" pocket book.
There is also the inventor of Loveparade, Dr. Motte.
By which the whole of Krautrock's influence flow margin would be marked with regard to future pop music.
The place left empty by the group will be filled by Harmony.
Brian Eno's phrase is in the room in the middle of the unique sounds: "The only true music, you hear the future."
There are photos showing producers with Harmonia in the farm room.
The projections of other black and white images of tools lined up in bazaar serve the formation of the legend.
First, the three veterans are again busy improvising.
But more by pulling microphones into the brain and battery, to draw inuit sound instruments through self-constructed self-constructed instruments.
Today, electronic music is like electronic music.
The three in large technical fineries.
At the same time, there's nothing to change about the house.
At the direction of Barbara Morgenstern, we are touched and chuckled under the cloud of sound, and we sing at a beautiful moment "Aaaaaaaaah" with empathy.
Krautrock has always been a very English concept.
It's never about rock.
The roots were found less in blue than in music conservatories (Can), in technology (Kraftwerk) or in the escape of artistic or social conventions (Cluster).
The one who calls "68" has not been completely tortured, and also Harmonia is now no longer upset by this.
But what's going to be most of itself will be covered in minutes on the scene.
Where does music start and where's it going?
This can depend on the nerves of someone (?) or give refugees moments of great joy.
Richard Gere is just not cynic enough.
With "The Hunting Party" and "Peace Killer", two films re-examine the war of the Balkans.
But they both don't.
The projects are either too much on action and on forced-fire trade or too alarming on the contrary.
Here, even Richard Gere in "The Hunting Party" can't help.
The good news first: some Karadzic and Mladic war criminals are always hiding in the mountains of the Balkans, but it's just there, in the most distant country in the war of Bosnia, where the actor Richard Gere is then found.
In the last place we had lost sight of the most beautiful man in the four and twenty years, because too many friendly and futile roles in women's-sensitive films and too many press conferences on the subject of Buddhism made him want to show himself.
Today Richard Gere is suddenly the most important argument to look at when even "The Hunting Party" - when the caster becomes broken (why should today's films be as long and confused as the collective conventions of locomotive drivers?)
He gives a great representation full of eyes: in the background, his character to report to war Simon Hunt is what Gere could have become, if the fate and industry of the films were not so welcome: a man who has his best moments since behind him, but who, even as a monument destroyed at his decline, has kept the visible remains of his former charm.
Despite this, "The Hunting Party" continues together with the German production "Death Peace", which also went on this week, the endless follow-up of films on the war of the Balkans.
The "Death Peace" process can be done quickly: the film speaks of two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt), which save a Serb from the Kosovar French tyrants, one of which is still a very loving one.
Although it is welcome that these Serbs are not once presented as the only causes of all evils, this film is as flat as a television film loses too fast in action and indiscriminate shootings.
It remains a sort of "Alarm for Cobra 11" without a car but with a war at the place.
On the contrary, we can look at the perfect example of "The Hunting Party" why there has never been a real good film on the war of the Balkans.
The story of the three U.S. war reporters, who are required to hit the high criminal war "the courage", could have become, with another realist and another scriptist (both Richard Shepard), at another time a new "Apocalypse Now".
Because history seems to be overwhelming: two men go into a small team in the forest, to accomplish something that the soldiers cannot do and for the two men, this becomes a trip in the mud.
One of the reasons for the failure of "The Hunting Party" is that we just don't let Simon Hunt be the cynic deserted with a heart, as it was presented at the beginning.
No, the script must give him a romantic adventure with a Bosnian who was then murdered.
Then "The Hunting Party" becomes definitely bad when, in the last five minutes, by an accelerated procedure, it comes to the failure of NATO, the CIA and all the world's prime fighters in five years: to attract the war criminal and leave him for a fair revenge on the Bosnians.
It is so bad that the International Court of Justice of the Hague should be seized against cinematographic logic.
In this case, the film has too much human concern.
He claims that Karadzic and Mladic are still free, and he suspects the Americans and the French (this must be an exceptional agreement) that they do not lead the hunt sufficiently intensively because of secret political agreements.
But the well- intentioned and evil is this time so similar that a famous poet of Brecht comes to our mind.
He speaks of an Asian demon's wooden mask on the table of work of the poet: "Compatigating, I see the wines of the confused front, clearly: how it makes it difficult to be wrong."
Films such as "The Hunting Party" have exactly such dark heads, but which insinuate to what point it is tired of being good.
The problem is not limited to the type of movies about the war of the Balkans.
Recently, it has been reported in this journal that all Hollywood films on Iraq were large floats.
We can add: there have never been good films on South Africa.
What's worth every time: when a star trains on a crisis home or on a mine field, he succeeds in doing something like "Rangon" with Patricia Archette, "Jenseits go to Grenzen" with Angelina Jolie or "Bluddymanten" with Leonardo DiCaprio.
It is possible that all these conflicts are just too close in time.
Whatever it is, decades have passed before Hollywood can turn a good movie on the holocaust with "The Schindler List".
Some films still have to grow - those who today have classic works on Vietnam "The Deer Hunter", "Apocalypse Now" or "Full Metal Jackett" have not been celebrated unanimously at their time as work leaders.
But maybe we know today too simply too much about the world's conflicts, where each hecatomb comes directly on two screens at the same time at home,
And this reminiscent of the scriptists is the lack of sculptures they need to tell beautiful stories.
"Be or not" or "The dictator" have actually become as good as Lubtisch and Chaplin did not yet know where the Nazi regime really ruled.
Maybe he doesn't want to be good when we want to make good movies.
Perhaps it is necessary to have the sarcastic and distant artistic view of the novelist Lawrence Norfolk.
When asked about the parallel between his historic novel "Dictionary of Lemprire" and the war of the Balkans, he replied, "This has nothing to do with the fact that some things never change."
"The great cities will always be terriblely dangerous, the men will always be killed in a horrible way and the war will always rule in Yugoslavia."
Von Beaust collects criticism for the annulment of the Olympics.
The take-up of the mayor with Hamburg's candidate for summer Olympic Games has resulted in critical policies and economies.
Many want to keep fighting for the Games on the waterboard.
But Von Beaust calls for realism in appreciation of opportunities.
The chief director of the Chamber of Commerce in Hamburg, Hans-Jørg Schmidt-Trenz, described Wednesday as a leave as "good for the local economy".
Recently, no other project had deployed as much motivational forces in the city as the idea of the Olympics.
"Without this objective, the political-sport could not be maintained in the same measure."
Schmidt-Trenz invites the Senate not to bury the project, but to find a longer-term starting point, "which takes as a starting point another modified agenda".
The mayor Ole von Beaust remained Wednesday to his previous statements, which stated that the Olympic ambitions of Hamburg were unrealistic by at least 2028.
"It's not Hamburg who decides to apply to the Olympics, but the German Federation of Olympics," said Von Beaust at WELT ONLINE.
It refers to the expected decision of the Federation of Sports in early December on Munich's 2018 Winter Games candidate.
This preference means for us, that, in the time-limits that we had planned until 2028 until then, we will have no chance."
However, the dream does not end in the past, Von Beaust said.
The Hamburg Sports Federation (HSB) regretted Beaust's statements.
The impression would be given that Hamburg no longer wants to apply for Olympic Games in the next 25 years.
"It is too early to close up an opportunity, while the projects are already being completed," HSB President Günter Ploß said Wednesday.
A resignation of the candidate would be further contrary to the statements of the head of the Senate at the time of the plenary meeting of the German Federation of Higher Schools of Sport.
There, Von Beaust would have qualified Hamburg's candidate at the 2015 universities as "no substitute" for the Olympic Games in Hamburg.
The Federation of Higher Schools of Sport had first in the past weeks named Hamburg as a candidate city.
The major SPD Group appealed to the Senate not to use this precious time in building housing in Hamburg.
"The development of Petit Grasbrook has been rejected by the Senate for years because it has played the Olympics card and has excluded the construction of dwellings," said SPD delegates Carola Veit and Jan Quast.
While the SPD has always claimed for Little Grasbrook an integrated plan in the Olympics and subsequent use of housing, the CDU would have placed exclusively on the "Event factor".
The 2012 summer Olympics candidate would have been very enthusiastic for its part in Hamburg.
However, Hamburg was broke up against Leipzig.
It's not Warhols' castles.
The one who links the concepts of Sweden and falls into wood, thinks of Ikea, but not Andy Warhol.
Or is it?
At this time, wooden boxes made in Sweden cast shadows on the list of Warhol's works.
A large part of the four-to-eight-ten Brillo-Boxes of "Type Stockholm" listed below are contradictions.
After the Swedish newspaper "Expressen" questioned the authenticity of the British Boxes of Andy Warhol's 1968, the internal research of the Modern Museum of Stockholm today is a disheartening result: the six "Brillo-Boxes", which the former director of the Pontis Hulten Museum gave a gift in 1995 to the Modern Museum, are copies - as well as a large part of the other hundreds of "Type Stockholm Boxes" that are circulating on the international art market.
The old history is confused, a disgruntled learning of artistic and curatorial productions.
In 1964, Warhol created its first "Brillo-Boxes" in New York, which are based on the red-blue-white design of "Brillo" soap cartons.
A exhibition of his work at Moderna Museet was presented in 1968 - with Warhol's agreement - of hundreds of Brillo cartons made of cardboard: They did not come (for financial reasons) from Warhol, but were delivered directly from the Brillo carding factory.
It was not about art works here, but rather about their models, exhibition samples.
At the same time, Warhol had given permission in 1968 to produce some Brillo wood boxes in Sweden, which were no longer exposed to Moderna Museet.
Witnesses of the time are now talking about about about 15 wooden boxes that would at the time be legalized in the history of art and entertainment, as well as the original Andy Warhol Boxes authorized, with the name "Type Stockholm".
Some of them have reached sales of over $100,000 in cash.
The problem is that the director of the Pontus Hultén Museum, who later claimed that, on the other hand, some 100 wooden boxes had been produced and exposed in Sweden in 1968, which Warhol had then handed over to him.
In fact, 105 Hultén cheeses were produced in Malmö only in 1990, for exhibition in St. Petersburg.
By this time, Warhol had been dead for three years.
Lars Byström, the Conservatory of Moderna Museet, examined, alongside the six Brillo-Boxes of the museum, three other Swedish private collections, of which two were assembled in Stockholm in 1968: their strategic panels were first printed and printed, then applied with a white oil painting pen.
The text of copies dating from the 1990s reveals that the painting was directly applied without background on stratified panels, using a painting roll - no longer is a painting on oil but an acrylic.
"These cases have not been authorized by the artist and should be removed from the official list of Andy Warhol's Brillo Boxes," says the director of Moderna Museet, Lars Nittve: "If the Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board in New York no other decision, the Modern Museum will classify the six cases in its collection as copies/exposure material."
Already in July the Authentication Board has been well informed that it would investigate the "hard charges" that will be raised in the case of powdered soap boxes.
But since then we've heard of an inexorable silence.
Manille's Rebellious Soldiers Leaven
In the Philippines, rebel soldiers left, the same ones who had been withdrawn from a hotel in Manila and who had demanded the resignation of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Chief Antonio Trillanes, who appealed to the President for corruption and electoral fraud, told reporters in the hotel that he could not answer any blood flow.
The loyal forces in power had just taken over the hotel with the help of larymogene gas.
The twelve soldiers had been retreated from the building for hours.
About half of them were detained in court due to a lack of potsch attempt in 2003 - among them Trillanes.
He took advantage of the audience to sympathize with about 30 sympathetics.
The military police, who normally had to monitor them, appeared to have been deserted in favor of him and joined his mutiny.
They entered the Penisula Hotel and demanded the resignation of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
The loyal forces in power block the sector around the respective hotel.
The President convened an urgent meeting of the Security Council.
The National Security Council, Norberto Gonzales, condemns military action.
"People have enough," says Trillanes.
"We call the people to meet us."
General Danilo Lim, who ordered before the Scouts Rangers elite unit, said that other military units wanted to join the march.
The criticisms of the regime had called for a great demonstration against the Wednesday President.
Its government has been surrounded for months by allegations of corruption.
Manille's financial district has been the theatre of some 200 members of the army against Arroyo since 2003.
The insurrection breaks up about 24 hours after the army refuses to join it.
Since 1986 there have already been at least seven potsch attempts against democratically elected governments in the Philippines.
United Internet becomes a main shareholder of Versatel.
United Internet has provided more than 20 per cent of Versatel telecommunications company.
The average price per action is EUR 14.46, as announced by Wednesday's company.
Only 20.05 per cent of social capital would be held.
We've already been speculating about a scratch before.
The option would remain open to further increase participation in Versatel.
With this help we seek to accelerate the consolidation of the German DSL market, United Internet communicated.
Just before, assumptions had already been made on Wednesday about an entry, after the Berenberg Bank increased its participation in Düsseldorf network operator from 5 per cent to 15.1 per cent.
The credit institution would only hold money for a third party, it is reported on the market.
Watch out, United Internet had already acquired about 10 percent participation in Drillish mobile phone company.
In the context of an increase in capital, Drillish has put in Bourse 17.4 million new actions of EUR 106.4 million.
United Internet has bought 5.15 million euros for 31.1 million euros.
In addition, companies have opened negotiations on cooperation in the marketing of DSL products and mobile phone.
"We strengthen our partnership," explained a U.S. Internet spokesman.
The two companies founded the MSP participating company to absorb the Freenet competitor.
At the moment, the two companies want to be satisfied with their 10 per cent share in Freenet, and do not use their right to invest 18,49 per cent more in Freenet, U.S. Internet Thursday trusted.
However, the two companies would leave all open options, especially to increase participation in SA Freenet, has been learned.
The negotiations between the United Internet and Freenet on a strategic partnership had ended in mid-October.
The poker on Freenet, which has been part of the strengthening of the German telecommunications market for months, is still difficult to predict.
Freenet had at the end of the third quarter 2.9 million customers connected by a mobile phone contract and 1.27 million DSL customers and full subscriptions.
The United Internet and Drillish Holding has so far held direct participation in Freenet from 6.01 per cent.
It was now agreed that Drillish would bring about four per cent additional.
The right to purchase 18.49 per cent of the investment company Vatas had already been decided in August.
