The goods cost less than 20 euros.
The fee corresponds to 40% of the value of the product....
I'm #PRS_ORG# Great skills and so there's no problem for me.
Just need a number or an indication what I should attach to the package so that it can be drawn back from you.
I ordered #PRS_ORG# a few days ago... for 249€.
Today it costs 179€.
I honestly think that's very embarrassing.
Do I have to cancel the order and order new orders for the best price or is there another option for the written?
I also think fundamentally that children should not be forced to take a parental role for their little sisters.
However, I find that it is also good for large sisters to take care of the little ones.
Take a look a little bit, help a little while, bring the bottle, etc.
In this way they learn responsibility, help the family and are involved.
As long as she can be a child herself, I can see no problem.
If your K1 is working alone for a short time and it's OK for him, that's good.
You can decide for yourself whether it works for your children.
It's not like he's going to turn K2 and spend hours with him when he's in bed.
Pure justice is probably questionable.
So maybe the psychologist's statement is also coming.
Because if something really happened like a fire, explosion, earthquake, alien invasion etc., it would actually be too much responsibility for K1 to take care of K2.
Whether this is now a risk you want to enter is of course your measurement ;)
Help me find the title of a book again!
I remember reading a Crimi / Thriller a few years ago and I can still remember the whole operation, but I don't want the title to fall apart anymore maybe someone knows here...
The story was about fear and therapy.
At the beginning of the story, an animal nurse kills herself by pushing herself over with food and going to her robcats.
The case will be taken by a Commissioner who, after brief detection of his therapists, is a medical device that is used to treat patients with anxiety.
The Commissioner has a small thing that also has a fear (before fire) and has landed at these therapists.
It comes to more suicides and there is another protagonist - a photographer who is sent anonymously to the scene of suicide and document and put the photos on the Internet.
In any case, this therapy is finally found to be a type of underlying therapy group where the patients are transplanted by a chip, the one who is suffering from a nervous breakdown in the brain and the patients are finally at the extreme risk.
(a woman jumps out of the window another rides towards death)
This fear is described in the book as "the fight".
At the end there is a great showdown in the clinic that had to do with a fire.
That's the serious action I'm pretty sure the book was originally written by a French author/author.
If this action is known to anyone or even to me, I would be very happy.
Oh, I don't have the password for Wlan.
I need to contact my husband first.
But it can last.
What steps must I take then?
Is it also possible to reverse the price difference ?
Child, 4 j., Splitter under the lady tongue
A child, four years old, has a full length of wood splitter under the dome needle (outside).
I've tried to take him with a pint.
It's very hard to catch.
He didn't complain and he didn't.
Now the child reacts hysterically when we try.
No more chances.
It's going to the doctor tomorrow.

Because of Omicron: Johnson wants to proceed with the update
Always new Omicron cases provide policy and science in Britain.
By the age of nine, therefore, all qualified adults in England should receive a reception offer.
London - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants to arrive faster than ever in view of the Corona-refreshing symptoms, despite rapid increase in Omicron numbers.
Each adult in England will be given the opportunity to receive a booster dose until at least three months have passed since the second season, Johnson said on Sunday evening in a recorded video message to his countrymen.
Until then, the target date was at the end of January.
The British government will also provide support to speed up the campaign in the parts of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
In view of the Omicron variant, there is a need to strengthen the urgent protection of vaccines, Johnson said.
The good news is that the level of protection can be increased at a third dose.
"Let yourselves boost now!" said Johnson.
On Sunday, 1239 further cases of Omicron were registered in Britain, with a total increase of 3137.
Compared to the previous day, it was an increase of 65 percent. dpa
will the full amount be refunded from the purchase price on withdrawal?
I am for everyone to be represented by pronoms
I sent an application.
Today the invitation came to a conversation by mail.
I want to answer the e-mail.
Unfortunately, the name is not "Peter", but a somewhat complicated name.
I've shot him and every time he/she has a cultural background here, it's either a man or a woman.
**I have no idea how to write the e-mail now.
Can anyone help me?
** I'm a foreigner and I don't want to keep any officers on my feet.
Conclusion: everyone should be represented by pronoms.
I've got 5 books on it.
Four of them go.
It's not just one I bought today.
Apparently the chair had an invisible lack of sales.
How can a plastic damage occur after 9 months?
Just try on the #PRS_ORG#.
But it's been working for some time.
14 days no longer.
That's why I've always bought the last books on the website and then read on the #PRS_ORG#.
I bought 6 #PRS_ORG# and wanted to buy 8.
But there was no more.
Now they are available again and I want you to add 2 chairs to the order and take it into account.

Content Warning: I'll write something detailed about domestic violence here.
I just need to write something out of my soul.
I (21) often come into contact for professional reasons with the victims (and aunts) of domestic violence.
A topic that really matters to me and unfortunately too often is that many victims don't help themselves or think we can't help them.
It is clear to me that we can't do everything and it's not perfect.
But there are fewer things in my profession that move me more than I can do in such situations.
I see the blue spots, the blood, the confused eyes...
But even in the conversation under four eyes, with the mother far out of sight and hearing I can't reach all.
I don't know what the reason is, maybe it's fear, fear of Rich, fear of leaving the usual social environment, fear of bringing the children out of this.
What I always want to make clear is partly very close to the trains, all of them are worth living without violence.
I want all women to know that they don't just have to take violence.
I often wish I could help in any case... I know I can't.
But this will never make it easier.
Please always think it's worth living without violence that it's so incredible.
"Arcane" on Netflix: What does the series use for "League of Legends"?
Many Fantasy, many complex names, an amazing opening: "Arcane", the series from the "League of Legends" computer game university, has recently started on Netflix.
Why are we delighted with the two staffs already announced?
Basketball-Bundesliga: Derby Debakel of the MHP Riesen Ludwigsburg at Merlins Crailsheim
At least on Youngster Johannes Patrick was released.
Again nothing: In the second time, within not even three months, the roses in Crailsheim - and how!
Before the game, Ludwigsburgs Trainer John Patrick had said with a look at the Pocal Niederage in the beginning of October at the Hacro Merlins Crailsheim: "We've still got some noise in the mouth."
He didn't put himself after the game then - but again increased in view of 61:72 (28:38) -lower position in the basketball Bundeslaga.
Where more than the fine result was the nature and manner of the event.
In contrast, it has been called a statistics that express the whole dilemma: The three-quats were just 13 percent, 4 hits (all by young Johannes Patrick) when saying and writing 31 attempts - still questions?
The answer was given by John Patrick: "We were simply not focused enough after the win at Teneriffa and did not apply what we have trained."
I mean to move the ball.
All others responded to Sebastian Gleim: "A crazy game to win for the second time against Ludwigsburg," said the lucky coach.
"It's felt like 10,000 people ago."
Only 750 visitors were allowed on Saturday in the High Lohe Arena, but they came at their cost.
Not long ago also because of BBL topscore T.J. Shorts, the 22 points marked and linked his team's game.
"The best player I've trained you," Gleim still praised.
While in Patrick's team, the performers like Jordan Hulls (0 points) and Jonah Radebach (7) were on the whole line.
Only in the last quarter (2:15) prevented the roses from a total debacle and came up to eight points after they had already returned to 39:59.
In addition to Johannes Patrick, Justin Simon came at twelve points.
Many hours of hard work are not very happy.
Already on Wednesday (19 o'clock) the Russians received the Skyliners Frankfurt, and then in Ludwigsburg they received a maximum of 750 visitors.
We had another e-mail address before, but I've changed it.
Yes, I've already reported to you a few months ago.
Unfortunately, all insurance claims were rejected.
We have just informed us again and have therefore joined them again.
We've already reported to us a year and a half ago.
City like from the Ei: Max Raabe will be 59
He was able to appeal to his audience with renewed interpretations of victims from the 20s and 30s.
At present he is on his way with the "Good Day, Dear Happiness" program - if he can come up.
In fact, Max Raabe wanted to celebrate his birthday on the stage in Leipzig this Sunday.
But that's not gonna happen.
The planned concert was delivered in May 2022 - "on official instructions" to introduce the Corona virus.
Other events planned in the Advent era must also appear only once, as it is on the website of the singer that will be 59 today and his musician (www.palast-orchester.de).
From January onwards, the artists want to keep their deadlines up to 2020 due to the pandemic.
Born on 12 December 1962 in North Rhine-Westphalia, Max Raabe has already been well-educated as a young man.
In Berlin he studied Operngesang, and in 1986 he founded the Orchestra Palace together with Commititones.
Since then, the Bariton has established itself with its repertoire of strikers and chances in the style of the Comedian Harmonists.
He was awarded a number of prizes.
His live album from the "MTV Unplugd" series (2019) reached - just like his success album "For Women, this is no problem" (2013) - the second place of the charts.
He made it out of the nest in the main stream.
Always elegantly dressed, the blonde hair returned strictly and focused on labels, Max Raabe is no longer thinking of the current German-speaking music landscape.
With the program "Good day, good luck" it has been on tour. dpa since 2020.
Hello #NAME#, is it possible to get a small sample of the furniture?

Federal Ministry of construction Clara Geywitz: No new apartment is created by rent
The new Federal Ministry of Construction Klara Geywitz (SPD) has spoken against the refusal of large housing companies, as was required in Berlin in a referendum.
"With an appointment there is no single new apartment, it changes only the property structure," Geywitz said in an interview with the "day mirror" (Sunday).
My goal is to give tenants security that their rents remain payable in the coming years.
A low mix of private tenants, companies or housing companies, for example, is the best protection against monopolism.
In Berlin, the Coalition from the SPD, Green and Left Party wants to implement an expert committee on how to deal with the outcome of the referendum.
If the situation does not calm down, Geywitz did not immediately conclude talks with the FDP in the Ampel Coalition about further damages in the rental law.
The Coalition Treaty provides for a rental price threshold up to 2029, a limit of rent increases in adjacent housing markets and the expansion of the rent level.
I will speak with the Minister of Justice to implement it as soon as possible.
However, if the rental market does not slow down, "we will talk to the coalition partners about further steps", the SPD politician stressed.
Hello, I wanted to order something and I found out a few days later that I forgot the last step in the payment.

At least 100 deaths by Tornados in Kentucky
Many tornados have been taken by the United States in a worsening storm system.
Only in Kentucky could be more than 100 dead.
The pictures from there are reminiscent of a war zone.
On Saturday night, several tornados in the U.S. have been severely injured and may have required up to a hundred deaths.
The storm leaves about 120 km long snows of the desert, especially in the state of Glyed Kentucky.
His Governor Andy Beshear said after a visit to the disaster area, wherever the Tornado was crossed, everything was gone.
Houses, businesses, government buildings - just away.
Part of industrial facilities, roofs are in the trees.
It is hard to imagine that it is possible at all.
He counts only in the county of Kentucky with up to a hundred deaths, which increase the official figures per hour.
Hello, I just saw what Vitrine's sold #NAME#.
That's very bad.
Is it still produced?
Or has she been taken from the band?
Is it possible to order this vitamin in another country?
How long until you report?
If the delivery can't be done in my apartment, I have to cancel the order!
I understand that only I can order the deck now and let it be delivered to Germany which is in the shopping cart?
I had given back an article about the contact form or a return and wanted to ask if it was arrived or processed since I had not received confirmation yet.
Companies pay inflation premiums and change advertising
While the Federal Government continues to support proposals for an inflation premium, companies in Austria themselves have taken the initiative and offer their employees money premiums.
This is why they are on a line with the social partners ÖGB and the Chamber of Commerce which today require financial incentives for imputation.
The design of advertising solutions - according to Germany's model - will also increase the readiness for Corona impasses.
He's changed to a company about what he's been through.
That doesn't make his situation better than yours.
Wait and drink tea.
It's a year.
Of course, he did not openly stick to his old position and looked for something else.
You can do the same.
And that he didn't find you well at the time: no.
He didn't find his job well either.
There are too many variables.
Please remove the cancellation.
That will be legally relevant.

Help with your first campaign
Boron to the grey!
I'm just leading a group of 4 friends the adventure Over the Griffenpass and I want my heroes to immediately take a campaign written for the players.
We're playing DSA 5.
The big bug is made to write the weights and their motivations, inventing the individual acts, and now I am writing the entrance fee and prouder at the first counter about my own feet.
The premise is that the Heldes should bring a railway work with gardens of Gratenfels in a small village near the Thuran Sea.
That's where further action is to be developed.
Some miles away from the village are to take up a group of Goblins and lock them in a container.
I want to give the player characters the opportunity to solve the confrontation on various types: conviction, trafficking, threats, early recognition of the danger, which also always involves players.
Group strength: 8 ordinary goblins, 2 with spirals, 6 with bows and chairs
At no note, the Goblins hire the helden in a treadway and tend to each three left and right bend me to arm the drill while two with horns stop the drill.
If it comes to the fight and the hero gets down, I have two solutions.
1. All the heroes are unconscious and are subsequently found and healed by the son of the village officer, half of them.
The carrene is of course gone.
2. Should an undisclosed landing take place next to this half with two of his servants and the hero comes into the fight for help.
The cart's still there, everything's great.
How does your God hold ex machine of solution 2?
Is the accounter too many as an entry into the adventure?
The Goblins Group will later play a decisive role, so it is not just cannon feed.
EDIT: Wow, I didn't count on so many answers, especially with so many great suggestions and tips.
I will guarantee many of your ideas and now I have more confidence in my narrative.
I built the lamps again.
And then buried together.
Unfortunately, it still doesn't work.
That's why I'd like to send her back.
Then you can let the back come, then I can pack the lamp and bring it to #PRS_ORG#.

Will everything be repeated again or just part of the store?
I'm excited about Sky Sport F1
Hello, dear F1 fans, over the season, the quality of the German Sky has been increasingly taken away, so I want to make a little air with this post.
For the first time, the transfer was interrupted in the middle of the F2 race to allow the F1 report to begin at the moment.
Although it was due to the delayed start and the start-up of the schedule far behind the planning, it was still possible to show the last ten minutes (planned) and the master’s decision (!).
It seems, however, that for legal reasons F1 had to take precedence and therefore have to limit everything else, so Sky DE probably had no choice here.
Despite the stupidity, as usual Sky UK has transferred the race to the bottom.
However, a small lobby: the commentor Olivier Zwartyes has well accompanied the difficult situation about the serious accident.
Then there was regular knowledge in the F1 again at the commenters Sascha Roos and Ralf Schumacher, so they both didn't know that under a red flag you can change the tires.
Although this situation had already occurred in Imola, Baku and Silverstone this year, both came to the conclusion that forgets may change the lines when there were relevant functional speeches on this subject at Hamilton.
At Sky UK as well as RTL, both commentators knew immediately that there was this possibility to forget.
I am of the opinion that such elemental rules should simply be known if you comment on the F1 with a pay-TV transmitter.
It is also not the first wheel rates that are now possible or prescribed according to rules, both have simply constant uncertainty about rules.
In general, it does not like the style of a favorite comment by Roos, but let it be said that the taste is the case.
But that's where I really like Heiko Water better than RTL.
To this end, persistent habits that make both simply unprofessional work, such as ordering coffee at the (believing) reporter Peter Hardenacke or "NewHD" by Ralf Schumacher.
Recently, there is a lot of uncertainty in the comment that he does not take this apparently seriously.
Not least does the advertising simply take over with Sky, in the run, Sky is the only transmitter who goes into the advertising, as you can listen to F1TV, since only the German tonspur has to come out without a comment after the race.
Neither ServusTV nor ORF do it.
They also make these two transmitters in the trainings less advertising than Sky, and that as free TV transmitter.
Although you have to praise Glock and tree gardeners for their work, it's all I can't think about.
The other program of Sky Sport F1 is also very necessary and full recovery.
Overall, Sky is really the worst German-speaking transmitter who transmits the F1.
Unironic RTL makes up to the advertising a better job at the four races they can still transfer.
In any case, the large F1 season makes much less fun than it would be possible with a reasonable sender.
I'd be interested in your opinion once.
Here: #PRS_ORG# pendant light, measuring and multi-coloured glass x 1
Hello, I have an article that should be delivered last week and that is not yet delivered.
I've contacted the chat twice, and so far nothing.
The first Lady told me it would be sent on Monday, the second Lady told me yesterday that she would check and send an e-mail and she never answered.
Hello, I ordered two #PRS_ORG# on 12.12.19.
One of them has already identified a defect after relatively short time (the substance has a hole in the front part of the chair).
I'm asking for support.
Air pumps are excellent to provide an additional aquarium with oxygen.
It is also possible to operate a filter system over airheber.
This series is offered in 3 variants by us.
Look at the end of the offer in the table.
There you can see the services in comparison.
If the pumps are strong enough, you can operate all installations.
If you have a large aquarium, pumps are suitable with 2 or more outputs so that you can connect more electricity.
The MK series has one, two or four exits, each according to the model air pumps, but also offers to place an accent in the aquarium, e.g. with an air front (see us in the shop) or with a decoration that turns air bubbles into a function.
Here would be a treasure trust, muscle or something like that.
The MK series has a special, dedicated construction and thus provides for low operating noise.
The installation is very simple.
The air pump will be connected through an aerospace 4/6 mm to an austromer or... and it can already be released.
The air pump should be equal to or higher than the water level and be taken out.
If the air pumps are deeper than the water condition, you should set up a drop-off valve between them.
Simply cut the air hole and place the valve between it.
This would prevent if the water were to run back and forth, which runs the water from the basin through the pump...
If the air pumps are released, you should also be covered and protected from moisture as other air pumps
The MK series pumps are clean power packages that consume little energy
Even if we specify here the processing time with 3 days in ebay, the packages will be packaged every day, and the packages will also be stored here every day.
Run along the way, it's going very fast.
We just want to pretend a little bit, so nobody's agreed, just because it once lasted a little longer.
It would be so, everyone doesn't understand all the employees who work in shipping beings... of course don't keep Corona here.
Please do not assess the same bad because the delivery is delayed, which is only available on package services.
Of course you like these services, even if we say at the moment, they've been fucking hard.
This is also a very different region.
Be no one bad, stay healthy and we all hope that there will be better times as well.
How long does it take to order the gels with and without arms?
Can you order the legs in the light here?
Amazon founder Bezo sends astronaut daughter and moderator into the world
The daughter of the first American in all, a TV moderator and four other passengers have taken a short trip into the world space.
They were transported on Saturday by the "New Shepard" rocket system of the company Blue Origin by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.
The start and landing of the approximately ten-minute flight took place in the west of the state of Texas.
Under the bright blue sky, Bezos personally took the freshly cut astronauts after their return to heaven.
"Welcome back," said Bezos, dressed in a blue robe when he opened the Luke at the Capsule.
Under the appeal of friends, family members and workers from Blue Origin, the six passengers walked out and surrounded the Amazoners.
According to Blue Origin, they were ten minutes and 13 seconds along the way and reached a height of 107 kilometers.
The 74-year-old Laura Shepard Churchley, daughter of the 1961 Nasa Astronauts to All Flighted Alan Shepard (1923-1998), named after Blue Origin's rocket system, and the 50-year TV Moderator Michael Strahan were honored guests of the company, who had paid for their tickets by other four passengers: space carrier Dylan Taylor, Investor Evan Dick, Technology entrepreneur Lane Bes and his son Cameron.
No matter how much they paid for their ticket, Blue Origin did not share it.
Laura Shepard Churchley recalled after the short flight to her father's mission.
He's got to work hard and do everything himself.
She just flew off like that, said the 74-year-olds with a laugh.
Michael Strahan was also excited.
He'd be back at least once again to All, said the moderator.
"New Shepard" flies up to 100 kilometers high
The "New Shepard" rocket system is widely automated.
During the flight from the rocket, the capsule was able to reach a height of about 100 kilometers across the earth, temporarily free of gravity, before the re-useable object was retraced by large floodscreens again.
The International Air Connection and many other experts see 100 kilometers across the earth as a border to the world, but there is no binding international arrangement.
It was already the third manned all-out of Blue Origin: At the first time in July, Amazon Founder Bezos was on board himself, along with his brother Mark, an 82-year-old former US pilot and an 18-year-old Dutch national.
On the second day in October, the 90-year-old Canadian actor William Shatner was world famous for his role as "Captain Kirk" in "Star Trek", in addition to former Nasa engineer Chris Boshuizen, entrepreneur Glen de Vries and the leading head of Blue Origin, Audrey Powers.
Critics advocates Bezos and Blue Origins to move the business with global tourism largely without scientific research interests for the benefit of mankind and without regard to the climate.

Someone who worked in biochemistry or studied biochemistry
I'm currently studying biochemistry in the first semester, and I find the experience really very exciting and I don't mind being in the lab (I already have the organic chemistry practice behind me).
Of course, I have already informed myself before the study on job prospects, but I still thought what I would like to study until the promotion.
At present, however, I have doubts, especially stressing my career prospects.
On one side (Studycheck etc) you always hear super job opportunities again and the job has been completely searched, on the other side you hear again of unemployed biologists and incredibly badly paid jobs.
That's why I'd really be interested:
1) When do you work at the moment?
2) Are you satisfied with your work/age?
3) What have you studied/What training have you done?
4) Would you do it all again?
Thank you for your answers!
I am currently really insecure and overhaul in 2022 if possible to cancel the study and make training for a specialist computer.
If you've been able to write the same experiences :)
Extra stress before holidays & holidays weekends
This topic came up with me last week.
But now I had to use my long weekend to relax.
That's why it's just a pivot.
Not just before big holidays, such as Christmas holidays, there is great stress in our business.
It looks like there's the same thing before the holidays plus Fridays.
It was this way: Last week Maria Heavenfart was named after us in Switzerland.
On Friday, most people and businesses make a day of spring, which is therefore semi-official.
So it was a long four-day weekend in the house last week.
So what happened last week?
Over Stress.
Listener e-mails, which are not required to leave before departure, order here order there, everything *unconditioned* before the long weekend.
Because... and because?
Because "the next week then" sounds so long and it can't be?
Or is it because people want to spend as much time as they want in a week?
Not only was I stressed on Wednesday, but I was also strongly alarmed.
What should this self-reliance be done about holidays?
So why do we still have holidays if we can't afford them?!
The stress wasn't well-known from above, the colleagues were all so self-evident.
My question is simple: Are we just the Swiss?
Is this our reformed evangelical kind?
Or do you know that in the north?
Yvonne Catterfeld enjoys Christmas in Thuringen
Yvonne Catterfeld (42) enjoys Christmas in her home of Thuring - but still has no gifts.
"The beauty, even if there should be no snow in Erfurt, then you just go to Ilmenau in the Thuring Forest," said the actor and singer Het Radio FFF.
She'll vote for the party by kicking and banging with her son's son.
"I love it," said Catterfeld.
Until the likely days, however, they have something else to do: "For the first time I have no gift, I have to finally release."

Unfortunately not working yet
DDR manual model Altbau E-Lok E 95 03 DRG/DR, which was in Schlesien and Central Germany in use, which is very rare from the modelling proposal ME Heft 11/1968, is used with toys and parts see photos, function well, The Baureeihe E 95 is a heavy-duty electric motor of the German Reichsbahn Society (DRG), which has been designed for the treatment of heavy carbon crops on the Schlesic network, which may also be produced by the small series company ZSCHUTCHCHKE and BACHMANN.
A Lokomotive is located in the DB Museum Hall (Saale) and we are fully designed
The German Reichsbahn company had commissioned the AEG in 1924 to provide proposals for an electric motor that could carry 2,200-tonnes and 530-tonnes passenger trains at 45 km/h on this route.
The maximum speed was 65 km/h.
Thus, in March 1926 the DRG determined the delivery as 1'Co+Co1' Lokomotive with Tatzlager Drive AEG with the delivery of the mechanical part, the Siemens Schucker works with the electric part.
From December 1927 to June 1928, the delivery of six Lokomotives received operating numbers E 95 01-06.
They all crossed the Second World War and then found themselves on the territory of the later DDR.
In 1946 the Lokomotics arrived as repair aid in the Soviet Union.
They returned to Germany until November 1952.
In the Desau Reichsbahn railway repair work, the refurbishment of all six lokomotives was established.
[4] As a result of the growing re-electrification of the medium-sized German network, a growing demand for Lokomotives for heavy goods service was met in 1959, the three Lokomots E 95 01 to E 95 03 were developed and the other machines served as replacement parts.
Firstly, the preferred E 04, E 44 and E 94 in larger sections were built.
Only when E 94 was considered that the number of jobs could not be increased further, E 95 returned to the point of employment.
[4]The Lokomotives were stationed in Leipzig-Wahren railways.
They arrived in 1960 at the Halle P.
They were used in their own turn plan mainly in front of carbon dioxide from the gas line towards Halle, Leipzig and Erfurt.
Problemically, with increasing age, the complex control of the Lokomotives was demonstrated.
Thus it became more and more apparent that protection would remain intact when dealing with fraud.
Then the driver on this lokomotive constantly had to solve the protection during the journey with Hammer and woodkeil.
Motor injuries were more frequent and resulted in monthly accidents at the Lokomotive.
[5] Since the end of the 1960s were sufficiently modern and a significant expansion of the power plant was not planned at that time, the rich route could be confined to old lokomotives and most distributions, so that E 95 was provided out of service.
In addition, they found that the German Reichsbahn wanted to own electric motors only individually, which had caused a problem in the training operation due to the above difficulties with the machines and the attitudes of the driver.
[5] After the removal of E 95 02 and E 95 03 in mid- 1969, they were followed as the last E 95 01, which ended the service on 5 October 1970.
The proposed new name 255 001 was therefore not used.
Up to E 95 02, all of the Lokomotives were damaged.
The E 95 02 was installed as a replacement for the future museum slomotive E 77 10 as a weyheizan plant at the main train station.
It took some time until the authorities on the Rich Road were convinced that the E 95 as a museum locker.
In 1979 the first external construction of the Lokomotive was started with the aim of presenting it to a vehicle view in RAW Dessau.
[5] It has since been part of the Dresden Transport Museum as a non-operable museum lockout.
1986 followed the internal completion of the Lokomotive.
In the DB Museum Hall (Sale), the Lokomotive Museum is located.
Since 1995, employees of the traditional community Bw Halle P have been working on the production of Lokomotive.
In April 2015, the Lokomotive was first able to present a exhibition in the Museum-Bw Arnstadt with new internal and external lacquering, where the transformers were tested and five drivers were capable of operating.
-The Lokomotics stood on the Schleschen mountain road and the two-way sideways in use until 1945, where they were guaranteed on the basis of their reliable drive and low maintenance costs.
In February 1945 the machines were shut down after Leipzig to the middle German network.
The main area of employment was first closed
Handwork model H0 in OVP, good function, there are optical after-work at the Lok in own-work, fitted, with toys, Kellergerich!!!!, very rare handwork model, very small load-which is also the basis of the small series company ZSCHUTCHKE and BACHMANN
The packages can show labels and stock traces.
Yes, the F parts are there.
I got a bed from you.
However, there were some problems.
The middle bar will be held by two feet..other these are too small and the bar cannot be mounted on the feet.
What are we doing now?
I can't build the bed.
The middle bar is held by two feet, which are unfortunately produced by mistake.
The medium bar does not fit in the pre-filled state.
So I'll get another suit.
When are they sent out?
No flashing.
That is, according to the assembly manual the right form, they were just too small
But that's not true.
The main thing they do is to fulfill their purpose.
They're not flat at me.
Can I get this?
Hello #NAME#, should I explain the problem to you again?
Home fire with two light damages and high damage
Two people have been slightly damaged by a fire in a house in Oberbayern.
In addition, a estimated damage has occurred in the six-year euro area, as reported by the police on Sunday.
The fire had probably spread from a carport to the adjacent house in Kinsau (Landkreis Landsberg am Lech).
Two residents were subsequently taken to the hospital on Sunday with mild smoking.
The exact brandurishe was not known at first, but the police did not go out of a preliminary fire.
The Kripo Fürstenfeldbruck has taken over the further findings.
But it'll come a long time later.
And I have to pay the shipping costs again.
To get out of the field news - Biontech-CEO published impmp photo
Ujör Şahin published a photo of his first impounding early 2021 on the social network "LinkedIn"
Biontech Chief Ujör Şahin had not yet publicly exposed himself to his infection status.
Now the entrepreneur published a photo showing his Corona impinging.
The illness of a friend moved him to share Şahin with him.
The CEO and co-founder of the Mainzer company Biontech, Ujör Şahin, published a photo showing how he gets an infection against the Coronavirus.
In the social media, there were false information that I was probably not involved.
In fact, my wife and I have received 3 doses of Biontech pfizer vaccine," Şahin wrote on Friday in a contribution to the network "LinkedIn".
"For a few months, friends have forced me to post a photo of me on which I will be forced to resist these false lies."
So far he has rejected it because communication should not be about himself.
But a call last week changed his opinion: "I was deeply hurt when I learned that an old school friend now fought for his life.
He's been fighting a serious covid-19 cancer and has been dependent on an operation device for three weeks.
The schoolmate and his family were not impressed, Şahin continued to write.
He didn't ask for the reasons.
"The most common cause, however, seems to be fear, which is often threatened by misinformation and misunderstandings."
Fear only makes it hard to fight facts, sometimes it is better to share personal experiences.
On the Internet, an interview with the German Welle, in which Ujör Şahin says he was not impressed.
However, the video was created in December 2020, as well as the German Welle himself explained.
"We are currently legally not allowed to get the vaccine itself," said Şahin at the time.
In Germany, priority is given to the introduction of the vaccine.
In the meantime, priority has been raised for a long time - and the Biontech chief has been able to receive appropriate data three times.
Fire in space station: tens of thousands of people without electricity
In several municipalities in North Rhine-Westphalia the light came out on Friday morning: no more electricity and in many cases there was no heating.
A fire had lit a refuelling station.
After a fire with serious damage in a space station, tens of thousands of people in the Rhine-Weg-Creis in North Rhine-Westphalia have to go out for about 24 hours without electricity.
On Friday evening, 41,000 affected residents and residents in several communities were literate.
The supplier Westnetz reported that on Saturday many nostrological aggregates were in operation until the major disturbance could finally be fully resolved on the late evening.
Firemen and helper and helper workers of the THW provided support in the municipalities.
The authorities offered care in schools and called for help from neighboring countries.
The provider thanked those concerned for their patience and for their assistance.
We are very aware that the last 24 hours have brought considerable restrictions.
We are also grateful to the municipalities concerned, the circle, the firewalls and the THW for the uninterrupted use," said Prime Minister Florian Witt, in a statement on Saturday evening.
The repair of the damage will continue to take place for a few days, as the Westnetz monteurs were able to take some instructions only temporarily back into operation, he said.
A technical defect led to the fire.
Stream Reflows
The fire fired on Friday at 19.15 p.m. has significantly damaged Westnetz's data in the Neunkirchen-Sealscheid Space Station.
Cleaning and repair work is needed.
At the same time, a connection was created to a 30,000 volt voltage level.
With this bypass, the power supply is up again.
Since Saturday 18 o'clock, over 21,000 people in Much and Ruppichteroth have had electricity again.
Other 20,000 residents of Neunkirchen-Sielscheid have been gradually activated from 21.30 a.m.
Since 23.15 a.m., the last power has been affected by the explosion.
Over 80 Mounts of Westnettz and partner companies have been in use.
The authorities had also called for emergency supplies for important buildings on Saturday.
"It is important now that citizens and citizens care for older or independent people in their neighbourhood and communicate with local fire-fighting facilities if necessary," Landrat Sebastian Schuster (CDU) said after a crisis.
In the construction and operation of notstrogmag aggregates, in particular the residents of old homes were in focus.
In addition, temporary care centres were established in schools according to authorities, for those who were unable to care for themselves or for those who were required to provide medical care by the power-dependent medical devices.
Good day!
Unfortunately, the deck in Germany is sold.
Can I buy those with you and pay in euro?
It's about the day cover #PRS_ORG# in blue.
I hope you also have a beautiful day and stay healthy . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
But I can't mount it on the desk.
It's a custom #NAME#.
There are 3 of them.
We wanted those with table plates through #NUMBER#
We got 155cm diameter.
Today my #PRS_ORG# came in, but I can't sign it and thus cut it.
Can you help me out there?
Otherwise I had to send her back because she's not suitable for the purpose otherwise.
I'd be glad to come back.
Yeah, that's really easy!
Then let's do it!
Can you send me the return card by mail?
The repair is over now.
I've tried this before the chat.
Before the purchase, however, I didn't start the E-#PRS_ORG# new.
Should I do it now?
I think I'm almost unchallenged by such a low spelling.
That's why we don't agree.

In order to make the paint order equal and clean, you should clean the components with some soapy water of dust, fat and fingerprints, wash them with clear water and dry them off.
Before you first bring the brush with a new color on the model, it is recommended to practice 2 to 3 strings.
You can do this on the later visible inside of the building or on a yoghurt.
The first string of the component
Draw the brush equal to the string next to the string.
Light coating of colour sheets later ensures a level playing field.
Avoid rushing into and her whiskey with the brush.
This creates unrealisticly effective areas.
A model is not gardening.
Start with the bright colors.
The dark ones might otherwise have appeared later.
Metaltones and metallic colors come to an end with a separate brush.
Otherwise, it can come to an unpleasant metal painting when it blends with normal colors.
Let the painted parts dry for a day before you build them.
Originally reliable appearances reach the models by the Decals or drawing images.
From high-speed signs on aircraft over ship names to destinations and signs on car models: The Decals give the model the last skip.
Bring the Decals into the right order as long as the components are still in good shape.
An aircraft cockpit can be covered or lighter before it is built into the hole.
Even more important than the right tool, such as chairs, pinzets and toothbrushes, are at the time, patience and a calm hand.
Cut out every required Decal individually and let it fit you.
Decals are also known as water slides because you quickly cool their backside with water until the carrier paper is dark by the nose.
Then you move the image only a small piece of paper and place the piece on the corresponding position on the model (which you have also washed before).
While holding the Decal on the model with a tool, you draw the carrier paper away side by side.
Attention: Always check if the image is sitting right before you completely roll it out of the paper so it doesn't hang on your finger, cut or even shake.
Drink excess water with a budget.

Child benefit treatment at PKV / What is a "insurance case"?
Hello together,
We were in childhood treatment for some time, now that it's about breaking up with the PKV, it suddenly stops.
_Line numbers:
We had applied for childcare in front of the PKV and were given 3 attempts.
The tests were not limited in any way (e.g. timeframes, success, etc.).
The first attempt led directly to successful pregnancy and birth and was calculated with the PKV.
Some time later we tried to get a second child, and led 2 (failure) attempts, but they were not yet calculated with the PKV.
We called for recosting at the PKV and received 3 further tests.
After some further trials (we have carried out more than we have said, logically calculate the most expensive with the PKV) we get the calculations at the PKV and get the worst surprise: instead of 5 trials (2+3), the PKV will only replace 3 trials.
Reason: With pregnancy/birth, the other 2 attempts of the first commitment are made.
The second child is a new insurance case.
According to AGB, however, "The insurance case starts with treatment, it ends when treatment needs no longer exist."
The questions to the experts in the round are as follows:
* Who has the right here to replace the PKV (only 3 attempts will be replaced) or we (there are 5 attempts to replace)?
* Should the PKV have indicated to us in our commitments that further trials will occur with a birth?
* Is the desire for a second child really a new insurance case?
The infertility (conditioned by closed needles) is not achieved by the first child.
It would be great if the experts here would give your opinion.
Thank you so much for your help!
Can you let me get the three options by email and tell me how I'll get them back to the best.
All right.
We're not gonna order anything else with them.
If they add the translations from me and my friend #NAME# (the same address), they have obviously lost good customers.
They may wish to continue this with their manager.
This is not competitive.
Yesterday, the colleague told me that the payment was made and now you tell me I have to send it back.
I don't think I can do anything to get the comemode completely destroyed by me.
Please see in the screenshot what the colleague wrote.
There is clear and clear that the refund has been paid and I have not yet received a refund per #PRS_ORG#
You can tell your manager that they've lost two tribal customers now.
My friend also ordered various furniture for our apartment through his account.
We're not gonna do that anymore.
No, the defect was reported only after a few months.
A desk must maintain a normal use.
Otherwise they can't sell him as an office.
Regardless of this, the 24-month insurance is valid.
No, it's not possible for me to create another kind of packaging.
I'm going to go down and make it available to the transport company.
Good day, I have a question about your series of #PRS_ORG#
These products will be purchased with additional hockers, but we cannot find them with you.
Can they help?
Week Theme: The Best Low Budget Films
What a low-budget film is right, there is no general definition with precise budget limits.
Wikipedia has the following to say:
>A **low-budget film** or **low-budget film** is a motion picture shot with little to no finding from a major film studio or private investor.
On the network you can find enough lists of low-budget films like zB on letterboxd.com.
Do you know any interested representatives of this category?
What's going on with you?
And maybe you don't like it at all?
In a very good customer of you, 2 apartments have already been fully equipped with your furniture.
He wanted to ask for the best price for the grey leather sofa Odelle.
The delivery time has now been renewed once more, is it now reliable?
Thank you very much.

Unfortunately nothing changes at the waiting position...I'll be back soon because it just doesn't work here.
Hello
"Halber victory" against Belarus with high costs for the EU
In conflict with the Belarusian regime, the EU can announce a "half victory" to political expert Raphael Bossong.
However, the costs were very high and significant violations of the rights of migrants and refugees to Belarus" border with Poland and Lithuania, Bossong said to the evangelical press service (e.g.).
The EU has consistently failed to address the confrontation, stated the researcher at the Berlin Foundation for Science and Policy (SWP).
This state of affairs - Belarus is not very small, but the EU seems to be a winner - it may go on for a long time.
The treatment of people at the border was not in accordance with the European Convention on Human Rights, according to Bossong.
It is obvious that there is a "increasing normalisation of pushbacks" by individual EU governments.
Since the EU as a whole does not decide against it, this goes at the cost of fundamental rights.
At the same time, this development weakens the Union's cohesion.
"It cannot be implemented openly if a Member State is in charge of doing its work," as is the case with Poland, which does not even allow EU Border Protection Agency Frontex to access the border.
In addition, the EU paid a further price for its policy at the border with Belarus, Bossong: a basic agreement on asylum policy will be difficult as the line "border protection, border protection and border protection" has been strengthened.
Renewal of border crossings
According to Poland's Border Protection, therefore, migrants have again tried to reach Belarus in Poland.
55 migrants were arrested at night on Sunday and returned to the border, said a speaker from the authorities on Sunday.
The Polish officials were immediately defeated by the migrants with stones in the case of Czeremsza.
As a result, a soldier was found in the face and had to be medically provided by a military doctor.
Overall, the border protection 52 registered border crossings tested within 24 hours.
On Friday evening, a group of 28 migrants had crossed the border barriers.
Thousands of people from such countries as Iraq and Afghanistan have crossed or attempted the border between Belarus and the EU in recent months.
The EU proposes that Alexander Lukaschenko, as head of power in Minsk, have joined them with the prospect of entering the EU.
Poland and Lithuania regularly received press reports following border crossings.
The EU penalized Belarus and safe airlines, bringing migrants and refugees into the country.
In addition, EU Commissioners travel to people's countries of origin to join them.
The most effective element of the EU's response was the pressure on the airlines, Bossong said.
"The EU has thus abandoned its market power in the Waagscals and has demonstrated its determination to operate with hard gangs and extra-territorial sanctions."
Mensk must also take into account internal political costs.
The Belarusian society may not have been determined by the fact that the security equipment regularly closed thousands of people across the country.
Mercedes protests after controversial formula-1-finals
Max forgets should have taken two regular breaks during the race in view of Mercedes.
Abu Dhabi - After the controversial formula-1 finale of Abu Dhabi, Mercedes filed a complaint.
The silver rings are mixed with two rules in the last great prize of the year.
A protest refers to a common failure of Max forgets in Red Bull in the last safety-car phase, when he should have been regularly overdue.
A second claim was filed against the value at the end of the race.
According to Mercedes, the protocol was not followed on a regular basis.
The last round of Lewis Hamilton was still missing in Mercedes and was addressed to his first formula-1 title.
The manoeuvre followed shortly after the end of a safety-car phase in which the Netherlands had been driving ahead of him.
I'll check it out.
I'll talk to the bank and report to you again.
Thank you for your support.

But I'm sorry just because he says he's not anti-Semitting doesn't mean anything.
It's like if an afdler says he doesn't have anything against foreigners.
Your i won't be given both.
But colleagues are constantly reproducing some anti-semitic messages.
If you want to distance yourself, you should just let it go.
Well, where then you're less serious than your colleague.
Those who seriously question the basic question of Evolution are simply completely lost.
I mean, a god has brought it all in.
But as soon as you're a creator, you have to believe that the earth is 10,000 years old and science is nothing but a mystery.
And that's why you're a science enemy and don't take any more stress like college.
To get an optimal field of sight, the Lupe should be eaten as close as possible to the eye.
The specially designed aplatic-acromatic lens system allows you to use a practical assurance and color error-free use of the lupe to the range.
Commonly, leads with zooming curves are marked.
However, these data only apply to specific conditions which rarely meet the conditions of use.
To be able to use your Lupe optimally, please note the instructions in the "Technical Data" table (see package leaflet).
On the lens surfaces of all optical devices, even when plug-ins - light-flexes occur.
These mirrors are significantly reduced by an anti-reflective layer.
When compliance with optimal conditions of use - Lupe close to the eye - mirroring on the lens surfaces are less accurate.

Dental sale in beautiful forest: In the municipality Krembz women look for Christmas trees
Landwirt Frank Animals has already experienced such a curious situation in the dental shop.
One time a man should even be away without his partner back home because they couldn't get some.
Every year he plants good 2000 pieces for it.
The 56-year-old has already experienced such a sad situation.
That makes the prenatal time always a little fun, he says.
And that's with the good news?
Otherwise I'm gone as a customer?!
I have always received a defective delivery and now pay the full price for it.
Then I'll evaluate it accordingly!
We do not need any discussions here about the better court, but there is a certain similarity between the two.
Both are made of meat that is grilled at a spinal cord.
And they both have their names.
In Germany a equivalent may be such as the "Dreher", which may not sound so nice at all.
Problems with glass phaser + Devolo DLan/Magic
We've had a new glass phase connection in the house for a few weeks.
I'm sorry I'm having trouble building a stable Wifi network now.
Previously I had a DSL 50 Mbit connection and used Devolo DLan, which has received up to a few cases free of charge 50 Mbit and issued it.
The new glass phase connection sends 500 Mbit to the FritzBox 7590 and to the DLan module connected to the FritzBox.
However, the other DLan module, which sends Wifi no more than 500 completes, but I keep leaving the house with the module, which is less likely (so use a single dose that is 1, 2, 3, etc. space away from the other module).
This means that the internet with the new glass phase connection is even slower than before (\~45 Mbit).
I also ordered a new Devolo Magic set, which seems to be using a new technology.
This was slightly better than the DLan, but there were similar losses here.
Can anyone explain to me why with glass phaser so much internet speed over the power direction "lost"?
And is LAN really the solution?
It would be extremely exciting to be in the house of LAN cable.
I'm really confused about why I've created an extra account here.
That is why I would like to hear more about an answer.
When it is time to change the giro account
Anyone who had thought that now that it was the first time peace was at the girocounts, looks confused.
While many banks have used the autumn to confirm with all their customers the tax increases in the past, the free amounts for negatives continue to decline.
The German Bank, for example, considered a limit of 100,000 euros to be relatively large.
Now she has doubled the amount of her freedom once and even benefited from the daily wage.
In the first step, the limit was reduced only for customers of the Group Sparte Postbank – at EUR 50,000 in Giro and plant accounts and at EUR 25,000 for daily accounts.
In the meantime, however, these lower amounts apply to the entire German Bank, as confirmed by a speaker on request.
And although not only for new contracts, but also for "new individual agreements with file customers".
The Commercial Bank had already gone down to a limit of 50,000 euros, which is still valid, as in ING Germany.
The direct bank DKB, which was popular for the most cost-conscious customers, has reduced the free amounts to two levels, initially at EUR 50,000, and now at EUR 25,000.
However, more than 100 banks still have a free amount of EUR 25,000 or less according to the number of the Verivox Internet portal.
The Sparda Bank Berlin has also reached EUR 25,000. However, there is still a legal replacement with the consumer centres that have received the law before the Court of First Instance in Berlin against this regulation.
It is now discussed in the banks whether the institutions should be able to form returns - in the case that the superior authorities must also explain the negatives in principle for implausible reasons and pay back many millions to bank customers.

Jennifer Aniston employs a whole beauty army
She's now officially at Hollywood's top.
But your life is like a mountain and a talf.
Jennifer Aniston (52) was chosen by the U.S. magazine "The Hollywood Reporter" to be the most influential woman of the year.
For those who made 2021 with the "friends" reunification and the continuation of their series "The Morning Show" Furore, this success is primarily the result of many disciplines and work.
She looks like a whole army of assistants, stylists and coaches.
Anyway, as Aniston said, she got a chip on the day (yes, really: a one-sided chip out of her mouth).
The fact that you add the hearts of men and women to the hearts of men is indeed a miracle.
Maybe because she's just got lucky - and she's still looking for great love.
And the baby boy from the list.
Before she was constantly asked if she would now be a mother.
That hurt her.
People who asked about it have no idea what's happening to me personally, medically, why I can't.
It was really bad.
It remains to be hoped that success and peace will make you happy too.
Undeterred End of a Career: Countdowns must be given
Kimi Räikkönen's distinction from formula 1 was even lower than thought.
Abu Dhabi - The 42-year-old Finn pulled out the gloves and disappeared the sweat of the storm.
That's it.
After a driver's error and a slight band transfer, wealthy men had to give up his Alpha Romeo at the great price of Abu Dhabi after not even half of the interest rate.
It was his 349th and last great prize, which "Iceman" finished his career in the motor sports kingdom class.
His wife, Minttu, and the two children also traveled to the United Arab Emirates.
The greatest success of the empire was the 2007 World Championship in Ferrari.
He created 21 Grand Prix victory, started 18 times from the Pole and came 103 times on the podium. dpa
Friedrich holds 60. World Cupsieg - Nolte wins in Biierbob - Sport
The brand of the Norwegian Biathlet Ole Einar Björndalen with 94 successes is the goal of the Bobpilot.
"I've calculated it once, I had to run out of victory by season nine and a half, then I could make it up to Cortina 2026," said the double-Olympianist from the BSC Oberberberenburg, who was both successful in the winterberg race in two days.
First on Saturday he rejected the attack by Johannes Lochner about five hundred stations, where he spent three times a day from Rank.
Then he changed something at the material setting and came out on Sunday with 0.30 seconds of greater origin.
With his team Thorsten Margis (SV Hall), Candy Bauer (BSC Oberberberenburg) and Alexander Schüller (SV Hall), he sat in front of the British Brad Hall.
The third was the Austrian Benjamin Maier.
"We have gone greater risk today and have been rewarded," said Friedrich, who also imported his 22nd victory into series.
Johannes Lochner, who was driving for Stuttgart, arrived at a place two times this time at five.
Christoph Hafer from BC Bad Feilnbach landed at Rank four in the first race.
"If I knew what he was doing otherwise, I'd do the same," Lochner said.
Nolte with home page - Podium for Jamanka
In the women, Laura Nolte held the third season in her home.
After the first day in Monobob only for the fourth place, on Sunday at the German trifache follow-up with Archipelago Deborah Levi to the World Cup.
Two-Bob Olympic winner Mariama Jamanka from the BRC Thuringen came with Germany's fastest Sprinterin, Alexandra Burghardt from Burghausen, to rank two.
In addition to her Olympic Qualification, she bought the first podest place in this winter.
The Wiesbadener Kim Kalicki landed with Leonie Fiebig at three.
For me it was supercool, the first podest place in the world Cup, I'm superhappy that Mariama takes me along.
I'm super-satisfied with development.
There is still much potential at the start, but the start times were okay today," Burghardt said, "It's not just shopping, but there's also much to do about here."
Jamanka was a little proud of the not-so-free journeys, but said, "It goes in the right direction".
I already had the blanket in the cart and could buy it now!!!
What am I supposed to do?
I didn't get it anyway, so I couldn't solve it either why I finally asked for it.
Through Corona last year I had other problems and never had time for it.
And now he was running out of something that really bothered me.
Look at the chat it's about the Asare Sitzbank.
I want to give it back and then order again, because it is just reduced :)
Why is the shipment only started on 16.3.
There was nothing from such a long delivery time on your website
Not until I step up a extra field with the message
I'd be taken from your colleague yesterday.
Why is this a problem today?
I also sent you images from the wrong goods.
But we want the regular module, even a new unharmed
And don't break the whole order.
Just this day, just this week, just until XY...
Hello loves great girls and girls and women,
I've got something I just want to write and maybe it's going to be the same...
I'm 24, have kPTBS, full-time student and dog-mamma - since my dog doesn't scream or goes into the children's garden he's actually 1 to 1 to my child.
My friend (since 6J together) is sick, has had a burning 2nd grade on Monday and has been depressed for years (but now in therapy).
Yesterday I visited him because I also had emotional needs and because I wanted to see him and feel him, we kissed him a lot and it was nice.
I helped him shower (because hand is in connection with wg burning).
He's cooled up above and we're seeing less (1-2x week) what makes me very creative with my needs after pleasure and love.
My dog's just got wet, I bought it for him and now he's in his kitchen and he's been a little restless after I was with the heat pump and he was there.
I live alone with my sister and my mother, and she's just gone for a month.
Now there is still work to do with us, which we naturally share.
But even cooking is just a lot of work for me...
My PTBS disease is just quite well established, I'm half-treated and come right.
Not good, but I'm right and I'm almost free of symptoms.
My Union just needs a lot (for me) tomorrow at 15h I've done a written test for which I haven't done anything and overnight anatomy hours for which I should have prepared at least a little.
And next week I have an oral examination on Tuesday, and what happens then is in my calendar and not in my head because there's no room anymore.
So my week goes like this: Just until morning, it's weekend.
But then it's all going on?
Just until the day of birth.
It's just until vacation.
Just until weekend.
Just until...
And so it goes on forever.
I think I'm just so stressed that I need these spiritual points because otherwise I'm packing it down.
Somewhere I feel guilty and "chatistic," but otherwise I don't make it...
Is that what you're doing?
Honestly, I'm so grateful that I don't have to work.
I can't really thank you for that.
I don't know if I had survived my kptbs otherwise.
I think it's also partly something to do with women's mental load, and so I thought I'd find some kind of pain in here...
In any case, I would like you to have another relaxing night, the week is almost over!
I've got my order today, I'm sorry, the whole other color plus surface is torn and tablestone has print.
The first delivery was the same color as on the website.
We are very disappointed!!!!!
What can you offer me?
If we're going to get the table now, I'll get another color or what?
The mail to be deleted was sent on 26.12.#NUMBER#.
The other two times.
But she wasn't confirmed.
Once everything else was completely different: I then found in school that many religious teachers don't believe in God and it's just another profession for them like Mathe or Earth Customers.
For me it was always something rare, perhaps also because I was Christian and I have always believed in it.
How are you?
You may also be able to tell your colleagues about different attitudes.
Basically I understand the difference between private and professional and it is reasonable to distinguish.
There is also a learning plan, etc.
But it was also very rare to have a physicist who does not believe in the theory of relativity.
What makes one want to teach religion if you don't believe it?
Is culture true or something?
Hope your question isn't too private.
Can't be changed or not? Writing English I understand it well too
It's been a long time, then I'd like to see it.
That's good, thank you.
I'm waiting for a return notice by the beginning of next week.
Thank you for your support #NAME#.
Please help us find a movie.
Hello, dear People,
I'm looking for a movie from my childhood (in 24).
I think it's been a movie for young people.
In the film there are two times (or parallels).
To one of the moderns (real world).
To others the past (or the realm of death) (not sure).
As I can't describe it any more, there's a young woman in the real world.
And in the realm of the dead a young soldier (uniform like those of the soldiers from the Caribbean.)
For some reason the way is crossed and there is an action.
The Antagonist is also a soldier from the realm of the deaths of the woman in this realm so that I can live myself.
The transition is I believe the soldiers' graveyards too.
At the end of the fight, both soldiers believe in each other.
If you say something, I'm grateful for every answer.
Our little girl just slept on the couch from week 1.
Fixed forward: still alive :D
Relax.
A child like that seems much more like you think.
Take care that everything agrees around, not cosmopolitan animals, often clean up and look, but not for minutes of surveillance.
That makes you crazy!
Fresh air in the room.
Let's get Matraz.
No kisses.
Ahsso and we didn't have a sleeping bag, but we've always had a roof.
Watch your child sleep.
Is it turning your head on?
Can it get out of the mouth?
Or is it right in front of your face?
You can see if everything's okay.
We're all grown up too and when my husband came to the world, it was zb going and said that you put the kids on the couch to sleep.
In addition, we have already "study" with you and have already bought a lot of articles
But why are you offering me only 20EUR?
Hello, I've been writing to a colleague yesterday with you, and I haven't been back yet.
It's about my dress box that arrived yesterday (command number: #ALPHANUMERIC-ID#).
The right shoulder doesn't fit in the throat.
Please contact me as soon as possible.
The knife is not to be used at this time.
To make it quite clear.
RBTV has made a lot of promises.
And yes, I know myself, everything can't be kept.

Of course, people can continue to be politicians.

How can you find it all right?
Great if you like it, I find it scary.
I'm begging you to turn my back on my delivery wooden defect.

Is the Akku caught?
Last night my laptop (ThinkPad E480 20KQ and about 3 years old) was no longer loaded by my website.
I bought this again about 5 months ago, so it should still work.
I thought the network part alone was enough for the operation.
The battery is empty and the laptop no longer starts despite an embedded network part.
That's why I built the battery, but I don't do anything here either.
Do you have any ideas?
A new battery is ordered, but why can't I use the laptop in the network?
Was it someone else's captivating?
Thank you for your help!
I want the delivery of the #PRS_ORG# to the room.
How can I book it?
I'm interested in the #PRS_ORG# chair.
But don't know how high the seating area is..
Often on a tour and yet a lot of equipment?
With the daily V2 backpack of Peak Design no problem!
20 litres of fastening power also remove larger photo equipment without problems that can be safely understood by the Polished FlexFold parts.
And what you need for other everyday items, thanks to practical access to the individual configurationable interior, remains well organized and separated from the camera.
With the "update" of the daily line on version 2 (V2), the series is still presented in a new look.
The send, minimalist design has literally in itself - with the everyday backpack series, Peak Design has developed some of the most innovative solutions that protect the back pocket’s inner space safely and, however, provide short access to photo equipment.
This works with two possibilities: once conventionally over the cover cap that can be closed with the MagLatch lock system, an excellently designed solution for effective protection that has already been guaranteed by the Messenger Bags.
In this case, there is a seal box of metal with suitable anchor bars on the front of the back pocket.
In contrast to most back pockets, Peak Design has observed various "Fills" : there are 4 anchor bars, which are permanently destroyed, which can be included in the lockers.
If you load the truck full, you just take the upper bar, it's emptyer, deeper.
In addition, cuts and hooks are magnetic.
In this way, the back pocket can also be safely closed without putting the hook in.
The second option also distinguishes the Everyday Backpack basically from other photo bags: In addition to the cover cap, there is still a travel closure on both sides of the back pocket.
This eliminates most of the traditional back pockets with access from above - you don't have to worry about the content anymore!
At the same time, this smarter detail increases the dailyity of the racksack: If you take your photo equipment not only, but also everyday items or travel packages.
In everyday backpack you can individually configure the interior (more below) and thus understand each other without any problems - and by the two side openings you can also access it independently.
In addition, you can draw the back pocket from the right side of the body to access the camera equipment in the right main box, while the daily days are safe in the left half of the back pocket and do not come between them.
Easy, uncomplicated road safety helps.
And since the outer layers of the back pocket are also completely made of 100% recycled, windproof nylon, the content remains dry itself when it is due to go to Scotland in autumn.
Unfortunately, I look forward to the e-mail of her support.

Would you like another nice evening?
Hello, my orderant is #NUMBER#. when is the article delivered?
Order and payment was on 12.1.21.
I was given a completely different lamp when I ordered
Please call me.
If you extend to me the good, I'll give you an even greater order, but I've always kept the damaged furniture and didn't send it back.
And that last year, unlike the thought, I couldn't ignore it and I couldn't solve it at the right time and clear it.
But I have the damage as a customer and I don't accept it that way.
Rotinger brake discs are designed to appreciate the requirements of the dynamic driver, the reliability and safety of brakes, even under difficult conditions.
Rotinger brake discs are manufactured from Guss and then mechanically processed (boiled and cut).
All thin discs are manufactured in short series according to individual technical characteristics which are for certain discs and patterns.
On the basis of the individual technical drawing, a special production programme will be set up, which will be adapted to the characteristics of the original assembly.
The sound discs produced in this way ensure high comfort and braking efficiency.
In addition, the openings created increase the efficiency of the cooling of the disc, where the sections improve the cleaning of brake discs and brake locks.
Aesthetic properties of our thin discs underline the character of each car by attractive and revealing appearance.
Coloma is the city where an unexpected event unfolded the history of the West Coast.
In the winter of 1848, a man discovered at the south shore of the American River lighting bridges in the water.
Although he tried to keep his discovery secret, the news spread quickly and solved the so-called 'California Gold Rush' of '49.
Thousands came from near and far and made Coloma one of the rapidly growing and flourishing cities of the country.
Areas were hidden, cells were stored, and saloons and hotels were created almost overnight.
Everyone wanted his share of the country's wealth.
For many it was "Columa or Bust" (Columa or Bankrott)!
In this game you are a pioneer who seeks wealth in the West and wants to make a name.
You'll look for gold, recruit workers, work horses together and build companies.
You will also have the opportunity to explore the surrounding rivers and adjacent areas.
You're not alone - the other pioneers seem to have the same idea!
You have to go over your fellow pioneers so you don't want to go with the rest of them.
Coloma is a fast strategy game with many ways to win.
At the same time, you choose your actions, you have to budget your resources and build a table which "work" for you more and more (hereinafter "Engine Building").
The buildings on your table allow you to become more efficient, to receive additional actions or to apply rules to your benefit.
With these buildings and the dynamic bridge floors, you can develop your individual game style using fine adjustments.
Coloma plays a period of three years from 1848 (the year in which the gold was discovered in Coloma), 1849 (the year of California Gold Rush) to 1850 (the year in which California gained official citizenship).
A year in Coloma consists of five rounds.
During each round, players will choose a location on the game plan where they can perform actions.
Then their selection will be covered and they will place their pioneers at the appropriate locations.
If a location has most of the pioneers, it gets a spray!
This disables half the location - reducing the possible actions there.
The players then conduct different actions, such as the acquisition of resources, the movement of cars, the creation of cells, the search for streams, the construction of bridges, the opening of businesses and the positioning of revolvers.
When all actions are completed, the pioneers return.
The pricer turns to a new location at the beginning of each round and thus changes the available shares.
This goes on for as long as the pricer has moved five times, so each place has been covered once and the year has ended.
There's a shooting in which the player Coloma has to defend gangs flying in front of an overfall.
If the players have paid enough for the revolution and the gangs are paid, they will receive rewards.
However, if they fail, they will receive less rewards or end up at the Peace Court.
The game ends after the third shooting, then the final score.
The player won most of the winning points!

"Why are children no tyrants" Doku, ARD Mediathek
CW mental violence, sexual abuse, abuse of power
The ARD documentation has been published today in my Twitter-timeline, and I have also seen it.
>The child psychiater Michael Winterhoff is a well-known guest in Talkshows and holds talks across Europe.
With his book "Why Our Children Become Tyranns" (2008), he opened a heated debate on education.
Former patients:in and eligible for education are now making serious accusations against him.
Please pay attention to how hard the film is to wear.
And I am very grateful that many people at the same time think and act differently.
Our parents and other responsibilities must never, no, no! for power over the child.
Our goal must always be to give the child free space for his development and to make the framework for the child as large as possible in the situation.
Brrr, I'm still protected.
Holletcheck: Countries advise on the failure of the test obligation for three-fold impact
At its next meeting, the Ministers of Health of the Countries wanted to decide on a federally far-reaching test obligation for three reasons.
"We urgently need clarity as to whether or not the test obligation can be removed for three reasons," said Klaus Holetschek (CSU), President of the Health Ministerial Conference, the "Picture on Sunday".
The loss of 2G plus for three seizures is "not only medically significant, but also providing an additional empphasis," Holetcheck said.
Federal Health Minister Karl Lauterbach (SPD) has said that "the Health Minister's Conference will make a proposal on the following Tuesday".
So I want to send the lamp back.

I've updated account data.
What can this be?
What you're describing is called "Awareness" so you're going to have to take your mind off your neck.
These range from about 1 to 1000.
The most common is hearing sounds/voices, rarely seeing images and at all times experiencing pain.
For this issue relevant: Cigarette cuts are operations that are carried out with an increased rate of Awarenes, since a very deep drug is avoided for the protection of the child until it is decommissioned.
Previous episodes of Avareness should be mentioned in the drug speech.
Certain methods of anaesthesia such as total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA) are accompanied by a slightly increased risk.
**EDIT: Love all, this comment by me describes how Avareness was right, but had no definition ** u/Nitemarex **.
You have read your comment wrong.
But the chair is defective.
We're not going to help the 20€ either.
These are legal insurance claims.
The absolute minimum would, however, be that they will recover the defective chair.
In addition to the legal obligation, it is also standard in the field of eCommerce.
Please check again if they get back at least the defective chair.
We sell the second chair then private.
Then we'll lose some money.
I've already sent you a mail that you haven't answered.
Again the question.
In order and on account of the fact that the goods are delivered into a room of my choice.
The sender is company #NAME#.
I just called there.
I was told that they only deliver before the house - because of #PRS_ORG#.
Is that so?
If so, I have to cancel the order because I don't know anyone who can carry the heavy furniture in my first store.
I'm not gonna call?
I've formulated a question.
Theater historian Günther Rühle died at 97 years of age
He's been profiled as a theatre critic and an intent.
Later he wrote a monumental theatre story.
On Friday Günther Rühle died at the age of 97.
There's still the new book on the table: "An older man is getting older".
The exciting Diary of a slow separation from the world, led by the theatre historian and journalist Günther Rühle until April 2021.
And in the middle of the night, the news comes that the author is dead.
The last verse in the book says, "I've been here ever for my life."
There are different types of palettes.
One of the most common are European leaves, usually wood pallets, which are used mainly in the European area as loading tools.
They are certified by the EPAR for the European Parliament.
According to data from Austria statistics in Austria, over ten million pieces of palettes were produced.
The value of production was EUR 79 million.
How many pallets are imported annually to Austria will not be raised

Rolled Tips & Tricks
A week ago I had a lot of great tips for the perfect glass.
It was Christmas and it was incredible and butterzart!
So thank you again for this :)
Now I've come to the taste and I want to cook for Silvester for the first time.
Tomorrow I'll set up a fund for it.
Do you have any more tips for me than that?
Note: I don't have any ovens, but just a big top.
How's it going now?
What about the books or how do I get back to my #PRS_ORG#?
My English isn't that good anymore, but I'll get it.
IE is about a refund of €#NUMBER#
I was already informed by e-mail that the refund was paid.
But until now, the money hasn't come in to me.
Please check it out.
Where there are still Christmas breakes in Lübeck.
For many people, Gans or Ente belongs to Christmas days such as the tanning tree and the gifts.
You haven't cared for any flights yet?
Now the time is fast.
We'll tell you where you got another Christmas break in Lübeck's room.
The "Drive" of a noise level contributes to the heat and fat content of the guitar amplifier sound.
These features are perfectly implemented by the Valve Reactor activation.
With the VOLUME, GAIN and MASTER VOLUME controller, you can set the desired Pegel on the one hand and the lower volume of your sound on the other.
In addition, the VT+ series amplifiers offer a unique Power LEVEL rule that allows you to reduce the threshold without changing anything on "gain" and pollution.
Furthermore, it is already known that with the power LEVEL ruler, one can even float a service reserve if it does not go smoothly.
Thanks to POWER LEVEL-Regulator, you can use the full potential of the VT+ series in any situation.
The headphone can also be used as a line output.
The signal presented here is processed with a box simulation so that you get a significant "acoustic" sound pressure even when using a headphone or a direct reception.
A CD or MP3 player can be connected to the AUX book so you can join your favorite songs.
A Tuner function is also on board - so you do not need a separate voice device.
Whoever additionally spends a VFS5 footing, who can call the sounds comfortable by foot, turn the power blocks on/off and the time of the corresponding compatible effects "stop".
For the living use, this is really inevitable.
With its new power packages, VOX is taking another step in the future!
But he had seen it with others.
Then can you send the lamp back?
Since it's too low for a table?
So I'd like to send her back.
Can you help me with that?
And the Commodes?
Do we get an update next week to the exact delivery term?
Hello, they are already on #PRS_ORG# stolen
If it doesn't go, I'd be satisfied with a
In any case, I'll find a taker for the furniture.
Only over EUR 1,000 for goods I don't need, then something much.
I should have received my delivery and would have liked to know whether screws were intended as part of the delivery.
I would like to install the #PRS_ORG# mirror (door) on the intended hacks.
This is no satisfactory answer and the waiting time has not been rewarded

Iran sees progress in negotiations on nuclear agreements
In the negotiations on a renewal of the International Atomic Energy Agreement, progress is made according to Iranian data.
"The two sides are just ahead of setting themselves up on the issues that should be on the agenda," said Iran's Chief Manager Ali Bagheri on the Sunday of the Irna News Agency.
This was a "positive and important development" because at first there was no unity over the issues to be dealt with.
The agreement should prevent Iran from building nuclear weapons.
On Thursday, the Vienna talks on the renewal of the Agreement were continued after almost one week of interruption.
Negotiators from Iran, Germany, the United Kingdom, China, France and Russia participated in the negotiations.
A US delegation is also present in Vienna, but only indirectly involved in the negotiations.
Thuringen overholt Sachsen - Freistaat now Germany with the highest Corona Incidence
Thuringen has dissolved Sachsen and is currently showing the federal highest incidence.
As the only German country, the value is over the mark of 1000.
Thuringen was the only German country in the Corona incident on Sunday over the brand of 1000.
The Robert Koch Institute introduced the 7-day value with 1025 new infections per 100,000 inhabitants.
In Sachsen, which had recently shown the highest federal incidence, this value was at 990.5 on Sunday.
On Friday and Saturday the incidence in Thuringen was slightly reduced, but it was also above the value of 1,000.
Within one day 2242 new contact with the Sars-CoV-2 virus and 16 other deaths were reported in Thuringen in connection with an infection.
200 severe Covit-19 patients were treated intensively on Sunday in hospitals.
On weekends it can be delayed.
In addition, health officials have been overloaded for weeks and are coming close to finding new cases.
I get it.
Since delivery takes place early in March, it may be possible until then.
I have to print it and stick it on the package and give it to the post that was?
I don't have to click/ specify/fill here anymore?
That's exactly what I want to avoid, so I'm writing you.
I would like to take the return on my own costs.
In my eyes, the return fee is a duty.
It is time for changes
# #BOUNDAY I'm u/StratorDE in the plenary hall in the heart of Europe on a fantastic day!
# Which post here?
If you look at the activity in the past months of the MBundday, you can determine one: it is not extensible.
We have arrived in a winter star and have extended the summer log for several months.
# Where's the problem?
Yeah, what happened?
Mostly, it can simply be associated with dissatisfaction, how some things have gone down here and how we are generally present.
In the last days, the increase in the impression has shown that many here still have a buck on the MBund Day.
#What we need to change
At this point, the community is asked about the MBundedag day which they want to keep alive.
The response came from u/edizVEVO, who has been paying attention to this project in the last days and has found a screen port.
After some rewriting and rewriting, several people from the community have found the pleasure of rebuilding the project.
However, I would also like to urge all of us to take part in this project once again, which is the only way that this project can exist in the future.
To this end, we have created a platform for discussion in the form of a record server, where we can exchange each other and develop concrete things.
The server may be contacted by this link.
Destination:
* How will the MBund Day work in the future?
* What existing arrangements must be changed/adjusted/removed?
* How should we act in the future?
* How are new members to be called?
* How do we create a fair choice system?
I'm pretty sure I've forgotten something, but it's not bad, so at the end we've got the score.
If you have fun and time, it comes to the record, works with it and lets us decide democratically about the future.
I've ordered a light screen to be delivered to you.
Now I see that the article is too large/kloblog for it and is not suitable for my taste.
I've already ordered another arrest with you.
I put it together and noticed this when I took the soft shoulder.
It's very sad about that.
I hope this will be returned and I have a full refund.
This is also very sad because the #NAME# is much darker than expected.
I have another question: the day cover #PRS_ORG#, is there too too large, so in 240/240, for example?
#PRS_ORG# I need to be able to guarantee that the wrong trigger will be delayed soon.
And I'm asking you to let me go now.
I don't have an appropriate packaging, but the cabinet will be unmounted as much as possible for the removal - they need to clarify with #PRS_ORG# how it can work then.
#PRS_ORG# can call me at any time to agree to a retirement term.
Is there any guidance for the assembly?
How long would I have time to take care of this or choose myself for the return?
How do you answer the question, why are you being vegan?
Today I had a conversation with a colleague I like.
She herself has lived a long time vegetarian, perhaps even now quite rarely meat.
I used to be a vegetarian a few years ago.
On the question of whether I have always wanted to be vegan, and Vegetarianism has been a planned step forward, I have honestly answered without thinking much.
And although I thought for a long time that as a vegetarian I would support animal welfare, I once thought and realized that I would also support animal breeding.
That's why my decision to be wrong.
At the moment, I had the impression that was on her side of the disorder, then she defended vegetarianism and thought she knew where her flesh came from and reduced it as a vegetarian animal.
Now I wonder if my answer was "plump"?
How would you answer the question?
Have the feeling that you are soon trapped as a Veganer into a corner and there are conflicts that you would not be able to deal with without it.
There is a harmonious Veganerin (;
This is clearly not an exception to § 312d BGB.
Your #PRS_ORG# is not bound by the legal standards to be removed.
I'm on the assigned date on which my return #PRS_ORG# does not take place.

Laundry weather equipped for water relief: 45 000 Euro Country aid
Recently, Reheinland-Pfälzic Interior Minister Roger Lewenz in Lahnsteiner Rathaus issued an application decision of EUR 45,000 for the new vehicle repair of the voluntary firewall Lahnstein to Master of Overburgers Peter Labonte.
The total cost of the vehicle used since November 2020 is EUR 135,000.
A good and important investment in security.
I am pleased that the country of Rheinland-Pfalz supports us in this," says Lahnstein Oberburger Master Peter Labonte.
The machine car is used by the shower staff Lahnstein, one of seven units in Rheinland-Pfalz.
Over and under water they perform tasks in water and ice relief and technical assistance.
In Lahnstein it is calculated with increasing applications: the tree of the hotel ship on Rhein and Mosol and the further increasing use of the loan as a free-of-time stream.
I bought me a book that I could only read 10% and then solve the problems.
I can't open the book.
However, in its recommendations, it has been synchronized, removed and the newly loaded application has NOT worked.
I've been frustrated because I've been spending a lot of time and hoping for help now.
Okay, that's it.
I would like to order 3 items from #PRS_ORG# collection to June.
Can I enter a term in the order procedure?

Thanks for the first time that you're doing the whole thing here, I've also spent almost a decade in the public service in a similar activity, we were also talking about gunmen in the Executive, and I don't want to go in!
The question of right and left is always very simple.
In principle, however, it should be said that of course the public services come from the liberal and conservative spectrum and not from the revolutionary links that should be clear to everyone.
That, of course, also in the special uniform and weaponry of humans should also be clear to everyone on the right of conservative magic that these people can then be difficult to deal with living reality is of course also clear, because you have, of course, a lot of Germans with migration background, women and even homosexuals (and therefore I do not now have the women's upper secondary schools, because these are less than normal men and women who don't notice it if they don't tell it) and I have to leave these people because in doubt they will save your life or put it in your place.
But these border groups are also represented, even if my experience is initially comical after a conservative attitude, speak proudly in Germany and feel less left-wing policies, even if these policies have to be used for them in a relatively small way or if they have to be justified, they simply want to be treated quite normal.
Back to the rights, since, of course, police and combat forces are also a cross-section of society, you will also find extreme rights there, but they can openly say there or even smile at some state-facing plans are medialy over-extended and I also admire them.
Of course, it is true that even police and soldiers who have often been in foreign service have often begun to pause because of negative experiences and sometimes say things that the opponents are politically wrong.
It is also possible that right-minded people who are carrying out a wide range of thinking exchanges are also determined.
However, as far as I am concerned is concerned, there is a good fight against political education and clarification.
Germany is so international and it is so good for me to believe that we could not afford to have the right racists and Nazis in our ranks at all!
Yes, which I don't understand, I ordered the other basket on the German side.
Why should this come from England?
When I ordered it, it wasn't sold.
I've already ordered it in November.
But it has been confirmed to me in your confirmation of the order.
It's still about my order, which is no longer available.
I used to chat with #NAME#.
Alternatively, you can deliver the other #PRS_ORG# Corb for #NUMBER# Euro in black still in Germany or is available in Germany somewhere.
I'm always looking for you as a partner company.
But above the edge of the tree are two deep kernels that were filled with something.

Ordinarily by a child?
Hello, I (w32) have been working on a matter for a long time.
I am very disciplined and organized at work (in a self-reliance, very little leisure time), but my life has been far worse than my right to keep my budget clean and orderly.
There are always phases in which everything remains, and then and when it packs up me and me up and sucks.
But it's never really like "that someone could come to visit spontaneously".
My husband is not (sorry) better than I am, although I suffer from some kind of damage but most of the money is lost simply against work and loss.
The kitchen will still be regularly cleaned because we like to cook.
Now, to my question, have you been able to become more comfortable with a child?
But we have nothing to do with this, and this question has been working on me for a long time.
Because for me I have no response, it just doesn't bother me so much as long as there's no visit and for example there's always fresh clothes there and the kitchen is useful.
Do you have a bigger match with a child or do you get hurt?
I'm glad to hear your answers.

Careers in social work - like someone with a self-contained personality disorder?
I've been training in software development and have been trained for about a year now.
Unfortunately, I am increasingly aware that this profession is not the right thing for me to do. I have been thinking about starting again and studying social work for a long time.
The problem is that I have a more self-sustaining (i.e. less often) personality disorder (ÁVPS).
This means grossly saying that I have no self-esteem and that I am rather shy.
I have no problem talking to people at a technical level, but I like having very difficult conversations and I have been told more often that I’m acting unappreciative (where I think I’ve become better).
Can I become such a social worker?
I do not want to work as a street worker or at an open youth meeting, but rather in search of advice or family assistance.
But I don't know if the particular working day really is the way I imagine it, and it's hard to find something on the Internet.
The ÁVPS is already leading to problems in my job (for me, emotional), because it takes me every time there's something to do in my code ("It's already easy to guess") and I find it hard to ask experienced colleagues for help ( "I should really know how it goes"/ "I keep him with my stupid questions from work"/ "I really need to keep myself undercover" etc.).
The problems I will probably have in any profession, but I would like to mention them in the place.
But you've already stopped the sofa?
Because there was no confirmation for that either.
I'm waiting for a term of withdrawal
What do you mean to give them back ?
If I have downloaded a book on #PRS_ORG#, your #PRS_ORG# will not authorise this book
Is there a problem?
I was in the chat with #PRS_ORG#, who asked me if I had received a delivery confirmation for my scarf.
The protein added to the feed puts the bird in its stomach-dark tract into the individual protein building materials (aminic acids) and builds up its body-shaped protein, which he also needs for feeding.
The feeding training in nestling and feeding training in breeding birds are extremely complex processes and are associated with a particularly high claim for the entire organism of the animal.
Please note that NEKTON-Bio must not be given during the training, as it may otherwise occur in the fracture.
In connection with this short-term administration of NEKTON-Bio, the daily vitamin supply of NEKTON-S (multivitamin preparation) and NEKTON-MSA (minoral preparation) should be reviewed.

It is only recommended to prepare as many drinking water/weach feed as the bird consumes daily and to exchange water/food daily.
A narrow measuring valve (inlet) corresponds to 1 g NEKTON-bio.
In case of severe liver damage, the double or triple dose of NEKTON-Bio may be given at the start until the approach to breast training is visible.
The normal dose will then be reached until breast-feeding is completed.
Storage: NEKTON-Bio should dry without solar radiation between 15° and 25°C.

Statement by a Community worker in the statement of objections to the establishment
Hall r/LegaladviceGerman,
I have the following problem.
A Walnus tree is supposed to fall on our ground.
So the case was lodged in the Community.
An employee writes to me that the cases of fruit trees and therefore also the walnus are not part of the settlement.
However, the walnus is explicitly described as a protective tree.
Can I now leave me to the employee's statement or not?
On the one hand, I must be able to rely on an expert opinion.
On the other hand, the setting is clear.
Thank you for your answers.
We understand that.
Then we'll use the new packaging.
I didn't get any messages
Well, then I still have a sopho without use.
Can you offer me a present or a present?
What were they more expensive?
Yes, I think the only question is whether I can pay in euro and let me deliver the envelope to Germany
Can you check it out?
E-mail: Heavy traffic accident in Selfb
Before long, a serious traffic accident occurred in the St. 2179 between the port of Selb-North and Plößberg.
As the police's press alarm is now being reported (14:03 p.m.), a Pkw arrived in the opposite direction.
There are injuries.
I got it.
Well, thank you so much again that it was so simple!
Council and ideas for further careers
First good Christmas to you!
My Christmas is so good, because my favorite head just remembers everything you can remember.
Before I leave here now .. briefly: I need advice and the best of people who know my situation somewhere - so you.
I'm just making the ref as Quereinstairs.
I originally studied something else and worked there too in an area (at least to remain a little anonymous, I call it nothing more precise).
All of this was too long for me then and I looked for alternatives that could make me more fun.
I have sometimes been landed in the classroom and I was sure that it is - even if the framework conditions are clearly inflexible than in my previous profession, but I did not.
I've now arrived at the third "I google other descriptions".
And it's only a half year round.
I have always decided to continue and at least finish the ref, and then I can still change.
But I'm absolutely done.
I've had so little free time in the last month that I've been completely exhausted.
Now there are holidays, but there's still a lot of work waiting for me.
Before the ref I always thought I would be depressed, but my weekend was also my weekend and my holiday evening.
I was free.
And the stress at work was the same at the moment.
Now I have too much stress on my own.
And then there's these star structures that are also nervous to me.
Basically it makes fun and from outside it runs well with regard to the feedback and so on.
But I'm completely exhausted and ask myself how much stress my body feels before it's completely close - if he doesn't just do it.
I ask myself whether I would like to have the rest of my life - just if I read some of your contributions here - or if I should not go back to the old area where I was valued, I could take free time if I needed it, and the work was somewhat long, but it was well paid for and together in a team that worked and not as a single fighter as it is now most of the time of the case.
But then I ask myself whether I have not come back to the same place in one year as I am now and I am not satisfied.
You note, it's all right, but maybe you have as an external council or ideas, like I'm out of this situation, which I'm completely finished and almost start to regret at least.
I'm not going to make decisions so emotionally right now that it probably doesn't work well.
But maybe your eyes help me to see at least a little light at the end of the tunnel - or Christmas night, which is enough for me for the first time.
Thank you for reading and apologize for the winey undertone of me.
I hope my situation has become a little clearer at least.
Since its introduction in 2001, the Valvetronix series of VOX has continued to develop, inter alia, to combine the advanced modeling technology with the Valve Reactor, which perfectly reflects the behavior of a noise amplifier.
With the VT20X/VT40X/VT100X Amps we present a brand new modeling engine that is absolutely sound at the latest state of technology.
Thanks to VET technology (virtual element technology), which is based on the analysis of components and amplifications, the VTX amplifiers are waiting for an authenticity that is absolutely impressive.
Of course, these amps also include the most advanced Valvetronix tube enhancer.
This is partly based on real analog beats because they are better access to the sound variations and nuances of a noise amplifier than any simulation.
In addition to this excluded operation, the VTX amplifiers offer a closed home and a bass reflux system from which the natural resonances only spray.
With the "Tone Room" software of VOX, you can even correct and avoid historical facts at the virtual level until the amp and the effects sound as you have always imagined.
The perfect combination of Röhren sound with modelling technology is to thank VOX Valve Reactor technology, which was first presented in 2001.
Of course, it was further refined several times to meet new additional sound requirements, which in 2010 led again to a performance shift of the VOX Valvetronix series - with more dynamics as well as more and significantly improved booster models.
From hand-held VT20+ to VT120+ with two speakers, the new VT+ Valvetronix series was also designed so that all guitarists will be five here looking for a maximum sound range.
All guitarists dream of the pressure and the dynamics of a noise amplifier: they expect a fat sound, an emphasised replay of play dynamics and satin attack and a prompt response.
During an ongoing analysis, the VOX engineers have discovered that in particular the end levels determine the strength of a booster and developed the VOX Valve Reactor technology on this basis.
The Valve Reactor activation of each VT+ amplifier with a 12AX7 tube represents the behavior, the subtle nuances and the sound character of a tube amplifier.

What finally fits in the backsack depends, of course, on the size of the camera and the object.
A possible fitting would be a DSLR camera with a specified object, two to three switching objects and a cover.
Larger DSLM cameras such as the different models of the Sony-a7 series or a Fuji X-T2 allow room for further objects.
In addition, you can also hide any number of accessories.
And whoever has a small DSLM camera (MFT cameras from Olympus, Fujifilm X-A or e-series) can use the backsack for his equipment and photo-friendly things.
Drohnen pilots also meet with the daily backpack 20L an optimal choice, as the Rucksack offers sufficient space for a DJI Mavic Pro including remote control and accessories.
Volcanic use on La Palma: probably the longest in history
In the near three months since the start of the outbreak, the lava stream on the Canary Islands has caused great damage.
Is there an end in sight?
With a duration of between 85 days, the volcanic eruption on La Palma has been the longest in the history of the Spanish Canary Islands since Sunday.
So far, the eruption of the Tehuya volcano in 1585 lasted 84 days as the longest on the Atlantic island before the West Coast of Africa.
There are no reliable data on previous outbreaks.
The activity of the still-named volcano in the Cumbre Vieja has taken place in the past few days, but volcanologists are still not expecting any forecasts when it could end.
The indicators point to a delay.
The best news is that they are stable," said the president of the island council, Mariano Hernández Zapata, the state TV transmitter RTVE.
Millions of damages
In the near three months since the start of the explosion, the more than 1000 degrees of hot lava has destroyed almost 2900 homes and other buildings, as RTVE reported.
Almost 1200 hectares were covered by a metric layer of lava.
This corresponds to almost 1700 football fields.
More than 7,000 residents had to be evacuated, the damage is estimated at more than 900 million euros.
At the coast, two new landings were created by the famous Lava with a size of about 50 hectares together.
In particular, the island was affected by an extremely important banana construction, of which about half of the approximately 85,000 inhabitants live directly or indirectly and already live in the crisis before the volcanic eruption.
225 hectares of banana plants were destroyed, further areas were severely affected, the newspaper "El País".
Christmas and Gifts
Christmas is at the door and especially the children can hardly expect the heavenly festival.
The many beautiful gifts under the Christmas tree have been associated with the spiritual atmosphere and the burning excitement.
Christmas is one of the few traditional reasons which still sustain our growing societies.
It is therefore more important to become aware of the Christmas tradition of the gift so that the taste of the gift, which was followed by French sociologists and ethnologist Marcel Mauss, has been a peaceful "Society Treaty of Natural Peoples" that the star Routine can be refilled with life in the context of this tradition.
How the Christ Son Came From Nicolaus
It was strictly the Protestants who were closely associated with the reception on Sundays.
In the past, gifts were transferred to one kind or another at Nikolastag.
The background of this still popular seat today is that the Holy Nikolaus as Bishop of Myra three women secretly threw gold into their window one night to save them from further life in sin.
Of this unconventional kind of gift, the usual use in Germany was to fill the stage with gifts, especially children.
Protestants are involved in this use because they act as mediators between God and men as "sanctification".
For these reasons they are against the institution.
Martin Luther made the Christian child from Nikolaus and therefore founded a new line of tradition.
The focus of the gift is therefore on the saint.
Since most Protestants do not see such detailed questions more clearly, it is only to the least, that the use of St. Nicholas is still a strong part of the prenatal life of Martinsing and Martinsumzug.
Today you find in stifles before the door and under the Christmas tree of Socken to the luxury of luxury all that the heart desires.
Multiplicity of Traditions in Christian Countries
Sources have established a tradition of the present since the 13th century on the day of Saint Nicholas.
With the reform, the day of the present moved to the shrine.
In all Christian lands, however, there is a happy bird model on the question of who now brings the gifts to the children.
In Germany, it depends on whether the child appears on the Holy Night or the Christmas man who is in principle a kind of Nikolaus who has been appointed by some species in time.
This includes, for example, his white rashbart, which has only a few more closely associated with the more strict asyrian bar of the historical figure, his castles drawn from Rentiers and the preferment of the stone to access the houses.
In the Netherlands, St. Nicholas remains the central figure at the Christmas festival.
In Spain, the Holy Three Kings give gifts, while in Italy it is the Hexe Befana that should have shown them the way to Jesus ’ child.
In Scandinavia both Fabelles brought the gifts, while in Russia it brought Father Frost some peace.
There are not any interest here, but three horses that carry their shields as Troika.
In Chechnya, the mother country of the reform in the course of the civil war, Christind is responsible for giving gifts.

Police shoots forced bank robbers near the King's palace
In the vicinity of the Kensington Palace in London, a armed man was shot by the police on Saturday.
The police shared the call with a man who was supposed to have gone into a bank with a gun and a bookmaker's business.
The man fled, according to the authorities, in a vehicle that could be stopped shortly later by officials.
It's been shot and the man's been hit.
He was still declared dead on the tatort.
The police didn't come out of a terrorist background.

Stacker Problem
Hello, love Weib people,
I hope I'm doing everything right here, it's actually my first post after a year.
To my problem: I had to start taking the pill about five years ago, especially because I had so incredibly bad pain during the period and broke PMS before the period.
Now I would like to keep it back because I have to take enough medication through chronic illnesses that I can't find.
My main problem is, not surprisingly, the pain, but my skin.
I've had my last two-year break from 0 to 100 explosive pickles and this is everywhere.
So superficially, but I've got it all pretty and I haven't felt well.
In the two years break, it has never really normalized itself.
Maybe someone has some tips to avoid this time.
Perfume free and without gednosis is my cosmetic already, but maybe there's something I can recommend.
I'm sorry I didn't take this seriously and it's too late.
Thank you very much for everyone who has read the Romans!
Yes, the love skin is so cool.
Vorbuper had bad neurodermititis, then a time of calm, then large-scale bone fractures and the acne theme.
Food I have also tried everything possible in the course of chr. Disease and have remained dependent on sugar, milk and meats mix cost because otherwise nothing has worked so well.
It may also be good that hormonal is simply the worm inside, but if you want to have any building like me you want to stop looking for something else that's still going on.
I've already had all of her colleague's seminar.
In writing and now I have lost the conversation, and I don't know what was answered to my questions.
I've always had to work between me and my phone and everything was gone.
What's there to check if the money was there, I'd have seen it.
Please check my bank data, maybe there was something wrong.
but there's him generally in large

Could you please send me the account from the order #NUMBER# again to the email address mentioned above?
Can we supply the packaging material?
We have no opportunity to keep this for so long.
We'd use the table as offered by them as it's ours.
I'd like to have the same sex in blue in nov.den already ordered it, and I'd have it.
Must the shell be fully built for the removal and replacement?
And when would the ransom be?
110 kV earth cable will be built again in 2022
The authorisation for the release of the new high voltage cable at Tann is legally valid.
The decision of the Dutch Government to set up a plan will open the way for the construction to begin in 2022.
It was now shared by the network operator Bayernwerk.
The about seven kilometers long earth cable will connect the Tann revolving work in the north of the municipality and the existing 110-kilovolt guide between Simbach and the pharmacies.
The cable is connected to the site of Edermanning at Reut to a mast of freedom.
Good morning,
my order from 03.01.21 with order number #NUMBER# has so far only arrived in parts with us.
The blue cell number:#PRS_ORG# with the post number #NUMBER# has been sent back by #PRS_ORG# with the note "It's not possible to set".
All three other packages have been arrived, so a destination is definitely possible.
Can you tell me how the next move is now?
A beautiful start in the week!
You can forget that, but I explained it several times yesterday!!!
This is a commode of glass and the whole pages are placed, so there's glass everywhere and the cardboard is capt
The commode stands in my apartment and #PRS_ORG# refuses to come into the apartment because of the #PRS_ORG# provisions
This means that the commode can't be removed because no one in my apartment can clean up
Thanks for the message
but why only EUR 20?
The original value of this table was #NUMBER#EUR
No, it's all books, so the question at #PRS_ORG# is probably a general problem
Ref: Plan instruction (EC)
Hello, ladies and gentlemen,
I've been in the summer, I've enjoyed teaching, but I still have major problems that are time-consuming to plan my teaching in the field of science.
Unfortunately my school is not technically well equipped, so in principle I can only use the table, the school book and a OHP as a medium.
In school I can also copy only s/w free of charge (which is nervous for science).
I currently need a very long time to plan my hours.
For example, we are currently making the topic of geofactors and I actually have every hour for myself.
In principle, the methods are always repeated, but on the other hand I do not want to invest too much time for simple teaching hours (which I also need for UBs etc.).
I'm actually going out of the learning goal (what I want to achieve) and then I'm going to find out how I can build it (mostly I create a working paper with texts from books that my school does not have).
We have the book Terra and I am more satisfied with most of the tasks in the book.
That's why the paper too.
Maybe I can even work with the book.
I'd really like it.
I would like to return the #PRS_ORG# from the #NUMBER# order.
I actually already decided for a new at #PRS_ORG#, but I would like to turn the return as soon as possible.
The trade is afraid of 2G Christmas business regulation.
In most cases only one can be infected or cured.
The trade holds it unnecessary and regrets the disruption of trade.
A possible solution has also been prepared.
The 2G rules in view of Germany's trade union (HDE) are the main Christmas business.
In the case of business with articles of non-performance need, HDE chief business director Stefan Genth criticized the trade.
According to a recent survey by HDE among 1100 traders, more than 70 percent of companies looked negative on the remaining days of the year.
Many had already written the Christmas business.
"What really should be the positive height of the year is now often a hole without soil," said Genth.
As a result, dealers with 2G access restrictions lose almost a third of their pre-crisis rates over the past week.
It only runs well in food trade and online.
The link called for the consequences of dramatic development.
The purchase of masks, distance and hygiene concept was a safe matter, said the chief executive.
"2G no longer brings us into the fight against pandemic," he stressed.
The current arrangements were broken down by customers and required high staff.
The band scheme must be approved federally, he asked.
Then each customer must be controlled only once on 2G (implicit or cured) and had access to all businesses with the supplied bonds on that day.
In addition, in individual trade - as already in public transport under the 3G rule (impacted, cured or tested) - sufficient sample checks should be made.
The German Euroshop real estate group, which specializes in shopping centres, also speaks of a difficult Christmas business.
The frequencies last were without 2G at good 75% of the pre-Corona level, the turnover at around 90%.
These numbers will now be safe in the middle of such important Christmas business," said President Wilhelm Wellner of the "Economic Week".
Because of the high level of personal and administrative wear, the centre will try to find solutions and get permission.
This includes the so-called band solution, where "the visitors, for example at a central location in the center, once obtain their 2G evidence and then - equipped with a flag similar to a club hotel - can be owned by all businesses at least." dpa
I recently ordered the #PRS_ORG# and delivered.
The mirror has a cracker and in the frame it is also an error that has been tried to hide with a yellow filling.
That looks bad.
I would like to return the mirror and have already packed it back into the package and attached it.
How am I supposed to proceed for the return now?
The lamp is designed for dual balance, based on new, flat SMD LEDs with high performance and high colour performance.
For setting the color temperature and lightness of the lamp, a modern microprocessor has extraordinary possibilities.
In addition to the adjustment of light there are two standard colour temperatures: daylight and artificial light.
It is also possible to install and store the colour temperature in the range of 3100 - 550K manually.
Use current settings in the Flash memory.
A special feature of the controller is simple and intuitive.
The light creates a very light stream with soft light of high quality, completely flimmer free.
The 120 degree radiation angle with which you can light large areas at relatively small distance is great.
Also in reporting situations in small spaces or short distances.
You can adjust the brightness virtually without changing the colour temperature.
It is a great tool to work both on the film set or on the studio.
The optional available DMX512 controller allows the remote control of the lights in television studios or when the lights are mounted at difficult locations.
On the back of the light is the control panel, it consists of keys and a light display.
The display shows the current brightness setting in percent and the current colour temperature in Kelvin.
There is still the slot for the NP-F Akkus (not included in the delivery volume)
User Memory The memory has up to three panel settings for brightness and colour temperature.
To carry out the settings of individual settings on the storage sites, simply press one of the storage keys and complete.
The storage controller stores the current state of the lamp when it is switched off, so that the known situation is restored when new turn off - very practically when the camera is set at certain color temperatures.
Working with battery one of the greatest strengths of the DL3120 functionality comes from the possibility of operating with cost-effective NP-F Akkus.
These are often already owned by photographers and cameramakers (and women) - so you can get back to existing equipment.
The DL3120 can also check before the set whether the battery has sufficient performance - it is a battery tester with the same built-in - for each of the two battery chargers a value in the two display displays (the left battery above display, which is the right at the bottom of the display).
In addition, it is, of course, possible to provide the scanners with electricity over the shared network.
The construction of the scanner is very simple.
You have a 16mm hole as a connection to fix it so you can go straight to your photostat.
The restriction is to be applied by means of fixedifiers on both sides.
It was also considered that mechanical components are extremely high and therefore are also used for longevity and hard work.
In addition, a new link is included in the delivery volume.
It's huge that also contains a bag in the delivery area.
In this way you can buy the lights with all the accessories you want to buy if you want, safely transport or store them without problems.
The damage I've given and it's too small :(
"Party we wanted to laugh": Frankfurt celebrates after a tortoise comeback against Livercusen
What for a more spectacular reaction from Intracht Frankfurt.
After 22 minutes, the last two horses in series were on their way to the next Bundesliga Plete.
But then the SGE rose up within a good hour to break the fruit over a growing season start from the soul and won a lot of joy with 5:2. "It is a joy what boys have done today," young coach Oliver Glosner at DAZN and said a "Pauschal Lob, to every single one who was with it."
At first, it appeared after a new dumpster for the Frankfurters who are now at rank nine more than before their expectations.
Patrick Schick had led the liver surgeon with 2:0.
What happened then was also impressed by the SGE trainer.
"How the players then came back and showed a fantastic performance," continues Glasner.
I am truly happy with the performance we have shown and of course also with the result.
The moral of his teammates was also the first to be able to stand in place since the fourth day of the game and his overcrowded muscle injury.
"I believe our mentality is incredibly great," said the 27-year-old and rejoiced with a look at the result, especially for the audience.
That was the party we wanted to smile today.
For the next tasks, though, Glasner wants to keep the focus on himself, but he also looks well at the staff situation.
It is extraordinary that in December we have all players fit that all players are physically in a top constitution.
It's top work in our medical department, but players also live high-professional.
Now you want to "go further and keep track of progress" and the tasks until the year-to-year shift "to this level".
The next Wednesday, in the course of the English week, there is an outdoor game at the Borussia Mönchengladbach (18.30 am, Sky) on the program.
I'll get the mail my package back to you because of a mistake on my part.
I tried to call #PRS_ORG# and let it go again, no chance.
Can it be sent directly to me again or must I wait until the money is returned and the order is given again?
I'd be sorry if I didn't order it again because it's been a long time.
Are they already on #PRS_ORG# stolen?
Dumpers for handball women before quarter finals against Spain
Germany's Handball Women fail after demolition against Denmark with hanging heads and empty views from the park.
At 16:32 (8:13) before 800 observers in Granollers, the DHB selection had a severe downturn and now has to run against Spanish guests in the quarter final.
"We were too young and had too much respect for the opponent," German coach Henk Greener said.
We have to act differently against Spain.
After the first landing in the tournament, Germany closed the main group III with 8:2 points as the second (10:0).
It's bad we couldn't take the flow.
It was all a bad game we had to erase," said Captain Emily People.
In the fight to enter the semi-finals, there must be a significant increase on the next Tuesday, 2019 in order to keep the harsh dream of the first medal alive since 2007.
Best German advertising in Dussel with the three-time Olympic Denmark was a back-room player, Alina Grijsels, with six towers.
"We were just not there - neither in the attack nor in the riot," said the space player Xenia Smiths and asked, "We have to look forward quickly now."
From front to back, not to height
Unlike in the previous five tournaments, the German team with the app was not on the height.
Bugfixes and technical errors in the attack and gaps in the turn were responsible for a rapid 0:4-regression after seven minutes.
Only Torfau Dinah Eckerle was immediately at operating temperature and prevented with some paraders.
The first tower came to the DHB team after 9:30 minutes, when Griswells successfully completed a quick match.
However, this was not the expected initial delivery.
Against the aggressive cover of the teeth, the German women could hardly sit in scene - and, however, they usually broke up at the strong Althea Reinhardt in the port of the Scandinavians.
So the party was running early at 3:10 a.m. after 20 minutes, so the back-room player Mia Zshocke saw some time later because of a hard crowd on her opponent.
But in the fourth final, they can work again.
Only in the final phase of the first half time did the DHB selection get something better in the game and up until the break at least five doors.
The only hope for a shelter after the change was already seven minutes at 9:19.
Again, the Greener guards sinned in all areas and made it easy for the well-established enemy, who, at the end of the round, counted the media candidates.
As a result, the German army was no longer able to reach a performance increase and became a clear loser from the park.
DACH-Advent Calendar Day 6: Family traditions at Christmastime
As part of the Reddit Advent Calendar, we have hosted the Nikolastag and are allowed to celebrate our family traditions at the springtime, the Advent, Nikolaus, the holidays and Christmas celebrations.

Placen back?
Woody?
Is it music?
Is the Christmas man, the Christmas boy or is the gift from Oma and Opa?
No matter how you do it, everyone goes to and around Christmas fairs, it's nice to have as a family as well as possible.
Whether these are now fixed traditions, or even every year something else: tells us how it stays or runs in your family!

That's what's going on with them?
The title suggests that I am active as an implant in mobile implant teams in which (e.g. only) bioNtech/Pfizer vaccine is infected in nursing homes.
As these are soon ready for a large part, then it goes on to part in vaccination centers for me.
I would like to answer questions without a time limit on the organizational and human aspects as well as medical questions if they are not related to a personal matter (e.g. "I take medicine X, this is against impinging."
In my task area, there is an explanation for the imputation, the indication position (person has a claim for an impupement under the Coronainfaction Regulation and no reason to speak against it), medical documentation and etc. emergency care in allergic reactions (I have never been affected).
The impasse itself is delegated to qualified staff, e.g. medical trade agents.
In Imfaction teams, however, we often do not have "only" (they don't want no value for God!) pharmaceutical-technical assistants for the preparation of vaccines, but they can't perform seizures (?), so I also perform most of the injections myself there.
Severe "Hudler" question: Amberger knows the solution
What's a shelterer, please?
With this dialect answer, sent by an amberger, "We in Bayern" has been provided for intense reflection in the BR television series "We in Bayern".
However, unlike many previous days, the term in the "Host Mi" series has this time been ignored by the appellants.
No, it wasn't "man who's nervous."
And no one, "He's got to go fast."
What people hear from the TV moderator is completely wrong.
The man from Amberg announced the solution and may also have provided for many overloads.
"The skinler," the viewers say, "is a lamp with which someone exchanges the bread."
Diarytologist Antony Rowley, who has been interviewed by Bayern TV for years as an expert, confirmed this.
With the note, this is a typical over-false term, some way away from the well-known oral answer "hudern".
As a result of an educational accident - perhaps also with some who have lived in the Amberg area for a long time.
I can't buy books for two weeks.
After confirmation there will always be the following error message: oops - something goes wrong - try again later.
I have restarted the #PRS_ORG#gel#PRS_ORG#n, synchronized and repaired the PC.
Nothing helped.
Are you really so sure about the race bike?
This morning I am excited about tattooing because I wanted to train at least a little more in preparation for my driving tour next week.
I said, did, and I went with my racing bike, which I bought on eBay last night.
The first 40kms were also really beautiful - but then what happened in every such town (this time: Thank you Kröfeld!).
Glass splitter on the line.
Zack, my late pockets and my back pockets wanted nothing more to do with the rest of the track.
Since I had no real opportunity to provide me with replacement money and replacement money due to the weekend, I had to return with half a bad lot and take the first train home.
It wasn't so bad either, maybe it's even better if I do it again before the wheel.
But now I'm facing a question and I hope you can help me.
Since I have a relatively long track of several days ahead of me, I would only get this problem more often.
Now it was really not bad, since even the old tyres from the predecessor (very lower than the old man, the day I got back the bike I left up to 14 h 120km!) and the one who had already described it as suboptimal because he has been driving with them for many years.
But if I think I have to take another turn when driving after 80-90km, then I think I'm really badly fired :D
Now I came in contact with an older man on the train, who wondered why I didn't have the Marathon Plus rifles; these should be unapproachable.
Now, of course, it sounds very exciting.
But are these really so improbable?
I've had a little pleasure now to issue 40€/reaps just to be disappointed then.
I still ask myself: at the moment on the race, I believe 25x622.
There is also (probably?) in the Marathon Plus Reifen, but most of it is already wider.
Is this a problem?
Or would you give me a ride to another train?
The Schwalbe page seems to me absolute! Do you know how to recommend Durano DD?
Thank you very much in advance for the help and love grace!
Car slammed against wood: Driver fatally injured
The 53-year-old spoke on the B57 between Rheinberg and Xanten with his car for an unexplained reason against a mediumline and then landed on the opposite road, as the police reported.
There it came to a front line with a 27-year-old vehicle.
The 53-year-old car was hit against a tree and the man was stuck in the car.
The 27-year-old and his 23-year-old driver were severely injured in the accident and brought to hospitals.

After the publication of our new high end broadband B 100-6 OHM, it was just a matter of time until our SOLO series would be back up.
SOLO 15 is the new sprayling and remembers optically the big models with the B 200 - 6 OHM.
However, in this construction proposal, a suitable design foot is involved directly in order to bring the speaker to the right position.
This has no influence on acoustics and can therefore be adjusted in length according to the circumstances at home.
The principle is that the SOLO 15 is very well suited for people where the maximum volume plays a more subordinated role, but is to be achieved at an exceptional high level.
A 10 cm sound speaker is simply not able to produce almost unfiltered high-pressure wall.
However, this does not mean that SOLO 15 sounds weak.
On the contrary, they are very grown and very impressive and accurate for their size.
Tonal was approved the SOLO 15 with a slight height.
This is generally used in broadband to optimise the highly frequent combination.
The SOLO 15 is very clear and fine sound.
Lightly driven outside can reduce the height area and make the sound image warmer.
Thanks to the point source, the location of the individual components of a musical piece in the optimum stereodreyck is a mercanic and exciting precision.
The extremely low mechanical losses of B 100 - 6 OHM provide for an enemy dynamic that is looking for the same.
The SOLO 15 therefore complements not only our SOLO series, but expands it in matters of resolution and accuracy.
As with all our construction sites, it is recommended to start thinking about the final optimization of the speaker in order to plan appropriate changes in construction.
For example, if you want to provide homes, the reduction of the speaker needs to be adjusted accordingly, as the supplier is again presenting material.
After all the discs have been closed (e.g. in the construction market), you should first drive an 8 mm hole into the ground floor at the appropriate location in order to carry out the cable safely later.
With the help of an over-frequency, the voice opening is now followed in the front, so that the B 100 - 6 OHM can be used privately later.
On the other hand, this opening should be provided with a 45° phase to make the opening area of the speaker chair as large as possible.
The four starting points of B 100 - 6 OHM will be interrupted in the phase as shown in the “Detail Phase” image.
Then you start with the actual construction of the box and place one of the two sides on a level area.
On these, the rear, the deck, the front and the floor will be removed.
They should also be used and bound together.
If, for example, you want to recover finished products from the construction market instead of producing 16 mm MDF itself, you can change the packaging itself if you need it.
The next step will be taken on the second page.
Then all the plates of the foot follow, so both the sides as well as the front.
The opening of the bass reflux tube, as well as the connection box on the backband, is facilitated by an appropriate lock circuit or a forest driller.
Next you use a round fresco to cover all sides of the actual box.
The upper side of the disc can also be removed.
In addition, the foot plate is firmly attached to the foot of the house and attached to long wooden screws.
It follows the signs and fronts (2,5-mm-bohrer) of the soundspeaker chassis and the connectors.
After cleaning the house of wood dust (abstain / burst), you start with the release of the cable.
This is achieved by the 35 mm bass reflux opening in the back yard.
To do this, you can skip the entire and short cable piece for pieces by the 8 mm drilling in the foot until the terminal is opened and it can emerge about 30 cm there.
In the upper part of the building, the cable is led to the opening of the speaker and it also allows lockers to climb up there.
The frequency ranges are then prepared and used.
The design plan of the frequency ranges, as well as the corresponding connection plan, may be excluded from the following document: assembly instructions Week Solo 15.
If the frequency range is built up and the connection terminal is broken, the thickness of the 8 mm cable is followed within the box, which is not completely closed yet.
With the 35 mm BASSREFLE opening and with something handy, you can drop heat blankets on the opening and close it.
By opening the B 100-6 OHM and with a small lamp you can check the coverage accordingly.
Now the pressure follows the description.
The B 100-6 OHM is then connected and attached to the corresponding screws.
The polarity plays an important role in this, so that the multi-track (marked cable) must be attached to the speaker's pulse (larger contact).
Finally, the bass reflexor is cut to the specified length of 28 mm (total length of the rotor).
To melt, a mass of steaming material is cut into two parts and placed in the house.
The opening of the bass reflex channel should be kept free.
Can I give you an order now and let you deliver it first in June?
> Hello everyone,
> finally we can announce that we will also reorganize the OSCE this year!
> For well-known reasons it is not possible for us to get more than four people into the studio, which has meant a higher planning challenge and explains the short-term nature of the announcement.
ABER: There will be at least three people per shift, so we will follow the Oscars 2021 with at least 7 bows in the stream and hopefully thousands of you!
> We do our best to avoid delay or other problems.
But hey, it's still as before pandemic – yet we will give everything to accompany the Oscars as much as possible.
> About 0:30 will be released.
Get you some drinks already cold, plant good food and prepare you for a long but very interesting night.
