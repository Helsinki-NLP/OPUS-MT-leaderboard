According to the Tatobey directive, members are advised to simply add or translate verbs into their native language, or translate them into their native language. The reason is that it is much easier to create naturally changing verbs in their native language.

I'll cut to the left.
I started writing a new book.
They started arguing about money.
I started reading a book that Tom borrowed from me.
I started reading a new book.
You started to cry.
He started explaining what happened.
I spent the beginning of my life in the incubator.
Be very careful about this.
He's dealing with him like something.
She saved my life.
You saved my life.
They saved Tom two hours.
I started being in the front.
I'm starting to be like Tom.
I'm starting to get it.
I'm getting cold.
I'm starting to feel a little guilty.
I'm starting to lose patience with you.
I'll start tomorrow at 6:00.
You're starting to offer me.
The locker in the bedroom started to burn.
Let's start!
Let's start this meeting when Tom's here.
I'll start tonight.
I asked Tom not to do it.
Did you ask for employment in this company?
Did someone ask me?
I want my money back!
I'm asking you to return the money!
No words will express how wonderful you are.
There's no giraffe going through this river.
No bones are broken.
No word during the test, people.
There is no solution.
No trees were broken.
None of these tricks are mine.
No honest person can go to politics.
No guy ever asked me about it.
There's a big garden behind the house.
He fucked up the game.
The background is still unsolved.
We dragged the horses into the building.
He's got those scars.
It's funny.
How long will you be ready to leave?
For what purpose?
What team is Tom playing for?
I'd be interested in what Tom should change his mind.
I'd be interested in what Tom's going to have in the future.
I'd be interested in how Tom got into my house.
I'd be interested in what Tom meant.
I wonder if Tom's busy.
I'd be interested if we could save this situation.
I'd like to know if Tom's been out with her.
I'd like to know where Tom is now.
I'd like to know where Tom ended up.
I'd like to know who's gonna drive.
I'd be interested in how many mistakes I made.
I'd be interested in how much Tom knows about that matter.
I wonder if Tom's still tired.
I'd be interested in what Tom really meant.
She was wondering where Sam is and what he's doing.
I was wondering when you were back.
I'm more interested in French speaking.
Do you care?
Are you interested in art?
The forbidden fruit is the most delicious.
I bought a new computer.
Jacque convinced the teacher.
She screamed at him.
Shut your mouth when you're coughing or you're crying or calling.
I'm sorry she's been haircuted.
"I care about you very much," she confessed.
Please keep your flowers.
The fund was paid.
He's stuck on her.
Put it under your armpit.
She fell in love with the Russian passenger.
Did you fall in love with her for the first time?
To love is one thing, to take someone is another thing.
I designed the guns for the train.
She locked up in his bedroom.
Did I close the main entrance?
I've been thinking about doing this job right now.
Zahn's lying.
I don't care about anything.
You paid more than you had.
You paid more than you had.
I paid the payment card.
You paid more than you had.
I'll pay for Tom's letter.
Will Tom pay for it?
Please turn off the radio.
Please shut down the radio.
Please stop the TV.
Getting Tom into it would be dangerous.
I forgot to tell you about Tom.
You forgot everything we did for you?
Forget it, they don't deserve it.
Forget about this sad event.
Forget I said that.
You forgot to call Tom, didn't you?
He forgot her name.
I forgot to pick up a note on the deck.
I forgot all about it.
I forgot to request an account.
I forgot my pen at home.
I forgot my money on the night table.
I forgot my password.
I forgot to get Tom out of the airport.
I forgot Tom could read French.
I forgot to wake up.
You forgot your actuarial home.
He forgot those keys back.
He'd sell his soul to the devil.
First, I don't have any crowns, second, no time.
Did I write everything right?
The principles neutralize oxygen.
I'm the last one to learn the truth again.
I lost again in the chess.
You're lying again.
You're back in your old ways, Tom.
We'll see Tom again.
I heard someone talk.
I deserve good things.
I deserve to know the truth.
They deserve what they get.
You deserve good things.
We slept.
My heart stopped.
Will anyone stop dealing with people?
He shot himself because of his unhappy love.
I'll shoot him.
I'll shoot him.
I'll shoot both of you.
They took her to court and raped her.
While I was reading, I called.
While Tom was still asleep, Mary was already upstairs.
You can still be with me.
You're not gonna break anything yet.
Did the police arrest him?
Did you shut Tom down?
Shut the fuck up.
I don't pay for this.
I won't pay for this.
That's what Tom's worried about.
I can't handle Tom.
You're not responsible for Tom's death.
Tom's mistake has been followed by the whole group.
I love you for that.
I'm not happy about that.
Three months ago Tom was dead.
They paid me five dollars for this bag.
She's stuck on him.
I'll call you back when I get to the bus stop.
I'll call you later.
I'll call you back later.
I'll call you back later.
Call back.
Call me when you're ready to go.
Call me when you're ready to go.
Call her tomorrow.
Call me, don't you?
Call me tomorrow.
Call your father and ask him.
Call him, please.
Call the rescue!
They locked Tom in the lock so he couldn't escape.
I locked the door so they wouldn't listen to us.
I closed all six windows.
Close the book.
Please close the door when you leave.
Close the fucking door!
You have to pay me for all my translations.
We're singing another song.
I called the bell and waited.
We got rid of some old things.
Get rid of the evidence.
She loved him.
I love that ocean.
I love you.
The arms industry brings benefits, but also suffering.
The rest of the day is for us.
There's only one day left.
What's the butter made of?
I totally don't agree to be treated like this.
With all my heart, I hope she's happy.
She seemed to be blind.
I thought I was fighting in the war.
I felt like I was in love with a beautiful girl.
I thought I changed my job.
I thought it was a cybulus.
I thought it was my friend from work.
I thought it was Daddy.
I thought about this down there.
I thought about Tom how he got back from the dead.
It seemed that the officer was afraid of their punishment.
Looks like Tom didn't realize that Mary was there.
Looks like Tom's got everything he needs.
Looks like Tom doesn't understand anything you said to him.
Tom didn't seem to be alone.
He seems to be very sleepy.
I think Tom's responsible for Mary's nervous breakdown.
It seems too dangerous.
Looks like I'm gonna be up all night tonight.
Looks like it's coming soon.
It seems I'm still asleep during the day, but it seems like I can't sleep at night at all.
Looks like I've done it all for free.
Looks like you're comfortable with yourself.
You seem to have the same problem as me.
I don't think anyone understands.
I don't think anyone understands.
You don't seem to take me seriously.
Looks like he saved a lot of money.
Looks like nobody noticed anything.
Looks like this war hasn't ended yet.
Looks like we're gonna have to do it.
Looks like Tom's world.
He seems to trust Tom as much as anyone else can.
Looks like Tom's crazy if it happens or not.
Looks like Tom's telling the truth.
Tom doesn't seem to remember any of us.
Looks like Tom's asleep.
Tom seems to have lost the meaning of life.
Looks like he knows everything.
He seems to be ignoring his obligations.
Looks like they're losing motive.
Here's a picture of my school.
There's got to be a connection here.
We left home early this morning.
I'm afraid I'm going to try this subject with her.
I'm afraid to ask Tom for help.
Healthy relationships develop freely.
Health is more important than wealth.
Health is the best gift.
It keeps her from work.
Only one of the twenty students read this book.

He asked if he'd come.
He asked if he'd come.
Let's ask Tom.
Ask Tom.
Ask your mother.
He made a sound, so everybody was listening.
He got some radio.
He's grown up, he's divorced and divorced, but he's also rich and famous.
He's done his best to stop thinking about her.
I didn't like him from the beginning.
Shut up, please.
Shut up!
Shut up.
We live alone.
We've been living in this town since 1960.
You like it here?

We found out who this woman is?
Did you find out where Tom was going?
I found out that the food was a bit sharp.
I found out my car's gone.
Did you find out how much Tom's got?
From the bus she was so wrong that she started to give up.
You fucked me up.
You ruined Tom.
Who are you afraid of?
Check if you haven't forgotten anything.
Check it out, please.
I tried everything.
I tried everything.
Son of a bitch!
Experience brings wisdom.
She tried it on her own.
I tried everything.
He tried to draw her attention.
I'll try and do something about it.
Try to have some compassion.
Try not to be stupid.
Try talking to the police.
Try it yourself.
You're trying not to take it so much.
Try to control yourself.
Try this!
Try to explain it to Tom.
Try it again.

They broke it.
He knows her.
He knows her.
Knowledge itself is the beginning of all wisdom.
We've known Tom for years.
I know him, but I don't know his name.

I know him very well because I've often seen him in his father's office.

She hasn't touched me since.

I was just about to write a letter when he came home.
They ruined my life.
I'd break all my jackets if I could.
You've canceled the meeting.
You're breaking that advice.
You're gonna miss this meeting.
She's got a face on her.
We can get much valuable information from that book.
You're tired.
I wouldn't play with that.
Tom's a man now.
It's a waste of time.
The loss of the job she loved so much was no sooner.
We lost all our equipment.
He lost her.
I lost the rain that gave me Tom to be born.
I lost the rain that gave me Tom to be born.
I lost my key.

I'd stay and tell myself, but I have to go.
They stayed in Tennessee.
We're still quiet.
Stay home.
Will you stay or will you leave?
Will you stay or will you leave?
Stay where you are or I'll kill you.
Stay with us!
Stay here and close the door.
Stay here!
Stay home and don't go anywhere.
Stay home.
I'll stay with her.
I'll stay in the motel.
I'm staying with you.
The science has won me.
Get your hands off before you answer.
Get out of the chair and help!
We'll call you.
We'll do it better.
You're gonna do it yourself?
Can you do it on your own?
Can you do it on your own?
I've allowed the path of minimum resistance.
He's calling me!
The bells broke.
The bells started ringing.
They called it.
I've turned my bike around.
We're used to everything.
I'm used to it.
It's a second attitude.
I used to live alone.
I used to win.
He used to have no hot food every day.
You'll get used to everything.
You'll get used to it.
