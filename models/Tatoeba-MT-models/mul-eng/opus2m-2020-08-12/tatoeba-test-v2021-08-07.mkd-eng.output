I offered to blow his ass up, but he answered that he wasn't available.
I talk to her a lot.
I've often heard him play the tune of the drum.
I often play football.
I'm often skiing.
I only have one minute.
I only practice to look nice when I'm naked.
I need to break your neck.
I owe him a lot of money.
I owe Tom this.
I paid a fine.
I'm going to skip lunch.
I'm planning on visiting Tom in Boston next week.
I like dogs more than cats.
I like cheese cheese more than cheese.
I prefer eggs from a subpoena.
I prefer the black one.
I'd rather sit down.
First I'd walk alone.
I must sound funny.
I promise I won't do anything to hurt you.
I hit his box in the street.
I pressed the button to turn on the radio.
I drew the word "Alis" to highlight it.
I offered it.
I put three coffees of fake sugar in your tea.
I opened my door.
I quit smoking. I quit smoking.
I gave up.
I'm looking at the stuff.
The Iranians are a peaceful people.
I read his book.
I read Tom's story to him.
I realized I hadn't eaten yet.
I'm really gonna get married.
I really like you.
I really don't know.
I really like your hair.
I really like wine.
I really like your website.
I really love your older sister.
I really missed you.
I really miss my mother's cooking.
I really miss them.
I really want to help him.
I really want to know what's going on here.
I really want to learn French.
It would be really nice to keep quiet.
I got this fax from her.
I recognize the guy.
I refuse to do that.
I refuse to work.
I remember meeting the Queen.
I'm revising his rude attitude.
I respect your decision.
I cried one.
The iron is more solid than gold.
Isaac Newton died as a girl.
I said I'd bring it.
I said maybe he'll turn it off.
I told you to open the door.
I said we're closed.
I agreed.
Is there anyone in there?
Is anyone surprised?
Did you miss something?
I've seen a spirit.
I saw an unidentified flight object.
I saw her a week ago.
Right now I've seen him.
I saw him play cards with all of them.
I saw him there.
I saw my sister filming the letter.
But I didn't see anything.
I saw it.
I saw them.
I saw the sunflower in the mill.
I saw Tom do that.
I saw Tom and Mary.
I saw Tom.
Is Boston far away?
Is Buddhism a religion or a philosophy?
Is Dan aware of what he did?
Are they caloric?
I don't see a spell here.
"I see," said the blind man.
I see Tom every day.
I see you're awake.
I sent Tom to Boston between me.
I left early to catch my first train.
Are they all busy?
Are they all happy?
Is everybody having fun?
Is everything there?
Is he breathing?
Did his aunt eat apples or bananas?
I just got off my head.
I definitely need to buy you a drink.
I should be sorry about them.
I need to take her home.
I need to pack up.
I have to move.
I should go home.
I shouldn't have believed her.
I shouldn't have done that without you.
I shouldn't have eaten so much ice cream.
I shouldn't have gone to Tom.
I should regret it.
I should look.
I should try to help them.
I should have asked her first.
I should have asked them first.
I should have asked you first.
I should have been a cult.
I should've checked.
I should've done it yesterday.
I should have known you'd be here.
I should have refused.
I showed you my room.
Is it cold outside?
Is it over?
Is it far from here?
Is Daddy really too slow today, or am I?
Is that the last lesson?
Is it time for us to go?
Is it true?
He's got a scarf.
I'm sleeping on my feet.
I'm sleeping in the stables.
I slept like a doll.
I slept in the kitchen.
I slept on the bus.
Nacoso, I cut the sandwich.
Did Mike stop drinking alcohol?
I laughed.
Isn't it exciting?
Isn't it possible for Tom to do this?
Isn't that unusual?
Isn't that dangerous?
Isn't that enough?
Isn't that too embarrassing?
Isn't that good news?
Isn't that the guy who wants to buy your house?
Isn't this too high?
I kind of like it.
I've been through snow cleaning all day.
Is she a cab driver?
Is she pregnant or just pregnant?
Is it really so beautiful?
Is that your mother?
I fucked up the man.
I started to see him.
I started thinking about him.
I found something strange.
Is that what Tom's doing?
Is that all we need?
Is that a rhetorical question?
Does that mean "yes" or "no"?
Is there a word at all?
Is that necessary?
Is that necessary?
Is that what I'm saying?
Is that satisfying?
Is that Tom's coat?
Is that what Tom thinks happened?
Is that what you did to them?
So there's Tom?
Is that why I'm here?
Is that why you're here?
Is that why you don't want to help him?
Is that why you don't want to help us?
Is that your package?
Is the bridge safe?
Is it hot coffee?
Is the house over?
Is the lake deep?
Is he paying for the delivery?
Is there a doctor here who knows English?
Is there any food?
Is there anyone else?
Is there anyone else here?
Is there sugar?
Is there anything else I can do for you?
Is there a problem?
Is there a reward?
Is there anything specific you want to see?
Is it about Tom?
Is this a good time to talk?
Is this where this is?
Is it a diamond?
Is that moral?
Is this exactly English?
This is Jupiter or Bub?
Is this our cabin?
Is that your radio?
Is anyone sitting here?
Is this a place?
Was that all the excitement?
Is this your picture?
Is this your bag?
This is your turn or his?
Is this yours, Tom?
I still don't believe Tom left.
I still don't believe it.
I still don't understand.
I still don't know how to do that.
I still don't understand women.
I still respect Tom.
I still like horses.
I stole it from them.
Does Tom know how to swim?
Is Tom back?
Is Tom aware?
Does Tom bring it?
Is Tom dead?
Is Tom dying of cancer?
Is Tom having fun?
Is Tom in Boston?
Is Tom interested?
Is Tom looking for them?
Is Tom mad at you?
Is Tom safe?
Is Tom still alive?
You talked to Tom?
Is Tom there by himself?
Is Tom with you now?
I stopped turning Tom's attention.
I've burned a guinea pig in the dark.
I'm learning the history of art.
I suddenly felt old.
I'm struggling with asthma.
I suggest you learn more.
I suggest we focus on the request to get out of the cave.
I suggest we go home.
I'm starving you to get up.
I suggest you send someone out to see what's going on.
I guess I should go talk to Tom.
I guess that's okay.
That's how I doubted.
I suspect Tom broke the window.
I was swimming in the river.
I swear it wasn't me.
I swear it was them.
I swear, I wouldn't even care about you if I burned you and you were the last cup of water.
I wake up every day.
Is the ice cream still working on you?
Is your head full of bruises?
I'm taking the opportunity to thank her.
Italian cops are driving me crazy.
I talked to my advisers about what I'm going to take.
That whole thing makes sense.
It looks like it's inconceivable.
It always happens the same way.
There can't be an accident.
So it wasn't.
It's not possible!
It's for you now.
It seemed a lot more than I expected.
Never, but never, could that ever happen here.
There's no way it was Tom.
That would be a disaster.
It'd be good.
I didn't think so.
We didn't mention that.
It didn't get so bad.
That disappointed him.
It'd look good.
Don't stop me.
He's not gonna get better.
It doesn't look very different.
It doesn't matter what you don't want to do; you have to.
It doesn't matter.
It doesn't seem to help.
Doesn't sound like he knows what.
That doesn't surprise me.
I'm giving Chinese.
I'm learning English.
It's me.
That gave me an idea.
I've got something to do with it.
It had to be done.
It must have been from somewhere.
Depends on your decision.
It happened too soon.
It's happening.
It's happening.
It's so easy.
There's nothing about luck.
It wasn't easy for us.
He's got a sentimental value.
I've been thinking about it all day.
I think about him every day.
I think he's right.
I think he's right.
I think something's hidden?
I think I can.
I think I could get used to seeing you every day.
I think I'd better help him.
I think I'd better help them.
I think I found one of these.
I think I'm pregnant.
I think I know him.
I think I know how to find him.
I think I know how to stop him from happening again.
I think I'm gonna eat outside.
I think I'm gonna go visit Tom and see what he's like.
I think I love you.
I think I'm pretty clear.
I think I'm pretty good at writing.
I think I'm a pretty normal guy.
I think it's possible to swim.
I think I'll be fine.
I think I should watch Tom.
I think I should have asked for help.
I think I speak French very well.
I think it's risky without any help.
I think it'd be best if I stayed here for a while.
I think it's time to start getting ready.
I think it's time you left now.
I think it's time to start getting ready.
I think it would be a mistake to borrow Tom's money.
I think I figured how much time we should leave.
I think I'm wrong.
I think maybe I can help her.
I think he's good at dancing.
I think so.
I think that hotel's gonna be a little expensive for you.
I think that's terrible.
I think that's ridiculous.
I think it's Tom.
I think you're right.
I think the box is empty.
I think they saw me.
I think Tom can help.
I think Tom left.
I don't think Tom's breathing anymore.
I think Tom's not breathing.
I think Tom's conservative.
I think Tom's brave.
I think Tom's crazy.
I think Tom's dying.
I think Tom's funny.
I think Tom's great.
I think Tom's serious.
I think Tom's hurt.
I think Tom's evil.
I think Tom's fine.
I think Tom's fat.
I think Tom's cute.
I think Tom's a vaccine.
I think Tom's rich.
I think Tom's right.
I think Tom's cursed.
I think Tom's cute.
I think Tom's approachable.
I think Tom knows who stole my wallet.
I think Tom might have a boyfriend.
I think Tom moved to Boston.
I think Tom needs a ride to the airport.
I thought Tom was just bluffing.
I don't think Tom's gonna go.
I think we can get him.
I think it's better not to drink the water.
We'd better not get out of this storm.
I think we'll join.
I think we're close to a solution.
I think we're ready.
I think we should call him.
I think we should help him.
I think we should work it out.
I think we should wait a little longer.
I think we ate enough.
I think we found one.
I think you did it.
I think you did it deliberately.
I think you know the rules.
I think you know Tom.
I think you know what I'm interested in.
I think you know who I am.
I think you'll have to help them.
I think you should call him.
I think you're panicking.
I think you're making the problem worse.
I think you're too sick to go to school.
I think you should choose her.
I think you should do this on your own.
I think you're helping me.
I think you were here before.
I think you've lived in the jungle for a long time.
I think they lied to you.
I think you're spending too much time with Tom.
I think you should get out of this alone.
I think you've helped me enough.
I thought about what Tom said.
I was thinking about you.
I thought there were bigger tits.
I thought he was there.
I thought I'd ask him for help.
I thought I'd ask them for help.
I thought I lost all my money, but I guess I was wrong.
I thought I'd never find him.
I thought I'd never find Tom.
I thought it was my fault.
I thought you already found a place to stay.
I thought they found him.
I think this is over.
I thought Tom was going well.
I thought Tom went to bed.
I thought maybe Tom knew where she put Mary's key.
I thought Tom might not want to go with us.
I thought Tom was coming from Boston.
I thought Tom was gonna be here.
I thought Tom was sick.
I thought Tom'd be busy.
I thought Tom wouldn't want any help.
I thought Tom wouldn't want to go with us.
So we didn't agree?
I thought we could help you.
I thought we'd sit here for a while and talk.
I thought we'd visit the museum together.
I think you're gonna have a job in the shower.
So you didn't want the prize?
I thought you found another one.
I thought you lost your manual watch.
So you don't hate him?
I felt tired.
I thought maybe you could help.
I thought you might be interested in finding out.
I thought you were only dating girls who were lower than you.
So you didn't know how to play a piano?
So you didn't say you knew how to swim?
So you didn't say you wanted to go with us?
I thought you'd be better at playing chess than me.
I thought you were crazy about Tom.
I thought you were funny.
I thought you'd live with us.
I thought you were in Boston.
I thought you were planning on staying in bed all day.
I didn't think you'd be busy.
I thought you wouldn't like Tom.
It hurts so much here.
Mary gets nervous when Tom leaves the hat from the chair.
It's a multiphase process.
It depends on whether we buy it or not.
He's at school the first day.
I can't answer the question.
There's no theoretical chance I'll finish my job in one day.
It's less cold today than yesterday.
It's not quite cool.
It's not expensive.
It's not over yet.
It's not that bad.
It's not wrong.
Can I serve with that?
I'm paying.
It doesn't matter.
They say the old hat is cursed.
It's starting to get into our mind that we can't ignore nature.
It's been hot since yesterday.
It's worth citing a famous passport for his essay.
He's writing on his head.
It's written on his face.
I'm kind of feeling wrong.
I just don't feel safe about it.
It just sounds boring.
It happens all the time.
It'll be okay.
It'll be Christmas soon.
It's gonna be hard to convince them.
It'll be okay.
It'll be worth it.
It looked terrible.
He looked funny.
You look right.
It looks very delicious.
It looks different.
I think I'm familiar.
It looks like eggs.
Looks like I had too much drinking yesterday.
Looks like these two guys are back in touch.
Looks like these two guys were calming down.
Looks like we're gonna have a snow Christmas year.
Looks like we're the only ones here today.
It looks nice.
That's how I got closer to Tom.
I'm out of here.
I'm worried.
It could be dangerous.
Maybe it'll be hard.
Maybe it's too late.
Maybe it sounded like a proposal, but it was an order.
Maybe he'll turn around tonight.
Maybe it's acting weird.
Maybe it'll be a long time before you see me again.
Maybe it's him.
It could be risky.
Maybe it's not just an accident.
He can come back today.
It must have been her.
I'm sure I'm surprised.
It must be perfectly symmetrical.
I told them when I saw them, and I told him.
I informed the police that Tom was with me at the time.
I told Tom about you.
I told Tom he wasn't welcome here.
I told Tom the truth.
I told Tom to tell you that.
I told you I couldn't.
I told you it'd be hard to get out.
I told you my father died when I was thirty years old.
I told you this would get tough.
I told you the truth.
I'm a teacher too.
I went on a trip to Boston.
I took care of it.
I've got it.
I got back on my bus.
I took Tom to lunch.
My pants have been removed.
I couldn't sleep all night.
I fully understand.
It's probably not worth waiting.
He came back two days ago.
He was having a lot of trouble.
I tried to explain it to him, but I didn't.
I tried to find Tom.
I tried to make him come.
I tried to make them stop.
I tried to pretend I'm something I'm not.
I'm really sorry about that.
I trust the teacher.
I'm trying not to mess up for you.
I'm trying not to make a mistake.
He's ready to turn.
That's classic.
It was a disaster!
It is recommended that you check whether there may be any side effects if you drink alcohol while taking your prescribed medication.
It's a kid's game.
That's a good system.
There's everything in the file.
It's all in the room.
We're done.
It's over now.
That's all they're talking about.
It's all very weird.
It'll be over for a while.
It'll be a little longer than midnight in Boston.
It's almost summer.
She'll have to go for a while.
Epten's fun.
It's already seven o'clock.
It's already 11 o'clock.
It's already open.
That's a minor mistake.
It's great you've survived.
It's a lot of fun.
There's nothing to think about.
Unfortunately, you've ruined everything.
It's about integrity.
That's a reasonable compromise.
That's a false track.
It's a risk plan.
Unfortunately, the concrete doesn't burn.
It's coming fast.
It's a simple thing.
It's a special cause.
It's a stupid rule.
It's a great idea, but it's gonna take a lot of work.
They blew it up.
It's just my mom's bringing me.
One week ago, up-down.
Three weeks have passed since Tom moved to Boston.
It's been a long time.
This week is extremely hot.
It'd be best if you didn't talk that much.
You better be alone.
It's better to be optimistic and be honest than being a pessimist and right.
"You'd better die on your feet than live on your knees." "Then why are you still alive?"
It's empty.
Sauna's here.
It's new money.
You scared me.
There's no one.
It's time to close.
Study here.
It's generally known that you don't like Tom.
It's dark here.
It's deeper than that.
It's definitely them.
It's definitely Tom.
It's different now.
It's hard to evaluate his ability.
It's hard to explain.
It's frustrating.
It's easier this way.
It's easier not to end up in jail than to escape.
It's easy to see why people love Tom.
You can easily distinguish them.
I guess I misjudged him.
It looks like her style.
I think it's the only possible conclusion.
It looks very well written.
It's empty.
That's what you need.
It's so bad to fly.
It's ten o'clock.
That's what happened before.
It's very rare.
It's fair.
It's fair.
It's to protect you.
It's from the Bible.
It's funny.
Watching TV is fun.
She's dressed.
It's dark.
It's getting harder to breathe.
It'll be wild.
It'll get colder.
It'll happen soon.
It's nice to see you all again.
That's a good practice.
It's okay.
It's getting better.
It's very fun.
It happened before.
It's happening right now, isn't it?
It's hard to explain.
It's her.
He's hot here in hell.
That should be possible.
It shouldn't take us a long time.
I don't care what you think about Tom.
It's impossible for him to quit smoking.
It's impossible to get out of the cell.
It's a safe place.
He's in a great position.
He's in the basement.
I'm just pushing.
A simple question is where.
It's just invented.
Just sit there.
It's a little forward.
It's locked.
It's made of skin.
I'm making a decision, Tom.
That's my only hope.
It's nice and fresher.
It's nice and warm.
It's better than wearing such gifts.
It's nice to feel like you need someone.
It's not a big miracle.
It's not a big miracle.
There's a lot of noise here.
It's not your job!
It's not a secret that Tom doesn't agree with you.
That's not a big priority.
That's not a mistake.
It's not attractive.
It's not back.
That's not exactly what happened.
It's not gonna be easy to do it without much help.
It's not hard to point out if you're surrounded by idiots.
It's no big deal.
It's not just a guess.
It's not usually a pen.
There's not enough light here to read.
It's not like we're doing something.
It's not my decision.
It's not my fault.
It's not necessary.
It's not absurd.
It's not that small.
It's not yet spring.
I'm not surprised.
It's not that deep.
It's not too early.
It doesn't depend on you.
It doesn't happen very often to buy a thousand dollars hat.
It's not worth a lot.
There was snow last night.
It's obviously a print error.
It's obvious to everyone that he's in love.
It's just a temporary solution.
Sounds like Tom.
Sounds really strong.
Sounds very good.
Our job is to help them.
It's white.
It's poison.
His presence is important to me.
It's probably hard.
It's probably right.
He's probably still there.
It's probably still available.
It's a doppelganger.
Actually, it's very common.
It's delicious.
It's very possible I'm not right.
It's possible that Tom won't help us at all.
It's really simple.
It's really exciting.
It's really bad.
It's a real damage.
It's really weird.
It's red.
It's so beautiful.
It's so complicated.
But it's strong!
It's a law!
It's so obvious that we don't need evidence.
It's getting dark.
It's still dark out there.
It's still on sale.
It's still working.
Not yet.
It's still growing.
He's still there.
It's weird how people in tropical areas eat their frozen food like carri.
It's stuck.
His surface was as flat as a mirror.
It's time for it again.
This is the best mission I've ever tasted.
It's a pajamas.
I'm so scared!
It's time to take care of work.
It's time to get up.
It's Tom's office.
It's too impressive.
It's too late for me to help you.
It's too dangerous to fight them at their choice.
It's very expensive.
It's bullshit.
It's wrong.
It doesn't last long.
It's unique and irreplaceable.
It's unnatural.
It's really hot.
I need to see Tom right away.
It's very easy.
It's very simple to understand.
It's hot here.
I don't care.
There's a wind.
It's from work.
You're losing.
It's yours to ask, Tom.
It's yours.
It's only three minutes on the water.
It's been all night.
He's been doing a lot more than I thought he would.
I needed a long time to get rid of those monsters.
Looks like you're an unexpected beauty out there.
I turned on the fan and I turned it over to the wall.
I've turned on the lamp.
I turned off the TV.
I rejected Tom.
It was a great honor to be invited to speak.
It was so beautiful.
That was shame.
It was about midnight.
This was an Arren day.
It was a great series.
It was all my idea.
It was all right here.
Everything was so easy.
That was an amazing night.
It was a meeting.
It was a terrible sight.
It was an honor.
That was an offer I couldn't refuse.
It was my pleasure to spend the night with a smart, spiritual and beautiful girl like you.
That was an extraordinary experience.
That was a surprise.
That was a wonderful experience.
It was a hard test.
It was a warm night.
It was a beautiful day.
It was a great day.
It was a great night.
That kind of behavior was a child by his side.
It was hot.
It was working.
It was pretty funny.
It was too late.
It was for her.
It was from her.
It was one of them.
It was fun yesterday.
He was having a party.
He was getting cold.
It was ironic.
It was my fault.
That was my suitcase.
It's nice of you to buy Tom such a nice present.
It was kind of nice of you to let me stay here last night.
It wasn't as difficult as I thought it would be.
It wasn't easy for me to admit I was wrong.
It wasn't easy to solve this problem.
It didn't matter.
It wasn't my idea.
It wasn't very good.
It was pretty disgusting.
It has been shown that the pain of dogs is higher than that of cats.
It was so great.
It was pretty funny.
Epten was very effective.
It was really good.
It was really nice.
It was really nice.
That was really attractive.
It was a lot of fun.
It was extraordinary.
It was necessary.
It was seven and a half.
The day was so beautiful that we decided to climb.
It was so obvious.
It was terrible.
He was still there.
Tom gave me the picture that's stuck in the suit.
It was Tom.
It was too little.
It was sad.
I arrived in Tokyo two months ago.
That was incredible.
It was very generous of you to buy us all these things.
It was very boring in that space because all the windows were closed.
It was Peter.
It was worth a try.
It was your fault.
It's not gonna be okay.
It won't be enough.
I'm not gonna be alone here.
There's nothing you can do to fix it.
They won't help lies.
It won't help you.
Good work.
It would be very normal to be angry with Tom.
It wouldn't matter.
I'll talk to you by tomorrow if I can explain everything to you.
I need you right away.
I've been watching you before.
I used to dream of becoming a dancer.
I hated you before.
I use it every day.
I'm using that computer.
I'm using this.
I've already packed.
I've already read it.
I've already written everything I needed to write.
I've already written my part of the report.
I've always admired Tom.

Would you lie to Tom?
Would he like that for Tom?
Would you do me a favor?
You want to go to dinner with me tonight?
Would you like a dog?
Would you like a brain bomb?
Would you like me to come with you?
Would you like more bread?
Would you like some tea?
Would you like to come here and watch a movie?
Would you like to watch TV?
Can you check those?
Can you deliver a message to Tom?
Could you take off your cigarette?
Would you put this in my car?
Can you talk loud?
Would you take part in this event?
Can you tell Tom we're back?
Wow, it's really late.
Look at this.
Oh, so that's great.
Oh, my God!
Write your birth date.
Write it to Tom.
If it does, it will fix... when the ear is born with a threat.
Yeah, bring me a cup.
Yeah, anyway.
Yeah, I said that, but I wasn't right.
Yes, my angel.
Yeah, and?
Yeah, so?
Yesterday I prepared a cake with cookies.
I came here yesterday.
It was hot yesterday, but it's sustainable today.
The yoke is coming from India.
You all look so busy.
You always forget.
You always get me wrong.
You're always leaving the point of the volcano.
Me and you will fly with the same plane.
You don't seem to know how it hurts if I hurt you.
You're doing great.
You're beautiful.
I can't live with you without you.
You're drunk!
You're my friends.
You're my luck.
You're my pride and my joy.
You're not Japanese.
You're not a Canadian.
You're not invited.
You're not sending.
You're one of us.
You're too proud of poon.
You're under oath.
You're kidding.
She came in front of them.
You asked me to help.
You're making bread in your ovens.
You beat her.
You borrow books.
You can ask me what you want.
You can ask them yourself.
You can ask Tom.
You can avoid such problems if you have these tips.
She can be trusted.
You can hurt me, hurt me, and even destroy my body, but you're never gonna ruin my mind.
You can come, but don't tell anyone else.
You can count on us.
You can easily recognize Tom because he's very tall.
You can eat as much as your soul likes.
Now you can go, sir.
You can go and stay as you like.
You can get out at the end.
You'll find out.
You can handle this.
You can take mine.
You can recognize children's voices without problems.
You can make your job easier.
You can rest.
Now you can sit down.
You can stay in here.
You can only stay if you're quiet.

You can rest.
You can talk later.
You can't beat me.
You can't call them.
You can't control me, Tom.
You can't undo that.
You can't undo that.
You can't do what you want.
You can't let her go.
You can't let him go.
You can't help us now.
You can't leave the baby alone.
You can't leave Boston today.
You can't let that happen.
You can't marry Tom.
You can't prove anything.
You can't sell it.
You can't sit there.
You can't take that away from me.
You can't treat me like this.
You can use my car.
You can use this car.
You can use this pen.
You'll get the data soon.
You're making a mess with broken pieces.
It's possible you're wrong.
You could have refused.
You'd be a great mother.
You better ask them first.
To find them.
You better go help him.
You better go.
You better let me do it.
You deserve a medal.
You deserve a higher salary.
You deserve better.
You'd be in my place too.
He's done a bad job.
You've done your job well.
You didn't buy that, did you?
You didn't give me a chance.
Didn't you know Tom was gay?
You didn't listen.
You don't see anyone coming in, do you?
You didn't tell me it wasn't okay.
You told Tom about it, right?
You did it already.
He gave it all to himself.
You don't have to like everything.
You don't want fish.
You're okay, aren't you?
Don't you have an accident key?
You don't know how long.
You don't have to be abnormal to work here.
You know my whore.
You don't know anything.
Dream you know.
You don't really love Tom, do you?
You don't have to be present for this.
You don't have to go.
You don't need to panic.
You don't have to wear anything.
You shouldn't write more than 400 words.
You don't think it's worth it, do you?
You don't understand business.
You don't want to do something that will remind them you're not really big enough to be here.
You don't want to go, do you?
You're not working here.
You're driving me crazy.
You forgot your morning!
You scared Tom.
He gave Tom the list, didn't he?
You have the right to a phone call.
You're going to pick Tom up and get him back.
You hit one.
You're not right, people.
You were right, boys.
Your hair's broken.
You hate us, don't you?
You've got a great job.
They're a threat to their conscience, aren't they?
You have a habit I don't like.
You've got a little town.
You have beautiful lips.
You were a great mentor to me.
You were busy.
You've got a nice eye.
You have a lot of different kinds of people here.
I respect you.
You don't have any idea how to do that, do you?
There's no reason to be afraid.
You don't think so, do you?
You didn't see it like that, did you?
You don't have a problem with it, do you?
You've got a really good manuscript.
Mickey's your hands.
You have to answer the question.
You have to ask them first.
You have to buy them a present.
You have to go home.
You need to help him.
You have to hurry up to catch the last train.
You've got to give up.
You have to attend.
You have to stick away from him.
You can't lose your condition.
You have to try, Tom.
You have very beautiful lips.
You've got a lot of spring eyes.
You heard me right.
Just get back from your vacation.
You missed him for a while.
You missed Tom for a while.
You don't get involved in this.
Children, this is where you're staying.
You knew, didn't you?
You know I'd do anything for your beautiful eyes.
You know I don't eat meat.
You know me better than you do.
You know me too well.
You know, you should ever hear it.
You know what I need.
You know, you don't mean anything to me anymore, Mary!
You're going to learn fast.
You'll learn to appreciate your health when you get sick.
Leave me alone.
You let Tom escape.
You want your life, don't you?
You'll be fine.
You're gonna get confused.
You'll be in danger.
You'll be my guest.
You'll be known for a while.
You'll feel better.
You'll get a copy.
It'll be better for you.
You'll get them back.
They're gonna make you mess.
You're gonna try, aren't you?
You're gonna go with me and a point!
That's what you're gonna have to ask.
You're gonna have to learn the next year.
You'll have to talk to Tom about what you expect him to do.
You'll need a map to travel by bus.
You're gonna have to sit still.
You'll never find her.
They'll never take you to that club.
You'll never guess.
You'll never know.
You'll understand when it's time.
It looked great.
You look familiar to me.
You look beautiful.
You look pretty bad.
You look very good.
You look sad, what's wrong?
You look imaginary.
You look very nice, Tom.
You've earned something.
You gave me a word.
You're bothering me.
Maybe you'll need it.
You can go anywhere.
Maybe you'll have to help us.
You can sleep here.
It wouldn't be bad to slow down.
She met my sister, didn't she?
Maybe you can help them.
You must be careful.
You must be confused.
You must be very easy.
You must've jumped.
You must be very proud.
You must be strong.
You have to show yourself first.
You have to forgive me.
You need to help her.
You have to protect the child.
You can't give up.
You have to overcome the difficulties.
You have to learn it worth it.
You need a friend.

You should do it somewhere else.
You need to make him listen.
You need to grow up and grow a little.
You need to help her.
You need to help me find him.
You need to hurry.
You have to do this to work.
You don't have to ask why.
He didn't give them a chance.
We only have one life.
One is life.
You should make it a habit to mix your teeth every meal.
You should go to a dentist.
You owe me nothing.
You pay me very well.
You made a good choice.
You probably think I'm a traitor.
She's gone to red.
He was running as fast as he could.
You burn your car.
You burn your car.
Your complaints upset me.
Your crimes made the graves of your ancestors feel.
Your demands are unreasonable.
Your desserts are welcome, but we're fine.
You're ready to cry.
You're totally right.
You're a real human leader.
You're acting weird.
You're a bride.
You're a pervert.
You're after them.
You're a good son.
You're a kind man.
You're all cowards.
You're all the same.
It's really you.
But she's changed her mind.
You really need a psychiatrist.
You really should have let me call a cab.
You're always tired.
You're a Mormon.
You're nobody and nothing.
You're a pig.
You're a prisoner.
You're a racist.
You're really smart.
It's you.
You're a smart man.
You're a wise man.
You're bad.
You're busy, aren't you?
You're capable, but you're jealous.

You're right now.
You're in power.
You're incapacitated.
You're an influential man.
You took my place.
You're not in any danger.
You're interested.
You're just afraid you're gonna have to kiss Tom.
You're something I'm tired of.
You're lucky I'm not late.
You're lucky.
You're lying to me.
You're mad at me. I can get to know you.
You're great.
You're discontinuing Tom.
You're my neighbor.
You're not my friend.
You're not so young anymore.
You're not weird.
You're not a woman.
You're not dressed.
You're not gonna find me.
You're not gonna find them.
You won't find us.
You're under her level.
You're under his level.
You're not ready yet, are you?
You're not so scared.
You don't suggest we give him all Tom's money, do you?
You're not too old, Tom.
You're not too old for her.
Now you can go.
You're crazy!
But you're smart.
You're our guests.
You don't have alcohol anymore.
You've got too much work to do.
You're specific.
You're part of our team.
You're a singer.

You're kidding me.
You're scared.
You're the only one who can laugh at me.
You're the only one who met Tom.

You misjudged her.
You're wrong, Tom.
You're lying, Tom.
People look strange to you.
Your future begins today.
Your hair smelled like spring.
You get too tight when you get sick.
Your health is very important to me.
Your house is very beautiful.
It's good to remember.
It's coming back your month.
Your mother put your cologne in the top of her face.
Your new guitar has a good sound.
Your journey is difficult.

Your sister's sleeping.
Your sons are very nice.
It's all your business here.
Your wishes are my order.
Your patent is broken.
That's what I said an hour ago.
You told me to call whenever.
He told you we'd never catch her.
He told you you'd help.
He said you were writing me a message last night, but he lied to me, obviously.
You saved my life.
You look desorientated.
I see you already know the answer.
You look like you're studying.
There's an infection in the Bible.
I guess it's hard for you to understand what I'm trying to tell you.
Do you share his interest in the book?
You should ask them for help.
You should ask Tom.
You should be ashamed of yourself.
Be careful not to miss out.
You should be happy for them.
You need to be proud.
You should eat less red meat.
You should eat more.
You should feel comfortable.
You should sleep well.
You should give him some space.
You should give them some space.
You need to go help him.

You only got 65.
You should try it.
You should try this.
You should try to write a letter of respect.
You should've asked her first.
You need to wear a helmet while you drive.
You should write him a letter of appreciation to Tom.
You smell like shit.
You sound like you're relieved.
You sound really safe.
You fucked your ass.
You're so beautiful.
You're really talking a lot.
You're talking too much about Boston.
You think she's weird just because she's not white.
The old man!
You two are very sweet together.
You used to be so funny.
You used to love Boston.
You're in the back.
They drank.
You've experienced a traffic accident, but you'll be fine.
You didn't thank us.
It was of great benefit to us.
You're right from the beginning.
You made white again!
You bought Mary something.
He beat me.
You win them.
You've done so much.
You scared her.
She's overextended!
You've got a nose.
You're too busy to take care of yourself.
You just got me wrong.
I promise you.
You got it now, don't you?
You have to let me deliver a message to Tom.
You have to let me go home.
You have to work together.
You ruined Tom.
You jumped a button.
You've probably seen a lot worse.
You've been doing this for a long time.
You saw what I could do.
You were amazing.
He was in love with Tom, wasn't he?
He was lucky they survived the attack.
You're wrong.
It's not that you weren't right.
Tom was right.
He was driving fast.
It was great.
You haven't slept all night, have you?
He was very brave.
He wasn't right about the picture.
You'll do as I tell you.
You'll find your toys and books.
You won't need that.
You're not gonna make it.
You won't win.
You're too safe for him.
You wouldn't want to be late.
Yeah, I'm mad.
