Dr. Lee was also concerned about reports that revealed that children in Turkey were now infected with A(H5N1) avian influenza virus without breastfeeding.
He stressed that some studies suggest that disease will become less deadly before it can cause a global epidemic.
It is feared that if they maintain flu-like symptoms of mild organs, patients may continue to be infected by more people during their daily routine.
According to Leslie Aun, a spokesman for the Komen Foundation, the organisation has implemented a new regulation prohibiting the granting of grants or funding to organisations under legal investigations.
The Komen's policy has excluded the Planned Parenthood due to an ongoing investigation by Parliamentary Cliff Stearns on how the organization's funds are spent and declared.
As Vice-President of the Supervisory and Investigation Sub-Committee for Energy and Trade, Stearns is trying to figure out whether the fees are used to finance abortions through the Planned Parenthood.
On Tuesday, the former Governor of Massachusetts, Mitt Romney, with more than 46% of the votes, won the presidential elections of the Republican Party of Florida.

The Associations Animal Liberation and the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA) are requisitioning the obligation to install closed circuit televisions in all of Australia.
According to the head inspector of the New South Wales RSPCA, David O'Shannessy, to the ABC, monitoring and control of the victims in Australia should be regular operations.
"The closed circuit TVs would certainly deliver a strong message to people working in contact with animals, i.e. their welfare has the highest priority."
The U.S. Geological Survey international map last week did not report earthquakes in Iceland.
No seismic activity has been reported in the Hekla area in the last 48 hours by the Icelandic Meteorological Office.
The significant seismic activity at the origin of the phase change was verified on 10 March at the end of the volcano, on the north-east side.
The presence of dark clouds was reported at the foot of the mountain, not related to volcanic activity.
The clouds created confusion about the possibility of a real eruption.
The moon was transported on board about 120-160 metres of fuel when it was sprayed, pushed on the fangs by strong winds and tides.

Under the Deng Xiaoping government, the first economic reforms were launched.
Since then, the volume of the Chinese economy has increased 90 times.
Last year, for the first time, China exported more cars from Germany and exceeded the United States by becoming the largest market in the sector.
In two decades, China's GDP could be higher than that of the United States.
The tropical storm Danielle was the fourth of the 2010 Atlantic hurricane season to which a name was given and became part of the eastern Atlantic Ocean.
The storm, located about 3,000 miles from Miami, Florida, is characterised by a maximum of 40 mph (up to 64 km/h).
The National Hurricane Center scientists predict that Danielle will acquire more strength and will become a hurricane within Wednesday.
The assessment of the potential impact on the United States or the Caribbean is difficult since the storm is far from the farm.
Born in the Croatian capital Zagabria, Bobek became famous playing in Partizan Belgrade.
He joined them in 1945 and stayed until 1958.
During his stay in the team, he totaled 403 dollars in 468 presences.
In the history of the club, no one has ever collected more presences or marks Bobek's goal.
In 1995 he was chosen as the best player in the history of Partizan.
The festivals are started with an extraordinary exhibition of the famous company Cirque du Soleil.
Next came the State Symphony Orchestra of Istanbul, a band of giants and singers Fatih ErkoÃ§ and MÃ¼slum GÃ¼rses.
So they're up on the stage with the dancers.

Fortunately, nothing happened to me but I attended a macabra scene when people tried to break the windows to escape.
They hit the windows with seats, but the windows were infrared.
"At last one of the panels was broken, and I was able to get out of the window," said Franciszek Kowal, who survived the incident.
The irradiated stars light and heat by means of energy that is expressed when hydrogen atoms combine (or form) between them, forming stronger elements.
Scientists are working to create a reactor that produces energy in the same way.
However, this is a very complex issue to resolve and they will have to be spent many years before effective fusion reactors arrive.
The steel needle on the water for the effect of surface tension.
The surface tension is due to the fact that the water molecules present on the surface of the water itself are strongly attracted to each other, more than the air molecules present above the same.
The surface molecules create an invisible film on the waterâs skin that allows objects, such as the needle, to gallop you above.
The range of modern ice mats has two sides with a concave cable between them. The double board ensures a better grip on ice, even when they are tilted.
The bottom of the blade is slightly curved and so when the blade falls from one side or the other, even the thread that is in contact with the ice describes a curve.
And that's what allows the cartridge to curve. If the cartridges turn to the right, the cartridge to the right, if the cartridges to the left, the cartridge to the left.
In order to return to the previous level of energy, they must be freed from what is in excess of the light.
To do so, they emit a small fraction of light, called "photos".
This process is defined by scientists "stimulated radiation emissions"; in fact, atoms are stimulated by a phase of intense light that causes the emission of a photo of light and light is a type of radiation.
The following image shows atoms that emit photos. Of course, photo dimensions are much lower than those described in photos.
The photos are even smaller than the material that forms atoms!
After working for hundreds of hours, the bulb filtration finally burns and the lampadine stops working.
The lamp must be replaced. It is necessary to pay attention when it is done.
First of all, it is necessary to spray the lamp switch, or select the cable.
This is because of the risk of electrical shock caused by electricity passing through the pressure in which the metal part of the tube is inserted, where the inside of the cap or the base in the metal of the tube is attached, if still partially inserted in the grip.
The main organ of the circulatory device is the heart, which is involved in pumping blood.
The blood flows from the heart through the tubes called arteries and returns through the tubes called veins. The smaller tubes are these capillaries.
The teeth of the triceratopo were able to spread not only the leaves but also the stronger branches and roots.
According to some scientists, Triceratopo eats cicadee, a common plant species in the Cretaceo period.
These plants resemble a small palm and have a kind of crown of pointed and accominated leaves.
With its stiff neck, a triceratop could break through the leaves and then eat the trunk.
According to other scientists, these plants are very veneerable, so it is unlikely that dinosaurs will eat them, even though today the salmon and other animals such as the papagall (which descends from dinosaurs) are able to eat leaves or Vellian fruits.
What effect would the strength of I have on me? If we were on the surface of me, we would weigh less than on the Earth.
A person on Earth weighs 200 pounds (90 kg), on Io would weigh about 36 pounds (16 kg). The force of gravity, therefore, exerts a lower pressure on us.
The Sun, unlike the Earth, has no cross on which to climb. The whole Sun is made of gas, fire and plasma.
The gas becomes less dense as far away from the center of the sun.
The visible outer surface of the Sun is called photo sphere, i.e. "light sphere".
About three thousand years later, in 1610, Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei, observing Venus with a telescope, saw the planet presenting phases, similar to those of the Moon.
The phases are checked because only the face of Venus (or of the Moon) turning towards the Sun is illuminated. The Vesusian phases evaluated the theory of Copernicus as the planets rotate around the Sun.
In 1639, a few years later, English astronomer Jeremiah Horrocks observed a passage from Venice.
A long period of peace for England was followed by the recovery of Danelaw.
In 991, however, Ethelred was faced with a fleet greater than any other than Guthrumâs time in the first century.
At the head of the fleet was Olaf Trygvasson, a Norwegian man motivated by the ambition of re-establishing his country by subduing it to the Danish rulers.
After a devastating military start, Etelredo came to agreements with Olaf, who returned to Norway to try to win his kingdom, with another success.
The Hangeul is the only alphabet invented intentionally for daily use by the people. It was conceived during the reign of King Sejong (1418-1450) in 1444.
King Sejong was the fourth king of the dynasty Joseon and one of the most beloved sovereigns.
At first, he called the alphabet Hangeul Hunmin Jeongeum, which means "The Right Sounds for People's Education".
There are many theories about the origins of the manuscript. One makes them appear to the Arians, who, moving from the West in India, would have brought their own language with them.
The Sanskrit is a classic language and is comparable to Latin spoken in Europe.
The first book in the world of which you knew was written in the manuscript. After the composition of the Upanishads, the manuscript lost its importance.
The Sanskrit is a very rich and complex language that has given rise to many modern Indian languages, just as Latin is the origin of some European languages, such as French and Spanish.
After defeating France, Germany began preparing for the invasion of Great Britain.
The attack was called "Operation Selion" code from Germany. The British army was in a state of fragility because most of its heavy weapons and supplies were lost during the evacuation of Dunkerque.
However, the Royal Navy remained much stronger than the German military Navy ("Kreegsmarine") and could have destroyed any fleet sent to invade through Manica.
However, the Royal Navy ships in the vicinity of the possible route of conquest were very few: the wonders, in fact, were afraid that they would be drowned by the German Air Attack.
We're starting to analyze what were the plans of Italy. Italy was essentially Germany's "small sister" and Japan.
They had an army and a weaker marine, even though they had built four new ships shortly before the start of the war.
The main objectives of Italy were the African countries. To win those countries, it would have been necessary to have a basis for the troops to enable them to cross the Mediterranean Sea and invade Africa.
It was therefore necessary to clear up the British bases and ships in Egypt. Moreover, it was not envisaged that the Italian warships would become another.
Now we're going to Japan, which was an island state, just like Great Britain.
Submarines are ships designed to move and remain underwater for long periods of time.
The submarines were used in the first and second world war. At that time they were very slow and had a very limited range of shooting.
At the beginning of the war they traveled mainly on the surface, but following the development of the radar and its greater precision, the submarines would have to go under water to avoid being seen.
The German submarines were called U-Boot. The Germans were very capable of guiding and operating them.
After the war, considering their success with these vessels, the Germans were considered dangerous if they had had a large number.
Yes! King Tutankhamon, sometimes called "Re Tut" or "the Pharaoh boy", is one of the most famous ancient Egyptian kings in modern times.
It is interesting to note that in ancient times it was not considered very important and was not added to the years of the oldest kings.
However, the return of his tomb in 1922 made him famous. Unlike many tombs of the past that have been dug up, this remains almost intact.
Much of the buried objects together in Tutankhamon are well preserved, and there are thousands of artifacts made with precious metals and rare stones.
With the invention of the raffle wheel, Asian cars became lighter, faster and better equipped to overcome soldiers and other cars.
Their mortal bullets were often able to enter into the army of enemy soldiers. About 1000 B.C. the Assyrians introduced the first cavalry.
The cavalry is an army fighting the horse. Because the sail was not yet invented, the soldiers of the Assyrian cavalry fought riding on the bottom of the horses.
We know a number of political personalities, scientists and Greek artists. The most famous character of this culture is Omero, the legendary poet who does not see it consists of two masterpieces of Greek literature: the poems Iliade and Odissea.
Sofocle and Aristofane are still prized dramas and their plays are considered among the most works of world literature.
Another famous Greek personality is the Pythagorean mathematician, known especially for his famous theorem, which establishes a relationship between the sides of the rectangular triangles.
There are various estimates of the number of people speaking Hindi. It is calculated that it is between the second and fourth languages with more speakers in the world.
The number of native speakers varies according to whether the dialects closely related to them are or not included in the account.
The estimates range from 340 million to 500 million people speaking the language, and up to 800 million people are able to understand it.
Hindus and Urdu have a similar vocabulary, but they are different in graphics; in everyday use, people who speak these two languages are usually able to understand each other.
About the 15th century, the north of Estonia was exposed to a strong cultural influence from Germany.
To draw close to God to the indigenous people, some German monks have invented Estonian literary language.
It was based on the German alphabet, with the addition of the letter "O/O".
In time, many words were added to the German loan. It was the beginning of a period of inspiration.
Traditionally, at the end of the school course, the yard on the throne reached the army directly.
Charles, on the other hand, attended the Trinity College in Cambridge, where he studied anthropology, archeology and, at a second time, history, achieved a 2:2 (vote class "Lower Second Class").
Carlo is the first member of the British real family who has won a prize.
3% of the country is made up of European Turkey (East Tracia or Rumelia in the Balkans Peninsula).
The territory of Turkey extends to more than 1,600 km (1,000 miles) of length and 800 km (500 miles) of width, with a more or less rectangular shape.
Turkey, including lakes, has an area of 783,562 km2 (300,948 square miles): of these, 755,688 km2 (291,773 square miles) located in Southeast Asia and 23,764 km2 (9,174 square miles) in Europe.
Turkey is the 37th largest country in the world; its sizes are approximately equal to the sizes of the metropolitan France and the United Kingdom together.
Turkey approaches the sea on three sides: west of the Egeo Sea, north of the Black Sea and south of the Mediterranean Sea.
Although Luxembourg had a long history, it reached independence in 1839.
Part of the current Belgium belonged in the past to Luxembourg, but became Belgian after the Belgian Revolution of 1830.
Despite Luxembourg has always tried to remain neutral, Germany has occupied both during both the first and the second world war.
In 1957 Luxembourg was one of the founding countries of the organisation known today as the European Union.
Located in the upper part of the district of Paro (in the village of Phondey), Drukgyal Dzong is a strong in ruins, besides a Buddhist monastery.
It is said that the fortress was built by Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel in 1649 to celebrate its victory over the Tibetan-Mungali.
In 1951 there was a fire, which survived only some remnants of the Drugkyal Dzong, including the image of Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyal.
Following fire, strength has been preserved and protected and continues to be one of Bhutan's most outstanding attractions.
During the 18th century, Cambodia was close between two very powerful neighbours, Thailand and Vietnam.
In the 18th century Cambodia was invaded more than once by the Thais, who destroyed the capital Phnom Phen in 1772.
In the last years of the eighteenth century, the country was also invaded by Vietnamese.
18% of Venezuelans are unemployed and most of them work in the informal economy.
Two thirds of Venezuelan workers are employed in the service sector, about a quarter in industry and a fifth in agriculture.
An important industry is the oil industry, in which the country is a net exporter, even though only 1% of Venezuelans work in this sector.
In the first years of the nation's independence, the experience of the Botanical Gardens of Singapore has determined the transformation of the island into a tropical city.

Every year, by October, nearly 1.5 million herbivores migrate from northern hills to southern plains, through the Mara River, due to the floods.
Then again heading north towards the west, crossing the Mara River again, following the beaches around April.
The Serengeti Region welcomes the Serengeti National Park, the Ngorongoro Conservation Area and the Maswa Game Reserve in Tanzania and the Maasai Mara National Reserve in Kenya.
Learning to create interactive media requires conventional and traditional skills, as well as the ability to use tools in interactive lessons (create a storyboard, audio and video installation, storytelling, etc.)
In interactive design, you need to reassess your assumptions about media production and learn how to think in a non-linear way.
The interactive design requires that the parts of a project interact with each other, but also act as separate entities.
The disadvantage associated with the use of the zoom objectives is the fact that the focus complexity, as well as the number of elements of the target required to achieve a wide range of focal lengths, are far higher than the fixed objectives.
Thanks to the increasingly high standards reached by producers in the production of lenses, the problem tends to be out of control.
This has allowed zoom objectives to give life to images whose quality is comparable to that achieved by fixed focal length targets.
The use of the zoom objectives presents a further negative aspect related to the fact that their maximum openness (speed) is usually lower.
For this reason, in conditions of lack of lighting and without a flash, zoom targets are difficult to use.
When you try to convert a film into a DVD format, one of the most common inconveniences is overscan.
In general, televisions are designed to satisfy public tastes.
That is why all the images we see on television had the upper, lower and lateral edges cut.
This is done to ensure that the image covers the screen completely and takes overscan name.
Unfortunately, when a DVD is produced, with all likelihood its edges will also be cut and, if there were subtitles located too close to the bottom, they will not be shown fully.
For centuries the typical medieval castle stimulates imagination, citing scenes of games, banquets and knights of King ArtÃº.
It is easy, too, to find among thousands of ruins, which return to mind the sounds and smells of distant battles, to perceive almost the noise of the zockles on the cittoli and to announce the fear that comes from prisons.
But our imagination is based on reality? First of all, why were castles built? In what way were they designed and built?
The Kirby Muxloe castle, a characteristic example of this period, represents a fortressed house more than a real and own castle.
Its large vets and subtly walls would not have been able to withstand long-distance attacks.
In the years beginning in 1480, when Lord Hastings began building it, the country was relatively peaceful and the necessary defence was only that against the small bands of nomads.
The balance of powers was a system in which the European nations committed themselves to maintaining the national sovereignty of each European State.
The concept meant that all European nations would be committed to preventing a nation from reaching the end of the world; that is why national governments often modified their alliances in order to maintain balance.
The Spanish postwar was the first focus on the issue of the balance of power.
This has marked a crucial change: the European powers would, in fact, no longer have the pre-existence of the wars of religion. That is why the last war to be defined as "religious" was the Thirty Years' War.
On 21 July 356 B.C.E., the temple of Artemis in Ephesus was destroyed because of a painful fire by Herodotus.
It is clear that its motivation was the awareness at all costs. The Ephesians, officers, declared that the name of Erostra would never be remembered.
The same thing we know today was noted by the Greek historian Strabone successively. The same night he came to the world of Alessandro Magno, the temple was destroyed.
Alessandro, king, offered to finance the reconstruction of the temple, but his proposal was rejected. Later, after his death, the temple was rebuilt in 323 B.C.E.
Make sure your hand is as relaxed as you properly perform the notes and also try not to make unnecessary moves with your fingers.
This way you can stop only the minimum necessary. Remember that to increase the volume you don't need to press the keys with much force as it happens for the piano.
On the fisharmonic, to increase volume, it is sufficient to exercise a higher pressure and speed on mantics.
The mysticism is a search for sharing and identifying, or conscious awareness of a final reality, of a divine, of a spiritual truth or of God.
The believer is looking for a direct experience, an insight or a vision of divine reality, divinity or gods.
The following keep specific lifestyles or practices designed to feed these experiences.
The mysticism differs from other forms of religious faith and worship for its emphasis on the direct personal experience of a particular state of consciousness, especially of peaceful, deep, beautiful, if not static.
Sikhism is a religion of the Indian subcontinent born in a Punjab region in the 15th century following a sectarian division within the Indian tradition.
The Sikhs consider their faith to be a religion separate from India, although they recognize their Indian roots and traditions.
Sikhs call their Gurmat religion, which in Punjabi means "the way of the guru". The guru, the central element of all religions of India, has taken such an important role in sikhism to constitute the heart of Sikh beliefs.
This religion was founded in the 15th century by Guru Nanak (1469-1539); after him there were nine other Gurus.
However, in June 1956, Krushchev's promises were put to the test when Poland's workers launched a protest against food shortages and wage cuts, which turned into a general insurership against communism.
Even if, in order to restore the order, Krushchev sent the armed cars, he consented to some economic demands and to the new prime minister of the famous Wladyslaw Gomulka.
The civility of the Indian valley is due to the age of the bronze and extended to the southern Indian subcontinent, which included much of modern Pakistan, as well as some areas of North-West India and North-East Afghanistan.
This civilization developed at the banks of the Indo River, from which it took the name.
Although some scholars claim that this civilization should be called "indo-Sarasvati civilization", because it also lived in the basins of the nearby Sarasvati River, some call it "Harappana civilization", from "Harappa", or the first of its sites, led to the light in the 1920s.
The military nature of the Roman Empire has contributed to the development of medical progress.
The first doctors were recruited by the emperor Augusto and constituted the first Roman health body used in the wars.
The surgeons knew several sedatives, including the morphine obtained from poppy seeds extracts and the scopolamine obtained from herbaceous plant seeds.
They have become experts in amputations to save patients from cancer, as well as in the use of haemostatic lactic acid and arterial pins to stop bleeding.
Over the centuries, the Roman Empire has seen the achievement of important obstacles in the field of medicine, which have provided the basis for modern knowledge.
The "Pureland" origami is an origami characterised by some limitations: it is possible to perform one single patch at a time and are not allowed more complicated tiles, such as those inverses. Furthermore, all tiles follow basic positions.
It was designed by John Smith in the '70s to facilitate work for the inexperienced or those who had limited motor capacity.
From a small age, children are aware of race and racial stereotypes and the latter influence behavior.
For example, children who are identified in a racist minority who are thought to have missed school results tend to not go well at school unless they come to know the stereotype associated with their race.
In the classification of the most used websites in the United States, MySpace is thirdly, with a current number of profiles equal to 54 million.
These websites have received great attention, especially in the field of education.
These websites present positive aspects, including the possibility of easily creating a page of the class that includes blogs, videos, photos and other features.
Access to this page comes through a simple web address that is easy to remember and digitize, even if students have problems with using keyboard or spelling.
You can customize it to make reading easier and you can also increase or decrease color according to your preferences.
The disorder of attention deficit "is a neurological syndrome which affects more common symptoms including impulsetivity, distraction, hyperactivity or energy excess".
This is not a learning disability, but a learning disorder; it "implies 3-5% of children, which is equivalent to about 2 million American children".
Children with ADD tend to focus on things like school tasks, but they can focus on what they like to do, such as play, watch their favorite animated cardboard or write sentences without punctuation.
These children tend to end up in gays, since they "take risk behaviors, engage in disputes and challenge authority" to stimulate their brains, as this cannot be stimulated by traditional methods.
ADD requires relationships with cotanians since other children are unable to understand that their level of maturity is different or the reason why they behave or write in a certain way.
Since the change in the ability to acquire knowledge and learn, as mentioned above, the basic speed to which knowledge was acquired has also changed.
The way to get information was changed. The point was no longer the individual memory; the focus was on the ability to remember the text.
In practice, the Renaissance has significantly changed the approach to learning and disclosure of knowledge.
The famous no longer use their hands for hunting, to carry weights or to do away with trees, on the contrary of what other primates do.
The hands and feet of the chimpanzees have similar dimensions and length, as a result of the fact that their hands support body weight when walking on the nights.
The man's hand is shorter than his foot, and the falsangs are more entitled.
The passage in the specialization of the hand from the movement to manipulation is shown by bone fossils of the hands of two/three million years ago.
Some believe that doing so with a certain frequency can be particularly exciting.
The main reason for this phenomenon is the product of bright dreams, which extend the period of time between the REM phases.
By reducing the nightly frequency of REMs, the state in which you experience effective sleep and the body recovers more rarely at the point of creating a problem.
Everything's rather fascinating as if we had to wake up every twenty or thirty minutes to watch TV.
The effect varies according to the frequency with which every night your brain tries to dream clearly.
From the beginning, things were not going well for the Italians in North Africa. Within a week of the Italian war declaration on 10 June 1940, the British of the 11th U.S. Regime won the Forte Capuzzo in Libya.
The English captured General Latucci, commander of the 10th Italian Army Army, looking for him as an embassies in East Bardia.
On June 28, he was the friend fire to kill the Marine Italiano Balbo, governor general of Libya and likely heir of Mussolini, during the voyage to Tomburi.
Today the screen is practiced at various levels, from students who learn to practice this sport at university to professional and Olympic competitions.
This sport is mainly in the fight between two opponents, where one screen is double with the other.
The golf game is to hit the thumbs up to the holes using sharp fittings.
A regular tour provides for a dozen holes, with players usually starting from the first hole of the road and ending at the eighteenth.
The winning player is what uses less hits, say shift of the mouse, to complete the path.
The game takes place on the tree and what surrounds the hole, called "green", is cut short.
The type of tourism may be more common than most people associate with the idea of travel: recreational tourism.
This type of tourism has its place where people go to a very different place than those in normal everyday life, with the aim of relaxing and having fun.
Beaches, thematic parks and campsites are the most frequent places by recreational tourists.
When the purpose of the visit in a specific place is to learn history and culture, then this type of tourism is called cultural tourism.
Tourists can choose to visit more interesting points of interest in a particular country or simply choose to focus on one area.
Even the columns, noting this activity, had called for reinforcements.
Among the troops that enriched the advanced positions were the 1st and 3rd New Hampshire regime composed of 200 men under the command of Colonels John Stark and James Reed (both became general).
Stark's men took a position along the defense on the north side of the column position.
When the bottom sea opened a boat along the Mystic River to the north-east of the peninsula, the defenses were quickly extended thanks to a small stone wall to the north, which ended on the river of a small beach.
Gridley or Stark planted a tree at about 100 feet (30 m) from the reconnaissance, ordering him not to shoot until the regulars did not overcome it.
The American plan was to launch coordinated attacks by three different directions.
In order to prevent the arrival of any reinforcements, General John Cadwalder would have launched a different attack on British troops in Bordentown.
General James Ewing would have led 700 million people through the river near Trenton Ferry, then take control of the bridge on the Assunpink River and prevent the escape from enemy troops.
The main assault force, consisting of 2,400 men, would have crossed the river nine miles north of Trenton, then split into two groups, one Commanded by Greene and the other from Sullivan, and transferred an offensive before the Alba.
Passing from the quarter of a thousand to the middle of a thousand, speed becomes much less important, while resistance becomes a real need.
Of course, a poet who wants to face a race of half a thousand at a certain level, a man who is able to beat the two minutes, must have a significant dose of speed, but above all it is the resistance that must be trained.
The most suitable preparation for the race season is provided during the winter for a few field courses associated with a training in a specific gym for the upper part of the body.
Proper nutrition practices are not enough to generate high performances, but they can have a significant impact on the general well-being of young athletes.
Maintaining a healthy energy budget, living in a proper hydration and understanding the various aspects of integration practices can help athletes improve their performance, as well as increase their pleasure in sports.
The average distance course is a relatively low-cost sport, however, there are wrong convictions about the little equipment needed to participate.
Products may be purchased at random, but most of these will have a demanding or no impact on performance.
The athletes may prefer a product even if it does not offer any real benefit.
We can consider the atom as one of the essential matter matter matter matter.
This is a very complex entity, according to the simple model of Bohr, from a central core on which orbits the electrons, a bit like planets orbiting the sun, is shown in Figure 1.1.
The nucleus is composed of two types of particles: neutrons and protons.
Protons have a positive electrical charge, instead neutrons are free of charge. The electrons are characterised by negative electrical charge.
In order to examine the victim, it is necessary to inspect the scene in order to ensure its safety.
As we approach the victim, pay attention to its position and possible presence of automatic signs of danger.
If you try to be helpful, you can only make things worse.
The study revealed that depression, fear and disaster were mediating the relationship between pain and disability in people affected by lumbargia.
The effects of disaster are the only to be conditioned by structured weekly sessions of physical activity, not depression and fear.
Those involved in regular activities needed more support, in terms of negative perception of pain, to distinguish the differences between chronic pain and the feeling of discomfort due to normal physical movement.
The vision or ability to see depends on the senses organs or the eyes of the visual device.
There are various eye structures, whose complexity varies according to the needs of the body.
The various structures have different capacity, are sensitive to different wave lengths and have variable accuracy degrees, in addition they require different processes to interpret the signal and different numbers to function optimally.
A population is composed of all organisms of a specific date within a specific geographical area.
When all individuals of a population are identical from the point of view of a specific phenotypic treatment, it is said that they are monomorphic.
Individuals who have different variants of a specific treatment are defined polymorphic.
In addition, the colonies of legionary shapes mark and nidify in different stages.
In the nomad phase, during the night the legionary formations march, then camp for day.
The colony enters a nomad phase following food reduction. During this phase, the colony realizes the temporary nests that are changed every day.
Each of these brands or anger nomads lasts about 17 days.
What is a cell? The term "cell" comes from Latin "cell", which means "small room", was used for the first time by a microscope who was studying the structure of the suggestion.
The cell is the basic unit of all living beings; all organisms are actually made up of one or more cells.
Cells are fundamental and essential for the study of life; they are not often defined as "the matter of life".
The nervous system is able to keep the homeostasis through the transmission of nerve impulses throughout the body to keep the flow of blood in motion, and without interference.
These nerve impulses can be sent very quickly to every part of the body, so as to protect it from any potential threat.
Returners attack a limited area compared to other violent storms, but they can destroy anything at their passage.
The backyards cut trees, scrape steel from buildings and scale cars for air. Among the most violent turnouts, 2% has a longer than three hours.
During these demonstrations, winds can reach 480 km/h (133 m/s; 300 mph).
For thousands and thousands of years, man has built and used magnifying lenses.
But the first true telescopes were created in Europe at the end of the 16th century.
These telescopes used a combination of two lenses to make the closest and larger objects appear.
Audacity and selfishness will always be part of us. It is in the nature of cooperation that when the majority will have benefits, acting selfishly will generate more gains in the short term.
Hopefully, most people will understand that the best choice for them in the long term is to work with others.
Many people imagine the day when human beings will be able to travel to another star and explore new worlds, some wonder what is out there, others think that on other planets they can live alien lives or other forms of life.
But if this should never happen, it probably won't happen for a very long period of time. The stars are so scattered that there are billions of kilometers between the stars that prove to be "near".
Almost one day your prospects will be in a foreign world and they will think of their ancient ancestors!
The animals are made up of many cells. They eat food and digest it internally. Most animals are able to move.
Only animals have a brain (even if not all: the meduses, for example, are not provided).
On the earth, the animals are everywhere. They crawl on the earth, swim in the waters of the oceans, and fly into heaven.
The cell is the smallest structural and functional unit of living organisms (things).
The cell is derived from the Latin word "cell", which means a small room.
If the living beings are observed in the microscope, it can be noted that they are formed by small squares or small spheres.
English biologist Robert Hooke, with the help of a microscope, observed the small squares in the suggestion.
They looked like rooms. It was the first to watch dead cells.
Elements and compositions have the ability to pass from state to state without any changes.
Gaseous nitrogen preserves the same properties of liquid nitrogen. The density of liquid state is higher, but the molecules remain the same.
Another example is water. The water composition is composed of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen.
It has the same molecular structure, both in the gas condition and in the liquid or solid.
Even if its physical state can change, the chemical state remains unchanged.
Time is something that surrounds and influences all our actions, but it is difficult to understand.
Time is the subject of study of religious scholars, philosophers and scientists for thousands of years.
We understand the time as a series of events that will pass from time to time through this.
The time is also the unit of measure we are dealing with the duration (length) of events.
Each of us can scan the passing of time by observing the repetition of a cycle event, which is something that is systematically repeated.
Today computers are used to manipulate images and videos.
Thanks to computers it is possible to build search animations, which are increasingly available on TV and in movies.
Music is often recorded using sophisticated computers to produce and mix sound.
In the 20th and 20th centuries it was believed that the first inhabitants of New Zealand were the Maoris, a people who had hunted huge birds called moas.
The theory then established the idea that the Maori people had been emigrated from Polynesia with a great fleet and finally in New Zealand was subjected to the Morioris, establishing a agricultural society.
New evidence, however, suggests that the Morioris were a group of Maoris of the farm that from New Zealand migrated to the islands of Chatham, developing their own peculiar peaceful culture.
On the islands of Chatham there was also another tribe; it was Maori from New Zealand.
They were called Moriori and, after some delay, they were finally scattered away.
People who have been dealing with us for decades have helped us to appreciate our strong points and our passions, while at the same time we honestly considered our difficulties and also our failures.
By listening to the people who shared their personal, family and organizational stories, we have received very useful information about the past and some of the characters who have had an uplifting, positive or negative, about the organization's culture.
Even if knowing a person's history does not necessarily mean understanding his culture, it helps people to understand where they are located within the organization.
In assessing the progress and taking account of the failures, both individuals and all participants have been able to discover more in depth the values, objectives and training forces of the organisation.
In this case, recalling previous examples of business behaviour and the related success has helped to open people to new changes and directions for the local church.
These cases of success have mitigated the fear of change, creating positive attitudes towards change in the future.
Converging thinking schemes are techniques for solving problems: they combine different ideas or areas to achieve a solution.
This type of thinking emphasizes the speed, logic and accuracy, also focusing on the recognition of the facts, the application of existing techniques and the collection of information.
The most important factor in this way of thinking is: there is only one correct answer. It is thought only of two answers, that is to say a right and wrong.
This type of thinking is associated with certain scientific or traditional procedures.
People with this kind of thinking have a logical thinking, are able to remember schemes, are able to solve problems and can work on scientific tests.
Human beings are the most long-term species capable of reading the mind of others.
This means that we can accurately predict what other people perceive, understand, think, know or wish.
The key among these skills is understanding the other intentions, which enables us to resolve possible ambiguities of physical behavior.
For example, if you are able to see a person breaking the window of a car, it is easy to conclude that you are trying to steal the car from an unknown person.
If he lost his car keys and himself trying to lose his own car, he should be judged differently.
The physical phenomenon known as nuclear magnetic resonance (RMN), discovered in the 1930s by Felix Bloch (University of Stanford) and Edward Purcell (University of Harvard), is based on magnetic resonance.
In this resonance, the atoms emit weak radio signals because of the magnetic field and radio waves.
In 1970, medical and scientific researcher Raymond Damadian provided the basis for using magnetic resonance for images as a tool to perform medical diagnosis.
Four years later he gets the first patent in the world in the field of magnetic resonance.
In 1977, Dr. Damadian completed the construction of the first scanner for the magnetic resonance "integral", which he called "Indomitable" ("Indomible").
Asynchronous communication promotes time for reflection and reaction to others.
It allows students to adapt their activities to their own pace and manage the speed of educational information.
There are also fewer time links and this makes working hours more flexible. (Bremer, 1998)
Thanks to the use of the Internet and the World Wide Web, students can access information at any time.
Students can also send questions to teachers at any time of the day and wait for answers in very early times rather than wait until the next person's meeting.
The post-modern approach to learning offers freedom from absolutes. There is no only valid way to learn.
As there is no right thing to learn: it is the experience between learning and knowledge presented to give place to learning.
This theory is evaluated by our current experience in the field of television broadcasts on your face and which provide information.
It is very common to see a television program that gives information about a procedure or tells an experience that will never take part or which will never be applied.
We will never repair a car, we will never build a fountain in the garden of the house, we will not go to Peru to visit the old ruins, or we will rebuild the house of our neighbor.
Submarine links in optical fibre with Europe and broadband satellites allow Greenland to be connected with 93% of the population online.
It is likely that your hotel or guest (if you stay in a guesthouse or in a private home) have Wi-Fi or a computer connected to the Internet; you will also find anywhere on the Internet a coffee or a public Wi-Fi place.
As already stated, although the term "eschemese" is acceptable in the United States, it has been regarded as derogatory by the non-US Arctic populations, especially in Canada.
Even if you can hear this word spoken by the Greenlandese natives, foreigners should avoid using it.
Inuit in Canada and Kalaalleq (a Greenlandese, Kalaallit multiple) in Greenland are self-defined.
In Greenland, crime and hostility towards foreigners are practically absent. Even in cities there are " dangerous zones".
The only real danger for an improvised traveler may be the cold.
If you visit Greenland during the cold season (being present that you will move north more and it will be colder), it is essential to equip yourself with enough warm clothing.
Long-term summer days can lead to sleep problems and health problems.
During the summer period, attention is also paid to the Nordic zoos. They do not transmit diseases, but they can be annoying.
The economy of San Francisco is diverse, although it is linked to its global tourist attraction.
The most important employment sectors are professional services, government, finance, trade and tourism.
Music, film and popular culture have often represented the city, contributing to the world fame of the city itself and its monuments.
San Francisco has developed a large tourist infrastructure, with numerous hotels, restaurants and excellent congressional facilities.
San Francisco is also one of the best cities in the state where other Asian cuisine, such as Korean, Thai, Indian and Japanese, is enjoyed.
For many American families, Walt Disney World is one of the most important trips.
The typical travel program provides a flight to the international airport of Orlando, a bus for a local Disney hotel, a stay of about a week only within the Disney property and a return home.
There are endless possible variations, but this is what most people think when it comes to "go to Disney World".
Many tickets sold online through site of aste, such as eBay or Craigslist, are valid Park-hopper tickets for several days and partly used.
Although it is a very widespread practice, it is prohibited by Disney: tickets are not transferable.
In order to be able to camping under the border of Grand Canyon, you must obtain a backcountry permit.
In order to safeguard the canyon, permits are available in a limited number and are required on the first day of the month, four months before the start month.
As a result, from 1 January a backcountry permit will be available for any start date by May.
The spaces available in the most popular areas, including the Bright Angel Campground, which is attached to the Phantom Ranch, are usually filled with requests received on the first day of booking.
A limited number of permits are available for free booking requests, assigned in order of arrival.
Getting into South Africa by car is an extraordinary way to admire the beauty of the region and to reach out to tourists.
For this purpose, with careful planning you will be able to use a normal car, but it is strongly recommended for a 4x4 vehicle. Many other locations are only available with a 4x4 high interest rate.
When you plan this trip you note that South Africa is a stable country, but the bordering countries are not always.
The visa requirements, as well as its costs, change on the basis of the nation and depend on the country of origin.
Each country also has specific laws setting out which emergency instruments should be present in the car.
Victoria Falls is a town located in the western part of Zimbabwe, near the border with Livingstone, Zambia, and near Botswana.
The city is located next to the castles: these represent the main attraction of this tourist destination note, which also offers many opportunities for longer stays, both for lovers of adventure and for lovers of panoramic life.
The volume of water increases during the pivoge season (from November to March) for which cascades seem more graphic.
It is impossible not to swim through the river or walk along the paths that cost the catacombs.
On the other hand, it will be for the huge volume of water that the view of the cascades will be dark; from all that water!
Tutankhamon Tomb (KV62). KV62 is probably the most famous tomb of the Valley of Re, the scene of the discovery by Howard Carter in 1922 of the real burial near the young king.
But, compared with most of the other real graves, Tutankhamon's tomb is almost not worthy of being visited, since it is much smaller and seldom decorated.
Only the head and back are visible, so anyone who wants to see the evidence of damage caused to the mummie then attempts to remove it from the bar will be disappointed.
The great treasures of the tomb are no longer within it, being transferred to the Cairo Museum of Egypt.
To tourists who have little time available we recommend visiting other places.
Phnom Krom, 12 km south-west of Siem Reap. The temple was built on the summit of a hill at the end of the 19th century, during the reign of King Yasovarman.
It is worth scaling the hill to enjoy the dark atmosphere of this temple and the panorama on Lake TonlÃ© Sap.
On a visit to the site you can easily combine a boat ride on the lake.
To enter the temple you need the pass Ankor Pass, so to go to TonlÃ© Sap you need to remember to take the passport.
In addition to being the largest city of Israel, Jerusalem is the capital, although most other countries, such as the United Nations, do not recognize it.
This ancient city that rises on the hills of Judea has a millennial and fascinating history.
It is the holy city of the three monotheist religions, that is, Judaism, Christianity and Islam, and plays the role of a spiritual, religious and cultural center.
For the religious meaning that gathers and, above all, for the many sites present in the area of the Old City, Jerusalem is one of the main tourist resorts in Israel.
Jerusalem offers many places of historical, archaeological and cultural interest, as well as live and abandoned shopping centers, bars and restaurants.
To enter Ecuador, Cuban citizens arriving through international airports or border crossing points must have received a previous letter of invitation.
This letter must be legalised by the Ecuadorian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and must also comply with certain requirements.
These requirements were introduced to regulate migration flows between the two countries.
Cuban citizens entitled to a U.S. green card must turn to an Ecuadorian consulate to obtain the exemption from this requirement.
The passport must have at least 6 months after the travel dates. To show the duration of the stay, a ticket is required to go and return.
Tours are more economic for the more numerous groups, so if you are alone or in the company of a single friend, you can try to meet other people to form a group of four or six, so that you can have a more affordable person tariff.
In any case, it is not something to be underestimated, as tourists are often pushed forward and back to fill the cars.
In fact, it seems to be more a way to convince people that they have to pay more.
At the northern end of the Machu Picchu, this snowy mountain is raised, often in the background of many photos of ruins.
Viewed from the bottom, it looks a bit scary; it's a quick and complicated climb, but people with a discreet physical shape should be able to compete with the company in about 45 minutes.
The stones are present on most of the road, and in the fastest parts steel cables constitute a support corridor.
This said, you expect to remain silent and pay attention to the darkest points, especially when they are bathed, since they can become rapidly dangerous.
In the vicinity of the roof there is a small hole rather low and narrow that must be crossed.
To admire the places and the wild forest of the Galapagos it is recommended to use the boat, just as Charles Darwin did in 1835.
The waters of the Galapagos are served by more than 60 ships from cross-border sizes, from 8 to 100 passengers.
Most people book their place very early (the boats are usually full in high season).
Make sure that the travel agent with whom the booking is made is an expert in Galapagos with a good knowledge of the various types of ships.
This will allow you to draw your own interests and/or special links with the most suitable ship.
Prior to the arrival of the Spaniards in the 16th century, the Northern Chile was controlled by the Incas, while the central and southern parts of the country were occupied by the indigenous peoples of AraucanÃ­a, the Mapuche.
The Mapuche were also among the last independent American indigenous groups: they were actually completely absorbed by the Spanish rule only after the independence of Chile.
The Chile will declare independence in 1810 (in the middle of the Napoleonic wars that left Spain for a couple of years without a central government working), but the decisive victory over the Spanish was achieved only in 1818.
The Dominican Republic (in Spanish) is a Caribbean country located on the eastern half of the island of Hispaniola; the other half belongs to Haiti.
In addition to having white sand beaches and mountain landscapes, the country hosts one of the oldest European cities in the United States, now part of Santo Domingo.
The first inhabitants of the island were the Tainos and the Caribbeans. The Caribbeans were a people of the Arawak language that prevailed about 10000 B.C.E.
The population of the Tainos, within a few years of the arrival of European explorers, was drastically reduced by Spanish conquerors.
According to Fray BartolomÃ© de las Casas in "Tratado de las Indias", Spanish conquerors killed about 100,000 Taino between 1492 and 1498.
JardÃ­n de la UniÃ³n. This space constituted the Atrium of a 17th-century convention, which is now the Church of San Diego.

CafeNet El Sol offers a 30-dollar booking service, or $10 for daily passports; details are available on the operator's Corcovado page.
Cook Islands are located in Polynesia, in the heart of the southern Pacific Ocean; they form an island state free of association with New Zealand.
This is an archipelago consisting of 15 islands distributed on an ocean surface of about 2.2 million km2.
The islands, which have the same time zone of Hawaii, are sometimes considered in the same Hawaii issue.
As little as possible, to some older travelers, the island reminds Hawaii before becoming a state, without large hotels for tourists and other transformations.
Cook Islands are composed of 15 different islands, the main are Rarotonga and Aituta, but there are no cities.
Today in developed countries to offer luxury bed & breakfast facilities has become almost an art form.
The B&Bs of the higher phase of nature are especially competitive at bed and breakfast level.
In fact, in the most refined structures of this category it is easy to find elegant lens, hand-made
Breakfast can include typical seasonal prettiness of the area or a speciality of the home home pattern.
The environment can be a historical building with old furnishings, clean gardens and a pool.
Getting out of the car and leaving for a distant destination has the inner fascination of simplicity.
Compared to larger means, you will probably already have a certain mix with your car, and you know the limits.
The installation of a store on a private property or in a city, small or large which is, can easily be subject to unwanted attention.
In essence, your car is a great choice for a trip on the road, but it is difficult for her, as such, to represent a good means of "camping".
The camping in the car is possible if you have a car, a SUV, a Berlin or a wagon station with the superior seats.
Some hotels benefit from traditions ranging from the age of gold, the age of railways and transatlantic steam before the second world war, between the 19th century and the early 20th century.
These hotels were located in places where the rich and famous people of the time lived and often offered a refined kitchen and night entertainment.
Old-style furnishings, the lack of latest supplies and a certain grace without time contribute to their nature.
Although they are generally private property, they sometimes host heads of State and other visiting authorities.
A traveler with a lot of money might consider the idea of a flight around the world, with support to stay in many of these hotels.
A network for the exchange of hospitality is an organization that allows travellers to contact people living in cities who are going to visit.
Usually to enter a network of this type it is sufficient to compile an online module, even if some networks offer or require further verification processes.
So a list is provided, in card format and/or online, that reports the available hosts and that, sometimes, can be full of other travellers' references and reviews.
Couchsurfing was founded in January 2004, following the episode in which the programmer Casey Fenton had found an economic flight for Iceland, but had not found a accommodation.
He contacted the local university students by email and received an outstanding number of free accommodation offers.
The hostels revolve around young people (a typical guest is on the wind), but often it is also possible to find older travelers.

The city of Pechino, in China, will host the 2022 Winter Olympic Games, so it will become the first city to host both the summer Olympics and the Winter Olympics.
Pechino will host the opening ceremony and the closing ceremony, as well as the ice events that take place on the roof.
In the skiing understand of Taizicheng in Zhangjiakou, which is about 220 km (140 miles) from Pechino, further skiing will take place.
Most of the temples have an annual festival starting from November to mid-May, which varies according to the annual calendar of the single temple.
Most of the temple celebrations are held in the context of festivals organised for the templeâs anniversary or for the fulfillment of the godship that presides over the temple or for any other important occasion associated with it.
The festivals of the temples of Kerala are very fascinating to see, with numerous processions of festivalsed elephants, temple orchestras and other celebrations.
For World Fair (usually also defined as World Exhibition or simply Expo) there is an international festival of great-scale arts and sciences.
The participating countries offer artistic and educational exhibitions in national landscapes to expose the issues of the world or culture and the history of their country of origin.
The international exhibitions of art are events dedicated to the exhibition of floral compositions, botanical gardens and all that it has to do with plants.
Although theoretically they can be carried out every year (in different countries), this does not happen in practice.
These events usually last between three and six months and take place in areas not less than 50 hectares.
There are many different types of film, which have been used over time. The most common is the standard 35 mm film (negative 36x24 mm).
Usually it can be provided quite easily if it is exhausted and ensures a more or less comparable resolution than that of an existing DSLR.
Some medium-format analogue cameras use dimensions of 6x6 cm, more precisely a negative of 56x56 mm.
This offers a resolution almost four times higher than a 35 mm negative (3.136 mm2 against 864).
The wildfire is one of the most difficult subjects for a photographer: it serves a combination of various factors including wealth, patience, experience and appropriate equipment.
Naturalist photography is often almost forgotten, but as for photography in any area, an image has more than a thousand words.
Naturalist photography often requires a long teleo-objective lens, although it was used by another type of lens for subjects such as a bird storm or a small creature.
Many exotic animals are difficult to find and the photos taken for commercial purposes are regulated by the rules of some parks.
Wild animals can be skimmed or aggressive. The environment can be cold, hot or in any hostile case.
There are more than 5,000 different languages in the world, of which there are over 20 with at least 50 million speakers.
In addition, written words are often easier to understand than those spoken. This is especially true of the addresses, often difficult to pronounce clearly.
In many nations there is an excellent English language, but in many others the knowledge of this language is limited, especially among young people.
Try to imagine, if you want, a city of Manchester, one of Boston, a Jamaican and one of Sydney sitting around a table at a restaurant in Toronto.
They take part in the events of their native cities, related with their distinct accents and local girgo.
The most convenient way to eat is to buy food at the supermarket. However, if you do not have the possibility to cook, the choices are circular to ready food.
More and more supermarkets offer a department with a larger choice of ready food. Some offer a feed feed to microwaves or other means of heating food.
In some countries or in some types of business there is at least an internal restaurant, often rather informal with affordable prices.
To produce copies of your own police and your insurance policy and carry them with you.

If you travel with a laptop or tablet, keep a copy in memory or disk (accessible without Internet).
Also distribute copies of the police/ contact to travel partners and relatives or friends at home, if you would like to help.
The algae (or wapi) are not for aggressive nature, but they defend themselves if they perceive a threat.
If people underestimate the potential danger of algae, they could get too close to them and run risks.
Drinking alcohol is responsible. Alcoholic beverages have a different effect on everyone, and knowing their limit is very important.
Possible long-term health episodes related to alcohol abuse may include hepatic damage and still blindness or death. The potential risk increases with alcohol consumption illegally produced.
There may be a number of types of dangerous impurities in illicit alcohol including metal, which can also cause blindness or death at small doses.
Eyeglasses can be more economical abroad, especially in low-income countries where the cost of manoeuvre is lower.
Take into account the possibility of conducting an eye examination at home, especially if insurance covers it, and take the prescription with you to present it where required.
The brand screens available in these areas may present two types of problems: some may be of imitation and those imported may be more expensive than those bought in their own country.
Coffee is one of the worldâs most exchanged goods and is likely to be able to find different types in your region of origin.
However, in the world there are many different ways of drinking coffee, which is worth trying.
The canyoning (or canyoning) is in the bottom of a hole, which can be dried or filled with water.
To begin with relatively little training and physical form (compared to training and physical form required, for example, for rock amplifiers, subwaterlings or alpine skiing).
Traveling is an activity that takes place in the open air and provides for walking in natural environments, often on routes designed for excursions.
One day's excursions provide distances ranging from less than a thousand to longer distances which may nevertheless be followed in one day.
One day's excursions on an easy path require little preparation and any person can usually enjoy it.
An open-air day is also possible for those who have newborns and children at school, even if families with small children may require more preparations.
There are around 200 tour organisations around the world. Most of these work independently.
Go Running Tours, successor to Global Running Tours, creates networks of dozens of watch running providers scattered in four continents.
With roots in the Running Tours Barcelona and the Running Copenhagen, it was quickly added to the Running Tours Prague and others.
When deciding to undertake a trip, it is necessary to take into account various aspects, both before and after departure.
When you travel you need to be aware that things are not like your own home. Behaviors, laws, food, traffic, accommodation, standards, language and so on will be different from where you live.
This is an aspect to keep in mind in order to avoid discouragement or even abuse for local customs.
The presence of tourist agencies in the 19th century. A travel agent usually represents a valid alternative for a journey that goes beyond a previous experience of the traveler in nature, culture, language or low-income countries.
Although most agencies accept the normal bookings, many of these are specialized in particular types of travel, price or destination.
Getting involved with an agent who often makes similar trips can reveal the best choice.
Take a look at the journeys that promote the agent, both on the website and in the wind.

The Antarctica surrounds the South Pole and is the coldest point of the Earth.
Tourist visits are expensive and require a good physical form, they are only possible during the summer period, from November to February, and are for the most circumscribed to the peninsula, the islands and the Sea of Ross.
In summer, mainly in these areas, there are two billion sub-shared employees in about one hundred bases, while during winter months only a required number of people remain.
The Antarctica entrance is an althipian fuel covered from 2-3 km of ice.
Sometimes specialised air tours run into the interior, for purposes related to alpineism or to reach the Polo, with a broad base.
The South Pole Transverse, Transverse of the South Pole (or the highway), is a 1,600 km walk that connects McMurdo station to the Sea of Ross to Polo.
It consists of compact snow in which the crates were filled and marked by banners. It can only be used by specialized engines that train skiers with fuel and supplies.
These means are not very agile, so the road must rise a long descent around the Transantartic Mountains to reach the beach.
The most common causes of informing in winter are associated with roads, marciapedes and particularly scivolous gradients.
They are necessary for at least shoes with suitable soles. The summer shoes are usually very smooth on ice and snow, and sometimes there are also some winter boots.
The sole must be quite deep, 5 mm (1/5 inches) or more, and the material must be sufficiently soft at low temperatures.
In scivolous conditions, there are closed shoes or shampoos to apply on the roofs or on the roofs and soles that fit most of the shoes and shoes.
