Galler's afraid of "looking like a doll" on Members of the Meclis.
As a member of the Parliament of Galler (MWP), the idea of change in the election has led to concern among some of the members of the parliament.
The name of this concern came from the change plan of Galler's Parliament.
Politicians are worried that this name might be funny.
One of the members of the Meclis Party said the party was concerned about the name of the party "to be able to play with Twp and Pwp."
For non-galler readers: "twp" is crazy in the Galce, "pwp" means fathering.
Plaid Party member suggested an alternative by indicating that the parties were "not satisfied" as a general.
Gal Muhafzakar said that one of the party's party members was "openly" about the change in the name of the party, indicating that there is a small word game from MWP to Muppet.
In this connection, the letter "w" in the Galce region is presented as "u" in Yorkshire, England.
"The decision of the members to identify what will be said to the members of the council will certainly be theirs," said the Legal Commission of Maclis, who made the changes in the order.
The Galler Government Act 2017 recognized the right to change its name to the Galler school.
In the course of the month, the Commission's mayor, Galler, published the results of a meeting of the council on large-scale proposals for Parliament.
When the Commission initiated the Welsh Parliament Members (WMP) meeting with members of the Meclis, the MWP campaign became the most widely supported choice in meeting the council.
Meclis members are clearly in the front of different elections, but not in unity of opinion, he can hurt Elin Jones' head, who is expecting him to present his legal plan for the changes in the weeks ahead.
The Youth Act will include some changes that will also include members' membership membership membership membership membership and the rules adopted by the Committee system, such as the rules of procedure of the Committee.
Members will decide which name they will take when they disagree with the law.
Macedonians will make reference for the change in the name of the country
The voters will vote in favour of changing the name of the countries on the market as "Northern Macedonian Community".
The people's play was put in place to conclude an annual agreement with Greece, a neighbouring region of Macedonia.
Atina has repeatedly opposed EU and NATO's accessions to the United States and NATO as she has long been trying to represent the right idea on the territory of the northern neighbours.
Macedonian Prime Minister Gjorge Ivanov, who was opposed to the people's vote on the change, said he would not take into account the vote.
But President Zoran Zaev, who also supports my reference to them, defends that the change in name will pay for membership of the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's Chans Become Like Churches in Harmem's Problem
Adams said, "When I talk to older people, they say there's a church in every corner."
"No more two."
Adams said it's possible to get rid of the bars.
He said, "People are socialized in different ways."
"They're no longer the halls where people go in order."
When it comes to the churches, it is concerned that the money bought by Adams for sale will not last as long as the leaders wait and "will return to their place of origin."
Mahallen also added that the apartments in which people live will be replaced by churches in the form of apartments that will not help the rest of the halls.
"There will be a very large number of white people living in these apartments, so it will make it possible for all churches to be closed together, because it is not possible that most people who move to these places are members of these churches."
In 1870 the two churches of Harlem were built by white communities before St. Martin's was born, ten years later.
The first white methodist group was transferred in the 1930s.
A black group of worshippers in the city took possession of the temple.
Rahip John Howard Johnson, a mother-in-law who was used to buy at Harlem. In Chad, he took the lead in a black group in St. Martin's leadership.
A new building that came out in 1939 was seriously damaged, but Father Johnson's plans to rebuild the building were made by a chain team.
Father Johnson's son and the director of St. Martin, Rabbi David Johnson, honored the chain team as "the poor of the poor."
The scientist who played the harps in our day gave the team another name: "A cultural treasure" and "an unpredictably historical tool."
Professor Tiffany Ng, who worked at the University of Michigan, said that this team was the first to be played by a black musician in the world. It was Dionysio A. Lind, who spent 18 years in the Riverside Church.
Merriweather said St. Martin didn't bring anyone instead.
In the last few months, what is happening in St. Martin is a complicated story that some of the leaders outside the church have found to be the migraines and the role of philosophers.
He sent a message to the police during the month of the month of July, with the administrative power of the church's non-religious leaders, who did not take part in holding the memorials and demonstrations of the institution's psychiatrists.
Some from the community were close to being left out of the church.
A dog fish in California killed a 13-year-old boy who went out to catch ice cream

Giles also added that the victim had travmatic wounds on his upper chest.
At 48 hours of research and security needs, the authorities closed access to the areas from the Ponto area in Casablad to the Swami district of Ecinitias.
Giles indicated that there were about 135 species of fish in the area but that most were not considered dangerous.
Sanisbury's plans to enter the English cosmetic market
Saninsbury's includes Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with beautiful areas in the department store.
As England's fashion and household goods continue to rise as part of a strong entry into the cosmetic market of 2.8 billion sterility, larger cosmetic regions will be tested at 11 stores in the country's market and will be transferred to the next year if they are successful.
The investment in cosmetics comes from the search for ways to fill the paths for televisions, microdrugs and household goods.
He said that the number of cosmetic products in the brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw would be 3,000 for the first time.
There are more places to be found from L'Oreal to Maybline and Burt's Bees, such as those in stores like Boots.
At the same time, the supermarket is re-marketing Boutique macyaj series so that most products can be more demanding by young customers.
And last week, Fragrance Shop, a perfume seller, will find a place in two Sinsbury's store in Croydon, South London, and the other year in Selly Oak, Birmingham.
Along with our way to buy online and buy daily food from small local stores, supermarkets have to do more to attract people.
Saninsbury's Director General Mike Coupe said that Aldi and Lidl would be like the more department stores by going to the supermarket prison to accept their sales points.
Saninsbury's two prisons have been operating in Argos for hundreds of years since he bought it and has included some of the Habitat Stans, which says it supports market sales and increases their hearts.
The previous entry into the department of the supermarket has failed.
In the early 2000s, Sanisbury's tried to open a joint store with Boots, but it ended up having a partnership after they didn't agree to share the events of the supermarkets.
Sainsbury's business of 281 stores, a new strategy was launched three years ago to sell 125 million steroids to Celesio, the owner of Lloyd's factory.
Lloyds' four stores, like La Roche-Posay and Vichy, are said to play a role in the plan.
Saninsbury's Ticari Director Paul Mills-Hicks says: "We have changed the appearance and sense of our cosmetic regions to improve the environment for our customers.
We've also invested in private educational work friends who are ready to give advice.
Our brand is designed to meet every need, and it means that we are a cosmetic seller who forces the old way of marketing."
Holly Willoughby's 11 million stellinity deal was "blowed" by Peter Jones.
Dragons Den's star Peter Jones, TV server Holly Willoughby left the program in a "heavy" way without an 11 million sterilization agreement with a life-style mark to focus on their new deals with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby's home and his accessory mark will never be able to separate Truly.
The work of both was compared to the Goop center of Gwyneth Paltrow.
This morning program explained that the 37-year-old server of this program was broken down by Instagram.
Holly Willoughby, Dragons' Den's star, Peter Jones, was finally dedicated to a new short deal with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
According to sources, on the day of the gold line television, Marlow acknowledged that at a huge meeting of business in Buckinghamshire, he was no longer home for 1.5 million sterility contracts and that access marks would not mean enough time to distribute them to Truly.
The firm was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop and it was said Willoughby's supposed to be 11 million steroids.
When Willoughby, 37, discovered that he had left Truly on Instagram, Jones went out on his way to go to one of his house outside England's toilets.
One source said: "Truly Holly's priorities were clearly different.
It would be a long way to support him for the next six months.
Holly's decision to get fired, everyone involved was completely shocked.
No one could believe what happened on Saturday. It was very close to the dance.
Marlow has a warehouse full of goods ready to be sold at HQ."
Scholars believe that this morning's server's travel program, one of England's most popular stars, may be worth millions of steroids for serious investments in clothing, and for a short-term potential for moving into the market.
It can also mean the end of a long friendship.
His three children's mother, Willoughby and his wife, Dan Baldwin, are ten years old, and they're close to Jones and Tara Capp.
Willoughby built Truly together with Capp in 2016. Jones, 52, was elected president in March.
The couple are having a holiday together, and Jones has 40 percent of his TV company Baldwin.
Willoughby will be M&S's mark agent and will be replaced by Ant McPartlin, who is a member of I'm A Celebrate program on TV.
One close source said to Jones last night, "We don't care about his business."
Strong talk "we've been in love"
He's been spying on the media because some of them are going to find "the opposite of the sovereignty" and the North Korean leader is so popular.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump answered by calling the "message server" and replied:
"I didn't give up anything."
The first meeting call in Singapore at the time of the trumpet revealed that Kim was involved in a second meeting after being referred to as a major step towards the nuclear-weapon-free movement of North Korea.
But the nuclear-weapon-free talks got into the sector.
More than three months after the summit in Singapore, North Korea's premier diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the BM General Council on Wednesday that they had not seen North Korea's previous arms-free agents from the United States.
Instead, he indicated that the U.S. continued its efforts to press.
There was a much better tone of voice during the Trump meeting.
"We're great with North Korea."
"We were going to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would die.
Now we have a great relationship."
Kim said that the development of relationships with him did not end the rocket tests, let alone the hostages, and let the American soldiers go home.
He also protected Kim's outside approach to their relationships.
He said, "It's easy to act in a way that's right, but if 10,000 people don't try to get into this area, there'll be 200 people here."
In Indonesia, Tsunami and Depression killed hundreds of people
After the Lombrok depression, for example, foreign civil society organizations said they didn't need to be heard.
Despite the fact that more than 10 percent of the Lombrok population is from places, no national disaster is reported that is likely to facilitate international aid.
Summing said, "I'm sorry they said they didn't want help from many countries in a very clear way, so it's hard."
Save the Children, if a team is set up to go to Palu, it's not sure the foreign team can't work in the field.
National Disaster Agent Sutopo said he appreciated the situation in Palu so that he could see that international agencies of Indonesian members could not be allowed to work together.
If Indonesia is thought to be constantly depressive, how sad it is to be angry with the country's nature that it's not ready enough.
There's no such work on the other side of the ocean when there's a tsunami shelter.
Although a warning has been given in Palu, it is likely that the Tsunami alerts have caused a loss of life.
Even in the best of circumstances, it's hard to travel between many islands in Indonesia.
Natural pain makes logistics even more complex.
A hospital in Lombok is heading towards Palu to deal with the depression, but the new disaster will take at least three days to the affected area.
President Joko Widodo, the most important part of the election campaign to develop Indonesia's gold medal, has made it a major part of the campaign and has spent a lot of money on royalties and railways.
But financing the difficulties has slowed Joko's governance, because next year's elections will be re-elected.
Joko, the majority of Muslims are faced with pressure from their encounters in Indonesia, which I believe is a more controversial belief.
The clashes between Christians and Muslims caused more than 1,000 people to die and tens of thousands of people from their homes, using street stones, bullets and missiles and other primary weapons.

The Cromwell before Meclist was the last target in the "recorded history" debate.
The attack of the Heykel will be a divine justice because Cromwell's fanatical followers have conquered many cultural and religious sects in England.
However, the Cromwell Council has identified Mr. Crick's predecessor as "discreet" and "recording history."
John Goldsmith, head of the Cromwell Court, said: "The idea of Oliver Cromwell before Westminster was not to be avoided within the existing debate on the removal of buildings.
The British internal wars did not make Cromwell's iconic failure, nor did these wars prove his command.
Maybe it's a wrong Cromwell. It's gonna be a victim instead of Thomas, his father.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is a great proof of Cromwell's 19th century vision, and Cromwell is an idea that is still worthy of praise, part of the historical record.
Mr. Goldsmith The Sunday Telegraph said to him: "To many Cromwell, maybe more than in the 19th century, you're a monster against prints coming out, in his condition as a defender of the monarchy.
It's a historical dispute that's not exactly a true statement.
What's certain is that the disagreement between the 17th century and the past has shaped the development of our nation, and Cromwell is a well-known person who represents a side of this agreement.
His achievements as the Protector Lord are worthy of praise and understanding."

In the 1980's, according to a statement by the Supreme Court that woke up on Friday, the island of Brett Kavanaugh was visited by more than 20 million people in six different television networks, a woman who was sexually abused by Christine Blasey Ford.
In this period, a long-standing political situation continued with the last minute of the day of Friday's regular program of publicity: an agreement designed to prosecute the FBI by Senator Jeff Flake for a week.
Ford told the U.S. Senate Justice Committee that Kavanaugh was convinced that he was trying to take his clothes off while he was drinking at a school party.
Kavanaugh said that hundreds of people said they didn't.
According to Nielsen's transmission, more than 20.4 million people could watch the show on Friday.
The company calculated the average number of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel using MSNBC.
PBS did not immediately access the number of other networks that show their presence on the Fox Business Network, including C-SPAN.
Besides, Nielsen, it's usually difficult to calculate the number of people who look at things in the office.
In other words, this number of spectators was like an action match on the American football game or the Academic Awards Watch Kitts.
According to the Fox News Channel, which supports Kavanaugh's father more than once, Nielsen has abandoned all networks during the day-to-day conflict.
The ABC took place in the second round with 3.26 million spectators.

A woman said, "I'm standing right here."
"Do you think He has told you the truth?
She said to Kavanaugh in her dress, "You have power when you're weak," she said.
Flake said that before the elevator was closed, the office was in a statement, and there was more to be said at the committee's hearing.
After all hours of cable networks and media networks, the Justice Committee was alive when it directed the father of Kavanaugh to the whole Senate.
But Blake said that only the FBI's crimes directed to the island will be investigated for a week after the minority Democrats demand them.
Flake's partner was convinced of the conversations he had with his friend Democrat Senator Chris Coons.
He made up his mind, Coons, and then he talked to a few senators.
Flake's choice had an impact because the public could not have the number of votes that would allow Kavanaugh without questioning.
President Trump opened a FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh.

Oriol said: "The best way to get back to the European elections, the return to democratic values, the pressure we have seen from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Some men were arrested after a house car crash
A house in Londonderry was regularly arrested by three men at the age of 33, 34 at the age of 39.
The event came at 7:30 p.m. with English writing hours in Ballynagard Crescent.
Detective Bob Blemmings said he was in the door and in the building.
At one point he may have been shot by a bullet in his car.
That's what Menga called Livingston, Rangers 1-0.
Dolly Menga's first hand led him to Livingston.
The top high-level Livingston stared at the 18th game of the Ibrox Club, and stared at Steven Gerrard's second novel, and stared at Rangers.
When Dolly Menga was created here, Gary Holt's team, along with the Hibernian, went up the second line.
Gerard's team still didn't get a diplomatic chance at Premiership this season, and it's going to meet with the Leader Hearts on the eight-point market day before us.
Before this meeting, Rangers will bring on the European Union's Rapid Vienna on Friday.
Livingston, on the other hand, took out six games in the field of rehab, and Chief Coach Holt didn't meet this new guy since he took charge of Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston lost positions in the field team
Holt's team was playing an open game with Rangers in all kinds of trouble and could've gone on for a long time before he shot his arm.
Scott Robinson attacked, but his efforts were not enough, and then Alan Lithgow, who fought against Craig Peoplet's head fighting, went out in a different way.
Homeowner's team allowed Rangers to play before knowing that they'll live through difficult times in groups at the site.
The important weapon of the machine came in this way.
He fought a free fight against Rangers, and Declan Gallagher and Robinson threw a ball into Menga, and Menga hit a ball in the middle of the penal scene.
As far as the Rangers group was concerned, it was difficult to pass the protection of the owner, and the fireman Liam Kelly didn't have a big problem,
This game model, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to be rescued, continued to the second half.
Scott Pittman threw the ball out at a bunch of Lithgows standing in Livingston while the Rangersman stopped allan McGregor's feet.
While all the middles of Livingston's sentence were removed from the scene, two penthouse ideas were rejected by the judge by the people's seventh player Glenn Middleton and by the judge.
Liverston Plays Game - Analysis
BBC Scotch Alasdair Lamont, Tony Macaroni Arena
A performer and outcome for Livingston.
Every player in the team was perfect and they kept waiting until they got out.
The style of the game and the framework has not changed much since it turned into a league team, but the Holt, who has been firing this team since then, deserves the greatest honor.
Holt had a lot of wine.
Captain Peoplet led a defense with a wonderful organization, but I was disappointed by Joe Worrall and Connor Goldson.
The Rangers are gone from inspiration.
There's been a lot of good performance they've shown me in the time of Gerard's administration.
Last failed, they could only go through the rap event once, and this could be a wake call for Rangers in the middle of the league.
A good and bad deal with Erdogan in Koln
There were faces and blue skies on Wednesday (29th of July) when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met at a festival in Berlin.
The meeting took place on the last day of the visit of President Erdoğan to Germany to resolve relations between NATO terrorists.
Human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's membership in the EU have been divided into two countries.
The next morning, he opened up a new truck to go to Koln.
The city is covering the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police showed the need for security to prevent the crowd from meeting in front of the camp for 25,000 people, but there were a lot of supporters around the area, and they were ready to see their leader.
Most of the Kurts, the hundreds of Erdoğan opposition protesters also heard their voices and questioned Erdoğan's policies and the German government's decision to bring him into the country.
Opposite protests show how a visitor who is recognized as a hero by some Turks living in Germany and some as a dictator has made a difference.
Traffic accident in Deptford: A biker, a car crash killed
A bike driver lost his life in a car crash in London.
Kaza came to the front of the British Green Sea at 10:15 a.m. with the Bestwood Cadedesy, which is located in the southeastern part of Deptford.
The car driver stopped and the health officials threatened the accident, but he lost his life in the accident.
The accident on Saturday occurred a few months after the accident at Childers Street, which was about a mile away.
The big city police said they were trying to identify the man who was responsible and to inform his family.
The road was closed, the buses were changed and the drivers were advised to stay away from the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six missions injured in the Warfare · Global Voices
My prison administration said that six prison duties were being violated in the complex of a high-security man.
On Wednesday, the British Red Clock was held in the Orcestershire Prison (HMP) and continues in Long Lartin.
The experts "Tornado" were brought to account for the interference of the eight courts and for their involvement with the conflict that had been halted by a canady.
The authorities who had minor injuries were treated at the scene.
The prison service spokesman said: "The HMP Long Lartin has been assigned to those who work in prison for the purpose of resolving what has continued to happen.
Six personnel were treated.
We can't show kindness to violence in our prisons, and we're determined that the police are in love with the police and that they're behind their fingers."
HMP Long Lartin has more than 500 sentences to include some of the most dangerous crimes in the country.
In the month of his visit, the prison manager saw a medical doctor in the hospital after he had suffered an attack on a prison.
In the past month's committee, officials were called upon to deal with the serious interference of officials with their intelligence groups.
Rosa Czarga by Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City (can be of use in the Kurrak Districts)
It's hardly seen that Arizona has been hit by a tropical depression, but at the beginning of the week, the energy remaining from the Rosa Carguegas went through the South-West Valley and created the potential of cell pressure.
The National Weather Agency, with West Arizona and South-East Nevada, South California and Utah, has published a series of marketing and marketing warnings for areas that are occupied by Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa's market day is expected to be a direct route from Phoenix to the end of the day, approaching the rain.
In a tweet at the Phoenix National Weather Agency, he said: "Since 1950, Phoenix has been only 10 tropical droughts, tropical storm or depression!
Katrina (1967) was a 40-mile-long fugitive from Arizona.
The latest National Center for Disease Control models, Arizona Mogollon, predicts that there will be 2 to 4 floods along with 6 metrics in the Mogollon Canary.
The other parts of the South-West Sea, including the Mediterranean Mountains and the Great Lakes, can provide water for 1 to 2 inches of rain, while in rural areas it can contain 4 inches.
The rains that Rosa brought in areas where she was not at risk of transporting her cell pressure may be of some benefit because she is a state-of-the-art ruler.
Even if it is a serious problem, the South could benefit from some of these rains because they now live in droughts.
Weather.com said, "The U.S. Crime Monitor said that Arizona has a little over 40 percent, at least the second highest category of obesity problem."
First of all, the road to Rosa Karrgaji is going to get in touch with the car for the first time through the Baja California region of Mexico.
On the morning of the morning, at 85 miles of maximum wind speed, Rosa, Punta Eugenia, still in the power of gravity, is located at 385 miles south of Mexico and is moving north at 12 miles.
It's slowing down because it's getting colder water in the Pacific.
That's why it's expected to reach Mexico's soil after Friday or at night in a tropical storm.
Heavy rains that can be seen in some parts of Mexico can create an important cell risk.
Weather.com reports that "Baja California and North-West Sonora are expected to have a total of 3-6 inches of rain and 10 inches of rain."
Rosa will reach the throne as a tropical storm in the early hours of the morning, following the north of Mexico in the wake of a tropical storm, and then enter the southern Utah in the late hours of the night.
The United Nations Centre for Sustainable Development said, "The main cause of the disaster in Baja California, the north of Sonora and the U.S. South-West Valley is a very heavy rain."
It is expected that these rains may threaten the lives of the living cells, the soil in the deserts, and the soil in the mountains.
Midsomer Norton: Four people were arrested for murder
Three young children and a 20-year-old man, who was found beaten in Somerset as a young man, was charged with murder.
The young child was found injured on Wednesday in the extraordinary Terrace region of Midsomer Norton, Britain's Green Clock at about 04:00.
He was taken to the hospital and his condition was stable.
According to Avon and Somerset Police, one was arrested in the Redstock area for a short period of time, at the age of 17, at the age of 18, and the other for four nights.
The authorities followed everyone's statement on the cell phone that could be seen on the case.
Trump told Kavanaugh that the Democratic Party was "the power of humiliation and humiliation."
Trump, Wheeling, said in a meeting in West Virginia: "A vote to be given to the next Kavanaugh is a voice of rejection of the free and disproportionate tactics of the Democratic Party."
Trump said during Kavanaugh's term of office that the Democratic Party was "the power of humiliation and humiliation."
Kavanaugh, Christine Blasey Ford, both young and young, presented himself before Congress on Friday as a strong and exciting day.
Ford also made a statement in the case of his own original.
The President said to the majority supporters in West Virginia on Wednesday: "The American people saw the light, quality and beauty of Kavanaugh that day.
A voice that recognizes Judge Kavanaugh is one of the most successful lawyers of our time, a voice that recognizes a judge who has won a valuable role in public service."
The president, when discussing the importance of Community participation in the elections, changed his name according to Kavanaugh.
"One of the most important choices in our life has been five weeks.
I'm not running, but I'm really running," he said.
"That's why I'm fighting everywhere for the good people."
Trump claimed that the Democrats were overrun by the "sustainment and arrest" mission.
According to one of the members of the ruling Party, one of the parties to CNN is expected to be held on the last Friday of the first important vote on the status of Kavanaugh in Senato.
Hundreds of people died in depression and tsunamis in Indonesia, rising by balance.
According to the authorities, on Wednesday, at least 384 people were killed by the great earthquake and tsunami that struck the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia, and many of them were hit by hurricanes.
On Friday, when the altitude in the city of Palu was 6 metres (18 ft) high, hundreds of people gathered for the beach festival, and hundreds of people were destroyed when they drove people to death.
At 7.5 years of age, I had a stroke after a depression.
In a news conference at Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a BNPB's organization to reduce the effects of Indonesia's injuries, said, "People continued their activities on the beach, they didn't run away, and they became victims of the incident," when the tsunami threatened the day.
Nugroho said, "It wasn't the only thing that happened; together he drove his cars, trees, houses, and hit everything in the street," he added that he had made rapid progress in the sea 800 km/h (497 miles/h).
He said some people were stuck in the trees to escape from the tsunami.
About 16,700 people were admitted to 24 centers in Palu.
Many of the photos published by the Affidavit Society showed that the building and the store were polluted, the bridges were broken down, and a truck was flooded with water.
On Saturday, there's been more disturbances in the city.
In the area where 2.4 million people live, there have been further depression.
In his explanation of Indonesia Technology Assessment and Application Framework (BPPT), he explained that nearly 200 times as powerful as the nuclear bomb left Hiroshima during World War II, the energy of the Great Depression on Friday was about 200 times higher than the nuclear bomb left in Hiroshima.
He said he could have increased the size of the city's cograffiti in a long and long circle.
Nugroho described the damage as "abundant" and said that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels were destroyed.
To some victims, he added that 540 people were injured and 29 lost when he said that the bodies of some victims were trapped under the walls.
Nugroho, in the north of Palu 300 km (190 km), said that the number of injuries and damages could be higher throughout the area of Doghara, which is located at the centre of the depression.
Nugroho said in Doghara that my message "is completely falsified and never gets any information."
In his statement "There are more than 300,000 people living there," Red Hach added that staff and volunteers are reaching affected areas.
"Even with this situation, it's a tragedy, but the situation can be much worse," he said.
Despite the fact that the authorities had warned them that the waves had come during the day of Wednesday, they took extensive action to inform Palu that they had been shot by the tsunami.
In social media shared amateur cameras, a building may sound like a man on the top of a building who called out in a crazy way to warn people about the tsunami that struck the people below.
In a few minutes, he hits a water wall with his head in front of the buildings and vehicles.
Reuters could not verify the camera display immediately.
Depression and tsunami made it difficult to coordinate the rescue efforts of the authorities to a large power station when communication was closed around Palu.
According to the authorities, the army, Jakarta and other cities began sending cargo planes to help them, but I still feel that I still need the basics.
The city's airport was only reopened for rescue efforts and will remain closed until the end of the month.
Commander Joko Widodo plans to visit the health centres in Palu on the market.
In Indonesia, Tsunami's balance sheet exceeded 800.
It's too bad.
Mr. Doseba explained that when the World Vision team arrived safely on the road to the city of Palu, they passed through the garbage dumps, and workers were staying in tents in their garden.
Doseba said, "They told me they saw a lot of broken houses,"
It's so bad.
Even if aid groups are engaged in an effort to start their operations of emergency aid, there are some complaints that foreign aid agencies with limited expertise have prevented them from going to Palu.
According to the reforms in Indonesia, money abroad, taxes and human aid can only begin to decline in the state of national impact of a disaster.
This line hasn't been made yet.
"It's still a disaster in the region," said Indonesian Red Sea spokesman Aulia Ariani.
"The government says, 'No, it's a national disaster,' and we can help the international community, but there's still no such status."
On the second night in Palu after Friday's depression and tsunami, the families and neighbors of the missing people still hope that there may be miracles that could be embarrassing stories of the natural wounds they loved.
A little kid was taken out of the canal on Saturday.
On Sundays, rescue teams brought out a woman who had been trapped under a rock heap for two days with her mother's body.
Indonesia's international team of German football players, Captain Gendon Subbandono, was running two of the missing football players for Asian Games held in Indonesia this month.
According to Mr. Mandzi, the rest of those who were stuck in the Roa Roa Hotel were his students, too.
"I draw my own emotional burden as a mercenary in the German peace zone," he said.
Gendon told me about the hours that Roa Roa Oteli's message was coming between the Germans and the populace, how he sent messages to the Palu contestants at the beach festival.
However, the messages remained as a Greek sign of approval instead of a two- blue sign of approval.
He said, "I think this is what it means that the messages aren't texting,"
Stealers received $26,750 in full-time ATM operation in Newport on the Level
According to a news report published by the Department of Newport Police, thieves stole $26,750 from a Newport on the Level Brink's ATM.
In the news, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote that the vehicle driver was ready to charge more money by emptying off the ATM in the entertainment system.
While in office, another man stole the full money box to be loaded into ATM, running from the back of the press.
According to the news, the witnesses said there were more than one suspect from the scene, but the police did not indicate the number of people involved.
Those who have information about their identity need to contact the Newport police by phone number 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapci changes his name as Ye
Raptor Kanye West changes his name as Ye.
This change came from Twitter on Wednesday, with the words: "A man who is officially known as Kanye West."
West, 41, for a time, used his E-mail and gave it to my eighth album, which was released in Hazarran.
The change was done before the Saturday Night Live program, waiting for my new album to be introduced to Yandhi.
According to the programmer, he will be replaced by Ariana Grande, who cancels the program "with reasonable reasons".
The West said that the word was important to him in the religious sense that it was in the sense that the professional name was abbreviated.
At the beginning of this year, the radio server Big Boy spoke about my album's name, "I think 'ye' is the most used word in the Gospel and 'sen' in the Gospel," he said.
"Well, I'm you, I'm us, it's us.
We're better than only Kanye, our bad, our headaches, our whole thing's going to be a bit of a y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y
It's a lot more than who we are."
He's just one of the famous rapists who changed his name.
Sean Combs had different names like Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but he heard that this year he preferred the names Love and Brother Love.
The JAY-Z, who previously worked with the West, uses its name as either triangular or triangular and large letters or small letters.
Mexico's AMLO has attempted not to use military force against civilians
Mexico's newly elected Prime Minister, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, promised that he would never use military force against civilians as the country's blood campaign against students came to its 50th anniversary.
Lopez Obrador said on Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza "You will never benefit from the military's power to keep the people under pressure."
On October 2, 1968, the military forces shot 300 people at the base of the left American student movement, shooting at a peaceful demonstration.
Lopez Obrador promised to support young Mexicans by offering them monthly aid and by opening up a free government university.
He said that unemployment and lack of access to education led young people to crime.
The U.S. needs to draw the building blocks on both sides
Earlier, the investor and industrial intelligence operator Kai-Fu Lee, who worked at Google, Microsoft and Apple, said that because China has increased its production activity, the U.S. would have to pay back to research in this area.
After reports from various U.S. councils were made, the United States generally reacted to the fact that it did not even have an official strategy of intelligence.
China, on the other hand, explained its last year's plan: by 2030, it aims to have 1 number in its intellectual youth.
Lee said, "When we think about the fact that all other countries are around the U.S. and we're looking for a major meeting on the construction project, it's a good start to get out on both sides of the structure research base,"
Lee said in his report to the CNBC this week, two cards of money, the next big business success is going to be done in the U.S.
The book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, one of the most important industrial companies in China, published by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt.
In the 1980s, Carnegie Mellon worked on an American Othello (Reversi) player at the first class at the University of Carnegie Mellon, and later became the head of the Chinese team at Microsoft Research.
Lee mentioned the technology competitions previously carried out by the U.S. government, such as the Robotic Development Project Foundation, and asked when the next competition would be held to help identify the following visas.
Lee said he had to work hard to get government support in the United States.
Lee said, "Academic leaders aren't China, they get companies,"
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have been working from universities to work on manufacturing plants in recent years.
Lee indicated that the changes in migration policy could also help the U.S. industry.
He said, "I think you should be given a red card automatically to those who made it to a doctor in the field of engineering,"
In December 2017, China published the New Generation's Zaka Development Plan.
Lee, China's National Academy of Natural Sciences; the National Academy of Sciences and other community organizations distributed funds to researchers in the U.S.
In the beginning of this year, the U.S. Defence Supervisory, sector and academia established a Joint Yapay Zeka Centre and announced the establishment of the White Saray, Yapay Zaka Selection Committee.
This month DARPA, AI Next, heard that $2 billion investment was made.
The NSF is currently making 100 million dollars a year for industrial intelligence research.
On the other hand, there was no month of action on the United States issue of the United States Security Commission, which wanted to establish the Yapay Zekaya National Security Commission.
Macedonians said that the name of the country would not be changed and that it would not be changed
When I referred to the Macedonian people's market day, the European Union and the NATO member states that it would not change its name to "Northern Macedonian Republic" as a phrase that would resolve a lasting agreement with Greece that would impede its membership.
Greece, a region called Macedonia, defends that the name of the northern neighbor has a legal claim on the Greek territory and advocates its membership with NATO.
Two governments had an agreement on the proposed new name in the month of Hazarjan, but nationalists claimed that it would damage the ethnic identity of Macedonian slaves, which created a new revolution, which created a majority of their minds.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not use the vote in my referendum, and he doubted why a boycott campaign would not reach 50 percent of the participation required for the referendum to be over.
The question at the referendum is, "Do you support NATO and EU membership by accepting the agreement with Greece?"
President Zoran Zaev, who supports the change in name, claims that it is worth paying for the adoption of the EU and NATO regimes for Macedonia, one of the countries that are part of Yugoslavia after the breakup of the former Yugoslavia.
Olivera Georgievska, 79-year-old in Uskup, said, "I came here today for the future of the country, for the young people in Macedonia, who are all the most secure people in the European Union,"
Although it was not legally binding, he said that he would follow the outcome of the vote in order to terminate the decision by a sufficient number of Members of Parliament.
Because of the change in name, there is a need for two or three majority in Parliament.
The State Electoral Commission said there was no irregularity until 13:00.
However, only about 34% of the last parliamentary election in 2016, which took place in 66 percent of registered voters, remained in 16%.
In the presidential Supreme, 62-year-old Gjose Tanevski said, "I came to vote for my children, our place is Europe."
President Zoran Zaev of Macedonia, his wife Zorica and son Dushko of Dusko, used the opening of the country to participate in NATO and the European Union on 30 September 2018 in Strumica, Macedonia.
Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54 years old in front of the Supreme Parliament, was preparing a small scene and removing the chairs before the tents built by those who would expand my referendum.
Kavadarkov said, "We support NATO and the EU, but not from the service door, but we want to get in close."
"We're a poor country, but we're honored.
If they don't want to take us as Macedonia, we can run other options like China and Russia and join the integration of Europe."
President Zaev says the NATO membership will have more than 20 percent high unemployment and will bring the necessary investments to Macedonia.
After using Zaev's game, he said, "I believe that a large majority of our citizens will use a reasonable vote because there are more than 80 percent of our neighbours in the EU and NATO."
He said the end of "Yes" would be "the health of our future."
A survey conducted by the Macedonian Institute of Political Studies last Thursday, on 30 May 43 (under regular participation) led to the participation of hundreds of voters in the referendum.
Another poll conducted by the Telema TV channel in Macedonia revealed that 57 percent of participants planned to vote on the day of the market.
He said he'd say 70 percent.
To make the referendum a success, I have to get 50 percent of my participation to get a vote.
A failure in my report will be the first serious task that the Western Government has taken in this policy since it arrived in May last year.
Watch: Themanchester City player Sergio Aguero reached the top through the entire Brighton defense
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling distributed Brighton's defense on Thursday at Manchester, Etihad Stadium, England.
Aguero was able to show himself in a funny way at 65 minutes.
Argentinian sticker got a passport at the beginning of the series.
Three Brighton defenses arrived in the open area after they ran away.
Then Aguero was surrounded by four green formulas.
First he went to a defense guard and then left a few more on the side of Brighton's sentence.
Then she sent a passport to the left and found Sterling.
In the English prefecture, he returned to Aguero, and Aguero attacked right-hand Brighton Colonel Matthew Ryan.
The city manager Pep Guardiola told reporters "He's fighting some problems at Aguero's feet,"
"We talked about 55, 60 minutes to her.
That's what happened.
We're lucky he threw it out then."
But it was Sterling who won the first advantage in the Premier League for Heaven's Mavis.
That bullet came at 29 minutes.
Aguero met together in Brighton.
From the left side, Leroy Sane threw a good crowd.
You know, he made a few touches before he turned Sterling away.
He sent the clouds of the sky before the wind blew out of the field.
City, Sunday, Sinsheim, in Rhein-Neckar-Arena, Germany, will go to the League of Champions with Hopenheim at 12:55 p.m.
Scherzer is planning to break up the game against Rockies.
There's no reason why the Nationals would force a new starter along with the actions and the reconnaissance of the Nationals.
But if there's still a chance of playing-off for Rockies, which is more likely to be played on the West NL than Los Angeles Doggers, she's hoping to blow up the stage against Colorado Rockies on the market.
Rockies has violated the right to participate with at least five or two of the Nationals, but he's still trying to win his first league championship.
"Even if we don't have any purpose here, we can do our best with the knowledge that the team will meet with the rest of the atmosphere in Denver this year.
Why don't I want to join this reception?"
A national market day has not yet been announced by a starter, but it has been announced that in such a case the shooting will allow Scherzer to do.
Scherzer, who's going to start, made a winter training on Friday and will shoot in the normal place on the market.
Washington's right-hand player has a range of 2,53 ERAs and 300 strikeouts between 18 and 7 during this season.
Trump met in West Virginia
The president, when discussing the importance of community participation in the elections, changed the High Court island as a result of the situation in Kavanaugh.
"Everything we've done is dangerous in November.
It's been five weeks for one of our most important choices in life.
It's too big, I'm not running, but I'm actually running.
The trumpet continued: "You see this terrible radical group of Democrats, you see what's happening right now.
You're determined to take the power back by every way you need. You see their pain and their hatred.
They do not care who harms them in order to gain power and control, and they want power and control, but We are not going to give them.
He said that the Democrats were my mission to stop and stop.
"You've seen this in the last four days," he called Democrats "a cruel and unmerciful, a cruel and a liar."
The Senate's highest-ranking judge, Democrat Senator Diane Feinstein, has raised a number of high-ranking celebrations.
"Do you remember what you answered?
Have you broken the document?
Ah, ah, no.
No, no, I'm waiting for one more, the body language was really bad, the worst language I've ever seen."
The Work Party is no longer a free mind platform.
I don't like those who say their thoughts.
I wasn't surprised when the Momentum activists in my country used to vote for me.
Anyway, I'm the last person we've ever met because we've said that we haven't had a good time since we talked about our ideas between the Labour Party parliaments.
My fellow MP Joan Ryan saw a similar favour because he had a strong case against the Jews.
In my case, my best friend, Jeremy Corbyn, was making me mad at me because I was inconsistencies with him.
A consistent economic policy, national security, such as Europe's importance, is similar to that of Jeremy's previous leaders.
On Friday, at the Nottingham East Labour meeting, there was a "We want the meetings to be a catcher and a producer."
That was exactly how the GC meetings were held on Friday night during the eight-year majority of the eight years I spent as the local parliament of the Labour Party.
Unfortunately today, it is not like many meetings, and even before that, the "Nice More" political promise has been forgotten for a long time.
It became clear that various meetings in the Labour Party were not welcome and that every opinion was not accepted by the party administration.
This happened soon after Jeremy became the leader, and my friends, whom I thought I had a political meeting before, asked me to become a U-turner in matters such as national security or the EU partner market, and I would never accept it.
In front of the people (not really important), I'm faced with an admiral who makes a social media call for disillusionment, who says I should not be at the Labour Party, and who says I should not be at the Centre's Party.
And it's not just me.
I know I'm more lucky than some of my friends because I'm usually political.
Every day, I feel the professionality and determination of my friends who never gave up their lives against a sexist or a terrorist cell.
One of the saddest ways of this political regime is how gambling levels are standardized.
Jeremy Corbyn pointed out that last week the Work Party had to feed a beautiful culture.
In fact, we are no longer that free thinking platform, and each "independence" issue or change of electoral rules is part of a party.
I haven't been in the cold in the last two years, I don't really sound so much, and then I took a lot of advice on "all right."
But I didn't get involved in politics for that.
32 years ago, I worked to provide better public services to those who felt that the government of Thatcher had failed as a potential student of the movement.
I've never hidden my policies from my last election.
No one in the Nottingham East has lived in conflict with my political situation and with my existing administration.
I don't understand how much time and energy I have to spend on the management of the Labour Party, as I'm going to tell all those who support the promotion of Friday, which is going to harm the economy of the country, the business and the public services.
But I really want to give a message not to Nottingham Momentum, but to those who are a member of the Labour Party and who are not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise I can't prevent you from doing what I believe is the best way to get out of politics.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Unnewed Air set in the first row
The two tests in the last few minutes may have changed to a little bit, but Ayr, this very fun Tenent's Premiership was definitely the one who deserved the victory at the game.
They're at the top of the league right now, and they're the only team that's not up to ten.
Finally, because of the excellent defenses they're making better use of the chances, the domestic team and the truck Peter Murchie is very right to be happy.
He said, "We've tested our games so far and have not been rehabilitated, so I'm happy."
From Melrose, Robyn Christie said to them, "I admire you, they used our chances better than us."
Grant Anderson's 14-minute trial of Frazier Climo took place on Air, but the iceman, Captain Rory Hughes, was free to play Warriors with a map he saw, so he spoke Melrose's numbers, and Jason Baggot took an unconverted test.
Climo took Ayr 17-5 before turning it into a solo test.
But Melrose started well in the second half, and Patrick Anderson's attempt to turn Baggot into five different numbers.
It was later that Ruahidh Knott took a long time to get out of the field and started playing again when he opened up a Stafford McDowall experiment from Air, Climate.
He saw Captain Blair Macpherson in Air's game card and used Melrose's advantage with an experiment by Bruce Colvine that didn't change at the end of a hard press.
But the homeowner's team came back to the end because of the fact that Struan Hutchinson had done to Climo during the storm and that MacPherson's impact on the scene.
Kyle Rowe, after David Armstrong's box kick, took the ball and sent the fifth test of the owner team to Gregor Henry, and then Climo, another time, almost re-launched the conversion line.
Still Game Star looks like she's going to take a new career in the restaurant industry
Still Game's star Ford Kieran is ready to enter the food sector.
The 56-year-old actor, a long solo comedy partner, Greg Hemphil, shows the character of Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC series he's playing with.
The second one heard that the ninth season would be the final season, and it appears that Kiernan began planning how he would continue his life after the end of Craiglang.
According to official records, the actor appears to be the manager of the Apionmorn Limited.
He refused to talk about the player, but a source that Scottish Sun reached revealed that Kiernan planned to be thrown into the "growing restaurant sector" of Glasgow.
"The sea is ours": He hopes that Bolivia, which is not part of the sea, will open a way to reach the Pacific.
The seamen are on their way to the shipyard in La Paz.
There's an oceanic massive bridge in the village building.
From the Titicaca Sea to the Amazon, all the sea surfaces are covered with this slogan: "We have the right to the sea.
It's our duty to take this right for granted."
In a 19th century war of blood, the memory of the lost girl in Chile continues to live in the memory of the non-seasonal Bolivian people, once again hoping to be opened to the Pacific Ocean.
Today, Bolivia's hopes may have increased as never in recent years. The country is waiting for the decision of the International Court of Justice (UAD) to be issued on 1 October after five years of negotiations.
The Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadilla used the expression "Bolivian energy, unity and co-operation are full of spirit and momentum and, of course, the result of a fair opening," he used.
In general, many Bolivians will monitor UAD's decision from large screens. Bolivia, after ten years of unregulated discussions, has indicated that it is necessary to negotiate an independent plot of land for Bolivia's sea access. Bolivia's people hope that they will accept Bolivia's request from the judge in Lahey.
Bolivia's local charismatic leader, Evo Morales, also called for a decision to be made on the day of the market.
Morales, at the end of August, was found on the promise "You're too close to going back to the Pacific Ocean."
However, some analysts say that the court's decision on Bolivia is unlikely and that even if it is decided by it, there will be no serious change.
The BM body in the Netherlands did not have the power to give land to Chile and indicated that it would not determine the outcome of any negotiations.
According to the Chilean international legal expert Paz Zárate, UAD's decision was "not difficult" only six months after last defenses were made.
In addition, the discussions that took place in the last four years may have been much more than supported by Bolivia's needs.
Zarate said, "The issue of access to the sea was used by the existing administration of Bolivia,"
According to Zarate, Morales' attacks were also echoed by his last good intentions with regard to the Chileans.
Bolivia and Chile will once again sit on the table at a certain point, but after that it will be very difficult to make their negotiations.
The two countries have not been sending messengers to each other since 1962.
The former president and Bolivian representative Eduardo Rodríguez Veltze rejected the idea that he had taken action without the speed of the trial.
In his statement, Veltze stated that his market day would offer Bolivia "a new opportunity to start a new cycle of relations with Chile" and that "both sides would end with 139 years of agreement" with benefits.
Calzadilla, one of the most popular leaders in Latin America, has also rejected the idea of what Morales used to do for politics.
Morales says, "Bolivia will never give up on access to the Pacific Ocean."
"This is an opportunity to show that we have to resolve the past."
North Korea will not leave nuclear weapons until you trust the United States
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said they'd never give up nuclear weapons while they didn't trust Washington.
On Wednesday, Ri spoke at the United Nations General Assembly.
Look, the U.S. has been invited to implement the promises made at the summit in Singapore between the leaders of the two countries.
Rei's statement, three months after talks with North Korean Leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore, came to the conclusion that the United States Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo was about to relaunch the nuclear diplomacy that had entered the press.
Ri, the idea that the continued actions and the United States will refuse to report the end of the Korean War was merely "an empty dream" to North Korea.
Pyongyang is nearing the signing of his important non-army steps until Washington's father.
Kim Jong Un and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But Pyongyang has doubts about the seriousness of the nuclear weapons he considers to be the only way to provide security.
Pompeo is planning to visit Pyongyang next month for preparation for the second Kim-Trump summit.
Recently, you can see the newest ever-in-the-art hat collections you can see on the streets of the shops in Paris Mode Week.
If you want to add bigger hats to your collection or stop the sun completely, it's easier to find suitable hats for you.
The designer Valentino and Thom Browne, for the 2019 First Bachelor/Yaz collection, published an incredible variety of accessories in the podium. The collection also expanded the names that indicate the style trends in the Paris Moda Week.
This letter was written by very unusable hats that broke into Instagram, and the designers of these hats drew their designs from the podium.
One of Valentino's prefabricated designs was a large-faced black hat that covered the entire head of the model.
Among other large-scale accessories with precious stones, there's a large hat and even a ring, but of course these accessories aren't designed to protect your head from cold.
Thom Browne, another collection of strange masks, was very much in harmony with the spirit of the Cadillary Bay.
Most of the color masks were closed with a close-up, and masks reminded many of Hannibal Lecter's designs.
One of the design reminds one of a snowflake and the seaviews of his own, like an inexhaustible steaming crew.
You're lucky you're following the fashion trends.
He says the style scientists will be able to take place in the vineyards of stores in the short term.
The big hats, together with the "La Bomba" collection, were quickly trended, and we saw many large-scale special hats from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The brand behind the unusual shape of the social media has made a major design more popular in its appearance: the poor beach bag it carried has shown its size in a major model model of its size.
The design of La Riviera in front of the La Riviera/Yaz collection, which was presented by Jacquemus in Paris Moda Week 2019, was covered with a white bag full of paper.
Commentist Luke Armitage told the FC in connection with these designs: "I expect to take place in the future writing store windows of big hats and beach bags. The designer has created such a powerful effect that it will be very difficult to resist the demand for guidance for large-scale accessories."
John Edward: Language skills are important to people around the world
Iceland's independent schools have a successful history in academia. In 2018 this success was accompanied by the potential test results of sports, arts, music and other civil society.
The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) is currently in the process of providing the best service to students, students and parents.
Independent schools are designed to prepare their students for their next education and higher education, their choice of careers, and their willingness to be a citizen of the world.
We see that modern languages continue to be popular in schools and to be a necessary education, as educational institutions that can be applied to them.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you speak to each other in your own language,
If you speak in your mother tongue, you will surely be comforted."
It is a powerful reminder that we must rely only on English if we want to establish relationships with people from other countries and establish mutual trust.
If we base this year's final test results on independent schools, we can see that language classes are at the top of the score tables.
This year, a total of 68% of foreign-language students were enrolled with A who had a high score.
According to SCIS's 74-member school, 72 percent of Chinese students, 72 percent of Germans, 69 percent of French and 63 percent of Spanish students were enrolled with A.
This data shows that schools of independent schools in Scotland support foreign language classes that children and young people will certainly need in the future.
The language courses that are to be chosen are in line with the FeTEMM (Fen Sciences, Technology, Engineering and Mathematical) classes of independent schools and other schools.
In 2014, a study conducted by the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland Commission found that 17% of the difficulties experienced by the administrations were related to the fact that they had a new element of their free position.
That's why language barriers are becoming more demanding in preparing young people for future careers.
Because of the fact that there is a need for more cooperation to be able to speak more languages, these expectations have become fundamental in a global world.
A person who knows a second language, independent of his chosen career, will be given a real advantage in the future because he is able to use it for the rest of his life.
Having real communication with people from other countries takes more than one language before a person can be accepted.
According to a survey conducted by YouGov in 2013, over 4,000 people in the United Kingdom do not know the foreign language until they can communicate with more than 75% of people and no foreign language (15) is available in two languages except French.
That's why it's important for your children to invest in learning your language today.
The ability to speak more than one language to master the languages of the developing economies will increase the chances of finding a decent job for children in the future.
The language taught in schools in Scotland is different.
While some schools provide more traditional modern language options, some schools are teaching languages that will be important for the United Kingdom in 2020, such as China or Japan.
Your child may choose one of the many foreign - language choices taught by scientists in this field of independent schools.
The aim is to provide an independent school environment that will prepare the children for the future and provide them with the skills they need to succeed.
In today's global work environment, it is a fact that foreign languages continue to move their lives so as to be important to the future of the country, and that must also be buried in the life of real education.
In fact, modern languages need to be evaluated as "interconnective communication needs".
Independent schools will continue to provide young people with this choice, diversity and success.
You have to do it.
John Edward, Director of the Institute of Independent Schools
LeBron will wear the first Lakers form in San Diego on the market.
LeBron James's waiting for Los Angeles Lakers to get out of his first car will soon end.
Lakers' husband Luke Walton explained that James will be in the field during the opening season of the season to play against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego on the market.
But it didn't work out for a few minutes.
Walton, on the Lakers official website, said "this period will be shorter than a minute, 48 minutes."
According to Lakers' deputy Mike Trudell's tweet, James will be on the stage for a limited period of time.
After this week's training, James was asked about plans for Lakers' six-year-old program.
James said, "I don't need the first season to prepare for my career,"
Trump's West Virginia Meeting Time, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump starts his evening meeting program in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This meeting will be the first of five meetings to be held by Trump next week.
The President of the U.S. Supreme Court has been elected to the vote for the United States Supreme Court, and the President intends to take the support of the people in the elections in June to the elections against the risk of losing power in Congress.
How can you watch West Virginia Mitting this evening from the Internet?
Trump's Wheeling, West Virginia meeting is scheduled to be held at 19:00 p.m. on Saturday, 29 September 2018, at 6:00 p.m.
You can watch Trump's West Virginia meeting alive from the YouTube channel below.
The trumpet will, in a large way, be worth this week's session with Brett Kavanaugh, who announced his name for the High Court membership.
However, the main purpose of this campaign is to help the Community Party to win its victory over the new risk in its press elections.
According to Reuters, President Trump's campaign will be held in the coming week for five meetings, "to protect and expand the success of the Community Party in the Senate and the House of Representatives."
He used the words "The control of Congress is so important for another day that the president will visit as many states as possible throughout the campaign," a speaker who worked for the Trump campaign and didn't want to give his name to Reuters.
According to West Virginia Metro News, the meeting planned to be held at Wheeling Wesbanco Arena tonight "may attract supporters in Ohio and Pennsylvania and take place in Pittsburgh media."
Trump will have visited twice during the month of our state meeting on Wednesday. U.S. President of West Virginia won the 2016 election in the country.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Senato Island, which remains in the polls of the People's Party.
According to news from Reuters, political scientist Simon Haeder from West Virginia University said "It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the head must come and support Morrisey in the polls,"
Ryder Cup 2018: The U.S. team is struggling to keep their hopes alive when it comes to key matches on Tuesday
Foursome games that took place after the three-sided game, after Saturday afternoon, took place in the Ryder Cup.
It's a full-time sport concept that I've always played from one team to the other, but sportsmen believe it from the heart, especially in games like this.
And the players think who I am right now?
Jordan Spieth said, at the end of the day, "They started six points ahead and this difference has now fallen four times, so I can say we've won a little bit."
Of course, the European team's four-point and the game's 12-point winning was on the day of the event.
According to Spieth, the Americans feel they've taken the wind off their back, and especially the fact that Spieth and Justin Thomas are in the form of a day-to-day play, and they both have three points.
Spieth was an example for everyone by showing a perfect performance from the start to the end.
Spieth and Thomas, together with the two others, have carried out a major ponting campaign to bring the school together after losing both ends.
The 15-day ponting attack on the American team also brought similar shouts of joy, which showed that Spieth believed that the American team continued to fight.
Spieth used the expression "you have to force yourself and just think about your own performance," regarding the matter.
All players need to think about it right now.
It's been 18 weeks since they could make a difference.
In the last two days, the only two who won more points than Spieth and Thomas, the most important two players in Ryder Cup were Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood.
Europe's different but loving two people, four of them, won the score, and they made no mistakes.
"Moliwood" was the only two who didn't fight the bogey after breakfast, and they escaped from the bogey fighting in the last nine days of the morning after Friday morning and Friday morning.
This supports the idea that the performances and the energy they take from the crowd will win the day of the market. They will probably be the most popular players in Fleetwood or Molinari, when the day ends in Le Golf National.
The choice is expected to bring this to the same fate as both of them.
But it's early to talk about the success of the European team.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson won a short match with Sergio Garcia and Alex Noren in the early morning game.
In the first nine holes, a double and double bogey gave way to a bad score that didn't save the Spanish and Swedish players until the end of the game.
But on the market, no one can help change the bad school.
It's a really exciting experience to be able to watch for fourballs and four games. It's a really exciting experience to see the interaction between the two of them, to see what they're doing with each other or to see how they can change at the time of their strategy.
Europe has shown a better performance as a parent team so far and has come into a very different world on the final day, but these four games have shown that the U.S. team has not lost the least in the fight, and the suspects from the U.S.
Europe's Ryder Cup's final day is 10-6.
On Saturday, the European team, which completes four and foursome games against the U.S. team 10-6 on Saturday, enters a major advantage on Ryder Cup's last day.
Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, two leading students in Le Golf National, won the Tiger Woods Awards for the first four prizes they won.
Two years ago, Thomas Bjorn's European team, who was about to take the cup they lost in Hazeltine, won a victory against an American team that didn't know what was going on in the morning. He won the 3-1 series.
The U.S. won two matches, showing more weight in the wedding tournament, but he didn't realize it.
Jim Furyk's team needs to get eight points from the 12-pound game on the market every day to hold the doll.
Fleetwood was the first European chess player to win 4 points next week, and he won the name "Mollwood" last weekly, and he won the second two in four matches in the history of the Ryder Cup.
After studying Woods and Patrick Reed in their team games, they were perfectly prepared to compete with a much more effective five-and-a-half-year-old Bryson Dechambeau.
On Saturday, Woods, who drove himself through two games, lost four tops and four tournaments on the 29th of March and had seven matches.
Justin Rose, who listened to the four games in the morning, was the first and third world partner to Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka and received 2&1 updates.
Still, in the south of Paris, Europe didn't act as it wanted on a nice and airy day.
Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, the winner of the three majors, were awarded a prize for the Americans on a two-point day.
After winning a 4th round against John Rahm and Ian Poulter from Spain, they won 2 and 1th of the 4th game of Poulter and Rory McIllroy, and they won 4-3.
In the history of the Ryder Cup, only once a team gets four points left on the keys, but as the owner of the Cup, it's enough to win a match to keep the Foryk Cup in its hands.
And together, after two days of being the best second, it seems like a day of attack is going to be very far behind.
North Korea says it's not possible to unarm itself without security.
On Wednesday, North Korean Foreign Affairs Day, he told the United Nations that the ongoing embargoes in the country had deepened the security of the United States and that under these conditions the country would not give up nuclear weapons in any way alone.
Ri Yong Ho, told the World Foundation for the Year of the Year, North Korea's Nuclear-Tests last year, the nuclear-tests, the withdrawal of nuclear testing and the promise that nuclear weapons and nuclear technology will not be produced.
"Despite this, we can't see it from the U.S.," he added.
"No confidence in the Lord will undermine our national security, and there will be no way for us to arm ourselves alone first under these conditions."
It seems important that Ri, when we know of a "living" approach that will be rewarded by North Korea's gradual move towards Washington's return to language, it is important that North Korea's complaints are rescinded, as Pyongyang did in the past, only because he refused to deny the removal of nuclear weapons as Pyongyang did.
Ri, the first time he had to work with U.S. President of the United States, was sent to the joint statements made by Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un on the summit that he had made on 12 April "The increase in the Korean share of nuclear power" by Kim.
North Korea, 1950-1953, is looking for ways to officially end the Korean War, but the United States says it needs to withdraw from its nuclear weapons before Pyongyang.
Washington also referred to the call for action by the violent international community in North Korea.
Ri says, "The United States insists on 'absolutely nuclear-depleting' and increases its level of pressure with actions to achieve its objectives by means of oppressive means, and even against 'the fact that the war has ended'," he says.
"The only thing that can cause us to fall into error is the vain desires of those who have no knowledge of Ours.
But the problem is that our actions continue to undermine our security."
At the beginning of the week, Ri did not find any idea of a second summit plan to be carried out between the U.S. U.S. leader Trump and Kim at the beginning of the week.
In the last five months, he attacked three meetings between South Korean leader Moon Jae and Kim and added: "If this nuclear issue were not reported by the U.S. and South Korea, it wouldn't be a secret cause for the increase in Korea's nuclear aid in this way."
Again, the tone of Ri's speech was very different from the last year's "Mr. Satan President" in BM General Kurulu, who said that North Korea's rockets would not escape the U.S. parental targets of the U.S. rockets.
Trump, who was present at the last year when he threatened to "daminate completely" North Korea, said that this year he was proud to show Kim the need to take steps to avoid weapons in the United Nations, but that was still a lot of work to be done and that the operations should continue to follow the North Korea nuclear power.
On Wednesday, Trump said, "It doesn't matter if it takes two years or three or five months."
As a result of the steps taken by China and Russia, the BM Security Council indicated that Pyongyang should be rewarded.
However, U.S. Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo told the BM Security Council on Thursday: "The Council's actions must continue with violence and no failure until the end of the nuclear-consumer is realized."
Since 2006, the Security Council, Pyonyang's nuclear and ballistic fission programmes have been co-ordinated in the North Korea, with a view to halting funds.
Pompeo, during BM General Kurulu, met Ri and then said he was going to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second tour.
Pompeo visited North Korea three times this year, but the last visit wasn't good.
The hours after he left, he said he was registered as a Pyongyang in December, he complained that North Korea had "maphivary demands" on him.
North Korea, at a meeting with Moon this month, has promised to remove a surface area and a nuclear complex while the United States is taking "consistent steps."
Moon said Kim's "consistent steps" to him were the security guarantees that Trump provided in Singapore and the steps that were taken to normalize relations with Washington.
Harvard students get enough rest classes
This year at Harvard University, a new school is aimed at getting more and more into line with the goal of combating "all nighttime" with a macho culture that works with all its students.
One academic found that when he came to show himself to them, he found that students of a digital university in the world were not even aware of the most basic information.
Professor of sleep therapy at Harvard Tüp University and Professor of the Brigham and Women's Hospital, Charles Czeisler, believed to be the first example of the U.S. type.
He took the inspiration from a discussion about his ability to learn about sleeplessness.
Professor The Telegraph said, "At the end of the conversation, a woman student came to me and said, "Why are these all telling me now, when I'm last?"
So far he has said that no one has told him about the importance of sleeping so far that this has surprised me."
This year's first open school students explain how good sleep habits are helpful in academic and athletic performance and how they develop general meals at the same time.
Professor of Psychiatry at Harvard Tüp University and general manager of the University's health services, Paul Barreira, said he had decided that students had been seriously ill within a week.
An hour's class contains a series of interactive tasks.
One section contains a local picture of how the performance of coffee and light performance is affected by the fact that the students are impressed by the quality of sleep by the sound of coffee, prayer, teachers and books, as well as the importance of regular sleep.
In another section, participants are told how their lack of long-term sleep can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression and cancer.
A campaign map containing interactive symbols later encourages participants to think about their own daily routines.
"We know that students will not change their behavior at any time.
However, we believe that if you have the right to know how to choose how to use tobacco, you have the right to know how it affects your health," said Professor Czeisler.
He added that modern technology and students still have a culture of pride, adding that there is an increasing pressure on modern technology and students, which is an increasing problem of sleeplessness.
He said that it should be "a secret weapon" to ensure that sleep and sleep are good quality, to combat stress, fatigue and anxiety, and even to avoid taking more than a kilogram of sleep, because sleeplessness is caused by the students ’ constant sense of openness when it comes to their brain.
When he was 19 years old, he helped Professor Czeisler, a 19-year-old professor of chemical and physical biology in California, who took a course in the first year of his school year.
He said he opened his eyes and inspired him to create awareness at the campus.
In the next step, he hopes his students will want to complete a similar course before they are involved in rehabilitation.
Professor Czeiss suggests that they will sleep as soon as they wake up students and warn them about the harmful effects of light from electronic screens and LED lights, which can cause sleep problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Mega, Gerrard's men
Dolly Menga's attack on Steven Gerard's team is more likely to be a disappointment to Rangers than another demolition in Livingston.
The Ibrox team was trying to get the first hits in this deposition from the 4-1 in the St. Johnstone's wing, but Gary Holt's team left Gerard as manager of the 18th game, leaving his team in the middle of his second reconnaissance, leaving him behind the eight-point turn of the Ladbrokes Premiership Leader Hearts.
The end of the first morning was seven minutes long, and the low moral Rangers didn't seem to be coming.
Now that Rangers is down the sixth line, Livingston has only one hand in the way of the Hibernian.
Also, it seems that the alien material that has been thrown away from the plane seems to be on the way more difficult for Rangers after it has been treated by Judge Calum Spence and the damage that has been caused by the judge.
Gerard, changing eight players in his team, took Air to Betfred Cup in half the final of the 11th.
Last week, Holt didn't make any changes in Livingston 11 from a point of view from Hearts, and he was happy that he didn't take any chances at all.
Although Rangers has dominated his office in the group government, Livingston has been able to do more work than they have.
Menga's first short walk to Scott Pittman was supposed to have been held by Allan McGregor in the second minute, but his middle-class player missed this great chance.
Later, Keaghan Jacobs found Captain Craig People's free fight but his team friend, Alan Lithgow, attacked the back of the team directly.
The Rangers had a lot of hope in their games in the last thirty minutes.
When Stephen Lawless was hit by the last 15 minutes of the game, Alfredo Morelos was convinced that they had definitely got a pen, but Judge Steven Thomson didn't listen to the conquistadores.
The Rangers managed to send only two of them to the streets in the first half of the first half of the world, but old Ibrax was not forced to take off the head of Liam Kelly Lassana Coulibaly and Ovie Ejaria's silent fight.
If Livingston lost his first 34 minutes of playing the game, no one can deny that he gained his chance.
The Rangers Jacobs didn't care about the bloody crowd.
The Declan Gallagher team wasn't found in any form when they sent Scott Robinson, who was sent to Menga for an easy completion.
Gerrard took the Coulibaly instead of taking out Ryan Kent between the turns, and when he showed the change he was going to send the band to Morelos, the active player blocked the ball from Kelly's cell.
But Livingston continued to play well in the game they took pleasure in playing with the long groups they sent to Lithgow and the People.
Holt's team could've raised their differences in the final stages of the game, but McGregor went up to stop Jacobs before he had a big head attack on the Lithgow side.
The Rangers Seven Glenn Middleton hit the end of the game with Jacobs right after he wanted a retrial for the team, but Judge Thomson didn't see his request again.
Almanak: The Superman of Geiger
Now a page from our "Morning Morning" Almana: 30 July 1882, 136 years before our day, and the physical day of the birth of Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger in Germany.
Geiger finally developed a method for detecting and measuring radio activity that would bring about a meeting with a known device known as Geiger Assay.
Since then, one of those who have not given up on this science has become one of those who have not been rejected by the pop culture of the "Bells of Coronado" that is probably not seen in the 1950s, as Roy Rogers and Dale Evans are playing.
Adam said, "What is this God's love?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger Xianic, used to find radioactive materials like uranium.
You can hear the effects of the atoms distributed by radioactivity in minerals."
Evans says, "They're definitely shooting now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, only a few days before the 63rd day.
But she's still living in a meeting that bears her name.
The new blood vessel can learn to "see" evil cells in the immune system
The new blood vessel can learn how to kill and kill evil cells in the immune system.
The wind teaches us how to recognize evil cells in the immune system as part of the treatment
The procedure involves extracting blood cells from patients and modifying them in the laboratory
These cells can "perform" the protein associated with many cancer cells and are re-injected
In patients with cancer at varying levels, there are promising results.
A woman who had learned to recognize wrong cells in her immune system had seen breast cancer rise from the middle of her breast cancer for more than 18 months.
The treatment includes the use of herbicide cells and the re-injection of Her2 protein found in many cancer cells by differentiating from patients in the laboratory.
In Bethesda, the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Maryland, Professor Jay Berzofsky said: "Our results show that we have a very promising future."
HER2, meme, mercy, hunger and thirst also explains that "the increase in cancer in many ways" is due to including cancers.
He's been working on a kind of close-up solution like teaching them how to get cancer cells from patients.
Kanye West, from the MAGA Head of the SNL, was involved in the trumpeters' disputes after the attack.
It didn't work out.
Kanye West Saturday Night Live was interviewed by U.S. President Donald Trump during his interview with the U.S. President, and was interviewed at the studio after he said he would sit in the presidential office in 2020.
After the third song of the night and the song called Ghost Town, which was worn by the Mace American Great, he took part in the fight against Democrats and won his support for Trump.
"I spoke to a white man many times and they said to me, 'How do you like Trump, he's a thief?' "
Well, if I were worried about corruption, I'd leave America a long time ago."
The SNL show was under the leadership of Matt Damon, and the Hollywood star Christine Blasey Ford began to complain about the sexual harassment charges made by Brett Kavanaugh against the Senate Committee of Justice.
Although not published, images of West's talks were loaded on social media by Chris Rock, who came from the comet.
I don't know if Rock's been trying to communicate with the West by uploading the video.
He also complained to the Western audience that he had been having difficult times in the back of the stage because of his hat.
"They raped me behind my back.
They said, "Don't come out with that hat,"
They raped me!
And then they say I'm in a western place," according to the Washington Examiner.
The West went on to say, "Do you want to see the west?" "I'll spend my Superman money because it means you can't tell me what to do.
Try love."
According to Variety, West's content was at least doubled by viewers and the SNL casts seemed to be embarrassed, saying to one person around, "The whole studio was covered with silence,"
West, his former boyfriend rapist Mac Miller was called a few days ago by the song singer Ariana Grande, who didn't show up before his death.
West was surprised to see a lot of people with the I Love it song that a Perrier told her into the South.
West, TPUSA leader from Candace Turner, a leading group, supported this tweet: "To one of the most powerful spirits: THE CALABILITY OF THE CALABILITY OF THE CHANGE."
But talk show server Karen Hunter, West's "who's the only one and who's really great" tweeted.
"But I choose to reward someone whom I think I am the ideologies that are harmful to my population and who I think you're selling your music or your clothes or "supporting" it.
He's free.
And so will we."
Before the program, the rapist suggested that he had changed his name on Twitter and now that "the Kanye West is officially known as Kanye. "
He's not the first artist to go to the West after his name was changed and his name was Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Another rapist, Snoop Dogg, changed his name as Snoop Lion. Of course, his faithful music poet, Prince, changed his name to a symbol and became known as Prince.

Kit Harrington's star Game of Thrones gave him toxicity
Kit Harrington is known for his fantastic Middle Left series, which includes HBO's violent scenes, with the character of the fighter Jon Snow in Game of Thrones.
But a 31-year-old actor found himself in a rapist who said that the role of this kind of role in the screen was usually the way young men felt they had to be hard to see.
Kit, who spoke about The Sunday Times Culture, said that he thought "some things weren't going on," and asked how to deal with the problem of toxic men during #MeToo.
A short time ago, a friend of the role in the Game of Thrones series, who was married to Rose Leslie at the age of 31, said that she was thinking about "dwelling" about going on the matter.
Kit says, "I think you're personally thinking about it right now.
What do we teach them when men grow up, when we see the face of this problem that we are living in?"
Kit, because of multiple masculinity, believes that TV can play a role in the strength of toxic men.
He will say, "What is it that you were taught?"
What is taught on television and on the street by young men that these young people feel they have to have certain qualities of men?
One of the most important questions in my life, I think, is: How can we change this?
Because it's obvious that some things aren't going well for young men."
In his report, Kit said that after the end of the future Game of Thrones, he would not play in parts that told about the past or the future and that he was now "abstained from warfields and horses."
Kit will play in a game called "The West" that Sam Shepard once again staged in August, which tells the story of a moviemaker and a thief's brother.
The actor recently explained that his game of Thrones was the best thing to do with Rose's wife.
Kit said, "I met my husband on this line, so a series of look-in-the-art gave me my family and my life after that."
Rose, Emmy played the favorite of John Snow character that Kit showed in the fantasy series.
In the summer of 2018, he married Leslie's family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reported a 14% increase in the new wave
China, HIV and AIDS are said to be a 14 percent increase.
According to health authorities, the virus has affected more than 820,000 people in the country.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, more than 40,000 new cases were reported.
In contrast with the past, it has been noted that many new ones have engaged in sexual relations.
In the past, the HIV virus was spread rapidly at the end of the infected blood clot in some parts of China.
However, the health authorities in a conference in Greece said that the number of people who were infected with HIV was almost zero.
Along with this, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 per year.
The sexually transmitted HIV virus is a serious problem for the LGBT population in China.
Sexuality indicates that despite the fact that it was released in China in 1997, there was continued discrimination against LGBT units.
In the work done, it is estimated that 70% of men who are sexually active are married to women because of the country's relatively high values.
Disease is often due to a lack of adequate attention to the protection of these sexual relationships.
The Chinese government has been promising general access to HIV drugs as part of its fight against disease and disease since 2003.
Maxine Waters rejected the idea that one of those who worked with "hazardous lies" and "complex theories" had violated the National Party Senate's data.
In a statement made by the U.S. National Commissioner Maxine Waters on Wednesday, one of his employees rejected the idea that three U.S. Senators share personal information on Wikipedia pages.
The Democratic Party of Los Angeles, Waters of the Nationality, continued to support the idea of "extremely healthy" politicians and websites.
Waters used the expression "falses, lies and less lies" in his statement on Twitter.
Among the information shared, South Carolina indicates that Utah Senator Lindsey Graham and Utah have also found the addresses and phone numbers of Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch's home addresses.
This information about Congress Members was posted on the Internet by an anonymous person during the session of the Senate group meeting on Friday, the Supreme Court of the island of Brett Kavanaugh.
The incident occurred after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
According to a report in Hill, Internet sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, such as RedState, revealed that the IP address of the source of the shipment was connected to the Waters office and published information from one of the Waters workers.
Waters used the expression "These false ideas are totally wrong and false," in connection with the matter.
"The fact that I'm working at risk of identity, personal information and security because of these false and unfounded ideas is not responsible for breaking these information.
These nonsense ideas are totally wrong and false."
The statement by Waters has attracted some people's attention on the Internet, and the White Saray Press Secretary, Ari Fleisher, was among those who wanted his opinion.
Fleisher, in his explanation, wrote, "This is a ridiculous lie,"
"It shows that Waters does not have the necessary qualifications to be a Congressman.
No one's supposed to be upset when he's exposed to a crime he hasn't committed.
The actions should not be shown as disabled.
He must not question the motives of the one who has offended him.
He needs to be calm and calm."
Fleisher compared his view of Waters with those of the Democrats, who appeared to be very harsh on the Friday meeting.
In the inter-elections, President Omar Navarro, who was named after Waters' seat, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter:
"If he's right, he'll play it out."
Waters, in his statement, stated that his office "has been informed about these false ideas by the competent authorities and the security organization."
Waters used the statement "We will ensure that the file is released in the middle and that these dangerous actions can harm all those who work," he used.
Johnny English Recycling: Rowan Atkinson's missing agent parish
The English production has now become possible to connect all new films with Brexit. This is also the result for Johnny English, who started with him in 2003, and Johnny English's return film again in 2011.
Will our own ironic film about how evil we are? Will our country have a new chance of freedom?
At least, the unbridled Johnny English character, who was attentive to the sights and motion pictures, has renewed his ability to do everything ever more. In fact, even the name Johnny English shows that the character is a highly developed catchable comedy element for non-speaking English movies.
Johnny English, although it is strangely safe and close to him, is an abstract secret agent from Clouseau, some from Mr. Bean and a few from London 2012 Olympics, which is associated with Chariots of Fire's music.
In fact, for this secret agent's role, Barclaycard TV advertising that has now been forgotten has been inspired by Atkinson and inspired by a secret tour of the nations that have created a chaos at the end of each of his work.
You can find this new Johnny English film in a few comics.
I liked the area where Johnny was approaching the helicopter in the middle of the war with the Central Child on the English side, and he jumped into the helicopter's perimeter and blew his voice out.
Atkinson's physical comedy looks like it's but I've found that the table item in the film is very weak and weird, especially 007 and our assignment as a "ciddi" film can be seen as more than ever if we think that the film's comedian material is included in the scenarios.
The content of the film seems to be directed to many adults, and I believe that the strangeness of Johnny English is not as creative and thoughtless as the character of the silent film comet at Atkinson.
It's about this movie that the Great Britain is under serious threat.
A cyber-crime, drawing into England's most secret agent network, reveals the identity of all the agents working in the field in England and falls into the scene of the agent who keeps his watch at night.
The political populace is the last blow to a very difficult situation that has come to an end: Emma Thompson, like Theresa May, has done his best to demonstrate this character, but the scenario is not a good text so much that it can work and develop.
The President indicates that the Commissioner has to be informed of the identity of all active agents and that he has to appoint a qualified agent for that purpose.
This is also the case with Johnny English. Johnny English, when teaching in a school where rich students are studying after graduation, also provides lessons about how to be a secret agent out of the register: there were some funny speakers in these areas where English School of Rock was a type of agency.
English is being taken to Whitehall Sara for a quick briefing and again comes in contact with former relief assistant, Ben Miller, who was shown by Bough.
Bough is married to a seamstress, and he's a little empty in this role for Vicki Pepperd, who's showing Bough's wife.
The Masters of the Secret Service are thrown into a two-fold macara known as the terrible abuse of everything, and they meet with a beautiful woman named Ophelia Bulletova, whom Olga Kurylenko has killed.
On the other hand, the President, England, is under the influence of the charismatic technology billionaire who claimed to be able to solve the cyber problem: this devil character, named Jason Volta, is being animated by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their adventures full of absurd fun: They enter Garson's daughter and go out to a French luxury restaurant; they go to the warehouse while trying to go to Volta's luxury bed in secret. English, while trying to use the virtual reality vision to learn about Volta's plan.
All of these events are related to a point at the end of the scenario, but the film has an understanding of children's television programs as pleasant and fun as it is.
The esprites are very busy.
Like other Johnny English films, I couldn't think of this: Can't the English film sector really give Rowan Atkinson a good role?
The Labour Party rejected the idea that a five-day pay-off plan had been made four days a week for British workers.
Jeremy Corbyn's leadership is expected to develop a radical plan that includes four days a week's work without any pay.
According to the party, the company's employers want to use the products obtained by industrial intelligence for a further day's work.
According to the plan, those who work will have three days of work but will continue to receive the same salary.
The sources of the message, the idea party's plans to address the economic day and the country's policies are "suitable".
The English Labour Union Congress also supports the four-day table offering as a way to benefit workers from the changing economy.
An upper-level source of the Labour Party found The Sunday Times in the statement: "A policy survey is expected to take place by the end of the year.
This is not a plan that can be achieved in one night but a four-day working week idea, a desire for the party's economy to be in line with its policy of reorganization and the general industrial strategy."
The Workers' Party is not the first party to make this point. The Eiding Party, 2017, was in the general election campaign for four working days a week.
But this desire is not currently supported by the entire Labour Party.
A speaker from the Labour Party made this statement: "The four-day work plan is not between the party's policies and is currently not being evaluated by the party."
Gölge Chancellor John McDonnell described in detail the vision of a socialist revolution in the economy at a conference last week.
McDonnell pointed out that powerful public services are determined to withdraw from "unidentified managers" and "the French" of their companies.
The Government of the Labour Party also means that the plans of the Gölge Chancellor will not be able to recover all the shares of the company's existing water companies in order to make them "responsible" in the event of an accident.
McDonnell also confirmed the company's management plans to take place in the company's management bodies. It also plans to create the Capsam State Funds to accommodate 10 percent of its employees.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy explained that the FBI's 60-minute questionnaire will not change and change their views on Kavanaugh.
Justice Brett Kavanaugh's investigation into the case of the FBI of the case against the Supreme Court has resulted in at least one week's delay in voting for the Supreme Court's membership, and this also raises a daily question of why the public senators do not support the issues that might arise in the FBI's report.
In a report on "60 Minutes" published on Tuesday, President Scott Pelley asked that public senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham could not change their views on the FBI.
Kennedy seemed more open to changing his view of South Carolina.
And Kennedy said, "Of course,
I talked to Judge Kavanaugh when I was going to sit down.
I called him and I said, "Did you do this?"
Kavanaugh used his words with courage, determination and purity."
On the other hand, Graham's play seems to be less likely to change.
Graham said, "I have made my decision about Brett Kavanaugh and there must be a very serious crime to change my mind,"
Graham, calling Christine Blasey Ford, who put the idea in the middle, said, "I don't know what's going on, Dr. Ford, but I know this: Brett has definitely rejected this idea,"
"No one who named Ford can confirm this idea.
It's been 36 years since that.
I don't think it's something new to change."
What Is Global Citizen Festival and What Did It Take to Reduce Poverty?
New York, this comet will own a home for the Global Citizen Festival, which is the last music event organized by the most influential stars each year.
This seventh year's Global Citizen Festival will also raise awareness of the role of artists, such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, as well as the mission to end the lack of activity by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, launched in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project. The Global Poverty Project is an international press group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people who are actively fighting poverty.
Those who want to join the concert must perform certain tasks or "actions" in order to get an activity free of charge if they do not want to pay the VIP ticket money. Among these are volunteer work, e-mailing to world leaders, searching for specific people or raising awareness about the purpose of ending poverty.
And how successful has the Global Citizen Festival been in order to achieve its goal for the past 12 years?
Does it really convince people to give a concert ticket to people? Or is it a situation that makes people feel that they are really different by signing a petition on the Internet or by using a tweet?
The Global Citizen movement has indicated that there are 19 million "yes" required by its supporters to meet many different targets since 2011.
According to the Global Citizen Group, these actions have led world leaders to explain more than 37 billion U.S. citizens' wishes and notifications, and they are intended to affect more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the Group transferred 390 complaints and notifications at the end of the supporters' actions and at least 10 billion US dollars have already been paid or collected.
The Global Citizen Group estimates that the funds received under the target are currently around 649 million people worldwide.
Among the important institutions found in the polls is the "The Power of Nutrition" (The Power of Communication) in England. Finally, a partnership between investors and project planners aimed at helping to bring about an end to the lack of funding in Rwanda, with the aim of helping to bring about 35 million U.S. dollars.
The Power of Nutrition apostle Tracey Ullman, a live concert held in November 2018, told observers: "We can eliminate the problem of social injustice by the Government of England, the donors, the national governments and the Global Citzen supporters like you."
According to the Global Citizen Group, the government of England, after calling for action against 5,000 women and children to move into action to improve their mother and child care, announced that the Government will provide funding for the The Power of Nutrition project and will reach 5 million women and children with the project's delivery services.
On the website of the Global Citizen Festival, Sícha asked questions, "Why do you think we can end the absence of more?"
And it was said: This shall be a painful journey, and we shall be overcome at times.
But we're going to succeed because we're stronger together like all civil rights and anti-diversity actions before us.
This year in New York, artists like Janet Jackson, the Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monée will also take part in the activities of Debora-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The Interior Minister explained that the United States could use the Sea Force for a "ablution" to prevent Russia's energy movement
According to a report from the Washington Examiner, U.S. Interior Minister Ryan Zinge said they could use the Sea Force to prevent access to world markets in order to include Russian energy sources in the Middle East.
Zinke claims that Russia is an excuse to explore new energy markets in Syria, but Russia is carrying out operations in Syria on the government's call.
Zinke, "I think that the goal of the Russians to negotiate the Middle East is to make energy agreements, such as in Eastern Europe and in southern Europe," he used their expressions.
He also looked at the various ways and means of combating it.
Zinke said, "We have the power to keep sea routes open because of our maritime forces as the United States, and if necessary, we can stop these routes so that Russian energy does not reach the market," she said.
Ryan Zinge, in the United States, interviewed participants in the activities organised by the Consumer Energy Alliance group, which identified himself as "the sound of energy leaks."
Zinke, in his speech, compared Washington's relationship with Russia and Iran to that of the two countries, indicating that they are almost the same.
"One of the economic options on our table with Iran and Russia is to pressure them and take their place in the energy field," Zinke identified Russia as a "one-field success" country with a fossil fuel-related economy.
These explanations were made on the mission launched by the Trump administration to replace Russian natural gas, which is a much shorter alternative to European consumers, and to increase the flow of heated natural gas into Europe.
In connection with this mission, U.S. President Donald Trump's authorities are working to convince Germany "unsuitable" Nord Stream 2 to be removed from the border project. According to Trump, this project has turned Berlin into a "privileged" in Moscow.
Moscow, 11 billion North Stream 2 boroughs has been hit repeatedly by a single economic project, which will reach 110 billion metrics by drawing out its existing border capacity on both sides.
Kremlin continues that under Washington's violent attack on the project, there are only economic reasons and that this is an example of injustice.
In a meeting in Moscow in July with U.S. Energy Bank Rick Perry, Russian Energy Bank Alexander Novak recorded: "I believe that we are generous about the need to be free from the pressure of energy as a means of application and that consumers should be free to choose what they want."
The U.S.'s attitude is that of Germany, which has brought about its renegotiation of the project.
At the time of the launch of the German Federation (BDI), one of the leading institutions in Germany, he asked the United States to deal with the EU's energy policy and the two agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
Following a meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin shortly after the meeting, President Dieter Kempf of the German Federation, "I feel very uncomfortable about the fact that third-party companies are threatening our energy supply," he explained.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren, Aday Olma's "Environment" in the 2020 Presidency Meeting
On Wednesday, Senator Elizabeth Warren explained that he would think of the presidential position after the elections as "round".
Hollyoke confirmed that he would appreciate Warren's willingness to be a guest at the museum in Massachusetts.
According to a report in Hill, Warren used his statement "The time has come for women to rehabilitate the corrupt system of government in Washington, and a woman has to go to jail for it," he used.
Warren said, "After 6 November I'll think about the position of the president,"
Warren, who was also in the mood for President Donald Trump at a news conference, said that Trump was "misleading the country."
"I'm worried about what Donald Trump has done to democracy," said the senator.
Warren, Trump and Trump brought the Supreme Court Island with their comments on Brett Kavanaugh.
Senator used a statement in a tweet that he shared on the day of the market, "The FBI must do an investigation before he can play."
On the other hand, according to a poll published on Friday, Warren doesn't want most of his supporters to be present in 2020.
According to a survey carried out by the Suffolk University Political Research Centre/Boston Globe, five percent of the "ola" Massachusetts voters indicated that the senator should not be named.
Hundreds of thirty-two support it as a name.
Anket showed that the number of people who supported Vali Deval Patrick's reputation was higher than that of those who supported Patrick's reputation, and that of those who opposed it, it was eight hundred and thirty-eight.
In the 2020 presidential elections, there are also former Vice-President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, among other democratic figures known as the aide.
According to the news on the Associated Press, Bidan will have decided as official until October.
Sarah Palin referred to Track Palin at the Donald Trump meeting
At the age of 26, Track Palin spent a year in Iraq after he joined the army in July.
Track Palin was arrested on the night of the market with violence against women
Sarah Palin, Tulsa, told the audience at a meeting held in Oklahoma by Donald Trump: "I better understand the other families who live with the afterlife after their son's return to their country, the after-traveling stress disorder and the pain caused by our soldiers."
Palin went on to say that his arrest was "an obvious fact from the victim's hand" and that as regards Palin, his son and other newspapers, "they turn out to be a bit different and emotionally sensitized from the war, and they are surprised that their fellows of arms, pilots and troops will not respect the sacrifices they have made for this country," he said.
Dan Bennett, who served as a spokesman at the Vasilla Police Centre, explained that he was arrested on the market on the day of his first day in Alaska with allegations of violence against his wife.
18 states and Colombia support the recognition of their new asylum policy
Eighty-eight states and the Columbia Region support the new U.S. policy which has been adopted to ban the right to asylum from domestic or state or family violence.
According to a news report in the NBC News, 18 states in Washington on Friday, and representatives of the Colombian region were sent to court to support a new asylum seeker.
The U.S. Civil Liberties Union did not provide the full name of the defendant in the Grace version Sessions case, which was opened in August to appeal to federal policy.
Grace, her partner, and "the children of a sexist state" said they were violent, but the U.S. authorities rejected the asylum requirement in the 20th century.
Grace, he was taken to Texas.
Lawyers who defended Grace, the mother of a large number of people who took the lead in the United States, have spread El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala and have been appointed as nations that are faced with domestic violence.
Along with the new U.S. asylum policy, the U.S. Immigration Team has broken down the 2014 decision that allows people who have fled from domestic violence to take refuge.
In his statement on Friday, Prime Minister Karl Racine stated that the new policy "has lost federal and international laws with state laws."
The information report used the expression "The Federal Law indicates that all asylum requirements, the requirement must be related to its own status and interests, and that such a law would accept this first," was used.
Lawyers also argued in the report that the lack of recognition of the right to access to the new policy for migrants has been detrimental to the US economy, that migrants are not involved and that the possibility of "encouraging the remaining labour force" is higher.
U.S. Court of Justice Jeff Sessions requested that the judges who had taken care of the situation in the month of July not be included in the cases of immigration and that they should not be entitled to shelter from the charges of forced violence.
Sessions, on 11th April, reported that "those who live in fear of being raped or deprived of their country may be found in the asylum process because of the theft, religion, prostitution, social group or political encounters," which is why they leave their countries.
"Protection policy, of course, does not carry the goal of reducing all the problems people face every day in every part of the world, even if these are serious problems."
In Palu, where the dead number has gone to two sides, they're fighting time to find those who are alive.
For the rest of your life, the situation is getting more important.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother who tried to comfort her daughter at a nursing home in the city of Palu, whose hopes were shattered, said, "I feel very bad.
There's an ambulance carrying the bodies every minute.
We live in clean water."
Kent's residents found that they were trying to get back to their broken houses to collect the water's damage and to save everything they found.
Hundreds of people were injured, and patients who suffered from a 7.5 degree of depression died and died.
Some of the victims, such as Dwi Haris, who were injured in war and famine, were treated at the Palu Military Hospital, where they were treated in front of the patient.
Haris, in the fifth floor of a hotel, told his wife and daughter about their feelings during a severe depression in their eyes.
Haris, in his report to Associated Press, said: "We didn't have time to save ourselves.
I guess I'm stuck under the wall." The Haris and his family came to join a wedding.
"I heard my wife wanted help, and then she disappeared.
I don't know what's going on with her and my kid.
I hope they're safe."
U.S. Enlarger accused China of violence using "propagandistic propaganda"
The official China newspaper published a daily newspaper published in the United States a four-paged commercial about the advantages of U.S.-China's ticket, which was charged with spreading propaganda using the US media a week after the announcement.
U.S. President Donald Trump, the largest sales newspaper in the state of Iowa last Saturday, changed the payout advertising published by China Daily in De Moines State.
According to U.S. officials who spoke to Reuters, Trump's attempt to challenge Beijing's US elections showed that a new stage was launched in the campaign that was launched by Washington to pressure China.
It's a state of affairs where foreign governments tend to promote the hypocrisy of advertising, but the trade between Beijing and Washington pays high prices to each other for Italy.
According to U.S. scientists, in the first years of the trade war, China's monetary taxes were aimed at influencing refugees in countries such as Iowa, which support the Trump People's Party.
The U.S. Enlargement of China and China has indicated that Pekin, former former president of the Iowa state of Taiwan, has been harming American workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstad, in his letter to the Des Moines Register, stated that China "has increased its burden twice in advertising advertising in the media of free America."
Branstad used these words in his letter: "The Chinese government is benefiting from the first and most recent release of America's freedom of expression in the Des Moines Register to publish its propaganda."
"On the other hand, when you go to a news station in Beijing, you can see that there are fewer media meetings published, and you can't find any accurate information about the economic situation of the Chinese countries, because the media is under the harsh control of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
Branstad stated in his letter that "one of China's previous newspapers refused to publish the article," but he did not mention the name of the newspaper.
Analysts Kavanaugh Phyaskosuy and Communitymen indicate that Women's Elections are distanced from the Middle Ages
While supporting the High Court island of Brett Kavanaugh against more than one of its previous names, analysts have been warned about the behaviour of women in future Community elections.
People were very strong about this, and they were found in newspapers showing that most of the people wanted to continue singing.
Professor Grant Reeher of Political Sciences at the University of Syracuse at Maxwell University said in his statement to an article published on the day of the market in Hill, "this kind of statement will not be accepted back."
Reeher is afraid that Senator Jeff Flake will be able to get the attention of the responsible voters if he asks for a short interview with a FBI in the last minute.
According to a newspaper in Washington, D.C., a leading group on MoveOn's top-level conversation and his national speech, Karine Jean-Pierre said on Friday, "Women will not forget what happened today, and those who wrote will remember it in November."
According to the information given by Mike, the members of the Community Party that formed a majority of the Court Committee, despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's statement, have cast slogans on the corridors of Senato "The House is near!"
An independent political analyst, who spoke on a news site, used the words "Democratic shock and motivation will be outside you," using the expression.
Rothenberg says, "People say that the bones and motivations are already high; that's the right idea.
However, when women in non-voting bunnies and young voters between the ages of 18 and 29 are not in favor of the president in the electoral areas," he said.
Before the open statement made by Ford on the High Court's island of sexual assault as detailed, analysts were going to be able to deal with the situation where members of the Community party were being forced to vote for approval.
According to NBC News, former head of the National Committee of the Communist Party Michael Steele said, "This issue has come to an unprecedented end in the form of the Communist Party."
In his statement to a news channel, Guy Cecil, director of the US Group on Priorities to the Democratic Party in the elections, said: "The issue is not only whether the Committee is playing, voting, or not being a member of the High Court of Kawanaugh.
On the other hand, it seems that the Americans are divided into two groups about whom they will believe after Ford and Kavanaugh's expressions, and the number of those who hold for Ford's side increases slowly.
According to YouGov's new poll, 41 percent of participants indicated that they believed in Kavanaugh's expression in a certain way or in part while believing in Ford's expression.
In addition, 38 percent of participants thought Kavanaugh was definitely or probably lying during his term, and only 30 percent of those who used the same term for Ford were limited to 30 percent.
According to a news report in the Guardian, the FBI began to question for Ford and at least one of the other complainants after Flake's request, and this second complainant was Deborah Ramirez.
Ford expressed his assurance that Kavanaugh, under the influence of alcohol in the Senate Committee last week, had been sexually assaulted.
Ramirez told the High Court island of Kavanaugh that during a party they attended at Yale University in the 1980s, they showed themselves sexual organs.
Plans to launch a new Internet Project, which will capture Google and Facebook by Global Wide Web
World Wide Web's great Tim Berners-Lee; Facebook, Amazon and Google are setting up a new initiative aimed at attracting companies such as Google.
Inrupt, the final project of the technology industry, is a company based on the open source platform of Berners-Lee.
Solid represents the possibility to determine where to store users and which people to access.
In his special report to Fast Company, Berners-Lee said that the original purpose of Inrupt was "to rule the world."
Lee said about starting and saying, "We had to do it now,"
"This is a historic moment."
The application uses Solid technology that allows users to create their own "personal data storage area" or another name for POD.
This storage area can include personal lists, calendars, lists, music books and other personal and professional tools.
The application; it symbolizes a test like using Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify from one browser at the same time.
If the unique feature that separates the personal data storage area from other technologies offers the user the opportunity to fully control which information he or she can access.
The company, it calls this concept "increasing personal energy through data."
According to CEO John Bruce, the basic idea of the establishment of the Inrupt company was to bring together all the resources, processes and appropriate resources that would help solid to make use of everyone.
The company is currently responsible for a security platform purchased by Berners-Lee, Bruce, IBM, and some of the developers working on the project as a contract.
This week, technology developers from all over the world can develop applications that are not central to my use on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he or his team had not met "on a change to make and implement all patterns of work with Facebook and Google one night."
Lee, "We don't want to let them go," he used his expression.
Berners-Lee explained in a letter published in the Media on Wednesday: "To provide commercial energy and ecosystem for the whole and quality of the new web system built on solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee changed the Internet from source by using the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).
In the last few months, Berners-Lee has become one of the names most important to the network's inconsistencies.
Berners-Lee will continue to be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
Berners-Lee used their expressions "I'm very good at this new time of the web,"
Bernard Vann: 1. In World War I, Victoria Hači was recognized as a champion
During World War I, the only English church hero who won the right to take Victoria Hači as a magician was known in his country 100 years later.
Judge Rahip Bernard Vann won this mark on 29 July 1918 in the history of Bellenglish and Lehacourt.
But four days later, Van, who was killed by a mean killer, never learned that Britain was honored by the highest military force.
On Saturday, Rushden opened Vann's two towers on the way to Northamptonshire.
Vann's tower, Michael Vann, pointed out that the opening was "a great symbol" just 100 years after the honor of his grandfather's military marriage.
According to a report in London Magazine, on 29 July 1918, Colonel Vann made it possible for the team to cross the Sant-Quent Canal of the St.
Then he ran straight to the fireline, pulled his "great disappointment" line, and walked up to the top of a series of dawns and threw three men out of the conflict.
A month after the war ended, Dr. Vann was killed by a German prisoner on 4 October 1918.
At 72 years of age, Michael Vann was in the middle of an "extraordinary act that I know I'm never going to reach" about what his grandfather did.
Michael and his brother, Dr. James Vann, left a scar after the transition to the imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said "it's a great honor to take the place around the corner," and he said "a real hero's courage is demonstrated by the support given by many people."
The MMA fans who were awake all night to watch Bellator 206 met Peppa Pig instead.
Think you've been standing all night to watch Bellator 206 and you haven't been given a chance to watch the actual activity.
There were 13 wars on the list in San Jose, the sixth of which was on Main Card, and the United Kingdom was released alive on Channel 5 all night.
Watchers in the United Kingdom were shocked when the Ghegard Museum and Rory MacDonald started to meet at 06:00 when the public was filming Peppa Pig.
Some observers who didn't sleep until the morning for the war were not pleased with the situation.
One of the MMA's fans identified it as "a bad joke" on Twitter.
Bellator, co-chair of the Department of Trade and Communication, Dave Schwartz, said, "There was a need for the channel line film to be transferred because it was not in line with the rules of the government in the morning of 06:00," he said.
Schwartz said, "Yes, 'Peppa the Pig' has been published."
Bellator, president of the company Scott Cooker, said that future releases will work on time schedules so that the United Kingdom's fans can watch the future.
Cooker said in his statement about the change in the volume, "I think we can fix the large volume probably again."
"But now it's Friday and Saturday morning in England, and we can't solve this problem until the day of the market, according to our time, and according to England, until the day of the market.
But we're working on it.
We got a lot of messages through the motion picture, and some of them weren't very friendly.
We were trying to solve the problem because we thought it was a technical mistake.
But it's not a technical error. It's a state of emergency.
I promise you this won't happen again next time.
We're going to put five wars in place, as we normally did, and we're going to deal with this problem when we're working to make MMA's fans feel better.
"A state of mind."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley explained that he felt like "a second-class person" because of sexual orientation
Olympic player Tom Daley explained that because of sexual orientation, he felt like a second-class person, but this feeling gave him reason to succeed.
He said he didn't realize that everyone wasn't like himself until he started with a 24-year-old sports club.
Daley, who was first served by Lauren Laverne on the Radio 4 Desert Island Discs, said that the purpose of talking about sexual rights was to give others "a hope."
And after being a father, he added that he was less concerned about winning the Olympics.
The original servant of the long-distance radio program had been granted permission for several months because of Kirsty Young's disease.
In this program, Laverne's first talk was that when she was growing up, she saw herself "down" because "no man, man, and girls were not accepted in public," she said.
He made these statements about Daley: "To this day, these feelings of inadequacy and a sense of being different from everyone have given me the strength and resilience I need to succeed."
In the past, sportsmen have shown that they want to prove that they're "normal" and that's why they think people won't be disappointed when they learn their sexual orientation.
A sportsman with two bronze Olympic medals became a well-known LGBT champion and was invited to release more and more of the country's sexuality from crime in the Commonwealth Games, which took place in Australia this year.
Daley said he felt lucky that he didn't face any legal problem because he explained his sexuality, so he wanted to give others a "hope" and he spoke out loud about it.
Three times a world champion sportsman told a "unexpected" guy, US filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, who met in 2013.
Daley married 20-year-old Oscar from the year we were married, but the sportsman, who said he never had a problem with the age difference.
When the Olympics were first engaged at the age of 14, and three years after their father lost his cancer, Dale said it was difficult to find a year old who lived in a life like this when he was so old.
Two days ago, Robert Ray Black-Daley had the joy of having a son named Robert.
The sport made statements about being an adult: "If you had asked about this last year, I'd only have gotten a gold medal."
But there are more valuable things than gold medals won in the Olympics.
For me, the Olympic gold medal became Robbie."
Daley's son, who contracted brain cancer and lost his life in 2011, gave his father Robert his name.
According to Daley, his father didn't agree to die and one of the last things he asked was that they didn't get tickets for London 2012 Olympics because he wanted to watch the games from the start.
"I didn't say, 'Daddy, you won't live until you watch the games first," I said.
Daley said that his father was living at the time of his death: "When I stopped breathing, I didn't realize that he wouldn't be healed until he gave up his last breath and lost his life."
A year after his father died, the Olympics fought in 2012 and won the bronze medal.
When Daley told the Olympics, "I knew I had imagined it all my life: flying in front of my own country, it wouldn't feel better," he said.
That's what moved him to choose the first song.
Desert Island Discs, market days, according to the British Green Clock, are published on BBC Radio 4 at 11:15.
Microlson's comet from the Ryder Cup game on the day he fell from his form
American Phil Mickelson will break a record at Ryder Cup 47 on the market, but this record has to be recognizable so it's not a sad turning point.
In two years, Michaelson, who was recorded 12 times in an organized activity, was captured by Captain Jim Furyk by a four-year-old four-year-old foreball and four-year-old four-year-old.
The five-time major champion, Mikkelson, would usually be in the center of events in the U.S. team, but he's been in the field training for this Wednesday's team, whether he's on a show or he's on the field with the hope that he's going to get his performance down.
Even in the course of his career, it's not an ideal choice for the 48-year-old sportsman who has not had enough drivers to fight, for long-distance and long-distance attacks, which are not punished by the Le Golf National Park.
As if he wasn't strong enough on the other hand, Mickelson was going to fight the British Open Championship with Francesco Molinari on the ninth day of the market, and Molinari won four of the games he went out with Tommy Fleetwood this week without any experience.
The American team, which is four points in front of the 12th game on Sunday, will certainly win the game if it can start fast.
Furyk explained that he trusted his teammate, and it wasn't possible to tell him anything else.
The U.S. captain used these words for his team friend: "Mickelson, he fully understood his role today and told me that he'd be ready for tomorrow."
"He's very confident of himself.
Mickelson, a player who wrote his name to Hall of Fame, to the teams he played last week and this week to our team a lot of things.
I didn't have to play him in two games.
I thought he was gonna play more games, but he had to be like this, and we decided we should keep playing.
Of course, Mikkelson wants to be on the field like everyone else."
Mickelson will break Nick Faldo's most playable player record on the day of the market.
This game for Mikkelson can mean the end of Ryder Cup's career, which he never achieved in his environmental records.
According to Furyk, he won a ban on his presence; he won 18 games; he lost 20 games; he lost seven games.
The team captain said to Mickelson: "There's a funny, funny and smart person who likes to get people on the way to a joke, a really great friend to spend time in the team room."
I think the young players were happy that this week they had the chance to fight with him, and it was fun to watch these fights.
He's doing more than playing."
Captain Thomas Bjorn of the European Union knows that the great difference will soon be over.
Captain Thomas Bjorn of the European team has seen a major difference in the recent day of Ryder Cup's race in a way that could easily turn into an uncomfortable relationship.
The Danish player, who went out to the first game in Valderama in 1997, was a team in the capital of Love Ballesteros, five points ahead of the Americans, but at the end of the game they won only a very small number of brains like 1411⁄2-131.2.
After watching a big difference between Le Golf National and Le Golf National on Friday and Friday, 2018, and Le Golf National on 10-6, Bjorn made the statement: "I always remember this: we had a big difference in Valderama, we had a big difference in Brooklyn, but we lost in Brooklyn, and we had a very small difference in Valderama."
History reminds me and the rap team that nothing's done yet.
We'll play full performance tomorrow.
We'll go out and do everything we need to do.
It means nothing's done until you write on the scoreboard.
We've got a goal, we're trying to get this bitch, and that's what our whole room needs to be.
I've been saying the same thing since the beginning.
Bjorn, who was pleased with the performance of his players in the violent golf course, continued: "I'm never sure about this game myself.
It's a very different day tomorrow.
Tomorrow's performances will come forward and we'll change what we need to do.
It's a great feeling to play with your partner if everything's going well, but when you go out on your own, you're being tested as a golfer.
The message we have to move to the players is this: Put the best thing that comes from your hand tomorrow.
Now you have to leave the partner, and the partner needs to go out and show him the best performance."
The chief of the rap team, Jim Furyk, is expecting Bjorn to show a better performance than their partner games as a single player.
Furyk, who was present at the recent turn of the team's team's team's match, was on the winning side of the European team's "Miceze in Medinah" on the side of the track in Brooklyn.
In 1999, Captain Ben Crenshaw used the expression "I remember what he said," which explained how he motivated his players on the last day of his life.
The captain of the American team went on to explain: "We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you have to start playing fast like Brooklyn or Medina.
Now that the moment has passed by you, it's a big task for middle-game players.
We have made our order and have raised in the midst of the players whom we believe to be superior to them; you know We are about to create a sign for them tomorrow."
Thomas has taken the lead against the attack and will face Rory McIrroy in the first match. The other players on the European team's first round list are Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter.
Bjorn said about the players he chose for the most popular games, "I've chosen the players I've chosen to play with this series because I think it's suitable for all games from the beginning to the end," he said.
History of entry into service of the new warship of Germany once more
Germany's new fleet will take place in the period of the Cold War, starting in 2014, but it will not be available until the coming year, according to local media reports.
According to the information provided by a military source to the newspaper Die Zeit, the new Baden-Württemberg-class american ship "Rheinland-Pfalz" has now reached its first half of 2019.
The ship had to join the German Navy in 2014, but after the transfer, it did not leave the original project's original project behind a variety of problems.
The four Baden-Württemberg class, which the German Sea Force set up in 2007, will take place in the former Bremen class.
It was suggested that ships should have a series of powerful teams, a series of aircraft and shipers, along with their low-frequency radar, heat and acoustic signatures.
Among the other important features of the ship is the longer the gap between the port and the new franchises is expected to be able to carry out a task for up to two years from the port of closure.
But according to Die Zeit, Germany's last model of warships will be too early to date that they entered the service.
The F125 francaate that was not rescued from indiscriminateness was transferred to the ports by officially refusing to take the ship of the German Navy in service last year and returning to the Blohm & Voss version of Hamburg.
The Sea Force, for the first time, brought the ship's delivered together with this incident to the ship manufacturer.
There was no detailed information on the reasons for the voyage, but according to news reports in the German media, there was a series of "software and hardware errors" that would cause the ship to fail in its mission.
The Baden-Württemberg class is particularly important for software errors to be used by 120 persons working on the former Bremen class forkouts.
In addition, the ship's very heavy and its performance decreased and its crew were forced to change on board.
The Rheinland-Pfalz, a 7000-tonn weight weight weight weight, was found to be twice the weight of ships that were used by Germany in World War II.
With my short-term skills, the property of all the project that took up staff training began to become a problem.
The project's cost is estimated to be EUR 3.1 billion (US$ 3.6 billion) from its initial cost of EUR 2.2 billion.
In addition to warnings about Germany's weakening of sea power, the problems that arise in new coastal areas are also important.
In the beginning of this year, the German Parliament's Defence Committee, Mr Hans-Peter Bartels, adopted "the reduction of Indian-owned vessels" to the German Maritime Forces.
The Defence Committee stated that although the former ships were being taken from service, the problem was that new ships were growing in time.
The president, the Baden-Württemberg class, regretted that none of the fraternals were eligible to join the Navy.
National Trust is a mission to listen to the hidden lives of the creatures
A new study is being carried out in an area in the Highlands region of Scotland, in order to understand how it has benefited from it during the harvest.
It is hoped that the findings obtained in the investigation will shed light on the behaviour of the only flying crew and guide their future protection efforts.
While Iceland's National Trust for Scotland's scientific work is being carried out by people working at the National Trust for Scotland, it will be followed by the long-distance coffee plant in Inverwe Gardens in Western Russia and the Daubington plant.
Special recording devices will be installed at the important points of the gap to track the creation activities of the creatures throughout the space.
The NHS personnel and volunteers will also perform their mobile work using the detectors they're holding.
After all the records have been analysed by the experts, the frequency of the noise generated will be determined by what type of sound it has done.
Later, a residence map and report will be prepared to create a detailed picture of the behaviour of the creatures in the middle.
The NTS's speech on natural protection, Rob Dewar, hopes that the consequences will be more important for the areas where the habitat is located and how these are used by each species.
This information will help to determine how best to protect forest areas for the most important types of habitat management, such as grassland development.
In the past century, there has been a significant decline in the generation of Scotland and the United Kingdom.
Under threat of damage, damage to buildings and damage to buildings.
There are other risk factors such as windscreens, lighting tools, tunnels, chemical processes used in some structural equipment and domestic fireplaces.
The wounded aren't really blind.
But their ears are more useful than their eyes for catching horses because of their nightly custom.
They're using an improved co-location technique to detect bugs and obstacles on their flight routes.
In the country, 270 historical buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares are important to NTS facilities.
At the end of the year, regular research, tuition and sometimes rescue operations are carried out by ten educators.
For example, during Dumfries and Galloway, who owned eight of the ten different types of creatures, Iceland created its first and only unique combination of the species.
The director of the facility, David Thompson, said that it was an ideal area for the creation of the facility.
Thompson said, "We've got a great area for those who've been created in Threave,"
Director Thompson said regarding the matter: "Our old buildings, we have a lot of old trees and a good life.
But we still don't know much about creations, so the work we do here and elsewhere will help us understand what the creatures need in order to develop what they need."
Thompson draws the bottom line of the need to control whether or not the building has been created before it starts, and the destruction of one mother's lungs by mistake can lead to the death of nearly 400 female and female children as a result of the loss of the entire population.
They are the animals that are under protection; it is the law to kill them, to disturb them, or to harm them, or to destroy them.
Elizabeth Ferrell, the Iscotic Officer of the Bat Conservation Trust, invited people to join the project.
Ferrell, in his explanation, said to them, "There are still so many things we need to learn about creations, and we don't know what the situation is of the many kinds of populations in our area."
Lawyers from Ronaldo are ready to appeal to German history
Christian Ronaldo has been called a "false message" and has continued that people use the name Ronaldo to "make their own confessions."
Ronaldo's lawyers are ready to testify to the story of German Der Spiegel, who publishes their ideas.
The Portuguese international team and Juventus' forvet player Ronaldo were alleged to have interviewed an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
On Friday, according to a news report in Der Spiegel, Ronaldo paid 375 000 dollars to the woman to stop talking about the incident later.
After hours in the media, Idiots said that they were "false news" at the age of 142 million who spoke to their 142 million followers on their live Web site.
The gold Top was paid five times to the football camera, "No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
This day it is that which they say is a lie.
"They want to make their own ads using my name.
It's normal.
They're going to be famous using my name, but this is part of it.
I'm a happy man, I don't have a question," he added with a smile.
According to Reuters, Ronaldo's lawyers are prepared to appeal to Der Spiegel on the ideas that they consider "the suspect in the restricted area to be unacceptable".
Lawyer Christian Schertz said he would require a diagnosis for "probably one of the most serious human rights incidents in those years" that have led to the magnitude of this phenomenon.
The incident is reported to have taken place in a room at Palms Casino Resort in Las Vegas in 2009.
According to documents from Clark County District Court in Nevada, Ronaldo and Mayorga went to the football room one night after they met at the club, and it is suggested that Ronaldo had moved to Majorga.
Majorga says that after the incident, Ronaldo broke down and told himself that he was "good man" there in '99" and that he was deceived by "one hundred."
The documents indicate that Ronaldo has proven that both are sexually involved, but that's both sides of it.
It protects Majorga from being taken by the police and photographed by the hospital's injuries but "fear of being arrested" and then from being afraid of "a small drop in front of the crowd" and then from being taken out of court.
Mayorga, aged 34, says that she is looking for ways to escape because of the trauma she is still affected by the incident.
Ronaldo was on his way from Manchester United to Real Madrid during the time of the attack, and this letter was transferred to the Italian devi Juventus 100 million euros.
Brexit: "There'll always be regret that England lost its car manufacturers"
Mr. Greg Clark said that if England lost its world leadership in its car production after Brexit, "it'll always be sad."
Toyota England added that in the case of Britain's withdrawal from the EU without an agreement from the EU to the BBC, it was also "an anxiety" that he said that he would call them as a producer in the Burnaston factory near Derby.
Clark said, "We need to make a deal."
In the state of Brexit, the Japanese Automotive Company has failed to agree on why it would be possible for people to lose their jobs during the border waiting period.
By Toyota Auris and Aventis production, the Burnaston industry produced 150,000 vehicles that were leased to the rest of the European Union last year.
Marvin Cooke, manager of the Burnaston factory in Toyota, said, "If my meeting is withdrawn from the EU by the end of March, I will continue my production at our factory,"
Onda, car manufacturers such as BMW and Jaguar Land Rover were also alarmed about leaving the EU without agreeing on how to operate the border trade.
For example, BMW said that Brexit would close the Mini component in Oxford in a month.
Real concerns are based on what car manufacturers rely on as a risk to the prison without Brexit's agreement.
Toyota's production line is working with the "time" prince every 37 minutes with parts of the UK and EU players.
If England is withdrawn without an EU agreement on 29 March, wealth can become an economical asset, which, according to the industry, can lead to loss of wealth, time, and parts.
The company told Toyota that it was impossible to hold more than a day in Derbyshire than it was, so it was going to stop my production.
Clark said that theresa May's future relations with the EU revealed that the Chequers plan "has been set in the right way to move forward this border controller."
In BBC Radio 4, "We need to make an agreement, as I say, not only an agreement that will bring us success now, but we want to make the best deal that will give us this opportunity," he said.
"The evidence from other producers not only from Toyota but also from Toyota is that we must certainly continue our last successful treatment chain."
He didn't know how long my production of Toyota would last, but he warned me that it would reduce the amount of additional fees in the longer term and leave people unemployed.
Peter Tsouvalaris, who has worked for 24 years in Bunaston and his partner in the United States, said that his members are still concerned: "In my experience, these things will not come back until we get out of the middle.
A government spokesman told them, "We need to set up a clean and reliable plan for our future relations with the Lord."
White Saray: Trump's meeting with Rosenstein can be resumed
The White Saray Market Day said the High Court had been arguing about Brett Kavanaugh's High Court Island, and Donald Trump said that the major meeting with Justice Assistant Rod Rosenstein would "be possible for a week more."
Rosenstein is managing the work of special competent prosecutor Robert Mueller, who investigates the links between Russia and the help of Trump, and the possibility of preventing the justice of another.
It was a matter of months in Washington that Trump said he wouldn't be able to get away from his assistant who had threatened Mueller's independence.
At the beginning of this month, New York Times wrote that Rosenstein had opened up a hearing device to record his talks with Trump and that he had discussed the matter with the 25th amendment.
Rosensstein's report was lying.
But she went to White Saray among the ideas that we were about to use the past market.
Instead, it was announced that the series would be held on Friday with Trump in the United Nations in New York.
Trump said he "chosenstein chose" but after his meeting he was arrested by Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, one of the two women who accused him of sexual immorality with Kavanaugh and followed his statements.
On Friday, Trump told the FBI that his ideas about Kavanaugh had been re-examined by Senato for a week.
The press spokesman for Trump, Sarah Sanders, went to Fox News on the market.
When she asked herself, "There was no date for this, it could be a week, but if everything else in the Supreme Court was taken into account, she might be given another week.
But we'll see, and I'd always like to inform you about the progress," he replied.
Some reporters objected to this explanation: Sanders hasn't edited a press briefing in White Saray since 10th of July.
The program's server, Chris Wallace, asked why.
Sanders Griffingler said that the reason why the TV reporters aren't "playing on the clubs" was "but I can't deny what they're playing on the classes."
Sanders later indicated that it would be more accurate with Trump and the press.
"Tump, it's more questions-responsive than any other leader before it," he added, "before showing the source, we've searched the statistical data," he said.
Sanders said, "Bryings will continue, but if the press has a chance to direct their issues to the U.S., it would be better than talking to me.
We often try to do this, and in the last few weeks, you've seen how many times we've done it, and when you can really talk to the U.S. President, this will take place in the press briefing," he said.
When the Trump comes out of the White Saray, or when he attends public meetings with high-speed visitors or attends a press conference, he gives a correct answer to questions.
Solo press conferences don't usually take place.
The president spoke freely in front of the delegates gathered in New York this week, and in time, he may have shown why.
The Health Department wrote to those who worked in the US in Scotland in NHS about their concerns about Brexit
The National Health Service (NHS) sent a letter to those working in the EU to express their appreciation and to wish them to continue their work in the post-Brexit period.
The Estonian Parliamentary Member Jeane Freeman sent a letter within six months of the EU's withdrawal from England.
The Icelandic Government has already made a promise to extend the mandate of local authorities designated for EU citizens working in the surrounding public services.
In Freeman's letter, he wrote: "The law of withdrawal between England and the EU has been passed through the text of the talks and has opened the way for the final decisions to be taken.
But the lack of agreement from the Government of England also speeded up their preparations.
I realize this is a very difficult time for all of you.
So I wanted to bring back the value I valued for every member of our staff who worked in any country.
Our colleagues in the EU and outside reflect the valuable experience and well-being of the patients and communities we serve while strengthening their health service.
Your home is certainly your home, and we would like you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie was taken from his head to Acilenia
According to a news report by Mike Organ in Tennessee, Tennessee State Tigers defends player Christion Abercrombie was taken to an open operation on Wednesday, 31-27 Vanderbilt Commodes lost.
Tennessee State's chief coach, Rod Reed, said that it was only a short time before the attack on the passengers.
Reed said, "He gathered where he came from."
After giving Abercrombie oxygen to the health staff, the workers were taken to a detailed interview with the football team.
A resident of Tennessee State, Nashville, said from WSMV to Abercrombie, said that Chris Harris went out of his operation at Vanderbilt Tüp Centre.
Harris also added that "there's no evidence of the type/direction of the injury" and that Tennessee State's injury was trying to determine when it happened.
He moved from Abercrombie Illinois, in college in the second year of his life, and his second season in Tennessee State.
Before Saturday, before the day-to-day game, I had five rounds of football in my collection, which I played five times, and the number of rounds in the season was up to 18.
A higher tax will be paid to foreigners living in England.
A higher tax will be paid to foreigners living in England, and this vast new Tory plan will be used for homeless people.
With this brain, Corbyn's young election will be ineffective in its attempt to attract young voters.
It'll be taxed by those who don't pay taxes in England.
The Financial Watch estimates that 120 million Sterlin will be collected annually to help homeless people.
Theresa May will explain today that it will be taxed more than once by foreign buyers in England.
In addition, Jeremy Corbyn is considered to be an out-of-court input for a more cost-effective house supply effort to target high-income buyers.
The tax rate will be provided by people and companies who do not pay taxes in England, and this additional fee will provide the Government with a strong commitment to the fight against homelessness.
Two years ago, the second house and foreign tenants could also receive three percent of the tax added to the existing tax.
The Financial Watch estimates that this income will bring up to 120 million Sterlin a year.
It is estimated that 13 percent of the new generation of farmers in London is taken by people outside England, and this makes it difficult for them to take up their prices for the first time.
Because of the vast majority of the time spent abroad abroad, many of the country's rich regions, especially the capitals, have become "exploited cities".
A few weeks after the new policy, Boris Johnson called for a tax release to get more young people's homes.
Johnson accused large construction companies of raising their rental prices early in the morning and then not using them here, and invited May to remove cars from the environment in England.
Corbyn also heard a series of interesting case reform proposals aimed at completing contracts that were also acquired and not "responsible" and "responsible".
He wants new houses to be given more resources to the councils to build.
May said, "I told my president last year that I would help relive the dream of English, that is, to make life better for all generations to come.
That's what we need to fix our broken deal market.
Britain will always be open to people living here, working and living.
However, it is not true that people living in England and foreign-based companies can easily get home as much as their English citizens work here.
It's a very powerful dream for a lot of people to have a house, but it's a little thing like homelessness.
Jack Ross: "The biggest goal is to make the director of Iskochia."
Sunderland Technical Director Jack Ross said at a point "the greatest goal" to make Iceland's technical director.
The 42-year-old ice-cream director, League One, is pleased to see the third round of the team of North Hemisphere in a three-point race in the League.
After we took St. Mirren to the Scottish Premiership last season, this letter went to the Light Stadium.
Ross, to the BBC Iskocher Sportssound, "I wanted to play football in my country.
I got a white hat so much," she said.
"But when I was a child, I grew up with my father, watching Iskochia in the big Hampden, which has always attracted me to myself.
But this opportunity only comes to me if I succeed in technical directorship."
There are Dick Advocacy, David Moyes, Sam Allardice, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Previously on Barnsley and Ipswich Town's former technical director, Alloa Athletic, said that he was never afraid of working after names from such a large club.
"The success for me now is measured by the answer to the question 'Can I return this club to the Premier League?'.
If you look at the structure of the club and what's going on, this club belongs to the Premier League," he said.
"It's not easy to get there, but the only way I can count myself here is to get the only way out of the club."
Ross, who took a 15-month course in the training course of Hearts, was an assistant coach in Dumbarton in the third year of his technical directorial career.
Ross also saved Allaa from falling and placed the third line on the ladder and returned St. Mirren from the foot of the enemy and won the next season's championship.
Ross says he's more comfortable than he's playing at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
He said, "It was probably a real turning point."
"If you play football, I really believe that the technical director is the right choice for me.
I'm playing good, I'm winning college games, and I can't believe it's my good times.
But it can be hard to play.
There's a lot of lives you need to spend every week.
I'm still living the same things because of stress and pressure, but the technical director feels very good about me.
I've always wanted to be a technical director, and I'm doing this right now and I've been the most comfortable person in my life.

The investigation revealed that the best time for the beer was 17:30.
The burning heat increased the pressure on prison restaurants while increasing the presence of British heavy loads.
According to statistics, the sales of pub and bar groups decreased by 4.8 percent when they increased by 2.7 percent in Tammuz.
Peter Martin, who collected the digital data and spoke about CGA's assets, said: "The long-term acceptance of the Sunlight and England's expectations at the World Cup meant that the Pubs of Tammuz made progress in a similar way to the month in which the restaurants took a deep job.
There's one hundred restaurants in attendance, one hundred and eight, and there's something worse in Tammuz.
The heavy pubs and bars showed the best performance by winning more than the fact that restaurants were lost than they were.
In addition, heavy - eating pubs suffered from fevers, even though they were not as serious as restaurant operators.
People look like they're just going out to get something to drink.
This month's food sales in the pubs and bars increased by 6.6 percent, while three percent of the sales of alcohol fell by this month's food."
RSM entertainment and accommodation analyst Paul Newman said in words: "These consequences are still disturbing my mind that we have seen since the end of Nisan.
The impact of air status and important social or sports activities continues to be the largest on domestic sales outside the home market.
It's not surprising that the restaurant groups continue to find it more difficult to keep up with the pressure of 4.8 percent of the prices in the last year.
A long and hot letter has been found at the worst possible time for heavy food operations, but what we saw in August will show us that there will be no need to provide any relief from the colder air we see in August."
The total sales of pubs and restaurants, including new openers, were 2.7 percent in Tammuz, and this is also due to slowdown in brand outputs.

There's a social media account that's been kept secret from a family of five.
A study found that every five children from 11 years of age and undertook to hide from their families and teachers were social media accounts.
The research among 20,000 average students has resulted in an increase in the number of "insta".
This development has raised concerns about sexual intimacies being committed
He said that hundreds of students had an "ana" account to show their parents.
One of every 11-year-olds opens social media accounts from their adults.
The research among 20,000 middle-level students, Instagram, a photo-sharing site, led to an increase in the number of eyes in their accounts.
This development increased their concern about sexual intimacies.
He told the students to show half their parents that they're the ones who're doing the clean "mother" accounts.
A 13-year-old mother found her daughter's secret account, a young man who forced her to "examine" herself.
A study conducted by the Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters' and HeadMistresses' Conference (HMC) in independent schools revealed that 40 percent of students aged 11 to 18 who changed their age were two percent.
HMC President Mike Buchanan said, "It's so disturbing that so many young families and teachers tend to create Internet areas that they won't find," he said.
The second Doyle Scotch Athletics administration will have "a sound of athletes"
Eilaid Doyle was elected independent of the administration of the population at the Scottish Athletics annual general meeting.
Doyle, Scotland's most generous athlete and President Ian Beattie considered this development to be a great opportunity to benefit from the international ten-year experience of the athletes.
Beattie said, "Eilid has great respect for Iskochia, Great Britain and the world's athletic team.
Doyle said, "I'm ready to be the sound of the athletes and I hope I'll be able to find and guide on ice sports."
In 1996 it became impossible for an American, who won 200 metres and 400 meters of competition in the Olympics in Atlanta, to have won four gold medals in my collection and now to be a scientist at BBC.

Mothers are like moms who split their brain pumps online into two
He shared the Internet with two ads published by his brain pump company, similar to those of nursing mothers.
Elvie, a pharmaceutical technology firm, published an espresso-advertising announcement that the world's "first voiceless gas pump" is "the world's first-class silent pump," to show the freedom of the new pumping mothers.
Four real moms dances with a song like the one below, "Yes, I'm making my own milk but I don't have a kiss" and "If you didn't do it Fark, it's not me. It's me."
And the wine's nose says, "Pompala, pumppala, baby fat, pumppala, pumppala, fat."
However, the company's Facebook page opened the way for ad contests.
He received conflicting reactions from 77,000 video monitors who were monitored and hundreds of contented, and many people said that the video was placed before the eyes of the fat industry.
One observer said, "It's a very bad decision to use eggs on this sample.
And they have to bear children as We have made them grow, but they are taken by their own hands after a few days."
Elvie's brain pump is sitting right in the lead tube. (Elvie/Mother)
And another wrote: "My mother and my uncle are in a state of disreputable.
But why don't babies be used in a brain pump commercial for mothers who don't get it from their hands?
And another wrote, "It's a lot of advertising in the world."
And some of them defended the commercial, and a woman said she found a "very funny" song.
One said, "I think it's a very creative idea.
If I were still dreaming, I'd get this pump.
I really felt like a doll pumping.
A little flying commercial, but I got a message.
It's a very clever product," he wrote.
And the other person says, "It's a commercial for mothers who feel like they're in their place of work or when they're pumping milk in toilets."
It's not a commercial or a commercial."
At the end of the video, it shows all women dancing with a brain pump.
The concept behind the campaign is that many women who pump milk are actually feeling like eggs.
But Elvie Pompa doesn't have a full voice, no cable, no pipes, and no guinea pigs, so when she does, she can't move women when she's pumping milk, she can't even get out.
"Elvie Pompa was so young that she deserved a bold and exciting recognition.
We wanted to bring out the milk pumps and all the difficulties of this operation in a pleasant and understandable way, by establishing a similarity between the mothers and healthy chicks, showing the wonderful sense of freedom that the new pump will provide.
Elvie Pompa isn't my first day.
On London Fashion Week, a two-year-old mother came out for a podium for designer Marta Jakubowski using her sample.
Hundreds of children moved to a blackout camp in Texas, U.S.A.
Despite the changes in the monthly ceilings, the number of children who have fled from politics has increased rapidly in terms of talking about forced child migration to sponsors.
People who, in the days of sponsors, are generally afraid to risk their own lives and their own lives in the country.
This risk increased during the month when the federal authorities heard that potential sponsors and adults at home had to follow their fingerprints and that the data would be shared with the foreign authorities.
Matthew Albence, a member of the High Commissioner for Migration and Youth, expressed his concern that he was arresting a person by means of procedures for sponsoring children who were not members of the organization against the Congress.
Then he confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested were missing.
Albence says, "About 80 percent of people who are sponsors or family sponsors are outlawed in this country, and most of them are foreign criminals.
That's why we won't leave these people behind."
The security staff laid down new rules that some of them had to go to court within 60 days of their arrest to see the children's case more quickly.
Most of them will defend their legal status in cases where they meet in a conference instead of going to court.
Those who don't fit to be released will soon be outside the border.
According to those who work for security and who are out of the system in recent months, the more children are under surveillance, the more anxiety and depression the more likely they are to live, the more likely they are to get into trouble or escape.
Lawyers said these concerns increased a greater degree of pressure like Tornillo, which is likely to increase the likelihood of the child's being given more attention.
They also indicated that sending children to a camp without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally or rehabilitate their friends and that many may be able to touch the traumas that they are already suffering.
Syria told the US, France and Turkey that the "survival forces" were immediately withdrawn.
Foreign Minister Velid El Muallim, who spoke to the BM General Assembly, called for the return of Syrian officials, even though he was in the eighth year of the war in the country.
At the same time, the Vice-President said that the foreign forces had been found illegal in the Syrian territories in the fight against terrorism and that "what they need is going to be done."
He said, "They must be pulled out immediately."
The teacher said that since 2011, more than 360,000 people have died and millions have been homeless in Syria.
Sham said, "This sacred struggle will take place until all the villages in Syria and terrorist groups and all the illegal foreign property are cleansed."
The U.S. has a close military union with the Kurts and the Syrian Arabs in Syria, and it has been reported to be 2000.
But France has more than 1,000 war powers in the country.
The teacher said he was willing to let the conditions go back, and he accused "some Western countries" of spreading unwarranted fears that could lead them to stay away from the country.
He said, "We have been calling for international campaigns and human assistance to ensure good return,"
"They're politicalizing what's supposed to be a human matter."
The United States of America and the European Union warned that there would not be aid in Syria until a political agreement had been reached between the US and Esad.
The BM diplomats said that they had created an opportunity to conduct political talks on the way to create a buffer zone for Idlib, Russia and Turkey, the last major rebel caliph.
The Russian-Turkey agreement has led to a major rapid attack by the Russian Syrian forces in the area where three million people live.
But the teacher pointed out that the agreement was "the last of the past history" and said that the soldiers in the Al-Qaide-related Nusra Cephes also hoped that the fighters would "get rid of the middle" of the military campaign.
BM representative Staffan de Mistura wants to organize the first meetings of a new organization from government and conference members on the design of post-war motherhood for Syria and opening the way for elections.
The teacher set up conditions for the participation of the Syrian government and warned the prosecutors that the panel should be restricted by "inspecting the material of the existing mother."
Trump Why He Won His Second Choice
According to this definition, Trump will win a new election in 2020 if he does not allow the use of the task as the liberal observers may expect and if he does not allow the scandal to end early.
This will certainly be the most dramatic end of all times for greed.
There's no sign of weakness in the viewers at the moment.

It is not surprising that the two responsibilities in the Congress are due to a long-term fall in competition for the same position in the 17th district of Pennsylvania.
The newly-adjusted Pittsburgh branch area is fighting the Democratic People's Conor Lamb, who participated in the past election in another region.
On another island, the Lamb is currently fighting against Communityan Keith Rothfus, who represents 12 regions that are largely covered by the new 17th of Pennsylvania.
In October, the High Court redesigned the maps because of the government that ruled that the former regions were in line with the interests of the Community as opposed to their motherhood.
In the new 17th region, the main funding arm of the country's national party was launched by the Democratic Campaign Congress Committee (DCCC) to finance an election campaign between the National Republical Campaign Committee (NCRC).
Lamb became a well-known name for the special election held in March for the 18th region of Pennsylvania and followed by many people.
There has been a Communityman for over ten years and President Trump won 20 points.
Politicians have bitten Democrats.
He then Canceled El Salvador's Punishment of Support to the United States of America
The diplomats indicated that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already met Pekin, and that they had a bit of an attitude from Washington.
Trump, Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela, held a similar meeting in Haziran in 2017 and held a hotel in Panama until the members of the Trump Organization took office.
At the beginning of this month's speech by Foreign Minister Heather Nauert, he said that he decided to call back from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama on the basis of "the decision of the new Taiwanese authorities to recognize the new one."
But my actions were only intended to apply to El Salvador, which received $140 million from the United States in 2017 for drug control, development and economic support.
It would be devastating for the countries of Central America and high unemployment and crime to get their financial assistance and visa restrictions.
As the summits continued, North American and Central American officials held a high-level conference on security and economic recovery, which was held at the end of a similar annual meeting and which was seen as an improvement in the efforts to prevent migrants from moving to the United States.
But in the middle of the year, top-level managers said they wanted the conference to move forward, and they didn't leave any infrastructure for El Salvador.
The diplomats said that as an important indicator of my management's meeting, Vice-President Mike Pence had planned to speak at a conference held in the middle of the board.
He returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic because he did not bring serious messages or actions from three representatives of the United States from Washington.
For Bolton, the White Saray Dictionary refused to comment on the details of the dispute identified by three American authorities who were both diplomats and admitted to do so in secret.
The statements of these authorities were supported by an analyst outside Saray, who was close to the administration and spoke to the secret police.
Learn History
Another pending progress may have been the report on the possibility of preventing the legal evidence found in the archives of Trump by special competent prosecutor Robert Mueller.
Mueller's investigation was informed that Trump's election campaign was not linked to Russia's attack on our elections.
If the Congress is to change its hands, Trump will once again appear before the voters, even as he has to count himself in this community when he is prepared to appear on a jury from his colleagues.
There are a lot of possibilities, and I'm not suggesting that the fall of thinkers in Trump or in Europe is inevitable.
To determine how long the debate will take place, there are options for all of us in two Atlantic ports.
In 1938, when the West opposed Hitler and supported Czechoslovakia in Munich, German troops were ready to take action.
We failed, and we didn't stop the existence of the whales for years.
The history of such turning points is shaped around and accelerated or slowed down by the unstoppable progress of democracy.
The Americans are living together from this point of view.
What if Mr. Trump, Mr. Mueller's question was taken from the Chief Agent Rod Rosenstein?
Since the year that we've been in the middle of the document that we've been saying that he's proposed to record his encounters in secret and that the other's not appropriate for the team, Rosenstein has faced serious problems.
Mr. Rosenstein, the Times claims that the statements are not true.
"How will we deal with the Supreme Court in the short term if Brett Kavanaugh's investigation of the FBI is not conducted and is not conducted correctly or sexually assaults and false testimony are serious?
Will we vote for a Meclis who will take charge of Mr. Trump in the elections?
If we don't give these tests, democracy will take a hard time.
But I don't believe we're gonna fail because I got a lesson from Prague.
My mother was a Czech-Slovakia Jew once sent by the Nazi regime to Auschwitz, where I once lived.
He left there right, moved to America, and sent me over 60 years ago to burn my sabotage on that table.

hope for Graham Dorrans after the Rapid Vienna attack on Rangers
After their interaction with Villarreal in Spain this month, Rangers will take on Rapid Vienna on this spring stage and will obtain a powerful advantage to raise an overrun from the European Union Group.
The middle stage player Graham Dorrans could not take place on the stage for a longer period of two to two and a half years, which was done with Villarreal. But according to the player, it can be used as a platform for larger tasks for this team.
A 31-year-old player said, "It's a good point for us because Villarreal is a good team,"
"We went to the game, believing that we could achieve a good outcome, and we split up with one point.
Maybe we could have a better outcome, but cooperation was probably a fairer outcome.
The first half was probably better than us, but the second half we went ahead and played better.
It's getting closer on Friday and it's gonna be a big European night.
We hope we'll get three more points, but it'll be a tough game because they've got a good outcome from their last games, but I'm sure we can force them and get a good outcome when the viewer is behind us.
The years we spent together with the changes in my habits and the club, it was really hard, but I think our current location is very good.
Our team is good and everyone is really surprised; coaches are good.
I hope we'll continue this and we'll leave the final season and we'll succeed."
Women are out of bed with fear of menopause.
Although the participants in the survey had clear ideas on how they wanted to be treated, very few were talking to their families about it.
The investigation carried out by Nationwide revealed that half of the units in the investigation camp had been talking to their wives for a long time.
She just said 10 percent to her kids talking about it.
Holly Snyder, the head of the company's life insurance company, said, "People want to take care of one family, but they don't take any steps to talk about it," he said.
That's how you start it.
Talk to your wife and your children: If you don't tell them what you want, they will not be able to prepare for you and your family in the future.
Talk to your family about where and how you want to take care of it, because these choices may be an important factor in determining your responsibilities.
Talk to your financial speaker: Your speaker may also offer you a solution to deal with these tasks.
A long-term security police can take place between you and your long-term pay options to secure your own service while you are a karma-valued life insurance policy that will help you deal with expenses.

It is estimated that in 2017 there will be up to 299,200 people living in an administrative area located under one state.
The state of Central Sulawesi creates the main sources of passage for the fisheries and fisheries, especially the economy of the Doghara region.
It's also important for the village's nickel mining, but it's in a situation similar to that in Morowilica, which is on the side of the Sulawisi.
In the past 100 years, according to the Indonesian Anti-Fraud Agency, there have been several cases of tuberculosis in Palu and Doghía.
In 1938 a tsunami destroyed hundreds of homes while killing more than 200 people in Doha.
In 1996, another tsunami killed nine people in Doha.

Federal prosecutors want to punish an individual who has applied for the NNC terrorist attack
Federal prosecutors in New York City want to punish the suspect of an terrorist attack by eight people in New York City who has led to the death of Saifullo Saipov. This sentence has not been applied to any federal crime in the city since 1953.
According to the Idalars, 30-year-old Saipov bought a truck from Home Depot in order to launch an attack on a bicycle on the North Korean coast of North Manhattan in October and destroyed the bikes.
They need to prove that Saipov killed eight victims "knowing" and "know" people with a serious physical injury, according to the evidence of his intention to punish them, which he reported in the South New York Region and that he wanted to punish them.
According to the court's documents, these two crimes are likely to bring a person's sentence together.
In the weeks following the attack, a major federal jury in Saipov was involved in a violent crime, a car accident, and an 8-year-old murder, which was intended to be committed by the police, and was generally used by federal prosecutors in cases of organized crime.
The prosecutors who said they should "plan ahead" for the attack said that Saipov's action was "crazy, painless, immoral."
The report "Sayfulllo Habibullaevic Saipov has opened the way for injuries and injuries; Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pannucco have broken the law on family and friends," says the report.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been ten years since the last person's sentence on South New York.
H.K.I. Barnes was charged with killing two drug dealers, but as a result he was sentenced to prison in July 2009.
In a federal case in New York last year, Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were sentenced to death in 1953, and married two years before the Cold War, they were convicted of having sex with the Soviet Union and registered.
Rosenberg was registered on April 19, 1953, when he was seated in an electric chair.
According to the court's documents, Saipov did not show any regret during the days and months following the attacks on Pakistani Saipov.
According to the police statement, the interrogators felt good about what they did.
According to the idea, Saipov said he was inspired by an ISID video on his phone to make an attack on the authorities.
According to the police, he wanted to arrange an ISHID party in the hospital room.
22 material says he didn't accept the crimes in India.
David Patton, a federal defense officer representing Saipov, said his decision was "not bad."
Patton said, "We think that if you're going to be sentenced without being released, you're going to be more likely to be punished by the decision of being sentenced to death for all the people who take the place,"
Saipov's defence team wanted them not to be found in the case of the defendants.
Tory Milletvekil said NIGEL FARGE should be brought to the start of Brexit's meetings.
Nigel Farage made a promise at a Tory conference today that "the people's army will move."
When Theresa May said one of her own citizens had to start negotiations with the EU, former Ukip leader said that politicians should feel pressure from the European Union.
In the course of his trip to Birmingham, President Peter Bone said that if Mr Farage Brexit wasn't Secretary of the United Kingdom, the United Kingdom "would have gone out so far."
Another Brexit in the city has been described six times by the left-wing Torys in the EU, who are fighting against another Brexit in the city.
President; Brexit's neighbours, EU's neighbours and the EU's own attacks are facing problems in ensuring that the parties' plans are implemented.
Muttifs insist on continuing their agreement with Brussels despite the following comments and urging the EU to vote among the "kaos" with a plan that served the Work Party against them.
Mr. Bone said during his trip to Solihull, Leave Means Leave said he wanted to "cleanse the checks account."
Mr. Farage said that Mr. Farage should be involved in the meetings with Brussels.
"If he were responsible for these meetings, we would still be separated from the EU," he said.
Wellingborough Millettvekil added, "I'm going to make an effort for Brexit, but we need to clear Chequers."
"We didn't give the world's wars to become a child.
We want to set up our own laws in our own country."
Mr. Bone, after the 2016 play, rejected the idea of changing the mind of the crowd: "The idea of the English people changing their mind and wanting to stay in the EU is completely unfounded."
Brexit's side and Tory's partner, Andrea Jenkins, were walking and he said to the delegates, "I'm just saying, Mr. President, listen to the people."
"Shequers doesn't like people, she won't play the leader, she doesn't like our activists who have our parties and streets chosen.
Please leave Chequers and open your ears."
She added to her message to Mrs. May, "If others don't keep their words, they won't even keep their place."
Mr. Farage said when politicians were thinking about betraying the decision that was made in the 2016 referendum, they needed to "feel the pressure" on them.
"This is now a security issue between us and the people and politicians," he said.
"They're trying to deceive Brexit, and we're here to say, 'We won't let you do this today.'
In his message to the majority, Coshkulu added: "I want to feel pressure on our politicians in the face of betraying Brexit."
"We're trying to move this country's people's army, which allows us to succeed in Brexit, and we won't stop until we have a proud United Kingdom."
During this time, residents of the EU held a two-hour meeting in the city centre after their march inside Birmingham.
After this weekend's group entered, a group of activists posted "Tory's Against Brexit" banners.
The member of the Labour Party, Lord Adonis, made the debateers about safety due to the lack of application of a party when the conference was opened.
"These people tell us that they can use all technologies for free trade in Ireland for information systems and for unrestricted borders for Canada," he added.
"It's a deal.
There's nothing good about Brexit," he added.

Warren had some tellers that he could be an agent against Trump in 2020.
After Saturday afternoon, the activity organized in Holyoke took place at the 36th meeting, which took place with the participants in the building.
A reporter asked him if he had been appointed to the president.
Warren replied that "the time has come to Washington to correct women's corrupt government and that it includes taking a woman's place at the top of the state."

The Baton Rouge Police Department explained that the 20-year-old Ditheon Simpson was arrested in connection with the press meeting, which was held at 11 a.m. on Sunday.

Russia Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton, after leaving Sebastian Vettel at the command of the team, runs into the world's championship
On Saturday, the day of the contest, Valtteri Bottas appeared in the middle of the team's command of Mercedes to play a major role in the contest.
Bottas made a good start out of his Polish position, protecting his position in the first two races, and forced Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel, who first went to the pit stop, then left Hamilton behind so that it could be the brain that would end this fight.
The Mercedes team that entered the pit in the next race came after Vettel, but Hamilton, after two close relatives who were forced to defend Ferrari on the third turn, tried to keep him out of the inside, even though he did not want to.
Max Verstappen, who started the race from the back of the race and celebrated his 21st birthday, was able to be seven at the end of the first round.
Then, with the goal of completing a more rapid finish, Kimi Raikkonen led a large part of the struggle to fire his last cargo in order to cross the fourth line.
Verstappen entered the Pit stop on the 44th, but he couldn't increase the speed of the remaining eight and Raikkon's fourth.
Hamilton said, "It was a terrible day because Valtter was doing a great job all weekend and was a real gentleman.
The team did an impossible job to get the first two lines," he said.
The Body’s Tongue Is Truly Evil
President Donald Trump interviewed Senator Diane Feinstein, who said that Christine Blasey Ford had not violated the letter he accused of sexual assault on Brett Kavanaugh.
The president, speaking at a meeting in West Virginia, did not specifically mention Ford's statement before the Senate Committee, but he said that people were "bad and lying" because of being in the Senate.
Trump said, "The only thing we can do and the good thing in the Senate in the last few days is to see people who are angry, angry, evil and dishonest."
You're looking at published and underlined information, but they say, "I didn't do it.
It wasn't me," she says.
"Do you remember?
Diane Feinstein, did you misinformed the information?
And do not forget her answer, did you break the document?
No, no, no.
I didn't interrupt," she says.
Wait a minute.
"We didn't do it," said Senator Trump.
A letter came to Feinstein from Ford in November to Kavanaugh, which contained details of the sexual abuses committed against Fenstein, but he refused to be the source of this disorder.
According to The Hill, the Feinstein Committee said, "I didn't keep Dr. Ford's charges and I didn't break his story,"
"Dr. Fort asked me to keep it secret, and I kept it secret as he wanted."
But when the unbelievers saw what they had said on the Day of Resurrection, he said to his companion, 'What shall I tell you?'
Maybe it didn't upset her, but it was the worst thing I've ever seen."
Three women pointed out that they used the ideas of Democrats for their own purposes, who continued to defend the Supreme Court, who accused them of being sexually discriminated against.
"They're determined to try every way to get through it again."
According to Mediaite, "You see how they did evil to gain control and control, who hurt and who don't care about who they were," said President.

Airport traffic controller Killed in order to ensure that hundreds of passengers from Depression Airport fled
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is considered to be a hero after losing his life by making sure that hundreds of people are safely on board.
On Friday, he lost more than 800 people alive in a massive depression that touched a tsunami on the island of Sulawesi.
The region continues to experience increasing shocks, and Palu is expecting many people to be rescued under an emergency.
Although his colleagues fled to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthony Gunawan Agung refused to leave his office of control at the Palu Air Force depressed by Mutiara Sis Al Jufri.
At the time, 6321 aircraft from the Badik Air was on board to make sure that it was safely aired by a number of aircraft.
Then he jumped out of the tower, thinking that the traffic control tower was down.
He lost his life in the hospital he was left behind.
According to Australian ABC News, Air Navigation Indonesian spokesman Johannes Sirait said that the driver's decision could have saved hundreds of lives.
"We have prepared a helicopter to get our colleague to a bigger hospital in a city other than the Balikpan in Calimantan."
"But unfortunately we lost him before we reached Palu this morning."
Siriat added, "It's too bad for us to get this news,"
On the other hand, the country's state-of-the-art fighting organization has indicated that access to the towns of Dorha, Sig and Botong is limited.
Sotopo Purwo Nugroho said, "We think there's still a lot of people in the world who can survive because there's still a lot of people."
The waves that reached up to six meters have destroyed Palu, and a mass funeral will be organised on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft take medical assistance and equipment that is needed.
A 35-year-old mother, Risa Kusuma Sky News, told her: "An ambulance every minute brings new bodies.
Clean water is very hard.
The mini markets are everywhere.
International Red Indonesia President Jan Gelfand CNN said: "We are fighting with time to help those who live in Indonesia as Red Cross, but we don't know what we're going to do there.
It's a big tragedy now, but it can get worse."
In CNN's news, Indonesian Prime Minister Joko Widododo came to Palu on the market day, and the army voiced: "I want you to work day and night to complete all the duties related to Tathil.
Are you ready to do this?"
Indonesia was hit by more than 550 deaths this year in Lombok.
A plane crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini indicates that a man is missing after the plane crash in his village.
An airline operating in a Pacific coast in Micronesia reported that 47 passengers and passengers had just lost one person.
Air Niugini indicated that a man could not find his way after dinner.
The airline announced that it was working with local authorities, hospitals and inspectors to find the route.
The airline has not yet submitted any more information on its travel issues, such as age or sleep.
The trains in the region helped save other passengers and crews on board the Chuuk River while trying to escape the Chuuk River.
The authorities indicated on Friday that seven people were placed in the hospital.
The airline said on Wednesday that six passengers were kept in the hospital under surveillance and that their conditions were stable.
It's still protecting his uncertainty about the cause of the accident and how it develops over the course of the events.
The airline and the U.S. Marine Forces said the plane landed at the dock near the bridge.
Some of the eyewitnesses claimed that the plane was missing.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane was approaching very low.
Janes added, "This is a very good thing."
Janes said that he and the others were able to move on to their immediate exits.
He said he panicked and shouted, and he got a little hurt on his head.
The U.S. Marine Forces indicated that mariners who worked to improve a nearby landing area helped rescue people by using a wet boat to transport them to the shore about 30 metres (100 ft) before they fell into the air.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network show that in the last 20 years, in PNG registered airlines, 111 people have been killed in disasters that killed 111 people, but Air Niugini is not a disaster history.
Analyst, when a woman was burned alive on the night she was burned alive, she had her breath in her head.
In 2014, the prosecutor charged a woman with a life-threatening case of a man charged with burning her alive on Wednesday.
U.S. Court of Justice Analyst Paul Rowlett has been an expert witness in the field of history.
The 29-year-old analyst Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers described how he managed to sort out the night after Jessica Chambers died.
According to Clarion Ledger, Rowlett indicated that on the night his wife died, Tellis was with Chambers to show that he had picked up his cell phone information.
The data showed that while Tellis' friend Michael Sanford was with him, he went to the police to talk to Sanford when his cell phone showed him that he was in the same place as Chambers.
On Wednesday, Sanford told me he wasn't in town that day.
When the prosecutors reminded Tellis that he was in Sanford's truck that night, he continued, "The witness is lying because my truck was in Nashville."
Another lack of restraint was that Tellis didn't say he knew him for about two weeks when he died.
The cell phone records show they've only known each other for a week.
Rowlett told Chambers after his death that Tellis had removed his messages, phone calls and communication information from his phone.
Hale said, "He's gone out of his life,"
It's scheduled to start on the market on a day-to-day defense by the defendant.
The judge said the case was expected to be transferred to the jury at the next hours of the day.
The High Breed: What is the famous hip hop?
This hip hop 3 wants to change your mind by filling up your music with possible messages.
Bristol, The High Breed, claims that hip hop has been away from the source of political messages and has faced social problems.
They want to return to their bones and make a well-known hip hop again.
The Fugees and Common artists, such as Akala and Lowkey, soon became popular in England.
Another black one?!
The New York Times, the two who work next door, open up the case because of the "extraordinary" message.
A New York newspaper, a double case of what a child's mother wrote and sent to her, after a "one more black" message she was separated from her and dismissed from her job.
He denies that he's committed robbery and makes the case look like a "punching."
Two children's mother, Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, expressed concern when she learned that Giselle Maurice was black on the first day of 2016.
Ms. Plasco-Flaxman wrote in her letter to her husband "WITHING A LITTLE BLOOD,"
But she sent her message to Mrs. Maurice twice instead of sending it to her husband.
According to the New York Post, after she found out what she had done, she attacked Afro-American Maurice as "unsatisfied", said that her father was doing a bad job and that a Filipino priest was waiting for her.
Mrs. Maurice was paid a day's salary and then sent home by a woman with a Uber car.
Maurice wants a double trial, and she's been working without an appointment, and she's been working at home for six months.
The woman who spoke to Post on Friday says, "I want to show them they can't do this,"
He's saying it makes sense to end Maurice's work because he says they're afraid they won't trust him after he's strengthened her.
His husband, Joel Plasco, who spoke to the post, said, "I think I sent him something that he didn't really throw.
He's not a driver.
He says, "We're not people who drive,"
"But if ye do err, will ye submit yourselves to the hand of someone to whom ye hold your children in honour?
Your newborn baby?
Don't do it."
Plasco, who sees the case as a "crowding" attempt, adds that the baby was born just two months ago and that his wife was "in a very difficult situation."
He says, "Are you going to open a case for someone like that?"
And I'm adding, "This isn't a very nice thing."
The legal process is still under way, but the population is being hit on the ground by two behaviours and meanings.
A new letter shows that Paddington's readers are afraid that they will not be able to communicate with a month that readers are talking about.
A short time after Bond's book was accepted, Karen Jankel, who was born, said about her letter: "It's very difficult to replace someone who first read before it was published.
It's great to see what we know now about Paddington's great success."
Jankel, who said that his father, who worked as a BBC camera before inspired him to write a book from the mouth of a small game month, said that his father's publication of books was "but painful and sweet" after his death last year.
His father, also known as Paddington as "a very important member of our family," said that he felt proud of his success at the end of the book.
He said, "My father was a very quiet man, and he was not one of those who lived by what he did."
"But Paddington feels like you've got a child who's got something to do with it, and you're proud of it even if you don't do it.
I think my dad appreciated Paddington's success this way.
He always gave Paddington his rights, no matter how he met and guessed.
My daughter was dead, and I had to get up on the phone.
After her pregnancy, her daughter Nice's Hospital Louis Pasteur 2 was taken to the hospital, and the doctors failed to show up to save her life.
Ms. Ednan-Laperouse said "Nad called me regularly and said that she was really bad and didn't expect her to live," she said.
"Then I got a phone to tell Nad he's gonna die in two minutes and I'm gonna have to rehabilitate him.
And I did.
"Tashi, I love you so much," I said.
"We'll be together again."
I'll be with you.
Doctors were slowing down and leaving his body to keep his heart pumping blood.
He died a while ago and he's done everything.
I knew what was going to happen, and I just had to sit and wait.
I couldn't call my family members and a lot of people because I was in a place where I was, I couldn't cry.
I really needed to hold on to myself."
Ms. Ednan-Laperouse, who is currently holding her back, finally flew off to other passengers, unaware of the difficulties she would have to live.
"No one knew," he said.
"I raised my head and my eyes filled with tears.
It's hard to explain, but during the flight, I felt a huge feeling about Nad.
I felt I needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much you loved her."
Women who lost their loved ones are holding cards to prevent their predators from entering the bridge.
They're trying to stop the other two women who lose their love for their own reasons.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys, Welsh for a long time, contain letters of inspiration and support for people whose phone numbers are written.
Mrs. Davis' son Tyler started fighting depression at the age of 13, and was pregnant at the age of 18.
Davis says, "I don't want you to feel like I feel like I do every day,"
Mrs. Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, says his son's promise to come and everyone around him is a joke.
"Everyone knew him because he didn't laugh.
They used to say, "What's your joke about?"
But before he died, he gave up his job because he was "in a bad time."
In 2014, Tyler was the first person to realize that he had finished his life as a 11-year-old brother.
Ms. Davis said, "I'm always concerned about creating an incentive."
Ms. Davis says that the reason for preparing the cards is "to let people know that if there's a friend, you can always talk to them."
"Don't be quiet, you have to talk."
For years Mrs. Humphreys, a friend of Mrs. Davis, lost Mark's wife 15 years after her mother died.
"He never told me he was in trouble or depression," he said.
"We noticed a change in their habits a few days ago from Noel.
The Christmas Day was so bad, and when the children opened their gifts, it didn't even look at them."
He said that his wife's death was a major tragedy for the whole family, but they had to throw it away. "There's a madness in your family.
He's taking care of us.
But we have to go on and fight."
If you are being forced to fight, you can call Samaritan on 116 123 (United Kingdom and Ireland) free of charge, send an email to jo@samaritans.org or visit Samaritan's website here.
Brett Kavanaugh's career will be determined by the FBI's inquiry
On Saturday, "I think if there was a limited press and time-conquistadore, we could have an agreement," said Mr. Flake, afraid of "departure" of a committee that had entered into an interview for party reasons.
Mr. Kavanaugh and his community supporters didn't want him to ask the FBI a question?
Don't give me the whole reason for this.
The elections are only five weeks away, and if the people of the Community are doing what they are expected to do wrong on 6 November, they will be severely injured in their efforts to ensure that they are elected to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush, who had been working for him at White Saray, in contact with Senators for a while, was making a lot of money to support Mr. Kavanaugh, a former personal secretary.
What will happen after the FBI's report has been prepared?
A vote will take place in Senato, which has filled the seats of 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
Mr. Kavanaugh will not be able to reach 50 in the Senate right now, but if he can reach out, he can accept himself to the Supreme Court by breaking up President Mike Pence's partnership.
Under Kim's leadership, the number of refugees from North Korea "has gone"
According to a South Korean legislator, after Kim Jong-un took power seven years ago, the number of refugees from North Korea to South Korea decreased.
Park Byeong-seug, who pointed out the information received from the South's integration survey, said that the number of refugees from 2,706 in 2011 fell to 1.127 last year.
Mr. Park, North Korea and China indicated that increased border controls and human refugees were the most important factors.
Pyongyang was not found in any explanation.
The vast majority of refugees from North Korea have the opportunity to move to South Korea.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border since the Korean War ended in 1953.
Most of these people are fleeing from China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is more likely to escape from China than the Armed Unarmed Region (SB) which is seriously protected between the two Koreas.
China sees refugees as more illegal than refugees, and most of them return to their countries.
There has been great progress in the months of our relations between the North and South, which are still in the war.
At the beginning of this month, the leaders of the two countries came up with an interview at Pyongyang about the expected nuclear disarmament.
This meeting took place after the United States Presidents Donald Trump and Kim Jong agreed to work for an enhanced Korean nuclear aid in the month of July.
But on Wednesday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho has been involved in showing enough progress in the United States since then.
Mr. Ri said in a speech to BM General Meclisi in New York, "If we don't trust the U.S., we won't risk our national security, and we can't do one-sided weaponry under these conditions first," he said.
Nancy Pelosi said "historic" to Brett Kavanaugh and said it was not appropriate to serve at the High Court.
Mr. McClis, Chief of the Minority, Nancy Pelosi, said the High Court island "historic" for Brett Kavanaugh and said it was not appropriate to serve in the High Court.
Pelosi made this statement in a report at the Texas Tribune Festival in Texas on Wednesday.
Pelosi said, "If a woman did the same thing, I can't ignore the fact that people would say 'historic' on Friday before the Senate Committee," for which he said on Friday before the Senate Committee.
Kavanaugh, both young and young, rejected Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's ideas of sexual assault.
During his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very excited, and he almost cried when he spoke about family and school years and sometimes couldn't talk.
In addition, the Committee's Democrats were explicitly cursed, and the charges against them were assessed as "a cruel and deliberate suicide" by the Liberals responsible for the loss of Hillary Clinton in 2016's presidential elections.
Pelosi said he believed that Kavanaugh's statement was evidence that he could not serve in the Supreme Court because it showed that he was committed to democracy.
"I am concerned about these statements and the behaviour of the Democrats with the Clintons," he said.
Kavanaugh was elected and the Democrats, the majority of the Members of the House of Commons, insisted on answering the question that they would not accept the Supreme Court.
"I'll tell you this; if you don't tell Congress or the FBI the facts, it's not appropriate to serve at the High Court, even in the present court," he said.
Kavanaugh is currently serving as a judge at the D.C. Thesis Court.
Pelosi added that Kavanaugh was concerned as a Democrat because he was regarded as a defender of the potential governments against the Economic Health Watch Act or Roe v. Wade.
Kavanaugh refused to answer questions about the fact that he would not change certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"Let's go to court and say, 'It's not great, isn't it?"
And women must use it.
Even if it's a right act, a full moon and years, it doesn't mean it won't hurt.
45 years later, Mrs. Steinem told me, "We'll cry when we're done,"
"It's not so bad, is it?"
He went on, "A woman who was in charge in one place helped me a lot, and she cried when she started to cry, but she developed a technique and spoke to someone who started to cry and cried.
I'm sorry.'
Then she's going on.
I think it's very smart."
The partial misunderstanding on the ground indicates that his eye is an external blow because of the wrong understanding.
I remember one of my first things very well; I was crying in an unbelievably way in an office where most men were in an office, an older woman, always a cold manager I was afraid of, taking me away from myself and bringing me to an ironic void.
"Never let them see you cry," he said to me.
"They won't understand it.
They'll think you're sorry and they'll be happy because they'll think they can influence you."
At the time, Colorado, a member of a Democratic Congressman, Patricia Schroeder, worked with him during Gary Hart's term of office.
Mr. Hart in 1987, when he was caught up in a ship called Monkey Business living on a ship without a marriage relationship, he realized that there was nothing to stop him from discovering the idea of the most surprising Mrs. Schroeder.
"Well, it wasn't a decision," she said, laughing at me 30 years later.
"There were seven other names in the contest, and the last thing they needed was another name.
Someone said, "Pamuk Princess and Seven Boys,"
He's been back because he was late for the campaign, and he promised he wouldn't get into the race until two million dollars.
It's a lost war.
He found out that some of his supporters gave him only 250 dollars.
"Do they think I'm being sent?" he asked.
When she was talking about a formal campaign she wouldn't start; her appreciation for those who supported her was so filled with feelings that she was overwhelmed by the thought of the failure of the system that made it so difficult for her to find money and delegates.
"You thought I was having a crisis," said Mrs. Schroeder, remembering the reaction of the press to her.
"You thought Kleenex was my official sponsor.
I remember thinking about what they'd write to my desk.
'Did they cry?'
How can the US-China Trade War benefit Beijing?
The first attacks on trade between the United States and China were very violent, and it could be useful for Pekin, as far as the end of the war is concerned, in the long term, in the open way between the countries.
U.S. President Donald Trump made the first announcement this year by bringing taxes on China's most important relief products contained in the solar panels, solar panels and aluminum.
The most important thing is that this week, the total amount of 200 billion dollars (150 billion pounds) was brought to some of the products and half of the products coming from China to the United States.
In fact, every time he made a more national comparison, he paid him one hundred cents of silver for American products worth $60 billion in the last time.
China has promised to give the same power to the United States, and it seems unlikely that the world's second largest economy will soon collapse.
Washington needs to be taken back into action, but it would obviously be a shame for China's President Xi Jinping to submit to the United States.
However, experts say that when China's cards are being played properly, two economies are less likely to be affected in a long term by the long-term pressure on the US trade war.
Researcher Abigail Grace, who works in an opinion air called the New American Security Centre, found it more dangerous than predicting that the conditions for a rapid decision to be taken in Washington or Beijing could lead to economic instability in two countries," he explained.
The Foreign Minister said, "Get ready for the return of refugees to Syria"
Syria says refugees are willing to return and wants to help rebuild a country that has been banned for seven years.
Speaking to the United Nations General Council, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moulam said the situation in the country improved.
