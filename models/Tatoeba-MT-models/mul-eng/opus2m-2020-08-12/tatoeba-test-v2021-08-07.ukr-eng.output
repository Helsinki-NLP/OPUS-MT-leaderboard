Clearly, he knows the answer.
It's hard for me to wake up before it's six.
It is difficult to express your thoughts in English.

It was a hard night for him.
I haven't seen any grandmothers since.
I haven't been in Boston a long time.
He was expelled from the camp.
It was removed from the accounts.
It's been a few hours.
Better not go there.
It's better not to trust him.
There is no doubt that rain will come.

It's getting better.
It's hard to choose.
It's hard to find a common language with Tom.
It's hard to focus on this camera.

This cannot be explained.
I'm sorry, it's not a minute.
He's in the shower.
She's in my shower.
It's interesting to talk to Tom.
She's in the fridge.
He's in the kitchen.
It's ironic.
It's just a matter of time.
It's down the street on the left.
It's a marriage, it's not a state of bliss.
She smelled like shit.
It smells like somebody's smoking here.
Today's Sunday.
It's much worse.
Open your mouth.
It's my fault, not yours.
I'm preparing.
My turn to talk.
His name is Tom.
Today's a national day is a lie!
It's never too late.
Good to see you again.

It doesn't matter to me.
We didn't.
It's not very important.
It would be unwise on your part to reject his offer.
It's a little expensive.
It's not worth the effort.
It doesn't make any sense to regret it now.
My turn to laugh.
Now my turn is to laugh.
It's my turn to talk now.
It's obvious that they're trying to destroy Tom at last.
Apparently, Tom and Mary are more than just friends.
Apparently, Tom is not talking to Mary.
Being wrong is not a problem.
Being wrong is not a problem.
I'm fine.
It's just for a while.

I want to talk to Tom on my own.
It's too hard.
It's too late!
It's too expensive!
The old man's too freaky.
It's too much.
It's twelve years now.
It's a typical contraction.
That's not true.
That's what you have to decide.
As you wish.
It's Valentine's Day.
It's very dangerous here.
It's very nice of you to help me.
It's your life.
Now it's yours.
It's yours.
It takes a lot of practice and patience.
The child will grow up all over the village.
We need determination.

It was my fault, not Tom.
That was not enough.
I didn't have to make that decision.
That wasn't necessary.
I forgot our dog, not Tom's dog.
It was Saturday night.
You see, it was Tom's fault.
It was Tom's idea, not mine.
That's what Tom did.
It was very cold.
She was white.
That's what you suggested to see this movie.
It'll be dark.
Tomorrow's gonna be worse.
It's going to cost $50 somewhere.
It'll take a while for him to figure it out, right?
It won't be as boring as you think it is.
It won't cost you anything.
It's working.
You'd be the best if I did.
I'd better tell you the truth.
