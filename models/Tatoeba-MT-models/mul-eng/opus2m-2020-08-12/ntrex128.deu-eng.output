Members of the National Assembly for Wales Feared of Muppets
For some Members of the National Assembly, the proposal to amend their title in "MWP" (Member of the Welsh Parliament, member of the Welsh Parliament).
This is why it is planned to change the names of the National Assembly in the Welsh Parliament (Valisian Parliament).
Members of the National Assembly of all political directions are afraid to become the target of the spot.
One of the members of the Labour Party said his group was concerned because the name “Twp” and “Pwp” were addressed.
For non-walisic readers: In Welsh there is "twp" for "dof" and "pwp" for "Aa".
A member of the National Assembly of the Party of Plaid Cymru stated that the entire group was "not happy" and suggested alternatives.
A member of the Welsh Conservative Party said his group was closed against the change of name, but showed the great similarity between "MWP" and "Muppet".
In this context, the vassian letter w is spoken in the English language spoken in Yorkshire, similar to the letter ou.
The Assembly Commission (National Assembly Board), which is currently drafting a Law on Names, said: "The final decision on names for members of the National Assembly is of course with the members."
The Government of Wales Act of 2017 authorized the National Assembly to change its names.
In June the Gremium published the results of a public consultation on the proposals from which broad support for the name ‘Wells Parliament’ was made for the National Assembly.
With regard to the title of the national assembly members, the ‘Welsh Parliament Members’ (Walisian Members) or ‘WMPs’ preferred the ‘MWP’ option in public hearing.
The members of the National Assembly may suggest alternative options, but the ring could pose a problem for President Elin Jones, who should present a draft legislation within weeks.
The Law on Reform will include further amendments to the working methods of the National Assembly, including rules on the disqualification of members of the National Assembly and on the establishment of the Committee's system.
The members of the National Assembly may finally vote on their name in their debate on the law.
Macedonians agree in a referendum on a change in the name of the country
The voters decided on Sunday whether their country's name should be changed to "North-Madian Republic".
The referendum was set up to contribute to a decades of conflict with the neighbouring Greece, which has a province with the same name as Macedonia.
Athens has long been saying that the name of its northern neighbours means that this claim exists in the Greek area and has repeatedly spoken against its entry into the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the referendum on the change in name, said he would not accept the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the change in the name of the price to be paid for accession to the EU and NATO.
The clocks of St. Martin's weak in view of the difficulties of the church in Harlem
“The old people whom I spoke to have given a bar and a church to every corner in the past,” said Adams.
"Today there is no more."
He said that the disappearance of the bar was complete.
"The social life of people looks different today," he said.
"Bars are no longer the living rooms of the neighborhood where people are regularly found."
In the church he fears that the money from the sale of assets does not last as long as the church leaders accept it and that they “will be at the beginning sooner or later”.
The church, he added, could be replaced by apartments with properties in which people do not support the remaining places of refuge.
"The overwhelming majority of people buying properties in these buildings will be white," he said, "and thus speed up the complete closure of these churches, as it is unlikely that most people who join these properties will become members of these churches."
Both churches were created by white communities before Harlem became a black metropolis: Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin's a decade later.
The original white mediocre community emerged in the 1930s.
A black community that had abandoned their service to God was owned by the building.
St. Martin's was taken from a black community under Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of individual dealers in 125th Street to a large shopping street in Harlem that refused to use or support black.
At a fire in 1939 the building was badly damaged, but as Father Johnson's community members planned the reconstruction, they ordered the clock game.
Reverent David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson and his successor in St. Martin's, called the clock game pride as "the bells of the poor".
The expert who played the clock in July used other words: “A cultural chess” and “an invaluable historical instrument”.
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the first clock game in the world that was played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind. This was changed to the largest clock game in the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Merriweather said he wasn't replaced by St. Martin's.
What has played in the last few months in St. Martin's is a complicated story with architects and contractors who have been attracted to the lead of the church and to the part of the Bishop Diocese.
In July the President of the Community, the Community's executive board of directors of the Community, expressed concern against the diocese in writing that the diocese would try to extend the costs to the Community's President, although they were not involved in the prosecution of the architects and contractors sent by the Diocese.
Some members of the Community complained about lack of transparency on the part of the Diocese.
Hai damaged 13-year-olds in California when sleeping by Lobster
In California on Saturday, the first day of the Lobster season, after official statements, a 13-year-old boy attacked a Hai on his way to Lobster.
The attack took place at 7:00 near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
As Chad Hammel told the sender KSWB TV in San Diego, he had been with friends in the shower about half an hour this Saturday when he heard the boy's help cry and spent more time with several other boys to help him get out of the water.
Hammel said that he had first thought the young man was happy to have caught a lobster. But then he realized that the young man cried: “I am hungry!
I'm hungry!"
When Hammel arrived at the boy, he realized that his entire key leg had been raised.
“I write that everyone should come out of the water: ‘There is a Hai in the water!’ added Hammel.
The young man was flew to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego and is in critical condition.
The type of attack was unknown.
Rescue Wizard Captain Larry Giles told the media that a few weeks ago a shark had been seen in the area. However, it was concluded that it was not about a dangerous horse.
Giles added that the victim had suffered traumatic injuries in the area of the upper body.
Officials stopped access to Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Encinitas for 48 hours.
According to Giles, there are more than 135 sharks in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plan for the cosmetic market in the United Kingdom
Sainsbury's works with cosmetic parts that are available to shoppers with specialized assistants, boats, superdrugs and debenhams.
In the United Kingdom, the largest share of cosmetics in 11 branches will be tested throughout the country in the next year, if they prove to be successful, they will be extended to other branches in the next year.
The investment in cosmetics coincides with the search for supermarkets for possibilities, before the use of charging areas used for television devices, microwaves and household appliances.
According to Sainsbury's, the range of its cosmetics is doubled for the first time to up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Twozerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The previous series of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees also receive more space and brand areas than those in business like boats.
In addition, the Supermarket conducts a re launch of its "Buttique" series so that most of the products are veganer friendly – a aspect which is increasingly required by younger customers.
In addition, the perfume trader Fragrance Shop will be tested in two Sainsbury's branches. The first place of sale was opened in Croydon, South London, and a second will be opened in the course of this year in Selly Oak, Birmingham.
Online shopping and the transition to the daily purchase of small quantities of food in local demand goods means that supermarkets need to do more to allow customers to visit them.
According to Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury's, sales stations will increasingly look like buyers, as the supermarket chain tries to fight the discounter Aldi and Lidl with more services and non-food items.
Sainsbury's has set up hundreds of offices in Argos and Habitat since the purchase of the Argos and Habitat chains two years ago and has also set up a number of Habitat sales stations. This has increased food consumption as well as the profitability of the acquisitions.
The previous attempt by the Supermarket to reorganise its cosmetic and pharmaceutical departments was broken down.
In the early 2000s, Sainsbury's tested a joint venture with boats, which ended after an exchange of views on the distribution of revenues from the drug dealer's branches into the supermarkets.
The new strategy follows the sale of its 281 branches to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for 125 million British pounds three years ago.
The company noted that Lloyds will play a role in the plan if an extended palette with luxury skin care brands, such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy, is added in four branches.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Managing Director at Sainsbury's, said: "We have designed the appearance of our cosmetic parts to create an attractive environment for our customers.
In addition, we have invested in special-debt colleagues who are available as consultants.
Our brand pallet is closed to all needs. Due to the closing environment and the favourable location, we are now an attractive target for cosmetics purchases that demand the type of purchase so far."
Peter Jones "in the future" after the return of Holly Willoughbys from a business worth 11 million British dollars
“Dragons’ The” star Peter Jones is “tomorrow” after TV moderator Holly Willoughby has withdrawn from a business worth 11 million British money with his life-style brand company to concentrate on their new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby has no time for the common homewear and accessories brand Truly.
The business of the two was compared with Gwyneth Paltrows Mark Goop.
The "This Morning" moderator, 37, announced their return to Instagram.
Holly Willoughby introduced "Dragons' The" star Peter Jones by her extremely short-term return from her luxury lifestyle company to concentrate on their new connections with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Jones is to be "innocent" when the "Golden Girl" of the television screen at a lively discussion on the Sunday at the centre of his business seminar in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, can no longer spend enough time on their new business – at the value of up to 1.5 million British pounds – of the common homewear and accessories market Truly.
The company was compared with Gwyneth Paltrows Marke Goop and would probably double the estimated wealth of 11 million British dollars by Willoughbys.
While Willoughby, 37, announced her return from Truly to Instagram, Jones lost Britain on his way to a holiday home.
One source said: “Truly had the highest priority for Holly with distance.
It should ensure for them their future over the next decade.
Your decision to withdraw came as a surprise to all the participants.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, so soon before the introduction of the market.
In central Marlow a warehouse full of goods is waiting to be sold."
Experts believe that the return of the "This Morning" moderator, which is one of the most successful stars in the United Kingdom, could cost millions of dollars due to higher investments in cheese and cheese products up to homewear and possible delays in the introduction of the market.
In addition, it could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, the mother of three children, and her husband Dan Baldwin have been close friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby founded Truly in 2016 with Capp, and Jones, 52, was added as president in March.
The couples spend the holiday together, and Jones maintains a share of 40 percent of Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby is to be a brand messenger for M&S and to replace McPartlin as the moderator of the I'm A Celebrity I'm sending.
One Jones near the source said last night: "We do not comment on his business affairs."
Hard Words "and then we loved ourselves"
He was concerned about the criticism he had received from the media for a comment that some would consider "not presidential" and hoped for such positive warnings about the North Korean leadership.
Why did President Trump say so much?
Trump said that the voice of a news moderator followed:
"I didn't say anything."
He noted that Kim was interested in a second meeting, since the first meeting in Singapore was awarded in June of Trump as a major step towards the denuclearization of North Korea.
However, the denuclearisation negotiations are in stock.
Over three months after the summit in Singapore in June, Ri Yong Ho, the top North Korea diplomat, said on Saturday against leading politicians from all over the United Nations General Assembly, that the north did not see a "relevant" reaction to North Korea's first disarmament measures.
Instead, he established that the United States held sanctions to maintain the pressure.
Trump showed itself significantly more optimistic in his customer service.
"We are very successful with North Korea," he said.
“We were facing a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have been killed.
Now we have this great relationship."
He said that his efforts to improve Kim's relationship showed positive results: the end of the rocket service, support for the release of hostages and the return of the dead remnants of American military personnel.
He also defended his unusual way of talking about the relationship with Kim.
"It is so easy to be president, but instead of 10,000 people standing out and trying to get back into this crowded arena, about 200 people would be here," said Trump, pointing directly to the people.
Tsunami and earthquake devastated an island in Indonesia and cost hundreds of lives
After the earthquake in Lombok, for example, foreign non-governmental organizations were said they would not be needed.
Although over 10 per cent of the population of Lombok were sold, there was no national emergency, a condition for the mobilisation of international aid.
"Unfortunately, they have made it very clear in many cases that they do not require international support, so that is something difficult," said Sumbung.
While saving the children together a team to travel to Palu, it is not yet certain whether foreign workers can work in front of the site.
Sutopo, speaker of the disaster protection authority, said Indonesian officials assessed the situation in Palu whether international bodies should participate in the aid measures.
In view of the earthquakes which Indonesia has to constantly fight, the country is still prepared for the worst of natural violence.
While in Aceh Tsunami protection accommodation, these are not a daily view in other coastal areas.
Despite an obvious lack of Tsunamiwarserren in Palu, the warning in force has probably contributed to the deaths.
Travel between many islands of Indonesia is already a challenge in the optimal case.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A Lazarusrettship stationed in Lombok for the treatment of earth victims is along the way to Palu, but the location of the new disaster will be reached within three days.
President Joko Widodo has made the improvement of the affected Indonesian infrastructure for the core of his election campaign and has raised enough money for roads and roads.
However, the government of the re-electiond Joko in the next year is facing funding deficits.
In addition, Joko suffers from persistent confessional tensions in Indonesia under pressure. Members of the Muslim majority there practice a more conservative form of faith.
Over 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands of people were displaced from their homes and apartments as bands of Christians and Muslims fought on the streets with masks, rifles and bows and other primitive weapons.

Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool on Saturday at the London Stamford Bridge Stadium with an encounter in 89. minutes before a Premier League defeat against Chelsea.
Sturridge received a pass from the tower of Chelsea by Xherdan Shaqiri at the time of his team's return at 0:1.
He drew the ball to the left and then shot it towards the rear.
The Committee was very proud of the strand and ran into the right upper corner of the network.
Finally the ball fell over the jumping Kepa Arrizabalaga and then into the net.
"I've just tried to get myself into this position and get to the ball. Players like Shaq always play as much as possible ahead, so I've just tried to make as much time as possible for me," said Sturridge against LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw edges and had a contact with the ball. I didn't think too much about it and simply adopted the shot."
Chelsea led a 25-minute encounter by the Belgian Star Eden Hazard at half-time with 1:0.
The Blues Sturmer gave a pass with the fresh back to Matthew, then turned off near the middle of the field and printed half in the Liverpooler.

Liverpool plays at the group phase of the League Championships on Wednesday at 15:00 at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples.
Chelsea stands on Thursday at 15:00 in London in the UEFA Europe League Videoton.
The number of deaths of Tsunamis in Indonesia rose to 832
The number of victims of the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has increased to 832, as reported by the Disaster Protection Authority on Sunday morning.
Many people should have been arrested in the drummers of buildings, which, through the earthquake of strength 7,5 from the Friday, which had dissolved up to six meters high, reported by the authorities at a press conference Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
The city of Palu, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, was replaced by the drummers of one-storey buildings.
Police take men, 32, for murder suspects after a woman was shot
After finding a woman like this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside, a murder investigation was initiated.
The 44-year-old was found at 7:55 in Grayson Mews in the John Street. A 32-year-old man was arrested for murder.
The police call the residents to report if they have seen or heard anything.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is in an early phase, but I ask all those who have stayed near John Street in Birkenhead and have seen or heard something suspicious to contact us.
In addition, I would like to contact all people, especially taxi drivers, who may have been involved with a Dashcam. They may have information that is of utmost importance for our investigation."
A police speaker confirmed that the woman whose body was found lived in Birkenhead and was found in a building.
Today's afternoon are friends who believe the woman to be met at the tatort to discover where she was found this morning.
The investigations were under way, and the police shared that they were about to inform the victims' next members of the victim.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews just tried to get into his apartment, but was informed by the police that no one can attend or leave the building.
He was speechless when he learned what had happened.
The residents are now informed that it will take hours to re-enter the building.
It was heard as a police officer told a man that now the whole area is being treated as a hostage.
A woman appeared in tears at the place of the event.

The Cromwell State before Parliament will be the newest subject of the debate on the resurgence of history
Its connection would be poetic justice for its destruction of so many cultural and religious art products in England by its fanatic Puritan allies.
The Cromwell Society, however, described Cricks' proposal as "Tority" and "Try to Describe History".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: “It was inevitable in the current debate on the removal of statues that Oliver Cromwell’s stand-by image became the target of the House of Westminster.
The image storm in the English civil war was neither directed nor implemented by Cromwell.
Perhaps the false Cromwell would be sacrificed for the deeds of his predecessor Thomas in the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorney Cromwell's great performance is evidence of the opinion and part of the historical writing of a figure that is still worth celebrating in the 19th century.
Goldsmith said to the Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell will be protected by many, perhaps by the end of the 19th century more than today, than anyone who considers Parliament against pressure from outside, in his case of course by the monarchy.
If it is an entirely appropriate representation, it is the subject of continued historical debates.
It is certain that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century has shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is a unique figure that represents a side of this world.
Its services as Lord Protector are also worth celebrating them and remembering them."
Killerschein in Chinese Farmers
Following local media reports, a farmer was attacked and killed on a market in South-West China by a pig.
The man, known only as “Yuan”, was found dead near a pig station in Liupanshui on the market in the province of Guizhou, reported the South China Morning Post on Sunday.
On May 30, 2005, a female builder in Xining in the province of Qinghai, China, is ready to inject Swiss vaccines.
He reported after midnight with his cousin from the nearby province of Yunnan to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning his cousin found him dead and saw that a door was open to a nearby pig stable.
He said there was a big male whore in the stable with blood on the snow.
According to the report, a forensic study confirmed that the 250 kilos of severe swine fever had infected the farmers.
"The legs of my cousins were bloody and confused," the Cousin, known as "Wu", was quoted by the Guiyang Evening News.
Recorded a security camera showed how Yuan delivered the market on Thursday at 4:40 p.m. to feed his wife.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man was neither Yuan nor his cousin.
A market manager said the Evening News, the Sweein was arrested to prevent attacks on other people while the police collected evidence material at the Tatort.
Yuan's family and the market authorities will then deal with reports of damage to his death.
It is rare that women are attacked, but such cases are known.
In 2016 a woman attacked a woman and her husband on her farm in Massachusetts.
Ten years ago, a 290 kilo of heavy pig caught a walsic farmer between himself and a tractor until the farmer's wife was able to push the animal.
After a farmer was released from his pigs in Oregon in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba said against CBC News that pigs were not normally aggressive, but that the taste of blood could work as a “losser”.
“They are just played.
They're tired and are very curious, ... they're not about to hurt someone.
It is only to be treated with respect to the right degree," he said.
The rest of Hurikan Rosa brings widespread strong rains in the southwestern United States
As predicted, Hurrikan Rosa fails on the road through the colder water on the north coast of Mexico.
However, in the coming days, Rosa will bring floods to North Mexico and the South West of the United States.
On Sunday at 5:00 a.m. East Coast time Rosa showed wind speeds of 136 km/h corresponding to a hurricane of category 1, and is 620 kilometers south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
It is expected that Rosa will move north on Sunday.
In the meantime, it begins to form a bridge across the Pacific, heading east toward the west coast of the United States. When Rosa reaches the Baja California peninsula on Monday, high tropical humidity is transported north to the southwestern United States.
Rosa will be dissolved on Monday in parts of Mexico up to 25 centimetres.
Then the tropical humidity in the next few days is caused by the effects of exchanges with the associated trog, which are widespread in the south-west.
Locally, 2,5 to 10 centimetres can cause dangerous riverbeds, water-flowing protection and possibly soils in the desert.
High tropical humidity leads to low-calculation rates of almost 5 to 7.5 cm per hour, particularly in parts of the south of Nevada and Arizona.
In the south-west, in particular in a large part of Arizona, up to 5 to 10 centimetres are expected to fall.
Due to the distortion of tropical rainfall, there is the possibility of fluctuating floods with rapidly deteriorating conditions.
In view of the devastating tropical downturns, it is forced to walk into the desert.
Strong droplets can lead to becoming currents flowing from Canyons, and winds bring local wind bubbles as well as wind that leads dust with it.
The nearby tree produces strong rains in parts of the coast of South California.
It is possible that total dropouts of more than one centimetre can lead to low water-flowing protection and smooth roads.
This would be the first disaster of the rain time in this region.
The first combined tropical rains reach Arizona on Sunday and Monday morning. On Monday and Tuesday it is widespread.
On Tuesday there are strong rains in the Four-Corners region and the middle of the week.
In October there are strong temperature changes throughout the United States as the Arctic cools while the troops remain relatively warm.
This sometimes leads to drastic temperature differences over short distances.
On Sunday there is a good example of drastic temperature differences in the middle of the United States.
Between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, as well as between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa, there is a temperature difference of almost 12 oC.
In the next days, the continuous summer heat is trying to develop and expand again.
For a large part of the middle and east of the United States, a hot start of October is expected with extended temperatures of 27 °C from the Southern Plains to parts of the Northeast.
New York City could reach 27 oC on Tuesday, which is about 6 degrees above the average.
Our long-term climate forecast points to a high probability of average temperatures in the first half of October in the east of the United States.
Over 20 million viewers have seen the audience of Brett Kavanaugh
Over 20 million viewers have seen on Thursday at six television networks the fascinating statements of Brett Kavanaugh and the woman Christine Blasey Ford, who accused him of sexual abuse in the 1980s.
In the meantime, the political stance was taken. On Friday, television broadcasters interrupted their regular program due to a change in the last minute: a deal signed by Jeff Flake, Senator of Arizona, to conduct a single weekly investigation of the charges.
Ford asked the Senate's Justice Committee to ensure 100% to ensure that Kavanaugh had been drunk at a high school party, had pressured her and tried to remove her clothes.
Kavanaugh said in a random statement that he was 100% sure this wasn't happening.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million viewers reported by Nielsen have seen the audience.
The company identified the average viewer fees at CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
For other networks such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, which had exposed the audience, the numbers were not available immediately.
In addition, Nielsen usually has problems with measuring watch payments in offices.
To get this back into the right perspective: This corresponds to the number of spectators in a play-off football game or at the Oscar show.
The Messenger Fox News Channel, whose mind-oriented moderators strongly support the appointment of Kavanaughs, recorded according to Nielsen, with an average of 5.69 million viewers of the full-time hearing the highest number of all networks.
ABC came to second place with 3.26 million spectators.
According to Nielsen 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million viewers.
The interest remained great after the hearing.
Flake was the central figure in the play from Friday.
After the Office of the moderate Republican had published a statement that would allow him to vote for Kavanaugh, he was filmed on the morning morning by CNN and CBS on how protestors pressed him on the road to a hearing of the Justice Committee with words.
He stood for a minute with a low look while he was locked. The scene was transferred alive at CNN.
"I'm right in front of you," said one woman.
"Do you believe he tells the country the truth?"
"They have power, while so many women are powerless," said one woman.
Flake said his office had published a statement and completed before the board concluded that he would have to say more at the hearing before the Committee.
All cable and circuit networks sent hours later live when the Justice Committee should vote on the continuation of the appointment of Kavanaughs to vote on the whole Senate.
Fleke said, however, that he would only do this under the condition that the FBI, such as the democratic minority, is required to investigate complaints against the candidates in the next week.
Fleke is partly convinced by interviews with a friend, democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After an interview with Coons and then various senators, Flake made his decision.
Fleck's decision was of great importance, since it was obvious that the Republicans would not have enough votes to confirm Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has conducted an FBI investigation of the charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of using Brexit for political purposes
Prime Minister Theresa May, in an interview with the newspaper Sunday Times criticised her plans for Austria from the European Union to use the future of Britain for political purposes and undermine the interests of the nation.
The British Prime Minister Theresa May will take part on September 29, 2018 on the Day of the Conservative Party in Birmingham.
In addition to the interview with her in the newspaper titled another interview, former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson intensified his attack on her so-called "Checkers Plan" for Brexit by calling for a proposal that suggested the mutual entry of customs through Britain and the EU as "completely absurd".
Killing shots at Wade Sims: Police take suspicious Dytheon Simpson in relation to the death of the LSU player
The police have found a suspect in connection with the murder shootings on Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at the Louisiana State University (LSU).
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and arrested after reporting by Baton Rouge's police.
The authorities published video recordings of the exchange between Sims and Simpson. According to the police, Sims lost his glasses during the battle.
As the CBS partner station WAFB reported, the police secured the bridge on the roof and said that Simpson's DNA was found on the bridge.
After a question of Simpsons, the police said he had the killer shots on Wayde.
The lawyer reports that the charge for US$ 350,000 has been fixed.
The East Baton Rouge Parish Coroner's office published a preliminary report on Friday, according to which the cause of death was a stroke on the neck.
The police are grateful to the Louisiana State Police Fugitive Task Force, the criminal laboratory of the federal police, the Southern University Police and the citizens in the area for their support in the investigation leading to the arrest.
LSU sports director Joe Alleva thanked the regional executive for "their concern and their efforts for justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The 198 m large flight player grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played for the LSU basketball.
In the last season he achieved an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game.
On Friday morning, the basketball coach of the LSU, Will Wade, said that the team was "deeply shocked" and "high under shock".
"There's always fear for something like this," said Wade.
Vulkan plays ass in Mexico City.
From the volcano Popocatepetl, ash has reached the southern quarter of Mexico’s capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned the Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after the crater was occupied and 183 gas and ashe explosions were registered within 24 hours.
The Authority monitored numerous cases of throats and seizures.
Images in social media showed thin asches on the windshields of cars in four districts of Mexico City, for example Xochimilco.
Geophysicists, since September 2017, had caused an earthquake of 7.1 Central Mexico, an increased activity on the 72 kilometres south of the capital was found.
The Vulkan known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Conciliation between police and Catalan separatists prior to the anniversary of the decision of independence
In Barcelona, six persons were arrested on Saturday after meetings between the armed police and pro-Independence demonstrators. Thousands of others participated in demonstrations to commemorate the first anniversary of the polarising referendum in Catalonia.
A group of masked pro separatists who were detained by the police in preparation, they stole dark dust clouds with eggs and other colourful powders, thus creating dark clouds in the streets normally populated by tourists.
In the course of the next day, it was also necessary to deal with the police who used their weapons to halt the fighting.
For several hours pro-Independence groups have been scanned "Not forgotten, not forgiven", while they are opposed by Unionists calling "Long Live Spain".
As the local press reported, fourteen people were treated because of smaller protests of injuries.
A year after the referendum of 1 October, which was considered illegal by Madrid, however, by separatist Catalans, the situation in the independent region is still very tense.
The voters had decided with overwhelming majority for independence, although the electoral participation was low, since the opposition voted in favour of the vote.
According to the Catholic authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured in the last year when the police tried to prevent the vote in violent conflicts before the elections.
Pro-Independence groups had camped in the open on Friday night to prevent a demonstration for national police.
The demonstration took place, but it was forced to take another way.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who participated with his wife in the protest of the separatists said he saw the hopes that Catholics would gain independence, not hope anymore.
“Last year we experienced one of our best moments.
I saw my parents happy because they could choose, but now we're stuck," he said.
Despite an important one, even though it is short, victory in the last December regional elections, the Catalan pro-Independence parties of this year had difficulties in maintaining the momentum. Many of their best-known leaders are either in the easing exil itself or in the port where they are waiting for their procedures because of their role in the organisation of the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest in favour of the police on his phone, said the conflict was resolved by politicians on both sides.
"The situation is getting more and more tense," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catholic leaders who have been in investigation court since the end of the last year, announced his candidate for election to the European Parliament next year.
"As a candidate for the European elections, it is the best option to start the construction of democratic values and the oppression by the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after the car's house was closed
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 were arrested after a car hit several times in Londonderry.
The event took place in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at 19:30 p.m. after British summer.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said the doors and buildings were damaged themselves.
In addition, it may have been shot on the car with an armbrush.
Menga range means for Livingstone 1:0-Sight over Rangers
Dolly Mengas was the first tower for Livingstone to win.
The rising Livingston FC surprised the Rangers and led to the first second download for Steven Gerrard in 18 games as manager of the Ibrox Association.
Dolly Mengas meter proved to be decisive that Gary Holt's men were able to get along with Hibernian in the second half of his life.
Gerrard's Mannschaft is staying in this season without going out in the Premiership and stands against the hearts which return eight points on the next Sunday.
The rangers are first on Thursday in Europe League guests for Rapid Vienna.
Livingston can increase his victory series in the Division to six games in the meantime, i.e. he has not registered any discount since he took over by Kenny Miller in the last month.
Livingston missed opportunities against free-of-charge guests
Holds team had to be in charge long before the encounter, as its direction put the rangers in front of the various problems.
Scott Robinson crossed, however, was slowing down before the tower. Then Alan Lithgow could only shoot a long way after he was here to meet Craig Halkett's head shop on the tower.
The guests were pleased to let the Rangers play before themselves because they knew that they could prevent the guests from playing in standard situations.
In this way, the decisive tower came to a standstill.
The Rangers set up a freehouse, and Livingston provided an opportunity to bring the Declan Gallagher and Robinson together to the store. This shot the door with a ball contact from the middle of the street.
In this phase the Rangers had dominated the ball estate, but could not overcome the opposition of the guests, and Torhüter Liam Kelly remained largely undeserved.
This pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos Kelly once insisted on turning back.
Scott Pittman was fired by the Ranger Tower of Allan McGregor with his feet, and Lithgow beat the ball out of another standard situation in Livingstone.
Flanks were again caught in the punishment of Livingston and were regularly taken out of the danger zone, while two required punishments – one from Halkett against the changed Glenn Middleton and one for hand game – were rejected.
"Phenomenal" by Livingston – Analysis
Alasdair Lamont by BBC Scotland in Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal performance and a strong result for Livingstone.
They were exceptional, and they have once again exceeded the expectations of this upward trend.
Her ways of playing and her team have not changed since her return to the top team, but Holt has paid great praise for the way he has raised the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was great and led to an excellent organised revolution, while Menga Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall held up during the entire game.
The Rangers, however, lacked inspiration.
So well they were under Gerrard at the same time, they couldn't meet this standard.
Her last ball was insufficient – only once they were able to pass through the host's crew – and this is something like a weekend call for the Rangers who are in the middle of the table.
Receive Earthgan with mixed reactions in columns
On Saturday (September 29th), smiling faces and blue skies ruled when the Heads of Government of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
It was the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which should serve to repair relations between NATO allies.
It had raised issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and the EU's accession to Turkey.
Next, Erdogan traveled to Cologne to open a large new mosque.
The city is the home of the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police called for security reasons for leaving 25,000 people to collect large numbers of people in front of the mosque. However, many attachors were in the vicinity to see their presidents.
Hundreds of former Erdogan demonstrators – many of them Kurds – also became members. They condemned Erdogan’s policy as well as the decision of the German government to welcome him into the country.
Opposite protests reflect the polarizing effect of the visitor, who is praised by some Germans as hero and praised by others as autocrats.
Traffic accident in Deptford: Railways die in combination with car
At a meeting with a car, a driver came to London for life.
The meeting took place about 10:15 a.m. British summer time near the crossing of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a road road in Deptford, in the south of the city.
The driver of the car stopped, and healthists cared about the man who died in the accident.
A month before the accident, another train driver was in an accident at the Children's Street, about 1.6 kilometers away from the accident on Saturday to come to life.
According to the Metropolitan Police, officials worked to identify the man and to inform his next members.
Road stops and bus directions are set up and car drivers are advised to avoid the area.
Long-Lartin prison: Six officers injured during rest
According to the Prison Office, six prison officers were injured in a high-security prison for men.
On Sunday, about 9:30 a.m. British summer time in HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire was released and still stopped.
Specialized "Tornado" officers were invited to end the disturbances involving eight individuals and restricted to one flight.
The officers were treated locally because of minor injuries in the face.
A speaker from the Prison Service said: “It has been used especially to limit a continuing incident in HMP Long Lartin.
Six employees were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and we want to make it clear that the police officers will be transferred and perhaps spend longer time behind bars."
In HMP Long Lartin there are more than 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June it was reported that the prison director was treated after an attack by a prisoner in the hospital.
In October last year, officials were called into prison to deal with serious disturbances in which the staff was attacked with pools.
Hurrikan Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with riverbed floods (probably benefiting from coastal areas)
It is rare that a tropical depression reaches Arizona, but that is exactly what will probably happen next week when the rest of Hurikan Rosa are heading south across the desert and risk of fluctuating floods.
The National Weather Service has already issued warnings of riverbed floods on Monday and Tuesday from west of Arizona to south and east of Nevada, as well as in southern California and Utah, including Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It is expected that Rosa will approach with rain on the mountain evening and move directly over Phoenix on Tuesday.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix reported in a tweet that “from 1950 only ten tropical cyclones have come as tropical storm or tropical phoenix depression up to 320 kilometers!
Katrina (1967) is located as a hurricane within 64 kilometers from the Arizona border."
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center are forecasting 5 to 10 centimetres of the fall with a unit of up to 15 centimetres in Mogollon Rome of Arizona.
In other areas of the South-West region, including the central Rockies and the Great Basin, are likely to be 2.5 to 5 centimetres and can be aggregated up to 10 centimetres.
For those who do not have the risk of fluctuating overflows, the dropdowns associated with Rosa may be a blessing because of the doors in the region.
Although overwhelming is of great concern, this rain will probably be useful in part, since it is currently prevailing in the south-west.
According to U. S. Drought Monitor, more than 40 percent of Arizona's most extreme doors are on top of the second highest category," weather.com reported.
Firstly, the path of the Hurikan means that Rosa will meet on the Baja California peninsula in Mexico.
On Sunday morning Rosa will still have hurricanes with maximum winds of 136 kilometers per hour and will be 620 kilometers south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico. The hurricane will then take 19 kilometers per hour north.
In the Pacific, the storm will be encountered on colder waters and then disappear.
Therefore, it is expected that Rosa will be hit by a tropical storm on land on Monday or at night in Mexico.
In parts of Mexico, the drop can be very severe, so there is a significant risk of overheating.
“From Baja California to the northwestern of the Sonora Desert, low-sighted amounts of 7,5 to 15 centimetres are expected, up to 25 centimetres are possible”, said weather.com.
As a result, Rosa will drive as a tropical storm north across Mexico, reach the border to Arizona early in the morning of Sunday as a tropical depression and then drive up to the south of Utah by the late service day through Arizona.
“As a major threat to Rosa or her remnants are expected to face very severe falls in Baja California, the northwestern of the Sonora-West and the south-west of the United States covered by the West,” the National Hurricane Center reported.
As a result of these floods, it is expected that riverbeds of life threatening deserts and water-flowing protection as well as in mountainous areas of soil will be expected.
Attack in Midsumer Norton: Four arrests for attempted murder
After the discovery of a 16-year-old with stichunds in Somerset, three boys were arrested in the teenage years and a 20-year-old man under suspicion of attempted murder.
The teenager was found wounded on Saturday at 4:00 British summer time in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton.
He was taken to a hospital, and his condition is "stable".
According to the police of Avon and Somerset, a 17-year-old, two 18-year-old man and a 20-year-old man were arrested last night in the Radstock area.
Officials are invited to register all those who have records of the events on a mobile phone.
Trump said that Kavanaugh had "under the community, the forest" of the Democrats.
"A voice for Richter Kavanaugh is a voice against the unbridled and unheard of tactics of the Democrats," Trump said at a customer service in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh had been “under the Community, the White” of the Democrats during the entire nomination process.
Kavanaugh said on Thursday before the convention and showed back the charge received by Christine Blasey Ford that he had sexually abused them decades ago as both teenagers.
Ford also said at the hearing of her complaint.
The President said on Saturday that the American people had seen the brilliantness, the quality and courage of Kavanaugh this day.
"A voice for the confirmation of Justice Kavanaugh is a voice for the confirmation of one of the most experienced legal heads of our time, a lawyer with a great balance in the service of the public," he said to the number of his supporters in West Virginia.
The President spoke directly about the appointment of Kavanaugh when he spoke about the importance of the participation of the Republican voters in the inter-elections.
“Five weeks before one of the most important choices in our life.
I don't fit in, but I actually do," he said.
"That's why I fight everywhere for great candidates."
Trump argued that the Democrats saw their mission in it "to deliver and block resistance".
The first important procedural vote on the appointment of Kavanaughs is expected to take place at the latest on Friday at the Senate, said a senior GOP leader against CNN.
Hundreds of deaths in Indonesia in landslides, pay increases
According to the authorities of Saturday, at least 384 people were killed. Many of them were drowned as a result of a strong earthquake and tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
Hundreds of people were gathered on Friday at a festival on the beach of the city of Palu, when, at the time of darkness, up to six meters high waves fell on the beach and many people were dying and all that was going on their way was destroyed.
The tsunami was a quake of 7.5.
"When the threat came through the Tsunami yesterday, the people were still on the beach and didn't run away from it immediately and they fell to the victim," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, speaker of the Indonesian disaster protection authority BNPB at a conference in Jakarta.
"The Tsunami didn't come alone, he wore cars, trees and houses with him, he hit the land at all," Nugroho said. He added that the Tsunami was driven at a speed of 800 km/h over the open sea before he hit the coast.
Some people were dressed on the flight before the tsunami and had survived, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated and accommodated in 24 centres in Palu.
A number of damaged buildings and shops, buried and encrusted bridges, as well as a pool surrounded by water were shown by air captures published by the disaster protection authority.
On Saturday, the coastal city was hit by further afterbows.
The earthquake series was to blow up in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Authority BPPT (Agency for the Assessment and Application of Technology) said in a statement that the 200-phase of energy spent on Hiroshima in the massive wave of energy released from Friday.
Due to the location of the city at the end of a long, narrow bay, Tsunami could have become larger, the authorities said.
Nugroho described the damage as “absolute” and pointed out that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels are ingested.
According to his statement, the bodies of some victims were found under the roofs of one-storey buildings. 540 people were injured, and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said that the number of victims and the damages along the coast had been 300 km north of Palu, in an area called Doghía, which can be higher at the epicenter of the baby.
The communication with Dogharaa was fully supported by the words Nugrohos, and no information was provided.
According to a statement by the Red Cross, more than 300,000 people live there, and its employees and volunteers are on their way to the areas concerned.
"This is already a tragedy, but it could be much worse," he said.
On Saturday, the authorities were repeatedly criticized for not having reported that a Tsunami Palu had been hit, although the waves were officially reported at the time of the warning.
In social media, amateur captures show a man on the top of a building's store, who suspects people on the street under him in front of the nearby Tsunami.
Within minutes, a water wall can be reached on the floor and wet buildings and cars from it.
Reuters could not verify the accuracy of the recordings immediately.
Through the baby and Tsunami, there was a massive explosion which interrupted the communication around Palu and made it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue measures.
According to the authorities, the military has begun to send freight vehicles with support from Jakarta and other cities, but the evacuations still need urgent food and other vital goods.
The city airport is closed until October and has been reopened only for aid measures.
For Sunday a visit was planned by President Joko Widodo in the evacuation centres in Palu.
The number of tsunami victims has increased to more than 800.
The situation is very bad.
The staff of World Vision from Doghea have certainly reached the city of Palu, where the workers in the inner courtyard of their office have been buried, but they have gone through the words Dosebas on the way to the scene of the demolition.
"They told me they had seen many destroyed houses," he said.
The situation is very bad.
As the relief groups began with the hard task of putting disaster relief into action, some thought that professional foreign aid would be prevented on their journey to Palu.
According to Indonesian law, financial aid, supplies and personnel from abroad are only possible if the place of disaster has been declared national disaster.
That hasn't happened yet.
"At the moment there is another disaster on the province," said Aulia Ariani, speaker of the Indonesian Red Cross.
"As soon as the government says, 'okay, this is a national disaster', we can accept international support.
While the second night after the earthquake and the tsunami fell over Palu on Friday, friends and family members of the missing ones hoped for this to be one of the miracles that shed some light on the sad stories of natural disasters.
On Saturday a small boy was taken from a water channel.
On Sunday, rescue forces released a woman who had been dragged under her mother's body for two days under a drum.
Gedon Subbandnon, the trainer of the Indonesian Paragliding National Army, had trained two of the missing paragliders for the beginning of this month in Indonesia to final Asian games.
Others who were imprisoned in the Roa-Roa Hotel, as Mandi added, were his students.
“As an adult at Paragliding, I have my own emotional burden,” he said.
Gendon told us how in the hours following the message from the director of the Roa-Roa Hotel under the paraders, WhatsApp sent messages to the contestants from Palu who participated in the beach party.
However, his messages led, instead of to blue hooks, only to green whiskers.
"I think this means that the messages have not been sent," he said.
Diebe stole $26,750 US dollars during filling up a cash machine in Newport on the Level
According to a press release by Newport's police, on Friday morning in Newport on the Live Diebe a Brink's employee was hired to fill a cash machine of 26.750 US dollars.
The driver of the vehicle had learned a cash machine in the maintenance complex and wanted more money, wrote Detective Dennis McCarthy in the press release.
While he was employed, “a man named behind the employee of Brink’s” and stole a bag full of money that was destined for the machines.
According to the press release, several suspects fled the tower. However, the police did not notice how many people were involved in the incident.
Persons who have information about the identity of the suspects are asked to contact Newport's police under 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes his name in Ye
Rapper Kanye West changes its name – in Yes.
In the announcement of the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: “The being formally known as Kanye West” (The officially known as Kanye West).
West, 41, has been using the top name Ye for some time and has used it as the title of its eight albums published in June.
The change takes place at Saturday Night Live, where the publication of its new album “Yandhi” is expected.
He appears in the consignment as a substitute for singer Ariana Grande, who, according to the manufacturer’s comments on “emotional reasons”.
The word is not only a short break of its current professional name, but it has a religious significance, according to its own statement for the West.
“I believe ‘yes’ is the most frequently used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means ‘du’,” said West this year in a conversation about his album with Radio Moderator Big Boy.
“So I am you, I am us, it is us.
Of Kanye, which means “the only one” was simply “Yes” – simply a reflection of our good, our evil, our adversaries, of everything.
The album reflects what we are."
He is one of several famous rappers who have changed their names.
Sean Combs was known under the names Puff Daddy, P. Diddy and Diddy, but this year he announced that he preferred the names Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who worked with the West before, has already written his name with and without binding letters and letters.
Mexico AMLO believes that the military will not use it against the civilian population
The elected Mexican President, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, never resorted to military violence against the civilian population during the 50th anniversary of the bloody repression against students in his country.
Lopez Obrador agreed on Saturday at the Tlatelolco Plaza, "Never use the military to oppress the Mexican people".
On October 2, 1968, soldiers fired at a peaceful demonstration on the spot and killed 300 people. At this time, left-wing student movements were to establish themselves throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador hoped to support young Mexicans through monthly assistance for students and the opening of further free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of training had led to young criminal gangs.
The United States should double its financial resources for artificial intelligence
In view of China's increased activities in the field of artificial intelligence, the United States should double its research expenditure in this area, says Investor and KI practitioners Kai-Fu Lee, who was active at Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments follow KI announcements from various areas of the U.S. government, even if the US generally lacks a formal KI strategy.
In the meantime, China proposed its plan last year: The country intends to become number 1 in the area of KI innovation by 2030.
"The duplication of the budget for the KI research would be in view of the fact that all other countries are back so much behind the US, a good start. We are looking for the next KI break," Lee said.
The duplication of financial resources could double the chances that the next great KI success in the United States would be achieved, Lee said this week in an interview with CNBC.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is CEO of the company Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of the most prominent KI companies in China, Face+.
In the 1980s he worked at the Carnegie Mellon University on a KI system that won the top American Othello player. Later he was leading leadership at Microsoft Research and President of the Google Delegation in China.
Lee appreciated earlier US government technology competitions such as the Robotics Challenge of Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and asked after the time of the next competition, as he wanted to help identify the next viewers.
According to read words, researchers in the United States often have to work hard to get state subsidies.
"China does not take the academic top power away, but the company," said Lee.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have established copies of universities that are supposed to work on KI.
According to read, an amended U.S. immigration policy could also be beneficial for the US KI efforts.
"I think that the people promoted by the KI should be offered automatically Greencards," he said.
In July 2017, China State Council presented its plan for the development of the next generation of KI technologies (Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan).
According to Read Words, the National Natural Science Foundation of China funds people to academic institutions like the National Science Foundation and other government organizations spend money on US researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower.
At the beginning of this year, the U.S. Department of Defense founded the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, where the partner from industry and science was to be involved. In addition, the White House announced the formation of a special committee for artificial intelligence.
DARPA also announced this month's investment of $2 billion in the “AI Next” initiative.
The National Science Foundation (NSF) is currently investing more than $100 million in KI research annually.
In the meantime, U.S. laws on the formation of the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence have done nothing for months.
Macedonians agree in referendum on a change in the name of the country
On Sunday, the people of Macedonia agreed in a referendum on whether the name of the country should be changed in "Northern Macedonia", which would mark a decade-old conflict with Greece which had blocked Macedonia's applications for entry into the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province named Macedonia, claims that the name of its northern neighbours means that this claim is in the Greek area.
In June, the two governments concluded an agreement on the basis of the proposed new name. Nationalist opponents, however, argue that the amendment would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slovak majority population of Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum. A boycott campaign suggests in doubt that the electoral participation will reach 50 per cent required for the validity of the referendum.
The question on the voting list was: "Are you a member of NATO and the EU through the adoption of the agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the change in the name to which Prime Minister Zoran Zaev belongs argue that Macedonia, one of the countries that came from Yugoslavia's collapse, deserves to be included in organisations such as the EU and NATO.
"I have come today to vote for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia, so that they can live free of the European Union's screen, as this means a safer life for all of us," said Olivera Georgievska, 79, in Skopje.
Although the results of the vote are not legally binding, enough Members of Parliament have said that they would stick to the outcome so that it is decisive.
The name change would require a double majority in Parliament.
The State Electoral Commission said it had not reported irregularities until 1 p.m.
However, the vote was only 16 per cent compared to 34 per cent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, where 66 per cent of the registered voters voted.
"I am here because of my children to vote, our place is in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a elector in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko gave their vote on 30 September 2018 in Strumica, Macedonia, in the referendum on the change in the country name, which would open the way for Macedonia to join NATO and the European Union.
In front of the Parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, presented a small stage and presented chairs to cells that were set up by people who wanted to boycott the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to join proud leaders, not through the back entrance," Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we would.
If they don't want to take us as Macedonia, we can use other people like China and Russia and become part of the integration between Europe and Asia."
Prime Minister Zaev says the NATO membership will be responsible for Macedonia, whose unemployment rate is more than 20 per cent.
"I believe there will be a large majority for this because more than 80 per cent of our citizens are for the EU and NATO," Zaev said after his vote.
According to his words, a "yes" result would be a "confirmation of our future".
According to a survey published on Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research, between 30 and 43 percent of the voters will participate in the referendum. This number is below the required electoral participation.
Another survey conducted by the Macedonian sender Telma TV found that 57 percent of the respondents are planning to vote on Sunday.
70 percent said they would agree with "Yes".
If the referendum is to be successful, the vote must be 50 per cent plus one vote.
A shadow of the referendum would be the first serious blow to the policy of the pilot government since its adoption in May last year.
View: Sergio Aguero of Manchester City maneuvered by the entire Brighton turn to reach the tower
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling crossed the bridge at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester on Saturday at 2:0 a.m. of Manchester City.
Aguero left his encounter in the 65s. Minutes look ridiculously simple.
The Argentinian attacker received a pass at the beginning of the sequence in the middle field.
He raced between three Brighton players and then ran into the open field.
Aguero then looked around from four green triangles.
He played for a defender here and then survived several more defenders along the coast of Brighton.
Then he took a pass to the left to Sterling.
The English attacker used his first ball contact in the punishment to play the ball back to Aguero, who crossed the right corner of Brighton Tower Matthew Ryan and jumped into the right side of the net.
"Aguero is struggling with problems in his feet," said City Manager Pep Guardiola against reporters.
“We talked about he should play 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were happy that he had reached a tower at this point."
However, it was Sterling that gave Sky Blues the initial advantage in the Premier League Dull.
This tower fell in 29 minutes.
Aguero received the ball at this train far on the side of Brighton.
He took a good walk along the left bank of Leroy Sané.
Sané needed a few trains to control Sterling's long neck.
The Sky Blues attacker targeted the ball into the net shortly before he got out.
City plays in the Champions League group on Tuesday at 12:55 in the Rhine-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim against Hopeneheim.
Scherser wants to destroy the Rockies game
Since the nationals have been expelled from the playoff competition, there was little reason to force another use.
However, the always performance-qualified scars hope to stand against the Colorado Rockies on the hill on Sunday, but only if this is relevant to the Rockies that have a game in the NL West before the Los Angeles Dodgers, for the playoffs.
The Rockies achieved at least one wild card with a 5-2 victory over the Nationals on Friday evening, but they still want to ensure their first divisional title.
“Although we can play nothing, we can play at least because we know the atmosphere in the audience here in Denver and the other team would probably play at the highest level that I would encounter this year.
Why should I not participate in this competition?"
The Nationals have not yet announced any start-up players for Sunday, but they are willing to leave their players in such a situation.
Scherser, for which this was the 34th term as a starter, practiced on Thursday in the bulpen and would throw himself at his normal rest day on Sunday.
The Washington Lawyer has to present a statistics of 18-7, an ERA of 2,53 and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 Innings this season.
Trump keeps customer service in West Virginia
The President addressed the situation directly with the board of Kavanaugh, elected by him for the Supreme Court, when he spoke about the importance of the participation of the Republican voters in the inter-elections.
“All we have done is on the game in November.
Five weeks before one of the most important choices in our life.
This is one of the great, great – I don’t, but in reality I do, so I fight everywhere for great candidates,” he said.
Trump continued: “You see these horrible, horrible radical groups of Democrats, you see it now.
And they're determined to take all the means back into power, you see the community, the disparity.
It is up to them who hurt them, who must pass them over to gain power and control, that is what they want, power and control, we will not give them."
The Democrats, he said, saw their mission in "to deliver and block."
"And you see it in the last four days," he said and named the Democrats as "good and common and foolish and unfair".
He called it the highest-ranking Democrat in the Senate Justice Committee, Senator Diane Feinstein, which released the public's prizes.
“Do you remember her answer?
Did you get the document out?
Uh, uh, what.
No, no, I'm waiting for you one – that was really a bad body language – the worst body language I've ever seen."
The work will no longer be valid for all the opinions.
The party is tolerant of those who say their opinion.
When the Momentum activists in my local party agreed to beat me, this was a little surprising.
Finally, I am the last of a number of employees who are said not to be welcome – just because we say our opinion.
My colleague, Joan Ryan, was treated similarly because she had taken an active stand against anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was criticized with the request for a second opinion as Jeremy Corbyn.
The importance of a responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, ironically, on similar issues was not an opinion on Jeremy and former top politicians.
The announcement of the Nottingham East Labour meeting was made on Friday, "the meetings should be inclusive and productive".
Most of the free GC meetings in my eight years were just that as a local labor officer.
Today, most of the meetings are not covered by this sound, and the promised “friendly, safer” policy has been forgotten for a long time when it has already begun.
It is increasingly clear that different views are not tolerated in the Labour Party and that any opinion will then be assessed whether it is accepted by the party party.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a party leader, and colleagues with whom I had previously believed to share similar political views were now expected by me to make a return application and adopt positions I would have never agreed with otherwise, whether on national security or on the European internal market.
When I always speak publicly – where it doesn’t matter what I say – a shipyard in the social media that calls for my departure, calls for the political centre and says I shouldn’t be a member of the Labour Party.
And with this experience, I'm not alone.
In fact, I know that I am better than some of my colleagues because the comments addressed to me are mostly political.
I am amazed by the professionality and determination of the colleagues who are daily facing a stream of gender or racist occupations and yet are never too small to deal with.
One of the most disturbing aspects of this political age is that things have become normal.
Jeremy Corbyn asked last week that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
In fact, we no longer allow all the opinions, and with every miscellaneous request and any amendment to the rules of choice, the party becomes more strict.
In the last two years, I have been told to pull my head out and not to express my opinion so clearly. Then I would "no problems".
But I didn't get involved in politics.
Since I was a student 32 years ago, due to the neglect of Thatcher's government, because of my classroom in the entire school, the Labour Party, I have fought for better public services for those who need it most – as a community council as well as as as a cabinet minister.
I've never made a hero out of my political views, not even in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could somehow be in a position of political position and of areas in which I do not agree with the current leadership.
I would just like to say to the supporters of Friday's application: In view of the fact that the country is going to suffer from a brexit, the budgets, companies and our public service, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leadership of the Labour Party.
In fact, I am not referring this message to Nottingham moment, but to my voters, whether they are employees or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that I will not continue to do so many foolish threats or political purposes in my opinion of doing the best interests of all of you.
Chris Leslie is the director for Nottingham East
Air against Melrose 38:17: Unmanned Air Team rises on top
Two later attempts may have failed the final result, but there is no doubt that Ayr has won the victory in this extremely long-lasting game of the day in the Tennt's Premiership.
They are now the only ones of the ten men in the table area.
The last endes was the success of the Homemanship on its previous turn as well as its better chance assessment, and coach Peter Murchie had every reason to be satisfied.
"We have so far been tested in our games, and we are still unbeatable, so I must be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: "Recognition for Ayr, they've appreciated their chances better than we do."
Grant Anderson's attempt at the 14th minute, which was increased by Frazier Climo, led by Ayr. However, Melrose was able to speak the numbers because of a yellow card for the Scottish Captain Rory Hughes, who was released for the game by the Warriors, and Jason Baggot received an unhindered attempt.
Climo built the lead of Ayr with a strike before he achieved a hit at half-time and then achieved an increased attempt at the entrance, so it was at break 17:5 for Ayr.
Melrose began the second half-time well, however, and Patrick Anderson's attempt, which was raised by Baggot, reduced the distance to five points.
Next came a longer interruption due to a severe breach by Ruarahh Knott, who was removed from the field. After the continuation Ayr built his origin by an increased attempt by Staffford McDowell.
Then he received a yellow card from Blair Macpherson as Captain of Ayr, and once again Melrose paid for the additional man at the end of a phase of huge pressures by an unhindered attempt by Bruce Colvine.
However, the home host came back, and as a stream Hutchinson for Tackling without a ball against Climo, MacPherson obtained a yellow card from the fine gas from a touchdown behind the former Air Package.
Climo has increased as soon as possible since the interruption after Kyle Rowe David Armstrongs Boxkick was arrested and flunker Gregor Henry had sent to the fifth attempt by the Homemann.
"Still Game" star seems ready for new careers in the gastronomy
“Still Game” Star Ford Kieran seems to be ready for a change in the host company after it appeared that he was called the manager of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old Jack Jarvis plays in the popular BBC post, where he writes drivebooks and plays one of the main roles with his longtime Comedy partner Greg Hemphil.
The two announced that the front nine staff will be the last of the mission, and Kiernan seems to plan a life after Craiglong.
According to official entries, he is a business leader of Aojimorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the story, although a source of Scottish Sun claimed that Kiernan was interested in getting into a "floating restaurant business" in Glasgow.
"The Sea belongs to us": Bolivia, which is closed by the country, hopes that a court will open its way to peace
Matrosen patrols before the well-smoked marine capital apartment in La Paz.
At public buildings there is a sea blue flag.
The motto is: “The sea is our rightful property.
It's a duty to win it back."
In Bolivia, across the country, the memory of a bloody conflict of resources lost in Chile in the 19th century is still alive as well as the desire to go back over the Pacific.
These hopes may not be as strong as they have been for decades as Bolivia is waiting for a court of the International Court of Justice to take place on 1 October following five-year consultations.
"Bolivia has the momentum, a spirit of unity and solidarity and looks forward to the outcome with a positive attitude," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians are following the IGH’s judgment on large screens, hoping that the court in Haag will decide in favour of Bolivia’s demand. According to this, Chile is obliged after decades of sporadic talks to negotiate a sovereign access to Bolivia to the sea.
For Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic Indian presidents, who is in charge of a controversial fight for his re-election next year, the trial on Monday is also very much on the game.
"We are about to return to the Pacific," he said at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe it is unlikely that the court will decide for Bolivia's benefit and believe that this would change little.
The UN-Organ with seating in the Netherlands is not empowered to speak in the Chilean territory and has determined that it is not going to be decided on the outcome of any discussion.
In view of Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert for international law, the IGH's judgment has already been six months after the closing speaker concluded that the case was "not complicated".
Far from supporting the Bolivian case, the last four years could also mean a relapse.
"The present Bolivian government has addressed the issue of access to the sea," Zárate said.
She pointed out that Morales' military rhetoric has attracted every remaining good will of Chile.
Bolivia and Chile will soon continue their discussions, but after these events this will be extremely difficult.
The two countries have not exchanged messages since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltze, Bolivia's representative in the Hague, showed the view that the decision of the Court was unusually early.
On Monday, Bolivia “is an extraordinary opportunity to introduce a new era of relations with Chile” and an opportunity to “prepare for the 139 years of conflict for mutual benefit”, he said.
Calzadilla also argues that Morales – still one of the most popular presidents of Latin America – uses the subject of the sea as a political cross.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to access to peace," he added.
"The trial is an opportunity to realize that we must overcome the past."
North Korea says that nuclear disarmament will only take place if it can trust the United States
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his nation will never break its nuclear weapons unless it can trust Washington.
Ri spoke on Saturday before the General Assembly of the United Nations.
He called on the United States to implement the commitments made in Singapore during a summit between the Heads of State of the Rivalen.
Its statements are coming at a time when US Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo, more than three months after the summit with North Korean state chief Kim Jong-un in Singapore, seems to be in the process of re-establishing the established nuclear diplomacy.
Ri stated that further sanctions and the resistance of the United States against a declaration to end the Korean war would always force the north into the knee as "hungespinst".
Washington is skeptical and would not agree with the statement unless Pjøngjang first takes significant cancellation steps.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second hit.
It is, however, a wide-ranging skepsy that Pjøngjang is seriously concerned with the appearance of an arsenal in which the country is likely to see the only possibility of guaranteeing its safety.
Pompeo plans a visit to Pjøngjang for the next month to prepare a second drop between Kim and Trump.
fashion shops in Paris show the latest collections for huge head coverings that will be first available in the shopping streets near you
If you want to expand your harvest or complete the sun, you must no longer look for it.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne showed on the stage a palette of crazy head coverings for their 2019 summer collection, which fascinated the model world at the Paris fashion week.
Instagrams have been transported in this summer by extremely unprofessional heat, and these designers have sent their magnificent creatures over the course.
The most outstanding piece of Valentino was an extravagant colored hat with a federal wide edge that impressed the heads of the models.
As further over-dimensional accessorys with juwels were shown with watermelons, a sugar cane and even ananas. However, these are not intended to keep the head warm.
In addition, Thom Browne included a number of strange masks – just right on time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks were equipped with tight lipsticks and were more similar to Hannibal Lecter than with Haute Couture.
One creation looked like a shower equipment, including a shower chair and shower glasses, while another looked like a smoldering eyster.
And if you want to set up another huge obituaries, you're lucky.
Mode observers predict that the huge head coverings could find their way into shopping streets near you.
The over-dimensional hills follow directly on "La Bomba", the bridge with a width of 60 cm, which all bear from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label behind the extremely unprofessional hat, which hit the big waves in the social media, sent another great creation over the walkway: a beach bag of electricity, which was almost as large as the model of a bathroom trailer that held the bag.
The bast pocket in red orange with bush francs and a white leather ring was the leading piece of Jacquemus' summer-2019 collection "La Riviera".
Prominent-Stylist Luke Armitage said to FEMAIL: “I estimate that large heat and beach bags will be available for the next summer in the shopping streets. The designer has come so far as to ignore the demand for overdimensional accessories.”
John Edward: Language skills for world citizens
Scotland's independent schools continue to be characterized by academic excellence. This has continued with further outstanding test results in 2018 and is only underpinned by individual and joint success in the areas of sports, art, music and other Community enterprises.
With more than 30,000 students from all over Scotland, these schools represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) strive to trust their students and their parents at the highest possible level.
Independent schools pursue the goal of preparing their students for further education and higher education, the profession of their choice and their place as world citizens.
As a education sector that can design and implement a balanced learning plan, we see that modern languages are still popular and popular in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “When you talk to someone in a language he understands, you reach his head.
If you speak with him in his own language, you will reach his heart."
This is an impressive reminder that we cannot just leave ourselves in English if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
The current test results of this year are that languages with the highest existing quotas are at the top of the ranks of independent schools.
In total, 68 percent of the students who learned foreign languages achieved notes A.
From the data collected by 74 SCIS members, it was noted that 72% of students in Mandarin achieved notes A during higher exams, while 72% of students who learned German, 69% of students who learned French, and 63% of students who learned Spanish also achieved notes A.
This is because independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as important knowledge, which will undoubtedly need children and young people in the future.
Languages today are seen as voters like STEM experts (natural sciences, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the educational plans of independent schools and other places.
According to a survey by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills in 2014, 17 per cent of the reasons for the problems identified by employers in employment in open-ended jobs were related to a lack of language knowledge.
Therefore, language skills are increasingly needed when it comes to preparing young people for their future careers.
As more and more open places require languages, these knowledge is indispensable in a globalized world.
Regardless of the profession chosen, young people who have learned a second language will benefit from such a long life skills in the future.
Directly able to communicate with people from other countries, multi-lingual persons will automatically provide a prioritise to competitors.
According to a YouTube survey of more than 4,000 adults in the United Kingdom in 2013, 75 per cent could not speak a foreign language well enough to conduct a maintenance, and French was spoken as the only language by a double percentage (15 per cent).
For this reason it is important for children today that we invest in language education now.
Children who speak several languages, especially languages from developing countries, will have better opportunities to find meaningful employment.
In Scotland, different languages are taught in all schools.
A number of schools will focus on the most classical modern languages, while other languages will be taught, which will be used with a view to 2020 as the most important for the United Kingdom, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Wherever your child’s interests are always at stake, independent schools will always be chosen by a number of languages with appropriate specialized teaching forces.
Scottish independent schools are committed to creating a learning environment that prepares the children and equips them with the skills necessary for their success, as always the future.
At this point in a global economic area, languages cannot be assumed to be as important as they are for the future of the country. Therefore, this must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should be considered as "international communication capacity".
Independent schools will continue to offer young people in Scotland this choice, variety and excellence.
You have to do it.
John Edward is head of the Scottish Council of Independent School.
LeBron before Lakers Debut on Sunday in San Diego
For fans who want to see how LeBron James responded for the first time to Los Angeles Lakers, the wait has soon ended.
Lakers trainer Luke Walton announced that James will play on Sunday at the opening game of the Preseason against the Denver Nuggetts in San Diego.
How many minutes he'll play, but he's still not fixed.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," said Walton on the official website of Lakers.
The Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James is likely to play only a few minutes.
At the beginning of this week, James was asked after his training plans for the six-game preseason play plan of the Lakers.
"I don't need pre-session games in this phase of my career to prepare me," he said.
Time for Trumps customer service in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is starting a series of election contests tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is the first five of Trump's customers planned for the next week, including well-known places such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
In view of the swirling vote on the confirmation of his election for the Supreme Court holiday, Trump wanted to build support for the leading semi-time units in November, as the Republican risk of losing control over the Congress.
When does Trumps customer service take place in West Virginia tonight, and how can you watch online?
Trumps customer service in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for today, Saturday, September 29, 2018, at 19:00 p.m. (East Coast Time).
You can track Trumps customer service in West Virginia down as livestream online at YouTube.
Trump is likely to address the hearings of the board of Kavanaugh appointed for the Supreme Court on allegations of sexual misconduct that were conducted this week in tense atmosphere. The expected Senate agreement on confirmation remains in the wake for up to one week while the FBI is conducting investigations.
However, the main objective of this customer series is to support Republicans who have to make difficult choices in November.
President Trump's election team therefore pointed out to Reuters that these five customers will serve in the next week “to mobilize volunteers and supporters, while the Republicans are trying to get and build their majority in the Senate and in the House of Representatives”.
"The control of the Congress is so important for its plans that the President will travel to as many states as possible as possible during the current electoral season," said a Trump electoral speaker who did not want to name it against Reuters.
According to West Virginia Metro News, customers from "Ohio and Pennsylvania participate in and report media from Pittsburgh", planned for tonight in Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling.
The visit on Saturday is Trump's second visit to West Virginia, the state he won in 2016 with more than 40 percent points.
Trump is trying to support the Republican Senate candidates from West Virginia, Patrick Morrisey.
"There is no good sign for Morrisey that the President has to come to try to get him involved in the interrogation," said Simon Haeder, politician at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: The U.S. team shows ready to fight to keep the hope for the single on Sunday
After three consecutive rounds, the four parties may have been exactly what this Ryder Cup needed on Saturday.
The moving pendant of the moment is as a sport concept a pure invention, but one that the players really believe in, and this is especially in competitions like this.
Where is the moment of her opinion now?
"They put six points in place, and now there are four, I think it means a little moment for us," Jordan Spieth said when leaving the place.
Europe is of course in advantage and is ahead of four points, while twelve more follow.
However, according to Spieth, the Americans have reason to feel the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who have played all day together and can each present three of four points.
Spieth was inconceivablely strong from the shell to the green and goes forward with a good example.
In the next course of his round, he reduced an important point to decide the fourth match with four points for both after he and Thomas had returned to two holes with two points.
His poet, who decided the match on the 15th floor for her, solved a similar step that concludes that the American team is not out of the game yet.
"I really need to count on myself and take care of my own game," said Spieth.
That's all the individual players still have.
18 spaces to set a character.
Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood have achieved more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days as the only player and, of course, wrote the story of Ryder Cup.
Europe's unique but sympathetic duo is located at four points and can do nothing wrong.
"Moliwood" was not the only couple who didn't hit Bogey on Saturday, but they also avoided on Saturday morning, on Friday afternoon and on the last nine Sunday mornings Bogeys.
This series and the likely amount of energy between them and the released energy suggests that they are the players that will win on Sunday. Fleetwood and Molinari were the most popular players who won a possible European victory during the sunset of the sun over Le Golf National.
By default they both at the same time in different places.
But it would be boring to talk about Europe.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made a short process with Sergio Garcia, the fourth half of the morning that played with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles at the front nine holes brought the Spanish and the Swedish into a shelter that they could not overcome closely.
On Sunday, however, no one can help them from the basement.
The four-to-four couples are given the interaction between the couples, the advice they give or do not give, and the way and how a strategy can change quickly, so fascinating from the vicinity.
The Europeans have played better as a team so far and are clearly in place on the last day. However, this fourth round has also shown that the US team is ready to fight, which some, especially in the United States, have doubted.
Europe goes on the last day of the Ryder Cup with 10:6 in charge
Europe stands after the four and four parties from Saturday to the United States at 10:6 and goes with a solid origin in the last day of Ryder Cup.
The brilliant Duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari went ahead with two victories over the difficult Tiger Woods and was able to cover four points in Le Golf National.
Thomas Björn's European mission, which wanted to win back the trophies lost two years ago in Hazeltine, dominated the four in the morning against the American army playing in the wrong place and won the series with 3:1.
In the four parties, the United States played more resistance and won two matches, but could not stop the retreat.
Jim Furyks Mansion needed eight points in the 12th Sunday playing units to keep the trophies.
Fleetwood won as the first European Neuling four points in consequence, while he and Molinari, who were baptized after a sensitive week of "Mollwood", won only as the second duo in the history of Ryder Cup in their four opening matches.
After they had hit Woods and Patrick Reed in the fours, they were excellently harmonized and beat the stripped woods and the American Newling Bryson Dechambeau with an even more impressive 57-4.
Woods, who had landed by two matches on Saturday, left his brilliantness temporarily, but now 19 of his 29 matches have lost four and four parties and seven consecutive parties.
Justin Rose, who had retired during the four days of the morning, returned and played the four parties as partners of Henrik Stenson. She won 2&1 against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, the number one and three of the world.
For Europe, however, this welcome day in the south-west of Paris did not everything according to its ideas.
The three-time Major Winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the table for the Americans on Saturday with two points.
They achieved a series of 2&1 victorys on the John frame and Ian Poulter playing for Spain and beat Poulter and Rory McIllroy in the four parties after they lost the first two holes.
In the story of Ryder Cup it was only two times that a team came back after it had moved back from four points into the unit. As a title holder, however, it was sufficient for Furyks' team to keep the trophies separate.
After only two days in second place, it doesn't look like they could start an attack on Sunday.
North Korea suffers one-sided breakup without trust around
On Saturday before the United Nations, North Korea's Foreign Minister said that continued sanctions had been imposed against the United States and that under these circumstances the country would not give up its nuclear weapons on its own.
Ri Yong Ho said against the annual General Assembly of the World Organization that North Korea had taken "a major measure of good will" last year." For example, nuclear and rocket tests have stopped building the nuclear test site and committed to not increasing nuclear weapons and technologies.
"We see no corresponding response from the United States," he said.
"Without trust in the United States there is no confidence in our national security, and under these circumstances we will never break one another first."
While Ri confided in North Korean complaints about Washington's resistance to a "phase" approach to nuclearization, which would be rewarded for successful steps in North Korea, his statement seemed to have been inconceivable if it did not allow a unilateral nuclearisation to occur in the past, as Pjung had done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump at the first summit between an ambitious US president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June. In this, Kim had been able to work on the "denuclearization of the Korean peninsula" while Trump Warranty for North Korea's security.
North Korea seeks an official end of the Korean war between 1950 and 1953, while the United States has said that Pjøngjang must surrender its nuclear weapons first.
In addition, Washington's demands are met after a closure of the strict international sanctions against North Korea.
"The United States is on "first nuclearization" and increases pressure by sanctions to achieve its goal by force and are even opposed to the "declaration of war", said Ri.
“The assumption that sanctions can force us into the neck is a brainache of people who don’t know anything about us.
The problem is, however, that the continued sanctions deepen our mystery."
Ri did not go to plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, which the U.S. state capital had highlighted at the beginning of the week at the United Nations.
Instead, the Minister said at three meetings between Kim and South Korean State Chief Moon Jae-in in the last five months: "If South Korea had replaced the other party in the issue of nuclearization, it would not have come to this position at the time of denuclearization of the Korean peninsula."
However, the sound of Ris Rede was quite different from his speech last year when he said it was inevitable to target North Korea rockets at the U.S. party after "the bad president" Trump Kim had named himself "Raketenmann" on his own suicide mission.
This year, a storm that had threatened North Korea in the last year with the “complete destruction” of North Korea hit Kim at the United Nations with praise for his courage to step down. However, he said that there was still much work to do and that the sanctions would remain in force until the nuclearization of North Korea.
On Wednesday, Trump said that he had no timeframe for it: "If it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn't matter."
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council must pay Pjøngjang for the steps taken.
On Thursday, however, US Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo said to the UN Security Council: "The implementation of the sanctions of the Security Council must in any case be continued energeticly until we have achieved complete, complete and verifiable denuclearization."
Since 2006, the Security Council has strengthened its sanctions against North Korea in a unanimous manner in order to financialize Pjøng's nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles programmes.
Pompeo met Ri at the end of the UN General Assembly and then said he was going to visit Pjøngjang again in the next month to prepare a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip was not successful.
In July he said in his departure from Pjøngjang that progress had been made only to be charged only hours later by North Korea, he had “gang-like requirements”.
North Korea managed to build this month at a meeting with Moon, rocket base and a nuclear complex when the United States took "relevant measures".
He said Kim told him that the "conforming measures" sought were security assurances that had been given by the trumpet in Singapore, as well as steps to normalise the relationship with Washington.
Harvard students learn in a course to sleep enough
A new course at Harvard University ensures that all students get more sleep in this year's basic study. This is a measure against the widespread macho culture to stay awake with caffeine and learn about it all night.
A scientist has found that students at the world’s leading university are often unnecessary when it comes to taking care of themselves.
The course was designed by Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, and is considered to be the first such course in the United States.
He was inspired to call on the course in life after he held a speech on the effects of sleep deprivation on the learning.
“At the end a girl came to me and asked, ‘Why do I experience this first in my last year?’
According to her words, no one had ever told her how important it is to sleep. That surprised me," he said against The Telegraph.
This year's course first explained to the students how the foundations of good sleep habits contribute to academic and sports performance and also improve overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and the director of the University’s health services, said that the university had decided to introduce the course after she had determined that students were suffering from severe sleep deprivation during the week.
The one-hour course includes a number of interactive tasks.
In a section, the students see the picture of a room in a home and click on coffee dishes, panties, training shoes and books. They receive information about the effect of coffee and light as well as the effects of sleeplessness on the sport performance and the importance of a sleeping routine.
In another section, the participants learn that longer sleep pressure can increase the risk of heart failure, stroke and cancer.
Next, they are invited to think about their daily routine with an interactive map of the university's field.
“We know that the students’ behaviour will not be changed immediately.
But we believe they have the right to know this – exactly how you have the right to know how the decision to smoke affects your health," added Professor Czeisler.
The pride in having a "nightboard" still spread, he said and added that modern technologies and the constant growing pressure on students make sleep deprivation a growing problem.
In order to ensure adequate sleep, he said that the “heavy weapons” of all students should be against stress, creation and anxiety. Furthermore, a weight loss was avoided as sleep deprivation placed the brain in the hungry mode so that they would be hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old student from California, studying chemical and physical biology, half Professor Czeisler, had completed his course last year in Harvard.
He said that the course had opened his eyes and responded to him to pressure him into a university course.
He hopes that the next step will require all postgraduate students to complete a similar study program before they will take their studies at the competitive university.
Following the recommendation of Professor Czeisler, students should set up a week for sleep and wake hours and be aware of the harmful effects of the "blue light" that are derived from electronic screens and LED lighting and can bring the zirkadian rhythm out of the act. This leads to problems when sleeping.
Livington v. Rangers 1:0: Menga-Tor wins Gerards Player
The Rangers lose another challenge when the encounter of Dolly Menga for Steven Gerards meant a 0:1 downplay at Livingstone.
The Ibrox team wanted to hide its first appearance from the 4.1-triumph at St. Johnstone, but Gary Holts team added the first second downset in 18 games as manager, so that his team returned eight points behind the hearts leading away in the Ladbroke Premiership.
Menga met seven minutes before the half-time, and the inspirational arms of Ranger seemed to have no chance of equalizing.
While the Rangers now fall to the sixth place, Livingston rises to the third place and is only behind Hibernian.
In addition, the Rangers are further concerned that after liner Callum Spence had to be treated for a headache by an object that appeared to have been fired from the guest block.
Gerrard made eight changes to the crew, took over the Air and reached the semi-final of the Betfred Cup.
On the other hand, the same 11 Livingston players who took off their hearts in the last week had to be eager to see how his well-trained team kept their opponents step and stand under pressure.
The Rangers dominated the ball, but Livingston achieved more when they had the ball.
In just two minutes, they were supposed to reach a tower when Mengas led Scott Pittman first to Allan McGregors Tower. However, the middle-field player missed his chance and shot him.
Then came a long break from Keaghan Jacobs to Captain Craig Halkett, but his vice-president Alan Lithgow was able to pass only on the back.
The Rangers took control, but their game proved to be more promising in the last third.
Alfredo Morelos was apparently the opinion that after a quarter hour he should have received a sentence between him and Steven Lawless, but Judge Steven Thomson did not let the Colombian complaints go.
The Rangers arrived in the first half of the year only two rounds, but the former Ibrox Towerer Liam Kelly had few difficulties with Lassana Coulibalys headball and a sharp shot by Ovie Ejaria.
Although Livingstons met in the 34th. Maybe not even agreed to the game course, it is not to lie that they had earned him for his hard work alone.
Again, the Rangers could not handle a long shot ball with one of Jacobs in a standard situation.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher threw the ball into Scott Robinson, who kept the calm and sought Menga for a simple conclusion.
Gerrard dealt for half-time and exchanged Coulibaly against Ryan Kent. The change showed almost immediate effect when the flight player Morelos took his position, but the impressive Kelly jumped out of his line to block the ball.
Livingston, however, continued to bring the guests to play exactly the game they were in, where Lithgow and Halkett got a long ball after the other.
Holt's crew had been able to build their leadership in the last phase, but McGregor stood well and held Jacobs out before Lithgow took a headball from the corner.
The Ranger exchanger Glenn Middleton also requested a punishment after a gathering with Jacobs, but Thomson saw again.
Almanach: The Founder of the Gegergerger
And now a page from our "Sunday Morning" German: on September 30, 1882, today 136 years ago, the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that ultimately led to the device known as the enemy.
The gay historian who has become the standard element of science has also become a standard element of pop culture, for example in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado" with the seemingly unusual Cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What is this in all the world?"
Rogers: “This is a geologist used to search for radioactive minerals such as uranium.
If you set up these headphones, you can hear the effects of radioactive radiation in the minerals."
Evans: "Really, I hear a knock!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63rd birthday.
However, the invention that bears his name continues to exist.
New cancer can cause the immune system to "see" developed cells
A new cancer vaccine can cause the immune system to "see" and destroy damaged cells.
The vaccine contributes to the immune system’s recognition of delayed cells as part of its treatment.
A patient's immune cells that are changed in the laboratory are excluded from the method.
These cells can “see” a number of cancer types of joint protein and are then re-injected.
A test substance shows many promising results in patients with different cancer types.
A woman who was treated with the vaccine, who brings the immune system into contact with developed cells, disappeared for more than 18 months.
A patient's immune cells are removed from the method, which is changed in the laboratory so that they can "see the many types of cancer common to HER2". The cells are then re-injected.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results are to conclude that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "promoting the growth of various types of cancers", including breast, eggstock, lungen-and-darm cancer, as Professor Berzofsky explained.
A similar method, which is taken out of the patients ’ immune cells and is assisted by cancer cells, has helped treat a leukemia.
Kanye West released a pro-trump Tirade following his encounter with SNL and carried a MAGA head (‘Make America Great Again’).
It wasn't good.
Kanye West was released at Saturday Night Live in the studio after he had awarded US President Donald Trump a large prize and said he wanted to become presidential candidate in 2020.
After his third title of the evening, "Ghost Town", he said and carried on a make-american Great Again head, he continued his support for the democracies with a shipbuilding canon.
“I’ll be asked so often by white, ‘How can you like Trump? He’s racist.’
So if I were to worry about racism, I would have left America a long time ago," he said.
SNL started sending with a sketch with Matt Damon, where Hollywoodstar made himself funny about Brett Kavanaugh's statement before the Senate's justice committee on charges of sexual harassment raised by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although the registration of West's shipyard has not been sent, it was uploaded by comedian Chris Rock in social media.
It is not clear whether Rock wanted to make fun of the publication over the West.
In addition, West complained to the public that he had difficulties behind the stage because of his head covering.
“They sent me behind the stage.
They said, "Don't go out with the hat."
You've given me a kiss!
And then they say I'm in a weakened area," he said according to the Washington Examiner.
What continues: "Do you want to see the missed area?" He said he would "take my Supermancape because it means you can't tell me what to do. Do you want it to go on with the world?
Try it with love."
At least two letters were released from the public, and SNL-interactors were deeply affected, reported variation. One person said in the magazine: "It was killed in the studio."

The Talkshow Moderator Karen Hunter, however, tweeted, West was simply himself and that was absolutely wonderful.
“But I would like to pay no reward to anyone who, in my opinion, makes himself an evil ideology for my community (when I buy his music or his clothes or support his art).
He's free.
The same applies to us." She added.
Before the shipment, the rapper had announced at Twitter that he had changed his name and now "The being formally known as Kanye West" (The officially known as Kanye West) was.
He is not the first artist to change his name, and follows the steps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.

"Game of Thrones" Star Kit Harington attacks toxic humanity
Kit Harrington is known for his role as the sword of violent Jon Snow in HBOs, a medieval fantasy series "Game of Thrones".
The 31-year-old actor, however, attacked the stereotype of the machoheld. He said that such roles on the screen had often had to be strong to be respected.
Speaking with "The Sunday Times Culture", Harington said that he believed there was something going on and asked how to solve the problem of toxic humanity in the #MeToo age.
Harington, who recently married Rose Leslie, also involved in "Game of Thrones", said that he was "very important" in solving the problem.
“I personally find the issue very important at present, what is wrong with humanity,” he said.
"What have we grown up with regard to the problem we are now seeing?"
Harrington believes that television is responsible for increasing toxic masculinity because of the very male character.
He continued: “What has been born, and what has been learned?
What is taught on television and on the street that the young man has the feeling that this particular side of a man has to correlate?
I think this is really one of the big questions of our time: How do we change this?
For there is certainly something wrong with the young men."
He also said in the interview that after the end of the series in the next summer he would not participate in Prequels or Sequels of “Game of Thrones”. He had “a lot of fields and horses”.
From November, Harington is seen in a new flag by Sam Shepards "True West", the story of a film producer and his brother, a rapist.
The actor recently complained that for him the best of "Game of Thrones" was that he knew his wife Rose.
“I have learned my wife about this mission, so I have thus received my future family and my life from now on,” he said.
Rose Leslie played in the fantastic series Ygrette with numerous emmys, the favorite of Harington's character Jon Snow.
In June 2018, the two married Leslies Family West in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reported 14% increase in new cases
China has reported an increase of 14°% in the number of people living with HIV or AIDS.
According to health officials, more than 820,000 people are affected in the country.
About 40,000 new cases were reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
In contrast to the past, the transfer occurred in the vast majority of the new cases of sexual trafficking.
Until then, HIV spread rapidly in some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people infected with HIV this way was almost zero, and Chinese health officials attended a conference in the province of Yunnan.
However, by year the number of people living with HIV and AIDS has increased by 100,000 in China.
HIV transmission through sex trafficking is an acute problem in China's LGBT community.
Homosexuality was outlawed in China in 1997, but discrimination against members of the LGBT community should be widespread.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men eventually married women.
Many of the disease transmissions are due to insufficient protection in the area of sexual trafficking in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese Government has promised, inter alia, general access to HIV medicines to address the problem.
Maxine Waters argues that employees have provided the data of the GOP senators, criticises "hazardous lies" and "preventory theories"
Maxine Waters, a member of the U.S. House of Representatives, fought charges on Saturday, a member of her staff published the personal information of three Republican US senators on the Wikipedia pages of the delegates.
The Democrat from Los Angeles is of the opinion that the allegations of "extremely justified" experts and websites would be disseminated.
"Talking, lying and even more absurd lies," said Waters in a statement on Twitter.
The published information should include the private addresses and telephone numbers of the US Senator Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday. It was published during the hearing of a Senate Committee against the Supreme Court candidates Brett Kavanaugh raised allegations of sexual misconduct by an unknown person in the government district.
The publication took place after the three senators had asked Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the contributions was allocated to Waters’ Office and published information from a member of Waters’ Staff, reported The Hill.
"This unfounded charge is completely false and absolutely false," said Waters.
“The member of my staff – whose identity, personal data and security were threatened by these fraudulent and false accusations – was not responsible for ensuring that this information was delivered.
This unfounded charge is completely false and absolutely false."
Waters’ statement quickly solved criticism online, also by Ari Flescher, a former press speaker of the White House.
"This dementia is exciting," wrote Flescher.
“This may conclude that she does not have the right temperature to be a congressman.
Those who are accused of something they have not done must not be ignorant.
You mustn't be sad.
You can't question the complainant's motives.
You must be calm and let go."
More like Waters’ reaction to the criticism of the Democrats to Justice Kavanaugh, who was accused of critics while listening to Thursday.
Also, Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who intervened at the half-time tables to solve water, expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
"Great thing if that's true," he tweeted.
Waters said in her statement that her office had informed the competent authorities and the prosecution authorities of these fraudulent charges.
"We will ensure that the aunts are covered," she continued, "and that they are taken to account for all their actions which are destructive and dangerous for all members of my staff."
Critics on "Johnny English – Man only lives three times" – weak spy parody with Rowan Atkinson
Meanwhile, it is a tradition to look for a new film in every colored British film for Brexit. It also seems to be to apply for this re-enactment of the "Johnny English" event, which started in 2003 with "Johnny English – The Spion who created it" and was re-examined in 2011 with "Johnny English – Now Right".
Will an Iranian self-sustainment be a new export opportunity for the nation, as we are obviously visiting?
In any case, the license of the glaucoma, grimasing and incompetenced Johnny English has been extended for the second time. His name indicates more than anything else that it is a general comical creation for cinema visitors in non-English.
Of course, he is again the busy secret agent who stands out for cool and worldly, while actually from something close, a prize Mr. Bean and a bell of this burschen that has contributed a single note to the title music of "The Hour of the winner" in London at the opening of the 2012 Olympic Games in London.
In addition, the figure was originally based on the chaos behind returning travelers and international secretaries who played the Atkinson in the forgotten Barclaycard TV series.
The last adventure of Johnny English has one or two net moments.
I liked how Johnny English approached a hopper in an medieval fashion and quickly pointed the rotor leaves at his helmet.
Atkinson's approach to physical comics has grown, but the Humor seems very weak and rarely overfishing, especially since the "serious" series such as "007" and "Mission Impossible" are also offered among themselves.
The humor seems to be more directed to children than to adults, and for me, Johnny English's crazy misses are not as simple and focused as Atkinson's stem film gangs in the role of the Bean.
The eternal present premise is now that Britain is in great danger.
A cyber hacker has infiltrated the supersecret British spy network and includes the identities of all British agents in use, very much for the failure of the service agent, a unfortunately small role for Kevin Eldon.
This is the last strike for the Prime Minister, a blasted and complicated figure that is already due to her political indifference before the complete collapse: Emma Thompson has this Quasi-Teresa-May character, but the script is not much there to work with.
Your secret service consultants inform them that all active spies have been removed and therefore they must get someone out of the house.
This is also part of Johnny English himself, who now works as a teacher at a post office, but has informal teaching at work as a subcontractor. There are a few gags, because English offers a school of Rock, which reminds us of the Spionage Academy.
English will be brought back to a emergency conversation in Whitehall and regrouped with his former hard-tested Kampang Bough, which will be played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to an U-boot commander, a nervous woman of the higher society in whose role Vicki Pepperdine has something to do with.
So Batman and Robin, who are always doing everything awfully wrong in your Majesty's Secret Service, are back in action. They meet Olga Kurylenkos beautiful woman Fate Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is at risk in the band of a charismatic tech billionaire, played by Jake Lacy, who claims to be able to solve the computer problems of Britain.
English and Bough start their Odyssee of the big stage: As Keller dressed they close a French restaurant in Brand, they care for Chaos when they smile on Voltas luxury boat, and English solves clean anarchy when he tries to build trust in a virtual reality headset with the interior of Voltas house.
In this last sequence, although all registers are drawn, but so sympathetic and funny they are, the subject is already dealt with in detail on children’s television.
A rather moderate substance.
As with other Johnny English films, I had to ask myself, "Can the British film branche Rowan Atkinson not play a role that will really justify his talent?"
Work seeks to work on a plan after which the British work four days a week, but they should be paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyns Labour Party is going to consider a radical plan that provides for the British to work four days a week, but will be paid for five days.
The Party wishes to report that business leaders will continue to provide savings achieved by the KI revolution (artificial intelligence) in the form of an additional free day for workers.
This would have made the employees a three-day weekend, but they would still receive the same payment.
According to sources, the idea of the Party's economic agenda and its plans to move the country's balance in favour of workers.
The conversion to a four-day week was sponsored by the Trades Union Congress (Trades Congress) as an opportunity for workers to benefit from the changing economy.
A high - ranking source from the Labour Party said to the Sunday Times: “It is expected that a review of the directive will be announced before the end of the year.
"A change will not take place at night, but a work week of four days is an attempt to restore the economic balance of workers and the general industrial strategy of the party."
The Labour Party would not be the first party to challenge such an idea. The Green Party has already promised during the general election campaign 2017 to introduce a 4-day week.
However, at present the approach is not endorsed by the Labour Party at all.
A speaker from the Labour Party said: "At a 4-day week it is not a party policy and it will not be taken into account by the party."
Schatten Chancellor John McDonnell concreteized his idea of a socialist revolution in the economy last week at the Labour Conference.
McDonnel said he was determined to regain the power of "anonymous directors" and "profitmakers" in public supply companies.
The plans of the Shadow Chancellor also mean that the current shareholders of water supply companies may not be able to repay their total share, as a labor government could take over a "debt" due to joint misconduct.
He also confirmed the respective plans to hire employees in the management of companies and to set up inclusive ownership funds to transfer 10% of private companies’ equity to employees who pay annual dividends of up to 500 cents.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy are out in the news magazine "60 minutes" whether the FBI's investigation in the Kavanaugh case could change their opinion
The FBI investigation into the cases against Justice Brett Kavanaugh has a final vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court of Justice for at least one week and raises the question of whether the results of the authorities could affect Republican senators in order to win their support.
In an interview on Sunday, the 60-minute correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could bring some days to change their opinion.
Kennedy seemed more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
"I am, of course," said Kennedy.
“I have announced in the negotiations that I have spoken with Judge Kavanaugh.
I then called him, this charge was made public, and asked if he had done it.
He was determined, determined and unintelligent."
Graham's voice, however, seems to be mixed in stone.
"My opinion is what Brett Kavanaugh is about, and it had to place a bomb," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what's going on, but I know what's going on here: Board has fought this thing," Graham added, adding: "I don't know what's going on, but I know what's going on."
"And all they called were unable to confirm."
It's 36 years now.
And I can't make any changes."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and was contributed to reducing poverty in this festival?
On this Saturday in New York, the Global Citizen Festival will take place to combat poverty in the world with an impressive lineup of stars and a similar impressive mission.
Tens of thousands will visit the Global Citizen Festival, which takes place this year 7 times, not only to experience the events of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to increase awareness of the actual purpose of the event: the fight against extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which took place for the first time in 2012, is an expansion of the Global Poverty Project. Within this project an international interest group is trying to combat poverty by encouraging more and more people to participate actively in the fight against poverty.
To get a free ticket for the event (the other option would be to buy a VIP ticket), you must complete a number of tasks. These include voluntary work, communication with a leading politician worldwide (by e-mail or telephone) or similar measures to raise awareness of the goal – the fight against poverty.
How successful is the project if you think that global citizens are still 12 years old to achieve the goal?
Is it the idea to look at a cool free concert, to convince others that it is time to trade, or just another case of so-called clickivism – if it is the idea to change something by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Global Citizen shared that the project has been able to record more than 19 million actions by its supporters since 2011.
These actions should have contributed to attracting leading politicians from all over the world, announcing commitments and strategies worth more than $37 billion, which will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the Group quoted 390 commitments and announcements resulting from its actions, of which at least $10 billion had already been paid or received by fundraising.
According to estimates from the group, the guaranteed resources have so far directly affected nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the most important commitments include the project The Power of Nutrition, a partnership of investors and implementing staff in the United Kingdom who have committed themselves to supporting children in their optimal development and who have promised to help Rwanda with $35 million in combating food in the country after having received more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
“With the support of the Government of the United Kingdom, donors, national governments and global citizens as well as you, we can make social injustice of food a stumbling block in history,” the messenger of The Power of Nutrition, Tracey Ullman, told the audience during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The Group also shared that, after more than 5,000 actions by which Britain was invited to improve the food situation of mothers and children, the government announced the financing of the The Power of Nutrition project, which should reach 5 million women and children and provide food interventions.
As an answer to one of the frequently asked questions on the website, namely the question why Global Citizens can fight extreme poverty,
they replied: “It will be a long and hard way with heights and depth.
But like the great civil rights and anti-apartite movements before us, we will succeed because we are stronger and more influential together.
Janet Jackson, the weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monée are among the artists who take part in this year's event in New York. These include Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman as moderators.
The US could use the sea for blockage purposes to prevent Russian energy exports – Ministry of the Interior
According to Washington exam, Washington can go back to the sea if necessary so that the markets, including the Middle East, do not reach the markets, shared by US Interior Minister Ryan Zinke.
Zinke claimed that the use of Russia in Syria is a prerequisite for exploring new energy markets. Russia is currently active at the invitation of the legitimate government in these areas.
"I think that the real reason for the use of Russia in the Middle East is the sale of new energy stock markets, just like in Eastern Europe," he said.
And according to the officer, there are means and ways to do this.
"The United States, together with the sea, can ensure that the coastal regions remain open and, if necessary, block them in order to ensure that the energy from Russia does not reach the market," he shared.
Zinke turned to the participants of the Consumer Energy Alliance event, a non-profit group that understands itself as "the voice of electricity consumers" in the United States.
He drew a comparison between Washington's approach to Russia and Iran and pointed out that they are practically identical.
"The use and replacement of fuels is more or less the economic option in Iran and Russia," he said, while he named Russia as "One Trick Pony" with a fossil-dependent economy.
The statements were made when the government was under pressure to extend the export of liquid gas to Europe and to replace Russia with a much more cost-effective option for consumers in Europe.
For this purpose, government officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the “unsuitable” pipeline project Nord Stream 2, which, according to Trump Berlin, became “Gefengan” Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that it is at the North Stream 2-Pipeline at the value of 11 billion US dollars, which will double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic metres in order to be an exclusive economic project.
The Kremlin argues that the massive opposition of Washington against the project is to be brought back on economic grounds and is an example of unfair competition.
"I think we are all of the opinion that energy should not be used as a means of printing and that consumers can choose suppliers themselves," said Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak after a meeting with U.S. Energy Minister Rick Perry in September in Moscow.
The United States has received wind from Germany which has confirmed its commitment to the project.
The German Industrial Organisation, the Federal Federation of German Industries (BDI), has called on the United States to withdraw from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"It is a big problem when a third country is involved in our energy supply," said BDI Dieter's board after a meeting between Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren wants a presidential candidate for 2020 "examine exactly," says the Senator for Massachusetts
The Senator for Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren announced on Saturday that she would "check exactly" a presidential candidate after the inter-election.
During a city-hall meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, they confirmed that they were considering a candidate.
According to The Hill, it would be time for women to go to Washington and repair our captivating government, and that includes women at the top.
Warren is planning to "check exactly" a presidential candidate after 6 November.
Warren said during the meeting that President Trump was leading this country in the wrong direction.
"I am very concerned about how Donald Trump deals with our democracy," she said.
Warren took no note of Donald Trump and Brett Kavanaugh, a candidate for the Supreme Court.
In a tweet on Friday she announced that, of course, an FBI investigation is needed before the vote.
However, a survey published on Thursday showed that most of the Warren elections do not believe that they should apply for 2020.
According to the survey of Suffolk University Political Research Center and Boston Globe, 58 percent of the potential voters in Massachusetts indicated that the senator should not run.
32% of the voters supported such a candidate.
The survey showed more support for a candidate of former Governor Deval Patrick; with 38 per cent who threatened a potential candidate, and 48 per cent who were against it.
The other names of prominent Democrats who come into question on a possible candidate for 2020 include former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Vermont, Bernie Sanders.
According to Associated Press, he said he would decide officially by January.
Sarah Palin is on Donald Trump-Ralley for post-traumatic stress disorder under the track Palin
Track Palin, 26, was a long year in Iraq.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence on Monday evening.
“What did my son do what he did when he came back, that all of this could be felt by other families who were inspired by the effects of PTBS and some of the wounds with which our soldiers returned”, she shared with the public at a rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin referred to his detention as “Elefant in space” and said about her son and other war veterans that she changed to return that she would be fired and asked if there was any respect for what other soldiers and pilots and any other member of the military had given to the country.
On Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, he was arrested and charged with domestic violence against a woman, so Dan Bennett, a spokesman from the police department of Wasilla.
18 The United States and D.C. support legal aid for the new asylum policy
18 The United States and the District of Colombia support a legal aid to the new US policy to avoid victims of gang activities or domestic violence Asyl.
Representatives of the 18 United States and the District have a court-martial statement on Friday in Washington to support an asylum seeker who is involved in politics, reported NBC News.
The full name of the complainant in the Grace vs. session complaint filed by the American Civil Liberties Union against the Federal Policy in August was not known.
She shared that her partner "and her violent gangs" did not use them, but U.S. officers rejected her asylum application on July 20th.
She was arrested in Texas.
The state attorneys, who support Grace, named El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, where many people apply for asylum in the United States as nations that have great problems with criminal gangs and domestic violence.
The new US asylum policy launched a 2014 Board of Immigrant Appeals decision allowing illegal immigrants to apply for asylum in the face of domestic violence.
The General Bundesanalt of the District of Colombia, Karl Racine, stated in a statement on Friday that the new policy "has been ignored at the national, federal and international levels for decades of legislation".
‘The Federal Act stipulates that all asylum applications are assessed on the basis of the facts and circumstances of the application and that the court contravenes this principle’ was stated in the judgment.
The lawyers further argued in the statement that the policy that immigrants avoid access to the country has an adverse impact on the economy in the United States, since immigrants could be more active than entrepreneurs and could provide the necessary labour force.
In June, General Bundesanwalt Jeff's session ordered that immigration victims fleeing from domestic violence and the violence of criminal gangs should no longer provide asylum.
“Asyl is available to all who leave their home country because they are persecuted or afraid because of race, religion, nationality or belonging to a certain social group or political conviction”, said the session in its announcement of the policy of 11 June.
It was never the plan to eliminate all the problems by giving Asyl, even all the most serious problems that people have to deal with every day in the world.
Double survival tests in Palu, since the number of victims in the race doubled with time
For the survivors, the situation was getting worse.
"It's all very exciting," says 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma and calms her little fiendish son in a rescue center in the devastated city of Palu.
“Every minute a new hospital car comes with deaths.
The clean drinking water is almost."
The people returned to their ruined houses to collect their riches and God's wealth and possessions and to set up whatever they could find.
Hundreds were injured, and the hospital staff who were injured by the earthquake with 7.5 force were completely overloaded.
Some of the injured, including Two Haris, who had a stroke and a broken shoulder, remained outside Palu's military hospital, where patients were treated in the outback due to the persistent seizures.
With tears in his eyes, he told how the heavy earthquake shook the hotel room on the fifth floor, which he shared with his wife and daughter.
“All went too fast.
I think I was trapped under the fallen walls," he reported to the Associated Press, adding that the reason for the city's stay was a long time.
“I heard my wife’s cry for help, but then it was calm.
I don't know what's going on with my wife and my child.
I can only hope they're in a safe place."
US messenger China of the Tyranee complains about "Propagandism"
A week after an official Chinese newspaper had turned up a four-page display in an American daily newspaper where the opposite benefits of trade between the United States and China were announced, the US messenger in China accused Beijing of using US press for propaganda purposes.
The United States Donald Trump spoke last Wednesday about the paid contribution of China Daily to the Moine Register, the most sold magazine in Iowa, after he accused China of joining the US Congress elections on November 6, a complaint against China.
Trump's allegations that Beijing has tried to join the US elections are in line with the US officials' message to Reuters; a new phase of a scaling campaign, released by Washington, U.S.A., to exercise pressure on China.
While it is common for foreign governments to launch advertising campaigns to promote the economy, Beijing and Washington are currently developing into an emerging trade war with tariffs on imports for both countries.
China's debt of compensation at the beginning of the trade war should be met by exporters in such countries as Iowa, which supported the Republican party of Trump, said Chinese and US experts.
Terry Branstad, US messenger in China and former governor of Iowa, who exports large-scale agricultural products to China, shared that Beijing has been damaged by workers, owners of agricultural companies and companies.
China, as a brand city in a poll in the Des Moines Register of Sunday, now doubles this tyranney by opening propaganda in its own free press in the United States.
“With the spread of its propaganda, the Chinese government is demanding the tradition of free expression and independent press in America by turning the country's paid advertising into the Moine Register,” says Branstad.
“On the contrary, you will find in Beijing the news media only in a limited number of votes and no real reflection of the different opinions that the Chinese might have about the disturbing economic development of China, given the fact that the media are firmly in the hands of the Chinese Communist Party.”
He added that one of the most famous newspapers in China did not accept the offer to publish his article. However, he did not mention the name of the newspaper.
Republicans spread voters before the inter-elections with the debakel about Kavanaugh, warned observers
Since many of the most influential Republicans support and defend the candidates for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, in view of more allegations of sexual violence, observers have warned of a reaction during the previous inter-elections, which could lead to women in particular.
The vote in this connection was extremely intense, and most Republicans have already stated that they continue to vote.
"You can't make such things come back," said Grant Reeher, professor of political science at Maxwell School of the Syracuse University The Hill for a published article on Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted that the last minute advance of Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) was sufficient for an FBI investigation to deal with hardened voters.
“Women didn’t forget what was yesterday, they didn’t forget it in the morning and not even in November”, said Karine Jean-Pierre, first consultant and national speaker for the progressive group MoveOn, so the daily newspaper in Washington, D.C.
On Friday morning, demonstrators called in the hall of the Senate "November is coming!" when the Republicans who control the Justice Committee decided to hold the appointment of Kavanaughs and despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's statement, told Mic.
Democracy's desire and motivation are an extremely important topic, shared by Stu Rothenberg, an unparticipated political observer of the news site.
“People say it’s already high, that’s true.
But it could be higher, especially for voters in the outlying areas and for young voters, people between 18 and 29, who, although they do not like the presidents, often do not choose."
Even before the public statement of Ford, in which its allegations of sexual assault are detailed against the candidates of the Supreme Court, observers stated that an objection could be followed if the Republicans gave confirmation.
"This situation is a challenge to the GOP," said Michael Steele, former president of the Republican National Committee, at the beginning of the last week.
"It is not only about the vote of the summit, the final vote or the review of Kavanaughs; it is also about the way the Republicans have dealt with it and how they have dealt with it," said Guy Cecil, Director of US Priorities, a group that supports the election of Democrats with the news channel.
The Americans, however, seem to be the only one they should believe in because of Ford and Kavanaugh's statements, with a somewhat larger share of the latter.
A new survey by YouGov showed that 41% of the respondents were convinced definitively or probably by Ford’s statement, while 35% indicated that they definitely or probably gave Kavanaugh beliefs.
38 % further indicated that they were of the opinion that Kavanaugh was likely or definitively present at his statement, while 30% said the same about Ford.
Following the pressure from Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations made by Ford and at least one other complainant, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Ford made a final statement last week before the Senate's Justice Committee that she was attacked by the drunk Kavanaugh at the age of 17.
Ramirez claimed that the candidate for the Supreme Court had betrayed her genitals against her when she was at a party during her study time in Yale in the 1980s.
The discoverer of the World Wide Web plans the launch of a new Internet to oppose Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is currently making a start on the market with the aim of establishing a competition for Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of technology-based, integrated, is a company based on the open source platform solid by Berners-Lee.
Solid allows users to choose where their data are stored and who access the information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee gave the best that the idea behind intrusion was the "World Heritage".
"We must be active now," he said on the issue of startup.
"It's a historic moment."
The app introduces the technology of Solid so that users can create their own personal online data memory or a POD.
It can include contact lists, task lists, a calendar, a music library and other tools for the private and business sector.
Like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify all content in a browser and at the same time available.
The particular feature of the personal online data storage is that the user can only decide on which data to access.
The company refers to this concept as personal strengthening and development of data.
According to CEO of company John Bruce, the idea behind it is that the company uses resources, processes and related capabilities so that solid is available for all.
The company is currently part of Berners-Lee, Bruce, some of the developers who have been set up to work on this project, as well as a community of volunteers programmers. A safety platform acquired from IBM will continue to be used.
At the beginning of this week, technology developers can create their own decentralised apps worldwide with the tools available on the Inupput website.
Berners-Lee shared that he and his team will not exchange with Facebook and Google whether a comprehensive change is to be made when their entire business models are fully redesigned over the night.
"We do not ask for their permission."
In an article on media published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that intrusion has the task of providing commercial energy generation and an ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of the new, solid-based web.
In 1994, Berners Lee provided for a redesign of the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Over the past few months, Berners-Lee has been involved in the debate on network neutrality.
The founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute remain even with the launch of Inrupt.
"I am extremely confident of what this new era of the web involves," he added.
Priest Bernard Vann, holder of the Victoria Cross in World War I, was honored
The only clergy of the Church of England, who had been awarded the Victorian Cross during World War I, was respected in his home city 100 years later.
Captain and priest Bernard Vann won the award due to his use in the attack on Bellengles and Lehacourt on September 29, 1918.
However, he was killed four days later by a guard and has never experienced that he had won the highest British warship.
His two singles included a monument on Sunday at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of the singles, Michael Vann, believed that this act was full of symbolism, since the monument was buried exactly 100 years after the Helentat, for which his grandfather was honored.
According to The London Gazette, Colonel Vann led his battalion on the Canal de Saint-Quentin on September 29, 1918; through close nebula and under strict command of field cannons and machine guns.
Later, he stepped forward to the fireline and led the line with the "largest trapping" before he turned off a field weapon at all and three of the military units.
Captain Vann was shot by a German guard on October 4, 1918; something more than a month before the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said that the deeds of his grandfather were something he could never be justified, and at the same time something that would be allowed to happen.
Together with his brother Dr. James Vann, he laid down a kranz under the parade under the direction of the Brentwood Imperial Youth band.
Michael Vann noted that he felt very proud to be able to participate in the parade, and added that the vulnerability of a real hero would be particularly visible through the support of many people.
MMA fans have been awake all night to see Bellator 206, instead there was Peppa Pig
Imagine you've been awake all night to see a exciting bellator 206, and then you can't see the main vent.
San Jose's account included 13 battles, including 6 on the main map, and live was spent all night in the United Kingdom on channel 5.
At 6 o'clock, just as Gegard Musasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for their fight, the observers in the United Kingdom did not stop bad to see Peppa Pig immediately.
Some remain unattended after staying awake until early in the morning to see the fight in particular.
A fan described on Twitter the change to the trick film figure as some kind of bad joke.
"Because of a government arrangement, these content is not intended for youth free, so that at 6 p.m. they must be changed to a child's consignment," said Dave Schwartz, Senior Vice President in the area of marketing and communication at Bellator when he was asked about the transfer.
"Peppa, the Sweeney, exactly."
The company's president at Bellator, Scott Cooker, shared that the company will be working on the run-up plan to take into account future observers from the United Kingdom.
"I think the problem could already be solved in the game of recovery," he said.
"But it's 6 a.m. on a Sunday day with observers in the United Kingdom, and we won't solve the case until Sunday our time, Monday.
But we're stuck.
There was a lot of communication in the exchange. It went very well together and it wasn't always very net.
We have tried to solve the problem and have concluded that it is a technical obstacle.
Which wasn't the case, it was a problem since the government.
I promise it won't happen again.
We're going to reduce everything to 5 instead of 6 battles, as usual, and we've tried to offer the fans the best possible experiences.
The whole situation is quite sad."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley feels about sex
Tom Daley, who participated as a water runner in various Olympic games, says that he grew up with the feeling to be subject to everyone else because of his sexuality. But this feeling had motivated him to be so successful.
The 24-year-old thought that he had only realized at the continuing school that he was different than others.
In the first radio 4 Desert Island Discs with Lauren Laverne, he said he spoke about school rights to encourage others.
He also meant that since he became a father, the victorys in the Olympic Games are no longer so important to him.
The real moderator of the long-term show, Kirsty Young, is in a state of illness for several months.
In Laverne's first mission, he said that he considered himself to be less valuable than others, since love for boys and girls was completely unacceptable.
He said: "To this day it is the feeling of subjection to others and of being different from others, the reason for my power and strength and finally for my success."
He wanted to prove that he was a very special person to disappoint anyone when his sexual orientation was known.
The two-fold bronze medal winner in the Olympic Games is a prominent LGBT activist today and used his performance at the annual Commonwealth Games in Australia to promote the decriminalization of homosexuality in other countries.
He said that he had made a statement on this subject because he was happy that he could live without restrictions and discrimination and wanted to make other courage.
The three-time World Master fell in love with the US filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013. The realization of being in love with a man was an absolute surprise for him.
Darley married Oscar-winner 20 years ago, but he shared that the age difference was never a topic.
He believes that if you had to spend so much time as a child and young people – he took part in the Olympic Games with 14 for the first time and his father died three years later at cancer, it is difficult to find someone at the same age with similar experiences.
The couple has been wearing a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley since June, and Daley believes that his whole outlook has changed since.
In the last year, everything was about gold medals.
But for him there is now more important than Olympic gold medals.
His son Robbie is now his main winner.
He bears the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after the diagnosis of Hirtumor.
Daley said that his father did not accept the imminent death, and one of the last things he asked about was the tickets for London 2012 because he wanted to be with it before.
"I couldn't tell him he wouldn't be there anymore," he said.
“I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and then it finally became clear to me that he is not invisible”, he continued.
The following year, Daley won the bronze medal at the 2012 Olympic Games.
"I just knew it was always my dream to get involved in Olympic games in front of a local audience – that was the wedding," he said.
His first choice of song – Proud by Heather Small – was also influenced. He heard the song in front of the Olympic Games and still cared for Gänsehut.

Mikkelson, who is not currently in shape, sits at Ryder Cup on Saturday at the replacement bank
The American Phil Mikkelson will build a record on Sunday at his 47th. Ryder Cup game, but he has to make a lot of effort so that the whole thing doesn't become a debacle.
Mickelson, who played 12 times on the occasion, was sent by Captain Jim Furyk to the Fourballs and Foursomes on Saturday to the replacement bank.
Instead of being mostly at the centre of the story, the fifteen Majors spent his day in order to fire others and work at his game, in the hope of reducing the problems he is suffering.
Even at the height of his career, the 48-year-old Mikkelson was never the direct golfer and thus no ideal crew for the Ten Le Golf National golf course, where missing balls are regularly punished.
And if the place itself would not be discouraged enough, Mikkelson will meet in the ninth game on Sunday at the perfect British Open-Champion Francesco Molinari, who has joined Tommy Fleetwood, Neuling in this tournament to win all four games this week.
If the Americans with four points retreating at the 12 single games start a hot start, Mikkelson's game could prove to be absolutely decisive.
Furyk appeared confidently to Mikkelson and could not add much.
"He was completely about his present role in the clear, gave me a clip on my back and put his arm around me and thought he was ready for tomorrow," Furyk said.
“He has a lot of self-confidence.
He is one of the world's famous personalities and has done so much for these teams in the past week as well.
I didn't think he was in two games.
I had more to think about, but that's how it's going now and that's what we've been waiting for.
He wants to be like everyone else."
Mikkelson will reach the Nick Faldos record for most of the Ryder Cup games released on Sunday.
It could mean the end of a Ryder Cup race, which could never match the heights of its personal record.
Mikkelson could record 18 victories, had to hide 20 downloads and reached seven times, although Furyk announced that his presence had already reached the team alone.
"He's funny and sarkastical, original and he likes a few steps, and he's a great man who's in love with the whole team," he said.
“I think the younger players were happy to get to know him this week a little more. It was fun to look at them.
He's a really interesting person who has many impulses."
Captain Thomas Björn knows that it can soon pass through with the origin
Thomas Björn, the head of the European team, knows from experience that a great beginning leading to the last solo games in Ryder Cup can quickly become an unacceptable situation.
The Dane was awarded in 1997 in Valderama, where a team led by Seven Ballesteros had a front end of five points against the Americans, but it was only a short way over the target line and led with the smallest possible advance and gained a victory from 1411⁄2–131/2.
“The thought remains that we had a great origin in Valderrama, we had a great origin in Brooklyn where we lost, and in Valderram where we had won, but it was not enough,” said Björn (on the photo picture), after he had seen the victory of the Class of 2018 both on Friday and yesterday to lead 10-6 at Le Golf National.
The experience shows me and all team members that it's not too late.
It's going to be okay tomorrow.
Put yourself in the witness and do the right thing.
The whole is over when the points on the display table are over.
We have a goal. We want to win this trophie, and that's where our focus is.
I've always said it, I concentrate on the 12 players on our side, but we're completely aware of what we face on the other side: the best players in the world."
asked Bjorn about the performance that his players had completed on a hard golf course: “I would never let this go.
Tomorrow will be another caliber.
Tomorrow, the single services are in the background, and that's a completely different matter.
It's great to work with a partner when things go well, but if you're alone out there, then you're tested up to the limits of your abilities as a golfer.
You have to make this clear to the players: all morning the best out of you.
Now you leave your partner behind and he must also get the best out of you."
In contrast to Bjorn, his opponent Jim Furyk will see that his players are better off individually than the team, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who have won three of four points.
Furyk himself stood on both sides of the great turnback on the last day of the tournament. He stood in Brooklyn on the winning side, before he stood on the side of Europe "Wander of Medina".
"I remember every damn word," he answered the question like Ben Crenshaw, the Captain in 1999, motivated his players before the last day.
“We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you would like to take off the quick start you saw in Brooklyn and Medina.
If the moment hits a direction, it puts the middle games under a lot of pressure.
We set up our team accordingly and send our boys out the way we feel like we do, you know we're trying to fuck tomorrow."
Thomas was assigned the task of removing the challenge, he has to appear in the top game against Rory McIllroy, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Ram, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter as another European in the upper half of the ranking list.
"I have decided for the boys in this series because I think it's all covered," says Bjorn about his choice for the individual encounters.
Germany's new warship is delayed
The latest cargo of the German Marines was to be put into service in 2014 to replace warships coming in the years from the time of the Cold War. However, it will be delivered by local media on account of broken systems and rapid growth costs only in the next year.
The introduction of the "Rheinland-Pfalz" to the lead ship of the new "Baden-Württemberg" class was now transferred to the first half of 2019.
The ship was already to be put into service in 2014, but the ambitious project of disturbing problems was imposed after delivery.
The four ships of the Baden-Württemberg class, which were already ordered by the sea in 2007, are to replace the old frigates of the Bremen class.
They should include a functional cannon, a series of air-conditioning rockets and seaplanes, as well as tartechnologies such as a reduced radar, infrared and acoustic flexibility.
Another important feature is longer maintenance periods. It should be possible that the newest frigates should not return to their homes for up to two years.
However, the continuing delays can lead to the fact that the highly modern warships, which Germany is supposed to represent as seams, are already ageed at the time of their entry into operation, according to Time.
The F125 Fregatte followed by the accident took place last year in the battle lines when the German Navy officially refused to withdraw the ship and returned it to the Werft Bloom & Voss in Hamburg.
This was the first time that the marine returned a ship after its delivery to the ship.
It was little known about the reasons for the return, but German media called a series of significant "software and hardware faults" that had made the new ship unusable in a real situation.
Software problems are particularly difficult since the Baden-Württemberg class ships are served by a crew of only 120 sailors, only about half as many as on the old brake class frigates.
It was also known that the ship is too difficult to carry out performance revenues and that it is not possible for the marine to carry out future repair measures.
The 7000 tons heavy "Rheinland-Pfalz" was apparently twice as difficult as ships with a similar class used by Germany in World War II.
In addition to the miscellaneous hardware, the costs of the entire project, including the training costs of employment, were also a problem.
The costs are likely to rise to an estimated $3.1 billion, compared to the originally planned €2.2 billion.
The problems with the latest frigates are particularly significant in view of the recent warnings that the Seemacht of Germany is breaking.
At the beginning of the year, Hans-Peter Bartel, the German Federal Warranty Officer, confirmed that the sea “extended ships”.
Bartels said that the problem with time grew because old ships were taken out of service but no replacement ships were provided.
He claimed that none of the frigates of the Baden-Württemberg class could be taken from the sea.
National Trust Casts the Secret Life of the Flander Mouse
In an presence in the Scottish Highland, new research works are carried out to show how Fledermuse uses the landscape when looking for food.
It is hoped that the results will allow further insights into the behavior of these unique flying mammals and help lead future natural protection activities.
The study carried out by researchers at the National Trust for Scotland will be followed by fermented and moustaches, as well as the brown Longohr and Waterflies in Inverwe Garden in Western Ross.
Special recording devices shall be placed at key positions on the ground to record the activities of the gladiators during the entire season.
Employees of the NHS and volunteers will also carry out mobile investigations with portable detectors.
In a sound analysis of all recordings by experts, the frequency of the flagship call is determined and determines which species it does.
A map and a report of the living room will then be drawn up to create a detailed picture of their behaviour at rural level.
Rob Dewar, Nature Counsellor for the NTS, hopes that the results will be shown which areas of life for the flag Mouse are the most important and how these are used by each species.
These data will help to determine the benefits of life-saving measures, such as the creation of knowledge, and to show how forest areas can be obtained for bats and other related species.
The Fledermaus stocks in Scotland and the whole United Kingdom have significantly decreased in the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development work that affects sleeping areas and leads to the loss of the living room.
Winds and lighting can also pose a risk, just as air carriers and the chemical treatment of building materials or attacks by house catacombs.
Flying mice aren't really blind.
However, their ears are more useful because of their nightly hunting habits than their eyes when it comes to catching beet.
They use an exhausted escort to identify insects and obstacles in their flight path.
The NTS responsible for the maintenance of over 270 historical buildings, 38 significant gardens and 76,000 hectares of land throughout Scotland takes the subject of the Fledermuse.
It has over 10 trained experts who conduct regular investigations, inspections of sleeping sites and sometimes rescue measures.
The organization has even established Scotland's first and only Fledermaus reserve in the Treve property in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of Scotland's 10 Fledermaus species.
Good Manager David Thompson explains that the existence of the ideal living room for her.
"Here in Thrave we have a great area for Fledermuse," he explained.
“We have the old buildings, many old trees and a wonderful living room.
But there are many things we don't yet know about Fledermuses, so we're doing these works here and others to help us learn more about what Flemish needs to feel good."
He stressed how important it is to exclude pre-reservation work in the wells from the presence of gladermouses first, since it is possible that the unwanted destruction of a single nest site could kill up to 400 females and young animals and destroy the entire population in front of the place.
Flanders are under protection and it is illegal to kill them, kill them or destroy their nests relatively.
Elizabeth Ferrell, Scottish Beamtin of Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the people to help.
She explains: "We still have to learn a lot about flags and we don't know how they are about many species."
Ronaldo argues against rape, while his lawyers want to accuse the German magazine
Christian Ronaldo referred to him as "Fake News" and said that people wanted to "be famous" by using his name.
His lawyers plan to accuse the newspaper The mirror that published the charges.
The director of the National Team of Portugal and Youth Turin was accused of having been raped by an American named Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
Apparently he paid her next $375.000 to buy her shoes on the occasion, as the mirror on Friday.
In an Instagram Live video of its 142 million Followers, 33-year-old Ronaldo named the reports only hours after their publication as "Fake News."
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they reported today: Fake News," said the fifth winner of the Ballon d’Or in the camera.
“They want to be profiled by the use of my name.
That's normal.
They want to be famous for my name, but this is part of the job.
I'm a happy man and everything's good," added the player smilingly.
Ronaldos lawyers are prepared to accuse the mirror because of the charges they call Reuters as “unauthorized reporting of suspicions in the area of the private sphere”.
Lawyer Christian Scherttz said that the player sought a set of damages for “moral damages at a level corresponding to the severity of legal damage which probably represented one of the most serious violations of personality rights in recent years.”
The event will take place in 2009 in a suite of Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After attending a night club, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly went to the player's room, where he reportedly showed up at the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo went on his knees after the incident and said that he was “99% a good guy”, which was “one percent” to him.
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirms that the two had sex, but say it was acceptable.
Mayorga also claimed that she had gone to the police and had taken photos of her injuries in a hospital, but later she had joined an extrajudicial agreement, since she had "betting for compensation" and made sure that she was "publicly humiliated".
The 34-year-old said that she is now trying to withdraw the agreement because she is still traumatized because of the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to change from Manchester United to Real Madrid and changed this summer into a 100 million euro heavy deal for the Italian giant Juve.
Brexit: The United Kingdom would “damaged the loss of car manufacturers”
The United Kingdom would be "very disappointed" if after Brexit it lost its status as a world-leading manufacturer of cars, said Economic Minister Greg Clark.
He further said that it was "responsive" that Toyota UK told the BBC that the production in the work in Burnaston at Derby would be temporarily interrupted, Britain should leave the EU.
"We need a deal," Clark said.
The Japanese car manufacturer noted that the influence of delays on the border could lead to loss of jobs at a no-deal brexit.
The work in Burnaston, in which Toyotas is produced by Auris and Avensis, produced nearly 150,000 vehicles last year, 90 % of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"I am convinced that we will experience in our work an uncontrolled Brexit End March production stop," said Marvin Cooke, Toyotas Business Manager in Burnaston.
Other British car manufacturers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have also been alarmed about a strong EU Austria without agreement and its impact on cross-border trade.
For example, BMW says it will close its mini-work in Oxford after Brexit for a month.
The main concerns depend on the car manufacturers with risks within the delivery chain at a hard break.
Toyotas production facility will be operated on a "just-in-time" basis, which means that parts of suppliers will be delivered from both the United Kingdom and the EU to complete the car on order.
If the United Kingdom were to leave the EU without an agreement on 29 March, it could come at the limits of interruptions which could lead to delays and delays in the shares.
It was impossible for Toyota to conduct a storage file at work in Derbyshire, which lasted more than a day, the company explained why production had to be interrupted.
Clark stated that Theresa Mays Chechers Plan on the future relationship with the EU "is precisely designed to avoid such border controls".
“We need a deal. We want the best deal that has enabled us, as I have already said, not only to enjoy the current success, but also to get this chance,” he explained in today’s BBC Radio 4.
"The findings not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers show that we must be able to carry out very successful supply chains so far."
Toyota could not tell how long the production had to be interrupted, but warned long-term that additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the work and lead to loss of employment.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been employed in Burnaston for 24 years and who has been the highest official of the unit's company at work, said that his members are increasingly concerned: “My experience will never come back when they are gone first.
A government speaker said: "We have presented a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trump's planned meetings with Rosenstein could be relocated according to information from the White House
Donald Trumps' important meetings with the Deputy Justice Minister Rod Rosenstein could "be moved in another week" during the debate on the candidates for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, continued to leave the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein has overseen the work of Special Agent Robert Mueller, who has examined the selection mixes by Russia, relations between Trump consultants and Russia, and possible judicial barriers by the presidents.
The question whether Trump would fire the Minister of Justice and thereby endanger the independence of Muellers has been the subject of rumors in Washington for a month.
At the beginning of the month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was addressing the possibility of registering his private conversation with Trump and the President's office with the help of the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denounced the report.
However, on the last Monday he entered the White House, while new reports of his joint return were announced.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, which was then held at the UN General Assembly in New York, was announced for the next Thursday,
Trump stated that he would not prefer to leave Rosenstein, but then the meeting was moved to avoid collise with the hearing before the US Senate Committee on Justice, in which both Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women who challenged him for sexual abuse.
On Friday, Trump ordered a weekly FBI investigation of the charges against Kavanaugh, which further delayed the full vote of the Senate.
Trumps Press Speaker Sarah Sanders appeared on the Sunday on Fox News.
On one question with Rosenstein, she replied: “A date has not yet been established; it could be this week, but I can still imagine that it will be moved for another week, in view of all the things that are just going before the Supreme Court.
That'll show up, but I always like the press on the run."
Some reporters would probably object to this claim: Sanders has not held a press conference in the White House since 10 September.
Moderator Chris Wallace asked her why.
Sanders stated that the low frequency of the press conferences did not lie against the TV reporter's "Effectchascherie", but said, "I would not argue, however, that they operate "Effecthascheries."
She then claimed that the direct contact between Trump and the press would take place.
The President makes more questions and replies than any President before him," she said without any clear evidence: "We have seen these numbers."
Press conferences will still be given, as Sanders said, however, “if the press has the opportunity to ask the President of the United States directly, but much better than talking to me.
We often try to do this and you have seen that we have done it often in the last few weeks. This will take place at the press conference if you can talk to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly accepts questions if he leaves the white house or participates in open meetings or press conferences with visitors.
Press conferences with him alone are rare.
In New York, the President may have shown why this is so when he presented to the gathered reporters a series of extraordinary events.
Health Minister writes about Brexit concerns to EU employees of the Scottish NHS
The Ministry of Health refers to persons from the EU-Austria who are working in Scotland's National Health Service (NHS) to express the country's gratitude and to express their desire to remain in the country after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter less than six months before the birth of the United Kingdom from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already agreed to bear the costs of applications for residence permits for EU citizens working in the decentralised public service in Scotland.
In your letter Freeman wrote: “During the summer the Austrian negotiations between the United Kingdom and the EU were continued and decisions were expected.
However, the British government has also strengthened preparations for a possible no-deal scenario.
I know what exciting times this must be for you all.
That is why I would like to express once again how much I am contributing to each and every employee's values, regardless of nationality.
Members and colleagues from all over the EU and in addition bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service and thus benefit the patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is full and full of your home and we would be very happy if you stayed here."
Christion Abercrombie was rejected after a head injury of a notation
According to comments by Mike Organ of Tennessee State, the linebacker of the Tennessee State Tigers Christion Abercrombie was following a head injury which he underwent on Saturday at the 31-27th floor against the Vanderbilt Commodores.
Rod Reed, chief trainer of Tennessee State, told reporters that the damage took place shortly before the half-term break.
"He came to the side line and just broke up there," Reed said.
Trainer and medical staff provided Abercrombie on the sideline with oxygen before being placed on a tray and transported for further examinations.
A speaker from Tennessee State told Chris Harris of the WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie left the OP at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that “no details of the nature or extent of the damage” have been known and Tennesse State is trying to find out when the damage has occurred.
Abercrombie, a so-called Redshirt, plays in his first season at Tennessee State after he changed it from Illinois.
Before leaving the game on Saturday, he recorded a total of 5 thanks, which increased his total number in the season to 18 thanks.
Foreign investors must pay higher stamp taxes for the purchase of property in the United Kingdom
Investors from abroad will have to pay higher stamp taxes for the purchase of properties in the United Kingdom in the future. Additional revenue should be paid in line with the new plans of the Conservative Party.
This step will enhance the success of Jeremy Corbyn's campaign on young voters
The increase in the stamp fee will affect all who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom
The Ministry of Finance accounts for an increase of up to 120 million dollars per year to help homeless people.
Theresa May will be announced today that foreign investors will have to pay a higher stamp fee if you buy properties in the United Kingdom, where multiple revenues are expected to benefit blind.
This step is an attempt to achieve the success of Jeremy Corbys in young voters, who promises to provide more comfortable living room and take top valuers into visitors.
The increase in stamp tax will be applied to individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom.
In addition to the current stamp tax and including the increase in dual-occupancy and leased residential property, the increase could amount to up to three per cent.
The Ministry of Finance accounts for a step of up to 120 million dollars per year.
Estimated 13 percent of newly built properties in London are purchased by investors who are not included in the United Kingdom. As a result, prices will be raised and it will be harder for first-time buyers to get in the real estate business.
Many prosperous areas of the country, especially in the capital, have been “Gester cities” because of the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the United Kingdom.
The new strategy is followed only a few weeks after Boris Johnson spoke for a reduction in stamp tax in order to allow more young people to own the first home.
He accused the construction companies of maintaining their real estate prices by buying a country without using it and forced Theresa May to give up quotas on affordable apartments to end the British "dwelling"."
Opposite Director Corbyn announced a series of proposals for housing reforms, ranging from a rental price link to a ban on rooms without a suitable basis.
He also wants to give city councils more power to build new apartments.
May stated: “Last year I said that I would devote my time as prime minister of the reconstruction of the British dream, according to which life of generations to generation should be better.
And that's to repair our captivated housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who live and work here and want to build a life.
However, it cannot be true that it is just as easy for people who do not live in Britain, as well as for companies living abroad, to buy property as hard-working British citizens.
The dream of privacy has become too much for many people and the innocence of blindness remains too much a problem."
Jack Ross: 'My biggest goal is to manage Scotland'
Jack Ross, head of Sunderland, says it's his “largest” goal to become the director of the Scottish team sometime.
The 42-year-old shooter is enjoying the challenge of bringing together a new life from the North East England, which is just on the third place in the League One and missing the three points.
He took this summer to the stadium of Light after he brought St. Mirren back to the first Scottish league in the last season.
“I wanted to play as a player for my country.
I created it on the bank and the war's," said Ross of BBC Scotland's Sports Sound.
“But as a child with my father, I often see Scotland playing in Hampden and that’s something that always draws me back.
However, this option would only come if I were successful in the management of the association."
Ross predecessors in the role as manager of Sunderland include Dock Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardice, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyt and Paulo Di Canio.
The former chief of Alloa Athletic had no fear of entering such established names at such a club after he had previously made offers by Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
The success will be measured with me at the moment whether I can return the union to the Premier League.
In view of the structure and possibilities in this union, he is undoubtedly part of the Premier League," he explained.
"It is not an easy task to get him there, but I would probably appreciate my time here only as a success if I bring the unity back there."
Ross can show a three-year management career, after a phase as the founding director at Dumbarton and a 15-month activity as a trainer in Hearts.
Then he helped Alloa to get from the Religion into the third League and moved St. Mirren from the side of the Religion to win the Mastership in the following season.
Ross says he feels better now than ever before in his career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"That must have been a real damage," he recalls when he took over Alloa's responsibility.
“I really believe that management was the right thing for me, more than playing.
It sounds funny because I didn't get bad jobs, could live well and experienced some very pleasant high-levels.
But playing can be hard.
There are many things you have to do every week.
I am still doing this through stress and pressure in my job, but management feels right.
I've always wanted to manage and now I've done it. I've never felt like an adult in my skin in my whole life."

The perfect time for a glass beer is every day at 17:30, so a study
The heat wave in the summer has missed the arrivals of British cruise pubs, while restaurant chainings are under greater pressure.
In July, pub and bar companies recorded an increase of 2.7 per cent. However, revenues at restaurants decreased by 4.8 per cent according to statistics.
Peter Martin of CGA’s company council, which compiled the figures, stated: “Intensification of Sunshine and England longer than expected continuous participation in football competition meant that July followed a pattern similar to last June, in Pub’s sales increases of 2.8 per cent, however, it was even more difficult.
The decline of 1.8 per cent, recorded by the restaurant industry in June, continued in July.
Pubs and bars with focus on drinks gradually showed the best performance, with an area-oriented sales development that increased higher than they fell at the restaurants.
Pubs focusing on food also look at the sun, but not as dramatic as the restaurant operator.
It looks like people were just going to go out for a drink.
In the managed pubs and bars, drinking rates rise by 6.6 per cent per month, while the number of meals falls by three per cent."
Paul Newman, of the analysts for leisure and hospitality RSM, stated: “These results continue the trend we have observed since the end of April.
The weather and the influence of important social or sports events remain the biggest factors for the out-of-home market.
It is not surprising that restaurant groups continue to have problems, but sales revenues of 4.8 per cent will be particularly painful compared to the previous year.
The long summer could not be a bad time for operators of companies with a focus on food and it remains to be expected that the appropriate temperatures in August will provide the urgently needed time."
The overall growth in sales for pubs and restaurants, including the new openings, was 2.7% in July and reflected the decline in the brand rollouts.

One of five children has secret accounts on social media that hide it from his parents
A study shows that every five children, sometimes just 11 years old, have secret accounts on social media that keep it secret in front of parents and teachers
A survey of 20,000 students in continuing schools has established an increase in so-called "Fake Insta" pages.
The message threatens to contain sexual content
Twenty percent of the students offered to own a "main account" to show it to their parents
One of five children, sometimes only 11 years old, creates accounts on social media that can be kept secret before adults.
A survey of 20,000 students in continuing schools showed a rapid increase in so-called "Fake Insta" accounts, a loan to the Photo Sharing Website Instagram.
The message threatens most that sexual content is shared.
Twenty percent of the students offered to own a clean "main account" that they could show their parents, but also to own private accounts.
A mother who stood on the secret side of her 13-year-old daughter found a teenager who urged her to “bless me.”
The study conducted by Digital Awareness UK and Headmasters’ and Headness’ Conference (HMC) of independent schools revealed that 40 percent of the 11 to 18 years of age had two profiles, with half being given to own private accounts.
Mike Buchanan, president of the HMC, said: "It is devastating that so many teenagers are led to create online rooms where parents and teachers cannot find them."
Eilyh Doyle will be “the voice of athletes” in the Scottish Sports Council
Eilyh Doyle was elected to the Scottish Light Telephony Association of Scottish Athletics at this annual General Assembly.
Doyle is Scotland's most famous lighthouse and President Ian Beattie described the election as a great opportunity for sports operators to benefit from their extensive international experience over the last decade.
"Eilih will be respected in the Scottish, British and World Light Telephony Community and we are sure that the Light Telephony in Scotland would benefit greatly from its choice in the Council," Beattie said.
Doyle said: “I am happy to act as the voice of the athletes and hope that I will be able to make a real contribution and lead the sport in Scotland.”
The American who won the distance over 200 and 400 meters in the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta, in total, called his own four Olympic gold medals and today often appeared as BBC experts, could no longer run after an unprecedented blood loss.
He wrote on Twitter: “A month ago I had a stroke.
I couldn't run anymore.
The doctors say no one can tell if or how far I'm going to heal.
It was hard work, but I've been fully recovered, learned to run again and make movement exercises today!
Thank you very much for the comforting news!"
An advertising for milk pumps, which compares mother to chicken, ensures uplifting in the network
A producer of milk pumps made it possible to build up in the network with a commercial clip in which the soothing mother is compared with the milking of cows.
For the market introduction of the so-called "first-high-fashioned milk pump" the manufacturer of consumer technology Elvie published a rather serious shared music video in order to emphasize the freedom that the pumps offer mothers.
Four real mother dances in a snow-filled shade with cakes in the background to a song containing text lines such as: "Yes, I milk me, but you see me no change" or "if you haven't noticed it, it's not yours but my breasts."
In the Refrain it continues: “Push it out, pump it out, feed the babies, pump it out, pump it out, milk my ladyies.”
However, the advertising published on the company's Facebook page has solved a controversy on the network.
With 77,000 accessors and hundreds of comments, the video was based on mixed reactions in the audiences, many of whom said it was the "breaking" of the dairy industry.
“It was a very bad decision to hire this product with cookies.
Like us, they must be pregnant and bear a Calb to produce milk, with the difference that their children will be taken away within a few days of their birth," he commented.
Elvie's milk pump fits into a still-bH (Elvie/Mother)
Another comment said: “Supplied traumatized for mother and baby.
But, hey, why don't we use them to buy a milk pump for mothers who can keep their babies?"
Another person added: "So a real promotion."
Others defended the announcement and gave a woman that you found the song “urcomous”.
"I think it's a great idea.
I would've bought me one if I was still silent.
I felt like a cow when I jumped off the pump.
The clip is a little crazy, but I'm not trying to interpret it.
This is a great product," one person wrote.
Another person commented: “This is a whitish advertising that is directed at mother, use milk pumps (or at work or on toilets) and feel like “knife”.
This is not advertising for or against the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, the group reveals to women that they all danced with the discrete pumps in their BHs.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the knowledge that many women who use milk pumps show how to feel like milk dogs.
However, Elvie's pump is completely out of reach, has no holes or holes and fits into a silent BH, whereby women get the freedom to move to hold their babies or even go out during the pump process.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD at Mother, stated: “The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a waiting and provocative market introduction.
By comparison of breast-feeding mothers with milk, we wanted to return milk pumps and all the emerging challenges to the centre and at the same time to a sustainable and sustainable way and to imagine the incredible feeling of freedom that makes the new pump possible.
This is not the first time that Elvie's pump is moving into the battle lines.
During the London Fashion Week a double mother appeared for designer Marta Jakubowski on the Catwalk while using the product.
Hundreds of immigrant children were silenced and leased into a city on the Texan border
The number of internally displaced migrants is as high as ever before, although the number of monthly border crossings remained relatively equal, among other things, forced rhetoric and measures of the Trump government have made it more difficult for children to be subject to abuse.
Traditionally, most managers themselves were illegal immigrants and now they are afraid to become a target when they sign up to adopt a child.
The risk was taken into account in June as the Federal authorities announced that potential managers and other adult members of their household must give their fingerprints and share these data with the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a high official of the Customs Administration Immigration and Customs Enforcement, announced before the Congress that the authorities arrested thousands of people who had been charged with the care of unaccompanied minors.
The Authority later confirmed that 70 per cent of the prisoners had no previous entry into the criminal register.
“At least 80 per cent of the persons who are either themselves or members of a household of a manager are illegal in the country and a large proportion of them are criminal foreigners.
That is why we will continue to follow these people," said Albence.
In order to speed up the cases of the children, the officials introduced new rules, which according to staff of the accommodation in some children, to appear within a month instead of 60 days after the memorial hearing before the court, which was previously the standard.
Many will appear on video and not personally to join an immigration judge for their legal status.
When negative decisions are made, the person will be released immediately.
The longer these children remain in danger, the more likely it is that it is according to the information given by the accommodation staff as well as reports known in the last month from the system that they will become pregnant and depressed, which can lead to violent outbreaks or explosions.
Defenders say that these concerns will be strengthened at a larger facility such as Tornillo, as there are signs that a child has problems, due to the size, will be easily overlooked.
They also stated that it can strengthen traumatized by many of the children who are already suffering, if they are taken to a city without emotional preparation or enough time to agree with friends.
Syria calls on US, French and Turkish 'Employment' to withdraw immediately
In a speech before the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moulam also called on the Syrian refugees to return home, although the civil war in the country is still in the middle of the eighth year.
Moualem, also acting Prime Minister, stated that the foreign forces are illegally engaged in the fight against terrorism and are "treated accordingly".
"They must return immediately and unconditionally," he said to the assembly.
Moualem was convinced that the “war against terrorism” was almost over in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions more have been displaced from their homes.
He said that Damascus "will continue to fight this holy battle until all the Syrian territories are cleansed" by terrorist groups as well as "every illegal foreign presence".
The United States has stationed some 2,000 soldiers in Syria, mostly both Kurdish and Syrian combat forces, who have been formed against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1000 land mines in the war-affected country.
With regard to refugees, Moualem stated that the conditions for their return have been granted and he accused "some Western countries" of spreading "irradiational anxiety" to the refugees leaving home.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to enable the return," he said.
"They are actually political in a purely humanitarian matter."
The United States and the European Union warned that no building aid would be provided for Syria unless there was a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats stated that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on a buffer zone in the last great rebellion in Idlib represents the opportunity for political dialogue.
The deal between Russia and Turkey turned out to be a wide-ranging offensive of the Syrian fighting forces supported by Russia to the province, where three million people live.
Moualem stressed, however, that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and stressed its hope that military measures against dissidents, including attacks on the Nusra Front associated with Al-Qaeda, "will be eliminated".
UN Representative Staffan de Mistura hopes to be able to invite the first meeting of a new committee soon to consist of government and opposition members to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and to set up a path to election.
Moualem referred to the conditions of the Syrian Government for participation in the Committee and stated that its work should be limited to "recasting the article of the current constitution" and warned against mixing.
Why Trump won his reelection
With this logic, Trump would win his reelection in 2020, should not, as many liberal observers probably hope, stop an official or scandal in advance of his presidency.
This would certainly be "the most dramatic finale of a Presidency of All Times".
Until then, there are no signs that it had set the viewers.
Since 2014, the best delivery time limit for CNN has doubled to 1.05 million and nearly doubled to MSNBC 1.6 million.
According to Nielsen, Fox News achieves an average of 2.4 million viewers for the best time of sending, compared to 1.7 million years ago. MSNBCs “The Rachel Maddow Show” showed the closing quotas with an average of 3.5 million viewers at evenings with important news.
"It's like a fire that people look magically at, because it's something we don't understand," says Neal Bear, showrunner of the ABC television series "Designed Survivor" about a member of the cabinet who will be president after an attack on the chapter.
Nell Scovell, an ancient Comedy writer and author of the book "Just the Funny Party: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys’ Club" has another theory.
It remembers a taxi trip in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her he'd choose a trup.
She asked him for the reason.
"He said: 'because he brought me to the lake'" told me Scovell.
Chaos has maintenance value.
Of course, the stories from Washington can be found in contrast with everything on television, the future of the fundamental decision on Roe v. Wade operations, the possible integration of families and the health of the global economy.

For my part, I'll never see Super Mario again with the same eyes.

Spending money flows the first rounds of meetings at the convention during the inter-election
It is not surprising that the 17th electoral district of Pennsylvania is overloaded by taxpayers, thanks to the renewed limits of the electoral districts leading to two officials running around the same seat.
The newly-designed Pre city district in Pittsburgh is allowed to represent the Democratic Conor Lamb who has won his seat in another district in the course of a special election last spring.
Lamb meets another official, Republican Keith Rothfus, who is currently represented by the 12th district of Pennsylvania, which is very close to the 17th district.
The maps were re-signed after the Supreme Court of the state of Pennsylvania decided in January that the old areas were confused against the Constitution and were manipulated for the benefit of the Republicans.
The run in the new 17th district resulted in the exchange of electoral funding between the major financial instruments of the parties, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NCRC).
Lamb was known in Pennsylvania after a short victory in a widely respected special election in March around the 18th electoral district of the state.
This seat was held over a decade by a republican and Trump won with 20 percentage points.
Politicians offer the Democrats a simple guide.
The United States checks El Salvador's punishment for its support for China, but then we'll go back.
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama Peking had already recognized it without much opposition from Washington.
Trump completed a friendly meeting with President Panamas Juan Carlos Valero in June 2017 and hosted a hotel in Panama to partner the management team of the Trump Organization.
Officials of the U.S. Ministry of Foreign Affairs have decided to withdraw the leaders of all US foreign trades from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of "no longer recognizing Taiwan's latest decisions", said Heather Nauert, Minister's spokesman at the beginning of the month's opinion.
However, only in the case of El Salvador on criminal measures, estimated at $140 million in 2017, including for drug control, development and economic assistance, were taken into account.
The proposed criminal measures, including cuts in financial aid services and visa restrictions, would have been painful for the Central American country and its high unemployment and mortality rates.
During internal meetings, North and Central American officials shall move a high-level conference on security and economic well-being to follow a similar meeting last year and to take a step forward in their efforts to keep migrants in the direction of the United States.
In mid-September, however, high government officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place and thus ended the consideration of the sanctions for El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence is now scheduled to be the speaker at the conference held in mid-October to give a sign of the importance of the Assembly's government.
The three American diplomatic representatives are silent and slow back to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new written communications or criminal action from Washington.
A government speaker from John Bolton held an opinion on the details of the debate, which were described by the three American officials, including two diplomats who agreed under the terms of anonymity to be outside the internal discussions.
Their views were confirmed by a government close to the existing external analysts, who also spoke under the terms of anonymity.
Learn From History
The next major surprise could be the report of Special Agent Robert Mueller on the possible judicial impediments to which there are sufficient public places.
Mueller is now also likely to examine whether the Trumps election team with Russia has devised its attack on the US elections.
Should the majority of Congress change, see that Trump faces an organ that forces him to account, even though he is prepared to meet again before the voters; and if so, before a voter's jury.
These are many 'Winns' and I do not want to say that the case of Donald Trumps or his European mentor is inevitable.
On both sides of the Atlantic we must make decisions that will affect how long the fight will last.
In 1938, German officials were ready to conduct a state war against Hitler if the West had only attacked him and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We have failed and missed a chance to avoid the years of barbarism that followed.
The course of history revolves around such turning points and the relentless march of democracy is either accelerated or delayed.
The Americans are just ahead of several such turning points.
What do we do when Trump leaves the Deputy Justice Minister Rod Rosenstein, so the man who decides about the future of Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has lived in Teofels kitchen since this last year, he has reported that he suggested secretly registering the presidents and speculating about it, but not suitable for the office.
Rosenstein demeans the performance of the New York Times.
“How will we respond if the newly-appointed FBI investigation by Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair or despite credible allegations of sexual abuse and fraud in the office?
And above all, are we going to agree in the inter-elections for a convention that forces the trumpet to account?
If we fail in these tests, we have a long winter ahead.
But I think we won't fail because of what I've learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czech-Slovakia Jew who was deported to Auschwitz, although by the same regime that once occupied my mission.

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers optimistically before the game against Vienna
The Rangers receive Rapid Vienna on Thursday knowing that after the impressive remise against Villareal in Spain at the beginning of the month, a victory against the Austrians will be placed in a good position for the qualification of the Group G of the European League.
Because of a kidney damage, Graham Dorrrans could not appear until the 2-2 equality against Villareal, but he believes that the rangers can use this result as a platform for greater growth.
"That was an important point for us because Villareal is very good," said the 31st-year-old.
We went with conviction into the game that we can do something about it and we're going home with a point.
Maybe we could still have won at the end, but overall a difference was probably a fair result.
They probably dominated in the first half, but we worked hard in the second half and were then the best team.
Thursday will be another big European evening.
Hopefully we get three points, but this will be a hard part because they have achieved a good outcome in the last game. But I am sure that we can go through this with the public behind us and achieve a positive result.
Last year was definitely difficult, with everything that happened with my injuries and the changes in the club itself, but now there is a kind of feeling factor.
The team is good and the boys are really good at it; the training is good.
Hopefully we can now look forward to the last season behind us and be successful."
Fear of aging leads to sleepless nights in women.
Although the participants knew exactly how to care for them, few talked to their family members about it.
About half of the participants in the National Wide Study offered to talk to your partners about the costs of long-term care.
Only 10 percent offered to talk to their children about it.
“People want a family member to take care of them, but don’t take the necessary steps to conduct the conversation,” said Holly Snyder, Vice President of the National Life Insurance Party.
You should start with this.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family to care for you if you do not express your wishes on time.
Work with your consultant and your family to discuss where and how you want to be made, as these decisions can be a significant factor in determining costs.
Bring your financial adviser to board: Your consultant can also help you find an opportunity to finance these expenses.
Your long-term financial decisions may include a traditional care insurance, a hybrid capital insurance to help cover these costs or self-insurance with your own assets - so long as they have the money.
Work out your legal documents: Get rid of legal disputes in the last minute.
If you are planning to take care of yourself so that you can ask a trusted person to monitor your medical care and to ensure that the health professionals are able to comply with your wishes, you should be able to express them yourself.
Consider also a full power for your finances.
You select a trusted person who will make financial decisions for you and ensure that your bills are paid, you should not be able to do so.
Do not forget the details: Imagine that your older parent has a medical emergency and is on the way to the hospital.
Are you able to answer questions about taking medicines or allergic reactions?
Note these details in a written plan so that you are ready.

Earthbees and Tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by a violent earthquake and a tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, so the authorities had to increase the number of deaths.
Due to the lack of communication systems, aid forces were unable to obtain information from the government district of Doghía, a region north of Palu, located near the Earth’s epicenter with strength 7.5.
In Palu more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some important facts about Palu and Doghía on the island of Sulawesi:

Fisheries and agriculture are the main sources of income from the Central-Sulawesis economy, in particular the Coastal Region of Doghía.
The Nickelabau is also important in the province, but it focuses mainly on Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesis.
In the last 100 years, Palu and Doghea have been victims of earthquakes and tsunamis by Indonesia.
In 1938 more than 200 people were killed by a tsunami that destroyed hundreds of homes in Doghía.
In 1996, West Dongala was hit by a tsunami that killed nine people.
Indonesia is located on the seismic Pacific Firering, and is regularly searched for land.
Here are some of the biggest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A strong earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in northern Sumatra opened a tsunami on December 26, which struck 14 countries and cost 226,000 people in the coastal areas of the Indian Ocean, almost half of which in Aceh.
2005: A number of heavy earthquakes devastated the West Coast of Sumatra between the end of March and the beginning of April.
Hundreds of people die on the Nias Islands before the coast of Sumatra.

Over 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A earthquake of 7.5 struck one of the mentawai islands before Sumatra and triggered a tsunami of up to 10 meters high, which destroyed thousands of villages and claimed about 300 lives.
2016: A light earthquake struck the government area Pidie Jaya in Aceh and caused destruction and panic when people were reminded of the destruction of the deadly earthquake and tsunami of 2004.
This time, Tsunami was not dissolved, but more than 100 people died from sudden buildings.
2018: Heavy earthquakes hit the Indonesian island of Lombok, which was popular among tourists, and called for more than 500 deaths on the north side of the island.
The baby destroyed thousands of buildings and thousands of tourists were temporarily scattered on the island.

Tsunami by earthquake in Indonesia: hundreds of deaths
At least 384 people die after a earthquake that struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The baby with a strength of 7.5 dissolved a tsunami that destroyed thousands of homes.
Power and communications networks are interrupted and it will result in an increase in the number of deaths in the coming days.

Federal government requires a rare death penalty for suspects in New York's terrorist attack
The federal government in New York calls for the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, who was charged with the terrorist attack of New York City, which cost eight lives. This is a rare punishment that has not been imposed in the state since 1953 for a federal offence.
The 30-year-old Saipov is accused of using a rented pick-up of the construction chain Home Depot for a terrorist attack, during which he drove on a road along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan and transported footmen and bicycles.
In order to justify the death penalty, the complainants must prove that Saipov killed the eight victims "targeted" and "consciously" serious bodily injury, which is the intentional declaration for the death penalty imposed in the South New Yorks area.
Both charges could be punishable by death in accordance with the judicial document.
One week after the attack, a Federal Investigation Court of Saipov presented a complaint in 22 points covering eight charges of murder before the basis of the organised crime, which are normally used by federal lawyers in cases of organised crime, as well as a complaint about the use of force and destruction of vehicles.
The attack requires "basic planning and advance", so the complainants described the kind in which the Saipov carried out the action as "abscisive, rude and abusive".
“Sayfulllo Habibullaevic Saipov added the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco damage, pain and loss”, said the statement.
Five victims were Argentinian tourists.
For over a decade, the southern district of New York has been no longer the case with the aim of demanding the death penalty.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murder to two drug suppliers and was finally sentenced to a life-long life sentence in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was carried out in New York at a federal trial was in 1953 in the case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a couple who were accused of committing spying on the Soviet Union two years ago.
On June 19, 1953, both Rosenbergs were built with the electric chair.
Saipov, who was born in Uzbekistan, witnessed such court hearings in the days and months following the attack of missing grapes.
He told his investigators to feel good about what he'd done, so the police.
Saipov told the authorities that he was actually inspired after he had posted ISIS videos on his phone, so the complaint was filed.
He also requested police inputs from ISIS in his hospital room.
He declared himself innocent in all 22 complaints.
David Patton, one of the public defenders representing Saipov, stated that they were "of course disappointed" because of the decision of the government.
“We believe that the decision to demand the death penalty imposes an obligation in exchange for a life-long life-long life sentence without the possibility of accepting the release of the trauma that will result only from all participants,” said Patton.
Saipov's defence team had previously asked the complainant not to demand the death penalty.
A representative of the Conservative Party asks NIGEL FARGE to transfer Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage is forced to mobilize "the power of the people" today during a protest in the context of the Toria conference.
The former party chief of Ukip stated that politicians "the pressure" of Eurosceptics must "feel"" while a member of Theresa Mays Party suggested that farage should lead negotiations with the EU.
Conservative back banker Peter Bone told the demonstrators in Birmingham that the United Kingdom would "be out already" if Farage Brexit-Minister was.
The challenge faced by May in paying off its deeply divided party was to strengthen the participation of members of your party who are for a stay in the EU in a separate demonstration against Brexit, which took place in the city.
The Prime Minister has problems in keeping its compromise plan Chechers despite attacks by Brexit-Pur words, Brexit-Geigner and the EU.
It was agreed that despite the opposition, they should continue to try to deal with Brussels and should therefore be forced by Eurosceptic and the opposition Labour Party to decide between their package and the Chaos.
Bone stated at the ‘Leave Means Leave’ demonstration in Solihull that ‘Checkers on the Müll’.
He suggested that one should have surrendered farge to a pair and that he should have transferred responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
‘If he were responsible for it, we would already be out,’ he said.
The deputy of Wellingborough added: ‘I will enter for Brexit, but Chechers belongs to Müll.
He stressed his opposition to the EU: 'We have not fought in World Wars to be subversive.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.
Bone claimed that the public opinion has changed since the referendum in 2016: ‘The idea that the British people have changed their opinion and now want to stay in the EU is completely wrong.’
The Brexit spokesman of Conservative Andrea Jenkyns was also on the demonstration and told reporters: ‘I just say: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
‘The compromise is unpopular in the public, the opposition will not agree with it, it is unpopular in our own party and in our activists who actually go through the streets and make sure we are chosen.
Please give Chechers up and start listening.
In a clear message to May, she continued: ‘The Prime Minister keeps her jobs when you keep their promises.
Farage stated in a reply that politicians must “press the press” just to reject the decision of the 2016 referendum.
‘This is now a question of confidence between us, the people and our political class’, says Farage.
'They're trying to deceive Brexit, so we're here today to say to them, 'That's why you don't come from it'.
Before an excited crowd, he continued: ‘I want you to let our political class, which is just ahead of you, talk to Brexit, breathe the pressure.
“We mobilize the power of the people of this country, which will never come to our victory in the referendum, unless we are independent, self-managed, proud United Kingdom.
At the same time, Brexit-Gegner marched through Birmingham before taking a two-hour customer service in the city center.
A couple of activists pushed banders of the Tories Against Brexit group, a group of Brexit Genners within Mays Party, which was called into life on the weekend.
Lord Adonis, peer of the Labour Party, was pleased with the towers which had security problems with a party app when opening the conference.
‘These are the people who tell us that they can ensure that IT systems, just like all the technology for Canada Plus Plus, for the free border, are available for free trade in Ireland without borders,’ Adonis said.
‘This is a farce.
There's just no good Brexit', he added.
Warren plant, the presidential candidate 'exactly check'
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren stated that after the elections in November she would "check the presidential candidate exactly".
The Boston Globe reports that the Democrats from Massachusetts spoke on Saturday at a meeting with voters in West Massachusetts about their future.
Warren, a critic of President Donald Trump, is in the race for the re-election of the Senate against the Republican Members of the Parliament of Massachusetts Geoff Diehl, who was vice-president of Trump's election team in Massachusetts in 2016.
It was the centre of speculation that it could challenge Trump in 2020.
The event on Saturday afternoon in Holyoke was since Trump's office, her 36th meeting with voters in the so-called Town Hall format.
One of the persons present asked her if she wanted to apply for the presidency.
Warren replied that it would be "to go to Washington and repair our captivating government and include women at the top."

The police of Baton Rouge, Louisiana, reported on Saturday that a suspect was arrested on the LSU basketball player Wade Sims from Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced at a press conference to hold the 20-year-old Dytheon Simpson at 11 o'clock in the morning.
On Friday they published a video of the shooting and asked for help in identifying the man who was to see the recording.
The 20-year-old Sims was shot in the morning near the campus of Southern University.
"Wayde Sims is having a stroke on his head and died because of this injury," said the media officer's 247th sports portal of police chief Murphy J. Paul on Saturday.
Wade wanted to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was heard and gave to be on the tatort and possession of a weapon and to have shot at Wade Sims.
Simpson was arrested without further incidents and was taken to the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department in Hazarsam.

Large price from Russia: Lewis Hamilton approaches the World Championship after his team has left the victory over Sebastian Vettel
From the time that Valtteri Bottas landed on Saturday in qualifying for Lewis Hamilton, it was clear that Stallors of Mercedes would play a great role in the race.
From the Polish position from Bottas was a good start and it was almost as he led Hamilton before when he defended his position in the first two rounds and invited Vettel to attack his teammates.
Vettel first went into the box and left Hamilton in traffic at the end of the train field, a decision that should have been decisive.
The Mercedes later went into the box and landed behind the vettel, but he survived Hamilton after a short radar and radar manoeuvre, where the Ferrari pilot, struggling to release the inside of the inside, risked two movements to protect the third curve.
Max stops started at one of the back places of the field and lay seven on his 21st birthday after the end of the first round.
He was then for a large part of the race of the fastest because he kept on his tracks to finish fast and to hold Kimi raikkonen for the fourth place.
Finally, he went into the 44th round into the box and did not allow it to take a step in the remaining eight rounds, while raikkonen finished as a fourth.
It was a difficult day because Valtteri has been doing a great job all week and how a true gentleman has treated me when he was supposed to do so.
The team has worked very hard to achieve a double victory," said Hamilton.
A case of really bad body language
On Saturday, President Donald Trump made himself pleased at a election event about Senator Diane Feinstein, who was required to present Christine Blasey Ford, in which he appealed to the candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, not to give the press a copy of the letter.
At the event in West Virginia, President Ford spoke not directly before the Senate's Justice Committee, but commented that the proceedings in the Senate showed that people are “common, bossy and dishonest”.
“A thing that could happen and the wonderful thing that has happened in the past few days in the Senate is when you see the forest when you see people who are angry and angry and bickering and rude,” said the President.
“When you look at the leaks and then you say: “Oh, I wasn’t.
I wasn't."
Do You Remember?
Diane Feinstein, were you responsible for the Leak?
Think about your answer... Publish the document - “Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I haven't published it."
Okay, just a minute.
We've... no, we haven't published it," he added by taking the vote of the senator.
Feinstein was joined with Ford's charges against Kavanaugh in July and was published in early September. However, Feinstein argues that the Leak comes from her office.
"I have not hidden Dr. Ford's allegations, I have not published your story," Feinstein said according to The Hill to the Committee.
"She asked me to keep the letter secret and I have to speak to her request for confidentiality."
Her dementia seemed to be not welcome to the president, who said on Saturday evening at the election: “I tell you something that was a very bad body language.
Maybe she didn't do it, but it was the worst body language I've ever seen."
In his continued defense of the right-of-law candidate, who was accused of sexual abuse by three women, the Democrats claimed that they would use the charges for their own purposes.
“They are determined to withdraw the power with all means.
You see the community, the evil, they don't care who hurt them when they're thrown under the wheels to get power and control," said the President, mediate.

Patrick Dwyer reached two gates for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars made the landing on Friday in the Elite League against the Belfast Giants by a 5:3 victory in the back game in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants headed early with two towers, after meeting with Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought the team together before four reconnaissance of the Giants.
Francois Bouchard looked forward to Dundee before Lucas Lundvald Nielsen won the victory with two towers.
This was for the men of Adam Keefe who suddenly beat Dundee on Friday 2-1 in Belfast, the third downlet in the Elite League in the season.
This was the fourth meeting of the season between the two teams, where the Giant won the three previous parties.

In this exciting opening phase, Sullivan brought the team back to the game after 13:10 minutes before Matt Marquartt Cownie joined his competitor after 15:16 minutes.
By four, the leadership of the Giants was assured before the half-time break when he reached his second gate shortly before the end of the first half of the evening.

Fluvolts died after he made sure that hundreds of people escaped the earthquake in a plane
A plane in Indonesia is celebrated as a hero after he found the death to start a plane with hundreds of people on board safely.
Over 800 people die and many are missing after the island of Sulawesi was hit on Friday by a devastating earthquake that triggered a tsunami.
Strong afterbbebebebe is still breathing in the region and many people are trapped under drummers in the city of Palu.
Although his colleagues have fled to save your life, 21-year-old Anthony Gunawan refused to leave his posts in the heavily changing control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu.
He remained to be sure that the flight 6321 from Batik Air, which was at the time on the starting road, could safely pass over.
Then he jumped out of the tower when he thought he was stealing.
Agung died in the hospital later.
Johanne Sirait, speaker of the Indonesian Aviation Safety Service, stated that this decision could have saved hundreds of lives, according to Australia's ABC News.
“We have provided a helicopter from Balikapan in Kalimantan to get him a bigger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately he died this morning before the helicopter could reach Palu.
We are deeply concerned about this message," he added.
At the same time, the authorities feared that the number of deaths could increase to several thousand. The country's disaster protection authority stated that access to the cities of Doghía, Sigi and Butung is limited.
“The number is likely to increase, as many bodies are still under the drums, while others cannot be reached,” said the speaker of the Sutopo Purwo Nugroho Authority.
For reasons of up to 6 meters, Palu has disappeared, which will be held a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft carry supplies and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35 - year - old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute a new car comes with death.
Pure drinking water is scarce.
Supermarkets are being pulverized."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, CNN stated: “The Indonesian Red Cross is committed to helping survivors, but we do not know what they will find there.
This is already a tragedy, but it could be even worse."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo came to Palu on Sunday and said in a speech before the country's military: “I ask you to work all day and night to perform all the tasks involved in evacuation.
Since you're ready?" said CNN.
This year Indonesia has already been hit by earthquakes in Lombok, where more than 550 people have died.
Air Niugini air traffic control in Micronesia: Air Niugini is now reported by an air traffic controller in Lagune
The airline that carried out the flight, which drove into a peaceful lagoon in Micronesia, is now reported by a loser after it first claimed that all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the sinking aircraft.
Air Niugini stated in a statement that they cannot say anything about the stay of a passenger until Saturday afternoon.
The airport offered to work with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats were helped by the rescue of other passengers and crew members after the aircraft was pushed into the water at the Chuuk Island airport while trying to land.
Officials admitted that seven persons had to be taken to a hospital.
The airline indicated that on Saturday there were still six passengers in the hospital but were in a stable state.
The cause and the exact outcome of the accident remain unclear.
The airlines and the U.S. Navy both stated that the aircraft landed shortly before the train landed in Lagune.
Some of the witnesses thought the plane was flying out of the train.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said that the plane was flying very fast.
"That's a very good thing," said Jaynes.
Jaynes explained that he and others were able to wash the sides of the sinking aircraft by means of heavy water.
He said that the pilots were shouting and screaming at panic and that he had a smaller head injury.
U.S. Navy reported that Matroses, who worked near the improvement of an elevator station, threw a floating boat into the coast to help people get to the coast before the plane fell in about 30 meters (100 ft) deep water.
The flight safety data can be found that 111 people have come to life in shock from airlines registered in Papua New Guinea, but none of them happened to Air Niugini.
Analyst rebuilds the night's run, in which a woman was burned alive
On Saturday, the complaint closed its evidence in the recasting of a case where a man is alleged to have married a woman from Mississippi in 2014.
The analyst of the U.S. Ministry of Justice Paul Rowlett spoke for hours as an expert in the field of information evaluation.
He told the jury how he rebuilt the movements of the 29-year-old accused Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on their death night.
Rowlett said to have positions from different phones that showed that Tellis was with Chambers on the night of her death. This contradicts his previous statements, says the newspaper Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his phone was at Chambers, in which he offered to be with his friend Michael Sanford, the police spoke to Sanford.
On Saturday, Sanford entered the witness station and said that he had not been in the city on the day.
When the prosecutors asked whether Tellis had told the truth when he claimed to be in Sanford's pick-up tonight, Sandford said he had lied, "because my pick-up was in Nashville."
Another argument was that Tellis suggested that at her death, Chambers should have known her at the time of her death two weeks.
But phone records showed that they could do it for a week.
Rowlett explained that Tellis sometimes after Chambers' death his messages, calls and contact information were released from his phone.
"He dragged her out of his life," Hale said.
The defense will probably start on Sunday.
The judge concludes that the procedure is due on this day before the jury.
The High Width: What is Aware Hip Hope?
A Hip Hop-Trio wants to challenge the negative image of the genre by filling its music with positive messages.
The High Breed from Bristol claimed that Hip Hop has removed himself from his sources of political message and social commitment.
They want to go back to their roots and make a socially conscious hip hop again.
Artists like The Fugees and Common in the United Kingdom have recently experienced a Renaissance by such artists as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black one?!
New Yorker girls apologize for being released after "racist" SMS
A New York girl complains a couple of discriminations after she received a failed mother's message, in which she complained she was "one more black".
The couple struggle to be racist and compare the legal struggle with “erpression”.
The two-time mother Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman expressed her frustration when she found out that the new mother, Giselle Maurice, was black when she attended her first day of work in 2016.
"NOEEEEEEEEEEEE, NOT ONE SCHWARZE," wrote Plasco-Flaxman to her husband in a text message.
Instead of sending this to her husband, she sent the message to Maurice twice.
After acknowledging her fauxpass, she dismissed the "deeply affected" Plasco-Flaxman Maurice and claimed that the closed Afro-American daily mother had done bad work and had waited for a Filipino instead, the New York Post.
Maurice was paid for her workday and then sent home with an uber.
Maurice now accuses the couple of damages for the release and makes a claim for damages for the 350 dollars per day, which she would have spent over six months in the job for which she was originally booked, but without contract, and for those she had lived with.
"I want to show them, see how you don't do it," she said on Friday, "I know that discrimination is."
The couple showed the racist prejudices back, and argued that the release of the sensible step was because they feared Maurice after they had persuaded them not to trust anymore.
“My wife sent her something she didn’t want to say.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists," explained husband Joel Plasco of the Post.
“But would you trust your children in a person who was powerless against them even if it was from sight?
Your newborn baby?
Come on."
Plasco compared the legal struggle with “expression” and explained that his wife was expecting a baby in just two months and was “in a difficult situation”.
“Do you want to care for such a person?
This is not very nice," the investment banker added.
As the legal struggle continued, the couple was quickly judged in public and appealed to the social media where they were criticized for their behavior and logic.
The publishers of Paddington feared that readers would not be identified with a talking bear, including a new letter
Karen Jankel, daughter of author Michael Bond, who was born shortly after adoption of the book, said of the letter: “It’s hard to translate into someone who read it for the first time before it was published.
Today it is very important with our knowledge of Paddington's great success today."
She said that her father, who had worked as a cameraman for the BBC before being inspired by a small toys bear to write the book of children, had no problem with it, would have been denied his work and added that the 60th anniversary of the publication after his death in the last year was "bitersh".
She explained that her father was secretly proud of Paddington's success, which she described as “very important family member”.
“He was a very quiet man and did not cry,” Jankel said.
“Because Paddington was so real to him, it was almost as if you had a child that did something special: you are proud even if it wasn’t really your own performance.
I think he saw Paddington's success like this.
Although he found him and created him, he always gave Paddington his own responsibility for his success."
My daughter died and I had to accept from her over the phone.
After the country, her daughter was taken to the hospital in Nizza, where the doctors tried to save her life.
“Nad called regularly to say that it really looks bad and that the doctors gave her little chance,” says Ednan-Laperouse.
“Then I received the call from Nad, in which he told me that she would die in the next two minutes and that I had to accept her.
And that's what I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, my dear."
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medicines you have given your doctors to keep your heart on the pumps, slow down and leave your body.
She was recently dead and this was the moment when everything was going down.
I couldn't wait to do anything else while I knew what was going on.
I couldn't cry or cry because I was in a situation where I was surrounded by families and other people.
I really had to get together."
Finally, Ednan-Laperouse, who now suffered the loss of her daughter, went to the airport with the other passengers who had nothing to do with what she had done.
"No one knew it," she said.
I've had my head down, and trains have been taking me all the time over the walls.
It is difficult to explain, but it was during the flight when I received this overwhelming feeling of sympathy for nad.
That he needed my love and my understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Tragic women depend on cards to prevent suicide on bridges
Two women who have lost a suicide attempt to stop others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelley Humphreys depend on a bridge in Wales with inspiring messages and telephone numbers for consulting sites.
Davis son Tyler was 13 years old when he began to suffer from depression and was only 18 when he committed suicide.
"I don't want parents to feel the way I feel every day," she explained.
The 45-year-old Davis, who lives in Lydney, said her son was leading a promising career as a cook and he had an exciting smile.
“Everyone knew him for his smiles.
They all said that his smiles could get a room."
However, he preached his work before his death because he was “in a really dark place. ”
In 2014, Tyler's body was found after the suicide of his 11-year-old brother.
Davis said: "I was always afraid that this could have an effect."
Davis designed the cards “to show people that there are people who can go and talk to them even if they are a friend.
Don't be silent: you have to talk about it."
Humphreys, who has been friends with Davies for years, lost her partner Mark, whom she was with for 15 years, shortly after her mother died.
"He didn't say he felt down or depressed," she said.
“A few days before Christmas we noticed a change in his behavior.
On Christmas Day he was at the deep point. When the children took off their gifts, he did not see them in the eyes or anything."
She said that his death was a great tragedy for her but that she had to be through: “It saves a huge hole in the family.
It's breaking us up.
But we all have to go on and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future in the Sweebe while the FBI starts with findings
"I thought if we could actually get something like this because he asked why, so a time-limited investigation, maybe we could get a little bit of income," says Flake on Saturday. He was afraid that the Committee in the political position would be "inconsisteive".
Why did Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want any information from the FBI?
Your wishes can only go back to Timing.
The mid-elections on 6 November are only five weeks away. If the Republicans are expected to break up badly, they would be significantly weaker in their attempts to choose their husband in the highest court of the country.
George W. Bush caught up with his phone audience to call senators and convince them to support Kavanaugh. This had worked in the White House for Bush and was introduced by his wife Ashley, the personal secretary of Bush.
What happens after the FBI submits its report?
There is a vote in the Senate where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are currently sitting.
It is still unclear whether Kavanaugh can bring together at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, Vice-President, to decide on equality and confirm him for the Supreme Court.
Number of North Korean passengers 'ink' under Kim
The number of North Korean crossings to South Korea has decreased since Kim Young-un came to power seven years ago, so a South Korean politician.
Park Byeong-safe, which is based on data from the South Korean Reunification Ministry, stated that last year 1127 survivors were registered, compared to 2706 in 2011.
Park called for stricter border controls between North Korea and China as well as higher prices of human mugs as main factors.
Pjøngjang was not public enough to do so.
The vast majority of the passengers from the north are finally offered the South Korean citizenship.
Seoul notes that since the end of the Korean Empire in 1953 more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border.
Most of them fly across China, which has the longest border with North Korea, which is easier to cross than the heavily protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Korean states.
China considers the transiter to be more illegal than illegal immigrants because they are refugees and often lead them back with violence.
The relations between the north and the south, which are technically still in war, have improved significantly over the last few months.
At the beginning of the month, the two Heads of State in Pjøngjang met to discuss the proposed nuclear-related negotiations.
This was followed by the historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in June in Singapore, where they generally agreed to work on a denuclearized Korean peninsula.
On Saturday, however, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed the US sanctions for the lack of progress.
"Without trust in the United States, we have no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances it is impossible for us to put ourselves together first," said Mir Ri in a speech before the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and says he is not suitable for the Supreme Court's office.
The minority leader of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, called Justice's candidate Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said that he was not properly qualified for the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I couldn’t deny the impression that a woman who had been treated as such would have been referred to as ‘hysterical’,” said Pelosi about her reaction to the words of Kavanaugh before the Senate's Justice Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh complained emotionally and in a way that he had been sexually abused by Dr. Christine Blasey Ford as both teenagers.
During his opening hours, Kavanaugh was very emotional. Sometimes he almost cried and was about to break out in tears when he spoke from his family and his high school time.
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats in the Committee and called the charges against him a "great and co-ordinated robbery", organised by Liberals, who had been the presidential election of Hillary Clintons lost in 2016.
Pelosi said she believed that Kavanaugh's statement proved that he could not serve at the Supreme Court because she showed that he was committed to democracies.
"I believe that he has made himself known to himself for the inconsequential reasons and the way and ways he has dealt with the Clintons and the Democrats," she said.
Pelosi wondered if she would try to contain Kavanaugh from the office, he should be confirmed and the Democrats should win the majority in the House of Representatives.
“I will say so much: if he does not tell the Congress or the FBI the truth, then he is not only inappropriate for the Supreme Court, but also for his current judges,” says Pelosi.
Kavanaugh is a current judge at the Federal Court of Justice in Washington, D.C.
Pelosi further said that as a Democrat she was concerned about possible decisions Kavanaughs made against the deportable Care Act or the operating principle decision Roe v. Wade was considered to be a conservative judge.
In his hearings, Kavanaugh raised questions as to whether he would review certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
“We do not need a hysterical, superior person who goes to this court and expects us to say, ‘I am not wonderful’,” says Pelosi.
Women have to use it as a weapon.
It's a true hatered, months and years of the overcooking forest and it doesn't get out without wine.
"We won when we were born," said stone to me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's rare, and you?"
She continued: “I was helped a lot by a woman who was some manager and said that she also drank when she became pregnant but developed a technique. If she became pregnant and began to drink, she said to the person she said: “She may think I’m sad because I’m drunk.
I'm thirsty."
And then she just keeps talking.
I found it great."
Trains are allowed as a valve for zorn because they are completely misunderstood.
One of my clearest memories is at a former job, in an office dominated by men, where one day I was burned by an unrecrisable forest and by an older woman, an under-retired manager, before which I was always a little scared, packed into the armpit and dragged into a wooden house.
"Never let her see that you're drunk," she said to me.
“They don’t know you’re thinner.
They believe that you are sad and will be satisfied because they believe you have gone to the substance."
Patricia Schroeder, a convention organizer from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential candidates.
In 1987, when a ship's board with the name of Monkey Business was discovered at an extraordinary deal and its candidate was withdrawn, the most frustrated trader argued that there was no reason to take into account the idea of the presidential candidate himself.
"That was not a well thought-out decision," she said to me 30 years later with a smile.
There were already seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone called the situation 'Schneeweitchen and the seven bears'.
Since the election campaign was already underway, it was behind the media creation and it was reluctant not to apply if it did not meet $2 million.
It was an invisible struggle.
She found that some of her supporters, who spent $1,000 on men, only supported her campaign with $250.
"Do you believe I'm getting a discount?" she asked herself.
In the speech in which she announced no official campaign to start, she was so moved by her emotions, gratitude for her supporters, frustration over the system which made the media creation and direct address of the delegates so difficult, as well as the light about sexism, so that she was near the trains.
"I could have admitted that I had a nervous breakdown," Schroeder recalls the press actions.
“You could have believed that my sponsor had been the bag maker Kleineex.
I still remember asking myself what they would probably write on my gravestone.
"She won't?"
Why Beijing could benefit from the trade war between the United States and China
The openings of the trade war between the United States and China were overwhelming. Although the battle is not over long, Beijing could benefit from a grave between countries in a long term, my experts.
Donald Trump, the US President, burned the first warning committee at the beginning of the year when he imposed important Chinese export goods, including solar cells, steel and aluminium, with fines.
The most important settlement took place this week with new fines on goods worth $200 billion, which has effectively affected half of all goods imported from China into the United States.
Beijing won every time in the same way back and soon won a fine of five to ten percent on American goods worth $60 billion.
China's challenge is to respond to every US measure and it is unlikely that the world's second largest economic power will soon collapse.
Washington to move to join, it would mean to be followed. However, it would be too much fun for Chinese President Xi Jinping for the US.
However, my experts say that if Beijing plays its cards well, China can benefit from the long-term effects of the trade war by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
“The fact that a fast political decision could either create conditions for economic turbulence in both countries in Washington or Beijing is actually much more dangerous than many observers have seen before,” says Abigail Grace, a scientific staff member who concentrates on New American Security in Asia.
Syria is 'prepared' for the return of refugees, so the Foreign Minister
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and asks for help in rebuilding the country's war that lasted more than seven years.
In a speech before the General Assembly of the United Nations, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moulam stated that the situation in the country would improve.
"Today the situation on the ground is more stable and safer thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government is building again the areas that have been destroyed by terrorists in order to bring about normality.
All conditions have now been given for the voluntary return of refugees to the country which they had to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures aimed at their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UNO estimates that over 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country need humanitarian help.
Al-Moulem said that the Syrian government welcomed assistance in rebuilding the affected country.
However, he stressed that there would be no provision for aid from countries which supported the rebellion.
Europe won a victory at the Ryder Cup in Paris
A team Europe won the Ryder Cup 2018 and won a team from 16.5 to 10.5 in Le Golf National near Paris.
The United States has now lost six consecutive times on European soil and no ryder Cup has won in Europe since 1993.
Europe won the crown back after the Danish Captain Thomas Bjorn team reached the 14.5 points needed to win the US.
The U.S. Star Phil Mikkelson, who had a major problem with the tournament, reduced his defeat on the 16th train (Par 3) in the water and lost against Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari was able to shine in all its rounds and was one of 4 players who achieved a 5-0-0 since the tournament started in its current format in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was hit by 5:4 by the player with the lowest ranking in the team Europe, Thorbjörn Olesen from Denmark.
The player with the world's best ranking, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 to 1 against the English Ian Poulter, who played his last ryder Cup if possible.
The Spanish Sergio Garcia, Veteran of eight Ryder Cups, became the best European ryder Cup player at all times with 25.5 career points.
“ Normally I didn’t drink, but today I couldn’t hold back.
It was a difficult year.
I am so grateful that Thomas chose me and believed in me.
I'm so happy to win the poker back.
It is about the team and I am glad to have contributed," says the emotional Garcia after the European victory.
He continues to win the case at his Landsmann John Ram, who won the unique contest against the American golf legend Tiger Woods on Sunday 2:1.
I'm so proud to have killed Tiger Woods, which I've been following since my childhood on television," says the 23-year-old frame.
Woods lost all his four games in France and now has a Ryder Cup balance of 13-21-3.
A remarkable statistics for one of the greatest players of all time who has won 14 important titles and only gets over Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team had the whole week's problems of finding the Fairways, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who have performed high-quality services throughout the tournament.
U.S. Captain Jim Furyk said after a surprising performance of his team: “I am proud of the boys they have fought.
There was a time this morning when we put Europe under pressure.
We didn't do anything about it.
It's for Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All of his 12 players left a good performance.
We'll regroup, I'll talk to the PGA America and our Ryder Cup Committee and we'll look forward.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be her captain.
You have to take the hat.
We were defeated."
