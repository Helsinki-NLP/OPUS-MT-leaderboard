Members of the Welsh parliament were worried that 'just like a supported video club'
Some members of the parliament were concerned when they heard a hearing saying that they would be called MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
This is the result of an attempt to change the name of Parliamentary Wellsh.
All members of the parliament are concerned about whether they will become people's voices.
A member of the parliament from one Labour party said his group was worried because it was "warning against Twp and Pwp".
For readers outside Wales: In Welsh, twp means stupid and pwp means diku.
Members of the parliament from the Plaid party also said that all members were "not happy" and offered other suggestions.
A Wellsh tradition expert said his group had "open mind" about the change in the name, but he says that the MWP and Muppet are too close.
In this context, the letter "w" in Welsh is the same as the letter "u" in English in Yorkshire.
The Committee of Parliament, which has enacted legislation to include changes in the name now, says: "It is clear that only the members of the Parliament will be the last to speak about what will be called the Members of the Parliament."
The Wales Government Act 2017 authorized the Welsh Parliament to change its name.
In June the Commission published the results of the question of citizens' views on the proposals, and it was found that many people supported the call of Parliamentary Wellsh.
With regard to the name to be called by members of the parliament, the Committee's attention was to Parliamentary Wellsh or WMP, but MWP was the most supportive option when asked what the population was thinking.
The members of the parliament also seem to have other suggestions, but the head of President Elin Jones, who should present the bill on change within a few weeks, may be in a position to discuss a specific search.
The reform law also mentions some changes in the way the parliament works, such as the rules on the removal of members of the parliament from their seats and the Commission's system.
When members of the parliament are arguing about this bill, they can vote for the final vote on the name to call them.
The Macedonian voters vote during a public poll on the change in the name of the country
This Sunday the voters will choose whether their country's name will be "Northern Macedonia's Republic".
The decades of drought in the neighboring country, Greece, which has a territory called Macedonia, are now due to this public trial.
The authorities in Athens have long confirmed that its territory is under attack by its neighbours in the north, but has consistently challenged the last request for membership of the European Union and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who opposes the public's request to change the name, said that he would consider it as if there were no such stone.
However, public opinion supporters, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say that this change is only required by the European Union and NATO.
St. Martin's Creed Hidden When the Churches in Harlem Face War
"As the story goes, the older ones who talked to me said that all the streets had access to drinking houses and congregations," said Atoa Adams.
"Now it's gone."
I can only say that it caused the drinking house to go down.
"People's way of communication has changed so much" he says.
"It's still too late to make the drinking house a permanent living room."
For the congregation again, he is concerned that the money paid by the church authorities will not last as long as they are sold out, "so soon or soon they will return from the beginning."
The church itself, he said, could replace the building people with rooms to clean up, so that these kinds of people would not be disturbed by the remaining sacred places around them.
"The majority of people who buy housing in these buildings will soon be forced into prison," he said, "so it is certain that the day of the end of these congregations will soon end because they are not sure that most of the people who come to live there will enter church."
These two congregations were built by a white concierge, when Harlem – a large city in 1870 was not yet a black city, and became St. Martin ten years later.
In the 1930 ’ s, the white Methodist church was removed.
At that time, the house was owned by a black faith movement that soon gathered.
Rev. John Howard Johnson led the black congregation that received St. Martin, this guard led the population to stay away from the 125th Street participants, the most powerful street in Harlem, because they prevented black workers from receiving or expanding black.
The building was very expensive in 1939, but when the church members of Mopera Johnson were able to rebuild it, they were able to handle many of the roofs.
Rev. David Johnson, the cousin of Mopera Johnson and behind him at St. Martin, has even been proud to call this "small-fashioned generation."
On the other hand, the expert who pointed to many of the roots in July: "Early culture" and "unrepresentable historical knowledge."
This specialist, Tiffany Ng from Michigan University, also noted, that this is the first number of black holes discovered by black people on earth, is Dionysio A. Lind, who moved to the most large ones in the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Toa Merriweather said that St. Martin was no longer looking for people to replace him.
In a few months when the situation in St. Martin was somewhat disturbed by the conflict between the building system and the building company, some of whom were members of the church, others were members of the Episcopal Dioscopal.
The church councils — the church’s management office, including the board of directors — wrote to the church in July that the church was "seeking to move the church’s unsubstantiated agenda", but no church council had entered into the agreement with the building system and the construction company of the diocese.
Some churchmen complained about the lack of attention from the goddess.
The 13-year-old boy who was raped by a witch doctor in California
A 13-year-old boy in California was injured by an assailant on the day of an outbreak of an armed conflict, the authorities said.
The accident occurred on 7:00 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
According to Chad Hammel's story on KSWB-TV in San Diego, they've been busy for half an hour since the morning hearing the boy who had been crying suddenly, and many of them have died quickly to approach him and get him out of the water.
I thought she was so happy that she got shots, Hammel said, but then she thought she'd call it "I'm busy!"
I'm trapped!'
Her neck was completely rolled out," Hammel thought when he came near the boy.
"I called very hard to get out of the water quickly: 'There is ice in the water!' Hammel just said.
The boy was sent by a plane to save Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, and his life was said to be still very troubled.
It is not clear what kind of stranger he was kept behind.
Capt. Larry Giles said during the interview with the journalist that there was a ghost in the area a few weeks ago, but it is known that it is not the kind of alien that keeps people alive.
The upper part of the victim's body is very high as a result of the hit by Giles.
The authorities decided that it would not be possible to travel 48 hours before the seabed of Ponto Beach in Casablad and Swami's in Ecinitas for the investigation and protection of human life.
There are more than 135 species of birds in the region, but most of them are not believed to be human beings.
Saninsbury's campaign is moving into the U.S. fashion market
Sainsbury's has come to compete with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams and uses a range of animal-care facilities similar to a large store and a special-skilled animal-care provider.
In an effort to find a place in the U.S. biodegradation market of 2.8 billion Livres, which does not increase as the retail and retail market increases, larger areas will be made available on 11 markets across the country, and will be moved to other markets if it seems successful.
At the time of the big market's search for ways to use television stations, four à micro-ondes and its most ancient inventions have come to use money in the modern form.
Saninsbury's said it would increase its sales volume twice, which would be up to 3,000 times, and would be marked by such characters as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw, which they will find.
The types of goods already seen like L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also get more space and bring special features like those seen on the news such as Boots.
This major market also re-lists the types of products for cultivation in the store to ensure special concern for those who do not accept the product of sale – according to an increasing demand from young professionals.
In addition, two French shop seafarers will compete for a special trade appointment in the Saninsbury magazine, and the first opened in Croydon, south of London last week, and the second will open at the end of this year in Selly Oak, Birmingham.
So as the number of people who choose to go online and buy more food each day in the city market is increasing, major markets have to work hard to reduce the number of visitors.
According to Mike Coupe, General Tale of Saninsbury's, their sales will continue to be similar to major markets, according to the efforts of large-scale companies against key players such as Aldi and Lidl through more services and food products.
The Saninsbury's sales of Argos have produced many magazines, and many Habits have been adding them since they bought the two magazines over the past two years, claiming that the sales of daily goods have increased significantly and the market value of their markets has increased.
The former efforts of this major magazine to give new life to the physical and medical aspects of it have been thwarted.
In the early 2000s, Saninsbury's tried to co-operate with Boots, but destroyed the cooperation of the trade union on the distribution of money in the medical journals of its major stores.
This new order was born three years ago when Sanisbury's 125 million Livres sold to Celesio, owner of Lloyds Pharmacy's network, the 281 pharmaceutical network he owned.
He announced that Lloyds would have a role in that format, which would help a wider range of plants for respectable red tapes such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
In particular, Paul Mills-Hicks, director of sales at Saninsbury's, says: "We have completely changed the external appearance and experience of our home-based fashioning environment to make our customers feel better.
We also used our entire money with the staff who received special training, who are always ready to make suggestions.
The needs of all of us have a profound effect and because of the warm and acceptable place in the public we have become an indispensable place for physical maintenance, so we change the traditional style of exercise."
Peter Jones was 'strongly scared' when Holly Willoughby signed the 11 million-Livres deal
Peter Jones, the most famous actor in Dragons Den because Holly Willoughby, a television programme provider, had rejected the 11 million Livres deal with his business of life, because he wanted to focus on his new relationship with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time for Truly's character as a rapist and boss.
People said the sale made by both parties was similar to Goop's character to Gwyneth Paltrow's.
This Morning program, which is now 37 years old, is in Instagram, said that he has resigned from the agreement.
Peter Jones, the most famous actor in Dragons Den, was deeply disappointed by Holly Willoughby's failure in the last second to the life-sustainment company – he turned his attention to the new agreement he had made with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Jones was said to be "strongly disappointed" when he accepted the young television broadcaster at a meeting that balanced Tuesday at the headquarters of his major company in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, as a result of the new agreements he was able to reach up to 1.5 billion Livres – he no longer has time to rely on the figure Truly housekeepers and landlords.
People compared the sale to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop and it was thought that Willoughby's size would increase by about 11 million Livres.
On a private plane, Jones left Britain to save one of his mobile homes, says Willoughby, who is now 37 years old, in Instagram, will leave Truly.
One source says: "Truly was the first to be proud of Holly.
This is exactly what its long-term future will require, so it will be secure for ten years to come.
Everyone will be punished if they hear their decision to leave.
No one believed that the Day had come to an end, since the date was about to be opened.
There's a magazine full of goods ready to sell at Marlow's headquarters."
According to experts, this morning's release of the provider, which is one of Britain's most money-producing stars for money spent on different products such as coins, clothing and clothing, could lead to millions of deaths for companies, and perhaps to slow down the start date.
They may also end up being friends for a long time.
Because Jones and Tara Capp have been close friends with Willoughby, who have been born three years, and Dan Baldwin's husband.
Capp and Willoughby built Truly together in 2016, and in March Jones, 52, came to the site of Tale.
Both of them are walking slowly and Jones has 40 percent money in Baldwin's network producer company.
Willoughby will now see the location of the M&S character ambassador and will replace Ant McPartlin with the I'm A Celebrate program on ITV.
A news source near Jones last night said, "We can't talk about her business."
More words 'from now on but we love each other'
He criticized his journalist for making a comment that people might consider not to be "principal" and for having hope of North Korea's president.
Why was President Trump so angry?
Atoa Trump replied and took it like the sound of a "new provider".
"I didn't take it for granted."
Kim wants to hold a second meeting, when Atoa Trump said that their first meeting in Singapore was a major step towards the elimination of nuclear weapons in North Korea in June.
But the nuclear-weapon-free debate is still under way.
More than three months after the high meeting in Singapore in June, the highest diplomat in North Korea, At Ri Yong Ho, announced before the United Nations Summit on Saturday that North Korea had not yet seen "competitive steps" in its first steps towards producing weapons.
He even says the US is going to punish us more severely.
There is more hope than that Trump's speech in his speech during the campaign.
"We are very good with North Korea," he said.
"We have already gone to war reading in North Korea.
Nearly a million people have lost their lives.
But now we have a good relationship with them."
They said they were successful in their efforts to improve Kim's relationship – stopped the fusée attempt, freed the prisoners and deported the US military base.
And she strongly defended the unusual view she showed when talking about her relationship with Kim.
"It's easy to behave like the President, but let's see 200 people standing here, as if 10,000 people out there are not in this area that I've been working on," Trump said, and pointed to the people who were facing him.
An island in Indonesia has been devastated by tsunamis and earthquakes, hundreds of deaths
After the earthquake in Lombok, for example, non-governmental organizations received messages that they did not need their help.
Although more than 10 percent of the population in Lombok have been injured, there has been no natural disaster announcements, but it is necessary to provide international assistance.
"It is often sad that they have said clearly that they do not ask for international help, so we are very serious," Rtoa Sumbung says.
Although Save the Children are already preparing a team to go to Palu, foreign workers are not yet clearly aware of whether they can work locally.
Atoa Sutopo, head of the natural disaster management office, said that the Indonesian authorities are still looking closer to the situation in Palu to see if permission is granted to assist international offices.
In view of the constant terror of Indonesia, the country's unwillingness to deal with the anger of nature can be a real threat.
True, there is a shelter if there are tsunamis in Aceh, but it is not to be found in the city that creates other lakes.
The fact that there is no alarm in Palu may be one of the rise in the number of people who have died, even though there have been warnings issued.
Even when there is no problem at all, it is difficult to travel to many islands in Indonesia.
Natural disasters have become more and more difficult to deal with.
A hospital ship in Lombok was planning to care for the victims of the earthquake that had arrived in Palu, but it would be at least three days to arrive at the disaster site.
President Joko Widododo focused on improving the routine structure in Indonesia during his campaign for elections, and he added money and construction to roads and roads.
It is very difficult for today's Joko regime but lack of financial support, especially in the coming years, to face a new election.
The conflict of different religions in Indonesia is still a problem for Joko, as many Muslims live their faith in a more traditional way.
More than 1,000 people lost their lives or fled the consequences of the Christian and Muslim conflicts around the street, using knives, other handguns.
See: Daniel Sturridge killed Liverpool's player in the far-reaching battle against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from being killed by Chelsea at the Premier League on Saturday because of the fast ball in the 89th minute of the Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received an offer from Xherdan Shaqiri when she was 27 metres away from Chelsea's port, which led 1-0.
She gave the ball to the left first, which she had just tried hard to save the most distant tree.
The ball rose high, saved its right foot from the tail.
But then the ball went down top of Kepa Arrizabalaga, which flew high and entered into the trap.
"I was just trying to save the place where, to get the ball, players like Shaq are always playing ball as soon as possible, which is why I tried to create as long as possible for myself," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante approaching and I remember the ball once again, and then I didn't think I'd come back to it."
Chelsea was led by 1-0 at the funeral because the 25-minute star, Belize Eden Hazard, died of a balloon.
At that time, the Blues attacker returned the ball offered by Matthew Kovacic, then walked quickly near the center of the stadium and was very close to Liverpool's supporters.
In the middle of the field, Kovacic offered a ball and ran away immediately.
Then he went to several players and led Hazard to reach the top of the tree.
Hazard did not miss the race on his side so he came to the top of the tree and left the ball to escape from Alison Becker, Liverpool’s seven-year-old.
Liverpool will face Napoli on the 3nd afternoon of the three-day anniversary of the war in the Champions League, in the San Paolo district of Naples, Italy.
In the afternoon, Chelsea will meet Videoton in London, in the UEFA Europe League.
The number of deaths from tsunamis in Indonesia is 832
The number of people who lost their lives as a result of earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia is 832, says the Natural Disaster Bureau in the morning.
Many people have been said to have not been released from the earthquake’s 7.5 earthquake shelter on Friday, which caused seabeds up to 6 meters [6 m], says Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the press conference.
The city of Palu, where there are more than 380,000 inhabitants, is covered by potatoes and trees from broken houses.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man who killed a woman in a wheelchair
The investigation opened after seeing the woman's death in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
The woman's 44-year-old body is full of fever when someone sees a 7-hour and 55-minute-old in Grayson Mews, John Street, and a 32-year-old man is arrested because he is worried about killing her.
The police asked to approach them who may have seen or heard anything.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan says: 'The investigation is still under way, but it motivates those around us who may have seen or heard something that concerns me to come to us.
I'm also calling for someone, especially the transporters, to receive a photo from his car that can help with our research.”
The police officer confirmed that the dead woman lived in Birkenhead and was found in the house.
This afternoon a friend was thought to be familiar with the local lady who asked where she was going to see her death this morning.
The investigation is still under way, so the police said they are now reporting news to the victim's relative.
A trainer living in Grayson Mews was about to return home but the police stopped because no one was allowed to enter or leave the former house.
He's upset when he knows what happened next.
The residents are now informed that they may be able to return home for hours.
A man was told by the police that a whole area is now considered a crime scene.
A woman came to the place and cried.
He kept saying that it was a disaster.
Two days later there were two police cars in the outlying area, and another car waiting outside.
On the other hand, several police were standing in the outlying area, watching the entire building.
News reporters are asked to send direct messages to @MerPolCC, call 101 or send anonymous news to Crimesstoppers by number 0800 555 111 to report the 247 case on September 30.
Cromwell's Parliamentary Web site is the last to be hit by the section 'rewrote history'
The creation seems to have returned to the poetic form, as a result of its destruction in the same way as the Taliban did in England of the cultural and religious roots of its followers who claimed to be religious heretics.
The Cromwell Society said the proposal from Atoa Crick "was stupid" and "in order to re-write history"
Today John Goldsmith, quoted by the Cromwell Association, stated: "The debate on the collection of stones has not been able to come up in this debate but must also be discussed by Oliver Cromwell before the Westminster House.
However, Cromwell did not order or perform photo and stone damages during the War in England.
Cromwell is not to be sacrificed for what Thomas had done so badly in the past century.
The beauty of Cromwell's appearance by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft and the concrete evidence for the 19th century and some of the photographs of a prominent person who is now believed to be worthy of celebration.
Today Goldsmith declared The Sunday Telegraph: "Many people today, and perhaps even more than most of them in the late 19th century, consider Cromwell to be a defender of the foreign-pressure parliament, in his day it is clear that the king and the king did so.
But it is still a continuing historical debate to this day whether this stone is a real reflection of its true nature.
What is certain first is that the decline in the middle of the 17th century has delayed our country's development, and Cromwell is a well-known form of self-representation.
It should also be celebrated and remembered as a Lord Protector."
A Chinese farmer who died of breast cancer
A farmer lost his life when he threw the dust in a market in the south of China, according to local journalists.
The man, known by the name "Yuan", was killed near the bathroom, and it was found that he had a major blood transfusion on him, he suffered a serious injury at Liupanshui's market in the province of Guizhou, as South China Morning Post said on Sunday.
On May 30, 2005, a customer is preparing to read a case in the retail market in Xining, Qinghai State, China.
It was Wednesday that he and his brother came from Yunnan's area around him to sell 15 cheeses at the market.
The next morning her cousin saw her dead, and she noticed that the door of an apartment was opened.
She saw a big man with a bleeding leg.
In an investigation by the doctor, it was confirmed that the 250-kilogram [250 kilograms] man had pushed the farmer and killed him, reports the report.
"My brother's legs were bleeding and his legs were torn," said his brother, calling the name "Wu," as he said to Guiyang Evening News.
The surveillance film shows that Yuan entered the market at 4:40 mm in the morning.
He died about an hour later.
The animal that killed him wasn't even Yan or his brother.
The market manager told Evening News that the case had already been investigated alone since the local police collected evidence.
It seems that Yuan's family and the market's manager are competing for the price.
In the past, though, there have been occasions when it has been heard that there has been a crime against people.
In 2016 there were married couples surrounded by their native tongue in Massachusetts, and the man was seriously injured.
Ten years ago, a large cat weighed 295 pounds [295 kg] on its tractor used a Welsh farm until her husband fired the animal.
Once again, when a farmer in Oregon was surrounded by a crop in 2012, a farmer in Manitoba told CBC News at the time that it should never be harvested that it could only be "red" if he heard blood.
"He's just playing.
They're game hunters, lovers of adventure... but they don't want to hurt people.
You just need to be careful in front of him," she says.
The rest left in the Rosary will bring much rain to the south of the United States
According to weatherlogists, the Russian weather was reduced by getting more colder water in the south of the northern coast of Mexico.
Nevertheless, Rosa will be bringing water for several days across the north coast of Mexico and the south of the United States.
Rosa's air reached 135km per hour, which is said to be Type 1 Wind in the morning at 5 East hours, and 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
It is thought that Rosa will move north on Sunday.
On the other hand, depression begins to develop in the Pacific Ocean, so the heavy tropical tax is rising near the western coast of the United States as Baja California's head is near Rosa on Monday in a tropical storm, starting to move north to the south of the United States.
Rosa will take up to 25 cm of water every Monday in many parts of Mexico.
After that, due to the relationship between tropical depression and approaching depression, there will be a huge wave of floods to form in the south-western part of the world for several days.
If one area reaches 2.5 cm to 10 cm of water, it will reach a watery river, a stream of floods and floods, and there will always be an earthquake on the ground.
As a result of heavy tropical rains, there will be a water shortage of about 5 cm to 8 cm per hour in some areas, especially in some areas south of Nevada and Arizona.
It is expected that the rain will reach 5 cm to 10 cm in some parts of the south-west, especially around Arizona.
Floods may also be caused by sudden climate degradation as tropical rains are increasing.
It is important to keep walking on the ground constantly because there is a potential for tropical raindrops.
The result of the rains can turn rivers into rivers and there will also be strong winds and floods that result from the heavy rain.
The near depression also brings heavy rains in some areas on the southern coast of California.
There may be up to 1.5 cm of water, which can lead to empty water and to wash the way.
This is the first water source in this area for the north.
Monday morning and Monday morning will start a tropical rain coming near Arizona, before the rain comes down on Monday and Tuesday.
From Tuesday to Wednesday the rain will rise across the Four Corners.
In October, the figures across the United States may change considerably because the Arctic will cool down, but the tropical environment will still burn.
Sometimes it can lead to major changes in characterization in an adjacent location.
This Sunday there was an outstanding example of this dramatic change in characters throughout the central part of the United States.
The difference between Kansas City, Missouri, Omaha, Nebraska, and St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa is almost 20 degrees.
In the next few days, however, the heat left for the year will try to collect and reemerge.
It is expected that the beginning of October will take place for most of the central and eastern regions of the United States, so that the figures in South Lemak are almost 80 degrees to the north-east.
This Tuesday may be 80 degrees in New York City, about 10 degrees above the sun.
It is estimated that far-reaching efforts are likely to be made to rise above the normal sun for the first half of the month of October.
More than 20 million people watch Brett Kavanaugh's prayers
This afternoon more than 20 million people were looking at the sad testimony of Brett Kavanaugh, who was expected to be appointed a member of the Supreme Court, and Christine Blasey Ford, who accused him of acting out of favor in the 1980s on six televisions.
On the other hand, the political reconciliation continues, so the TV decided to report on the most unexpected incident: an agreement made by President Jeff Flake from Arizona to allow the FBI to conduct a weekly investigation into the charges.
In front of the Committee of Laws of the Parliament, Ford stated that he was 100 percent sure that one day he was killed in Kavanaugh and had been trying to take his clothes off during a lycée student's party.
On the other hand, in Kavanaugh he replied, during his testimony not filled with guilt, but he was sure that 100 percent did not exist.
There is no doubt that the more than 20.4 million people that Nielsen reported on Friday followed.
The company called for CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC TV viewers.
However, it is not yet known that the signal for other televisions that sent it directly, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
Nielsen is also often difficult to estimate the number of viewers at work.
If there is a simple comparison, American footballer or Academic Awards is the same.
Fox News Channel has been a source of attention to all televisions, where researchers have found that today's Kavanaugh appointment has been strongly supported, as its viewers have reached 5.69 million lashes during its one-day oral interview, Nielsen says.
ABC, on the other hand, had a population of 3.26 million.
CBS has 3.1 million viewers, NBC has 2.94 million, MSNBC has 2.89 million and CNN has 2.52 million, Nielsen says.
People are still very interested after their prayers.
It was like Flake that everyone focused on the evolution of the history of Friday.
When the office of this moderate President of the Republic said that he would support the Kavanaugh Today at least to do so, CNN and CBS were able to capture him by the protesters if he tried to get into an elevator to save his speech by the Law Commission.
He stood up but watched through the crowd for several minutes, as CNN's TV showed directly.
"I'm standing here before you," said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?
Someone said to him, "You have power, but many women are not able to stand up."
My office has already issued a statement saying that Atoa Flake, and it has added before the elevator closed that there is something else to say during the committee's vote.
All television broadcasts on television and the following month, when the Committee of the Smallest Law on the appointment of the Kavanaugh House for a full-time parliament, were scheduled.
But Blake announced that he would not do that if he refused that the FBI would investigate this person's case during the previous week, according to a few Democrats' request.
President Chris Coons, Democraty, was among those who won the day of Blake's conversation with his friends.
Fleke made a decision after he talked to Atoa Coons and a few bosses later.
There was a force that was the choice of Lake Flake because it seemed that the Republicans would not be enough to accept the appointment of today Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump opened the FBI's investigation into the Kavanaugh Today's charges.
Prime Minister May accused his critics of making a 'political game' about Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of his way out of the European Union of "political games" in the future of Britain and of minimizing the benefits of the country, during a discussion with the Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Theresa May came to the Conservative Party's First Meeting in Birmingham, Britain, September 29, 2018.
In a discussion near one of the prime minister's first page, Boris Johnson, former Foreign Minister, confirmed his complaint by the so-called Chechers format for Brexit, saying that the proposal should be "instinctively foolish" both to Britain and to the European Union.
Wyde Sims shooting: The police arrested Dyteon Simpson, suspected of being a victim of the death of LSU player
The police arrested a person who was suspected of shooting Wade Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player in LSU.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and imprisoned for killing people, says the Baton Rouge Police Agency.
The authorities have released a file containing the conflict between Sims and Simpson, and the police have declared Sims' office lost during the war.
The police took the scene from the crime scene and reported that Simpson's DNA was found there, according to WAFB's report, working for CBS.
When Simpson was taken out of his office, the police announced that he agreed to shoot and killed Wade.
The value of its temporary freedom has been defined as 350,000, says one spokesman.
On Friday, the East Baton Rouge Parish National Bureau issued an interim report on the death of a gun from the head to the store.
This service thanked the crew of prisoners who had escaped from the state police in Louisiana, the state-owned crime lab, the Southern University police and the people around the investigation were able to do this arrest.
But as Joe Alleva, the LSU's athletic leader, thanked the local police for their "his thoughts and intentions."
Sims is now 20 years old.
The 1m82 Baton Rouge is a major power plant, and his father, Wayne, also played basketball in LSU in this city.
During the last year of the game, he took 5.6 and captured 2.6 balls per game in general.
On Friday morning, according to Will Wade, LSU's basketball coach, the team was "too weak" and "hard" when he heard Wade's death.
"That's what worries people all the time," says Atoa Wade.
Volcanoes in Mexico City
The wave from the Popocatepetl volcano has always come to the southern city of Mexico’s capital.
The National Centre for the Prevention of Natural Disasters warned the Mexican people on Saturdays to avoid the volcano because there was an incident in their mouth and 183 cases were recorded in writing within 24 hours.
There are also many sounds and reflections followed by the presence of the nearby eye.
The image of the social network has a thin ceiling covering the traffic patterns of many cities around Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geography and soil researchers believe that the situation in the volcano, which is 72 km south of the capital, has increased since the earthquake that hit 7.1 mark Mexico's center in September 2017.
The volcano called "Don Goyo" has been alive since 1994.
Police and Catalan refugees are fighting to remember the loss of independence
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday when protesters fought against the police for independence, and thousands of those who were involved in street crossings to mark the first year's stalemate by Catalonia were stoned to death.
There were a number of people who had broken up with police opposition officers who were not moving forward, but they were stuck in mud and mud, so the roads should be full of tourists for such a time.
There was also a riot in the afternoon and the police used knives to block those who fought.
For several hours the groups of volunteers who sang "There's no one to forget, there's no crime" were facing the parties to unite the country who complained "Let Spain live for a long time."
More than forty people were treated for minor injuries to protesters, local journalists say.
On October 1, one year after a public trial, Madrid said that it was illegal, but the Catalans celebrated it.
Nearly all voters have chosen to exercise self-determination, but few have come to vote because they refused to take part in the vote against the vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, about 1,000 people were injured last year if police in a violent conflict were to prevent the drop in stones from entering the local stone offices.
There were a number of people who shared their independence during Friday night to stop those who tried to protest in support of the national police.
There was only one road trip but another road had to be used.
68-year-old Narcis Termes, an electric engineer who attended the refugee movement with his wife, said that he no longer believed that Catalonia would be free again one day.
"Last year we had the best thing to do.
I remember my parents losing their joys because they could just throw rocks, but we're already on the way," she says.
Even though Catalan leaders have been able to win a victory, which has taken a small amount of time during the last December elections, this year the party has been concerned about the risk of being held accountable because many of its leaders have become on the ground or in prison for their responsibility in handling the trial and then declaring independence.
Joan Puig, 42-year-old car manufacturer, who records the demonstration to support the police on his cell phone, announced that politicians on his side and on his side are now taking a break.
"You've got to keep your head up in the morning," he said.
On Saturday Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who have been imprisoned since his trial last year, announced that he will be elected to be a member of the European Parliament next year.
"The stand as a candidate for European elections is the best way to read out the hard-and-heavy democratic advantages we see in the Spanish government," he said.
Londonsderry: A gang of men arrested in the house
Three men, 33, 34 and 39 years old, were arrested when a car exploded several times in a house in Londonderry.
This disaster occurred in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at 7 p.m. and some BST.
The door and wall of the house were seriously damaged, says Det Insp Bob Blemmings.
There may also have been a regular boy going to the house this evening.
Livingston has won Rangers 1-0 by Menga
The first ball of Dolly Menga for Livingston won the victory
Livingston's reconnaissance of Rangers, a second defeat for Steven Gerard in 18 games as leader of his Ibrox team.
This was the case of Dolly Menga, as Gary Holt's team was able to match the Hibernian.
Gerrard's team in Premiership has not yet won a win in the country this year and this Sunday they will face Hearts, who have the experience and have an eight-numbered advantage.
Before then, however, the Rangers will take the Rapid Vienna on Thursday, in the European League.
At the same time, Livingston has never been defeated in this recent division game, as Holt's usual winner has been able to win since he gave Kenny Miller a month ago.
Livingston couldn't face the red stranger
Holt's team continued to lead before his death, as their attack had caused a variety of problems for Rangers.
Scott Robinson was short but didn't miss the ball when he was hit by the head, then Alan Lithgow couldn't do anything but lie when he was forced to fly the ball by Craig Halkett.
The owner did not allow Rangers to play in front of them, as he knew he was able to punish these foreigners in good shape.
And it seems that the number that changed history was the most.
The Rangers made a mistake leading up-franc and Livingston sought a way out, Declan Gallagher and Robinson joined Menga, who got the ball and lied to the middle of the stage.
The Rangers have still been stopped on the street, but they have never been able to read the householder's poems, especially if there was a danger of questioning Liam Kelly's cook,
This seems to be the case during the second half of the year, although there was a case from Alfredo Morelos that Kelly had to arrest quickly.
Scott Pittman was also almost killed by football, but it was banned by Allan McGregor, a Ranger’s poet, and then Lithgow’s crew was very disappointed when he received a good deal from the Livingstone player.
Not only did the game arrive at Livingston's headquarters but it was blocked, and there were also two pints – one of Halkett's mistakes to replace actor Glenn Middleton, and one of the results of the shooting in hand – but it was all fired.
Livingston's findings 'No Like This' - Exemption · Global Voices
Alasdair Lamont, from BBC Scotland, to Tony Macaroni Arena
Livingston's play and performance did not look like it.
Each of them has done nothing wrong, and does not stop doing more than what they think they might be able to now move up.
There has been little change in how they play and how the team has formed since they've been back on top of it now, but Holt has been particularly appreciated for his ability to join the team since he arrived.
There are also many members of his team.
Captain Halkett's performance, led to the best program protection, but Menga did not allow Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall to be known during the game.
The Rangers, however, did not seem to have much to offer.
They may have played well at times under the direction of Gerard, but they did not meet the criteria they were here.
Their attack is not permanent – once they are dragged from the street – so now they need to be warned of Rangers, since they are now not down.
Erdogan's reception in Cologne is very different
On Saturday (September 29th) there was snow and snow during the morning meal held by Turkey's president and the Germans in Berlin.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's many critics' visit to Germany – which was done to improve the relationship between the OTAN fighters.
Among the topics they did not include human rights, freedom of press and Turkey's entry into the European Union.
After that, President Erdogan won Cologne a new major mosque.
This city is the largest in Turkey outside of Turkey.
For security reasons, 25,000 people were prevented by police from meeting in front of the Moscow, but there are still many supporters coming to see its president.
However, most of Erdogan's opponents — and Kurdes's most of them — also expressed their opinion, accusing Erdogan's policies and Germany's willing to take him away.
The image of the foreign who is causing a revolution appears to be contrary to that protest, some Turkishs called German citizenship a savior, but others accused it of being a traitor.
Traffic accident in Deptford: The bus driver is dead
The bus driver in London lost his life.
Near the Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street office were the victims of the disaster, the city's busiest road in Deptford, southeastern, at 10 and 15 BST in the morning.
The car stopped running, and a doctor came and arranged for it, but the man died unwatered.
The accident occurred several months after the vehicle driver died on the Children Street, about a mile away from the accident on Saturday.
The Metropolitan Police said they were trying to know about the man and to warn his family.
As a result, the road is broken and the vehicle has to cross the road and is invited to choose another route immediately.
Long-Lartin Prison: Six Prison Guards injured during a riot
Six prison guards were injured during an accident in a safe prison for men, says the Prison Office.
The HMP Long Lartin storm in Worcestershire began tomorrow at 9:00 a.m. and some BST; and it is not yet over.
Specialized police called "Tornado" have been invited to settle the disturbance, which is responsible for raising eight prisoners in a prison cell.
Prisoners were treated locally because of mild facial injuries.
The prison service announced: "A special-appointed prison guard has been ordered to destroy HMP Long Lartin's problems.
Six prison guards were treated for his injuries.
We will never tolerate the violence in prison, and our statement is clear that security officers have to offer police and can help their prison time."
There are more than 500 HMP Long Lartin prisoners, including the most dangerous prisoners in the country.
According to a report in June, the prison chief had to be hospitalized when a prisoner was injured.
And in October some prison guards had to call police officers who were in trouble because of the heavy bombing of billard balls.
Rosa’s Disaster threatened to cause floods in Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City (may be a benefit for the dry areas)
Tropical depression is known in Arizona, but it can occur at the beginning of the high week, as the rest of the rivers from the Rosa River continue to read the Desert Southwest.
The National Weather Reporting Office has already issued warnings for the East and the West of Arizona to the south and east of Nevada, southern California and Utah, including Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is thought to be heading straight to Phoenix, and she will take the rain tomorrow morning.
The Phoenix National Weather Agency tweeted that "the tropical storm of tropical storms or depression when within 260 km around Phoenix is ten" since 1950!
Katrina (1967) is the only disaster that reaches 60 km near the AZ region."
According to the most recent estimates published by the National Weather Forecast Model, water can reach 5 cm to 10 cm, and it can reach 15 cm in the Mogollon Rim in Arizona.
The other area in the Southwest Desert, such as its central Rockies and the Great Basin, may get 2.5 cm to 5 cm, but there may be some places to get to 10 cm.
For those who are not afraid to get a boat, Rosa’s rain may be a blessing because it is an area of global warming.
It is true that there is a serious problem with water pollution, but it may be good to get the water wells because the south is now dark.
According to the U.S. Poster Office, more than 40 percent of Arizona’s population is the most severe type, according to weather.com reports.
The Rosa River was first thought to enter the world in the Gulf of California in Mexico.
In 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico is the Rosa Rivodoza, which is heading north at 20 km speeds per hour.
The climate is shrinking because the water is colder in the Pacific Ocean.
So it is thought that he will become a tropical storm when he enters Mexico on Monday or Sunday.
Mexico’s share of raw water may be strong, and it may result in massive flooding.
"Baja California is thought to be able to continue north of Sonora, and it can reach 25 cm in some places," states weather.com.
Then Rosa, who is already tropical, will read from the north of Mexico before arriving at the Arizona border on the very morning of tropical depression, will be following Arizona again to the south of Utah.
"The most serious flooding in Baja California, north of Sonora, and desert Southwest in the United States is the most serious accident that is thought to have taken place by Rosa or by a group of rivers," the National Weather Center says.
As a result of this rain, there will be fear that there will be a river that will die and a flood of trees and rocks will continue on the ground, and the land will dry up in the mountains.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: Arrest of four people who tried to kill people
Three and a 20-year-old boy was arrested because he was worried about trying to kill people, when there were 16-year-olds in Somerset.
At Excelsior Terrace in Midsomer Norton, the child was seriously injured, Saturday morning at 4:00 a.m. BST.
She was rushed to the hospital immediately and was said to be "not worried."
A 17-year-old, two-year-old, and a 20-year-old man was arrested this night around Radstock, says police in Avon and Somerset.
The police asked who could get a photo file on their phone to get them.
'Kavanaugh' said Atoa Trump to the Democratic Party · Global Voices
"The drop in stones for Judge Kavanaugh is a loss of stones to stop the unbridled and proud struggle of the Democratic Party," said Atoa Trump during a public meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Atoa Trump announced that during the format for the appointment of Kavanaugh, the last was "contained by love and anger" by the Democratic Party.
On Thursday in Kavanaugh witnessed before the Congress, and she deliberately rejected Christine Blasey Ford's allegations of ten years ago that they were still children.
Ford also came to bear witness to his case.
The President said on Saturday that "the American people saw Kavanaugh's imagination, skill and courage" on that day.
"The lower stone to strengthen the appointment of Judge Kavanaugh is the lower stone to appoint one of the most perfect legislators of our time, the best-known judge in his service to date," he told the team of supporters who attended him in West Virginia.
The President spoke of the importance of the arrival of the rock-climate Republic during his election, using the appointment of today Kavanaugh.
"The last five weeks will be one of the most important elections in our lives.
I'm not going to vote, but if I'm really going to vote," she says.
"That's why I'm going to fight for the best candidates."
Atoa Trump declared that democracy is actually taking a "controversial and street ban" march.
The last Friday should take place the first major stone break in the House of Commons in the form of the appointment of today's Kavanaugh, says the GOP senior in CNN.
Hundreds lost their lives because of the earthquake, tsunamis in Indonesia, the number of victims keeps increasing.
More than 384 of them contributed their lives, many of them were killed by massive ocean waves in the sea, following a major earthquake and tsunami on the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia, says authorities on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered to attend a seagoing festival in Palu on Friday mornings, where there was a seabed of six feet [6 m] above sea level in the morning, where many people crossed and destroyed everything they had dug.
Before this tsunami there was 7.5 earthquakes.
"When yesterday's Tsunami was warned, people continued to do what they did on the sea but did not escape, but became victims," says Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, BNPB spokesman, Indonesia's natural disaster agency, during a talk in Jakarta.
"The tsunami didn't come alone, but drove cars, trees, houses, and ate everything that hit them in the black soil," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami hit 800 km an hour before it reached the sea.
There was someone who cut down trees that didn't go to waste the tsunami and who didn't kill her, he said.
A total of 16,700 people were moved to 24 refugee camps in Palu.
The photos taken from the aircraft produced by the natural disaster management office show that many houses and shops are destroyed, flooded with mud and debris and mosquee surrounded by water.
The city of sea-creaming was still flooded by the waves of the earthquake on Saturday.
2.4 million people in the region have experienced these earthquakes.
The Indonesian Institute for Technology Planning and Application (BPPT) said that the energy generated by the massive earthquake in Hiroshima was around 200 feet [200 m] above ground during the Second World War.
The city's geography, which is based on a long-distance flood, may have increased the magnitude of the tsunami, they say.
Nugroho declared the destruction and thousands of them "great," he said, the houses, hospitals, stores and hotels were destroyed.
He said that 540 injured people died in a collapsed building, and 29 were missing.
Nugroho is creating a river that may be more likely to be affected and damaged, in the area of Doghía, 300 km north of Palu, as this is the closest to the top of the earthquake.
"The internet is very appealing because there's no news" from Dogharaa, Nugroho says.
There are more than 300,000 people living there," the Red Cross said in a statement, and its workers and volunteers have already saved its devastated areas.
"It's very dangerous, but it can still be worse than it is now," he said.
The service received a lot of criticism on Saturday because it did not say there was a tsunami that had been received by Palu, although the authorities said that shortly after the warning, the mayor came.
There are images of ordinary people spreading on social networks with men on the top of the street calling for people on the streets below that there are tsunamis there.
A few minutes after the flood flooded the lake, they lost all houses or cars.
The Reuters image file could not be verified here.
As a result of the earthquake and tsunami, almost all of the city was destroyed and no one was able to connect around Palu, so it was difficult for the authorities to manage the emergency effort.
The authorities said that the aircraft had already begun to send cargo to the military, brought aid from Jakarta and other cities, but many of the people who had to move to live needed food and daily supplies soon.
The city airport was opened for life-saving only, and will continue to close in October.
On Sunday, President Joko Widodo is said to visit the camps that have been attacked in Palu.
There are over 800 deaths from tsunamis in Indonesia.
That's really bad.
It is true that World Vision workers from Doghaa, who are found in the backyard of their jobs, have been kindly recovered in Palu, but they see many dangers along the way, says Ato Doseba.
"How many houses they saw," he said.
That's really bad.
There are now many relief groups starting with the heavy post-natural disaster, but some complain that a large number of foreign workers have been prevented from going to Palu.
According to the law in Indonesia, there must have been before the national declaration that a victim's natural disaster was caused by a place where he could import funds, settings and workers from abroad.
However, that statement has not yet been made.
"The natural disaster is still in the first place," says Aulia Arriani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"When the state says "Well, then, a whole country is affected by this natural disaster," it can be opened for international aid, but we are not yet here."
This second night in Palu since the earthquake and tsunami came on Friday, and friends and family still hope that their freedom will be one of the most exciting miracles in the natural world.
On Saturday a small child was shot alive from a drinking water channel.
On Sunday, the victim was released by a woman in a bomb shelter for two days, along with the death of her mother next door.
Gendon Subandono, the usual Indonesian national parapet team, trained two undiscovered parapetists for the Asian Games, which ended this month in Indonesia.
He is also a student of the other features of the Two Roa Hotel, including Today Mandinga.
"My heart is heavy, as I am antelope in the parapenta area," she says.
Gendon told us that a few hours after the news was spread among the parapentanists that the Two-Roa Hotel was destroyed, the contestants from Palu quickly sent a lot of messages through WhatsApp, who participated in the sea-going meeting.
However, the message he sent was only one colored sign, not two colored characters.
"I believe they have not even protected the message I sent," she says.
The buyer spent $26,750 during GAB filling in Newport on Level
On Friday morning, the buyer lost $26,750 from the Brink's workers holding GAB in Newport at Levee, according to a press release from the Newport Police Office.
The driver released the vehicle inside the GAB at a parking lot and prepared to raise additional money, Det. Dennis McCarthy in the statement.
When she got divorced, another man "was running away from the Brink's staff" and stole the food that was almost full of money there.
There were a number of witnesses who fled the area, according to the report, but the police did not clearly tell the number of people who were now protected.
Police in Newport are encouraged to call on 859-292-3680 who have information about these people.
Kanye West: Rap singer changed his name to Ye · Global Voices
The rap singer Kanye West changed his name to Ye.
He wrote on Twitter on Saturday when he said his name change: "The official name Kanye West."
At one time, 41-year-old West was named Ye and this was the title of the enemy song that he released, which came out of June.
Just before his release on Saturday Night Live, which is supposed to release his new identity file named Yandhi, this change of name.
He is the stranger who will replace the singer Ariana Grande in the program, who has resigned immediately from the program for "stimulative reasons," the program's creator says.
West stated that the term also has a religious view of it as well as of the name of the professional he now uses.
"I believe 'yes' is the most frequently used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you'," said West at the beginning of the year, when talking about the title of his configuration file to the provider of the Big Boy audio program.
"So I am and you are, we are, we are.
So it originated with Kanye, which means it's the only one, so it comes to Yes – there's nothing but good, bad, bad ideas, all of us.
This song file contains more information about us."
He was one of several famous rap singers who changed his name.
Sean Combs, for example, has been called Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he should be called Love and Brother Love.
His colleague, JAY-Z, also in the West, admitted that his name could always be either a protest or a text or a text.
AMLO in Mexico won't use the military to fight civilians
The newly elected Mexican President, Mr. Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, argued that it was his duty to use the military force to fight civil war, as the 50th anniversary of the blood hit by the current student protest.
On Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza, Lopez Obrador promised that "because he had to send soldiers to kill Mexican people."
In fact, on October 2, 1968, the military shot the protesters in the field, killing at least 300 people, while students from left across Latin America were getting shot.
Lopez Obrador promised to support Mexican young people with monthly donations for students and to open a new state university.
Lack of work and lack of learning is why young people are forced to save bad associations.
The U.S. has to increase the amount of money for I.A.
China is already making great progress in the field of artificial intelligence (IA), so the United States should also increase its funding for research in this area, says Kai-Fu Lee, an IA user and user who has already worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
That was the comment he made when a different department of the U.S. government made a statement about IA, even though a whole United States does not have formal requirements for IA.
In the meantime, China has announced its format last year: it is still focusing on the development of IA by 2030.
"It is good to start with a two-fold increase in IA research project, as the United States is already far closer than any other country, and we are now waiting for the most special information for IA," Lee says.
When money increases twice as much as the energy in the United States is going to be twice as high as the next major innovation in the IA world, Lee says during the NCBC interview this week.
Here Lee, who wrote the book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" published by Hughton Mifflin Harcourt this month, is the General Tale of the Innovation Ventures, which created one of the leading companies of IA in China, Facebook+.
In the 1980s, he worked at Carnegie Mellon University in an IA system that won the best American Othello player, and then he was a senior worker at Microsoft Research and head of the Google team in China.
Lee acknowledged that the technology competition organized by the former U.S. government, such as the Robotics Challenge of the Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency, was good and wondered when its next series was going to be able to get to know those who are smart about the future.
Lee often says that researchers in the United States need to work hard to get government funding.
"But China is not trying to force academic leaders to leave; it is the company," Lee just said.
In recent years the various universities' stars have been attracted to focusing on the IA field of all Facebook, Google and other technology companies.
The change in immigration policy can also help the United States to speed up its efforts for IA, Lee says.
"I should immediately give a red card to those who have Doctorat on IA," he said.
In July 2017 the Chinese State Council issued the IA Extension Format in its new form.
The National Natural Science Foundation in China, like the National Science Foundation and other government organizations for American researchers, provides funding to people at the educational center, but the quality of academic work in China, says Lee.
At the beginning of the year in the United States, the Ministry of Defence has set up an International Institute for Artifielle Intelligence, which is designed to bring together industry and educational partners, and Maison Blanche has announced that the Commission is now being set up to focus on artificial intelligence.
DARPA also announced this month that it will raise $2 billion for the event called AI Next.
For NSF, however, over $100 million is now available for IA research.
At the same time, no action has been taken on the law in the United States to set up the National Intelligence Commission on Artificialelle.
Macedonia's voters are putting a low vote in a public poll on whether or not the country's name is changed
This Sunday will stone the Macedonian voters in a referendum to ask whether the name of the country is "Northern Macedonia's Republic", a measure that would undermine its decades-long tradition with Greece, which prevented its intention of becoming a member of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a territory called Macedonia, continued to complain that the name of the neighbouring country in the north is being violated, and she has always denied access to the NATO and the European Union.
The new name was agreed upon by the two regimes in June, but some opposition nationalists said that if the name was changed, many Slavs would be forced to defend themselves in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said that he would not give up during the referendum and that the result of the conspiracy would not take part in the campaign was that the 50 percent demand to grant the referendum was not understood.
The question to be raised in the public opinion is: "Do you agree to enter into the NATO and the European Union by agreeing to the agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, said that let us accept the value of membership in such a group as the European Union and NATO for Macedonia, one of the countries born of Yugoslavia’s disaster.
"I am here today to cast a stone for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia to be able to live in freedom under the attention of the European Union because it means a better life for all of us," says Olivera Georgievska, 79 years old, in Skopje.
Although the law did not specify that it had to be followed, the number of parliamentarians had already said that they would follow the results of the fall in order to make it change immediately.
Two thirds of parliamentarians are required to accept the change in name.
The National Electoral Commission said there has been no reports of non-compliance since 1 p.m.
However, not more than 16 percent of voters have come to vote, while 34 percent have been elected during the last parliamentary election in 2016, which saw 66 percent of voters named after the vote.
"Because of my son I cast a vote, because we should be in Europe," says Gjose Tanevski, 62-year-old, president of the capital Skopje.
In Macedonia, Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko came to the public for a survey on the change in the country's name to open the door to enter the NATO and the European Union in Strumica, Macedonia, on September 30, 2018.
Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54 years old in front of the Skopje Parliament, has prepared a small table and set up a chair in front of the building that was set up by those who refused to take part in the public exam.
"We would like to join the NATO and the European Union, but we want to do so in honor of it instead of moving in the countryside," Kavadarkov says.
"It is true that we are a poor country, but we still have ships.
When our name is not valid for them, we can turn to China and Russia and join the European and Asia Advertising Group."
The entry into the OTAN will result in an urgent use of funds for Macedonia, says Prime Minister Zaev, since unemployment rates are already over 20 percent.
"I believe that the majority of people are interested in this because more than 80 percent of citizens are grateful for the European Union's and NATO's entry," said Atoa Zaev after his fall.
The victory of "he" will be like "the strengthening of our future."
As a result of a simple survey published by the High Commissioner for Macedonia's Policy Research Monday, between 30 and 43 percent of voters will come down to the public polls – that is, the number required is low.
Another simple survey conducted by Telema TV in Macedonia found that 57 percent of the respondents said they would vote on Sunday.
70 percent of them said they would vote "yes".
The 50 percent of voters contributing to a voter need to come down to the vote, which is likely to have been successful.
While this public opinion is underway, it is the first major debate for Western-wide governance policy since it began in May last year.
See: Sergio Aguero from Manchester City has broken down the bridge of all Brighton and has died of a balloon
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling captured the bridge of Brighton when Manchester City won 2-0 on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
The introduction of Aguero balloons in 65 minutes seems to be relatively easy.
An attacker from Argentina received an offer from the center of the front floor.
He broke up between the first three Brighton tunnels, and then broke down free.
Immediately four black players surrounded Aguero.
He quickly walked behind the front of a tunnel, then ran across the tracks on the sidewalk of Brighton's coast.
Then he left the ball to the left, so Sterling could.
When the English attacker lied to the first ball in the field of battalion, it was returned to Aguero, who lied to the right and threw Matthew Ryan, Brighton's watchman, because the ball was placed in his right foot.
"Aguero's left leg has a small problem," says Pep Guardiola, city manager, to a journalist.
"We talked about 55 or 60 minutes to play.
That's what's happening.
We were very proud that he had been killed by a ball at the time."
Sterling, however, gave Sky Blues the first advantage in this game for the Prime Minister League.
He died in 29 minutes.
Aguero then received a gift from the country of Brighton.
It looks good to send the ball back to Leroy Sane's left end.
Sane tried to advance the ball before leading Sterling to reach the far edge.
The attacker Sky Blues has almost pulled out of the field.
On Tuesday at 12 o'clock and 55 m from the west of the City will meet the Hoffenheim in the group for the Champions League, in the Rhine-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer's Will to Play Rockies Meeting
There was no reason to force the first play, since the Nationals were no longer involved in the final process.
But Scherzer wanted to compete so much that if he was to follow the ball this Sunday at a meeting with Colorado Rockies, the only measure was that the process of ending the game had an impact on the Rockies, since they had an advantage in Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
Rockies won Joker's position when the Nationals won 5-2 Friday night, but it is still hoping to get the first division.
"Even though we don't have anything to do anymore, at least we're surprised because we know that the air will disappear during the Denver game with the viewers and other teams I can be sure to produce the best in it, more than the best I've seen this year.
How can I not hurry to compete with it?"
Until now the Nationals have not yet announced who will play the first Sunday, but it seems that Scherzer will be able to shoot the ball if that is true.
On Thursday, Scherzer was very familiar with football, which will meet his first 34th game when it comes, and he will play football on Sunday even if it's a few days off.
It has 18-7 degrees to the right in Washington, and for this playing year it has ERA 2.53 and strikeout 300 in 220 2/3.
President Trump killed people in West Virginia
The President has done a little moving about today's Brett Kavanaugh that he has chosen to be appointed in his Supreme Court, in a matter that highlights the importance of the coming of the voter during his election.
"All of our work is on top of this November.
The last five weeks will be the most precious of our lives.
This is one of the greatest, most important -- I don't want to vote but if I'm really going to vote, which is why I'm going to fight for these good candidates," she says.
President Trump continues, "You will see these very negative democratic groups, those who are doing what they are doing right now.
And they're ready to overthrow power in any way, you see love, cruelty.
They don't care who they are, who they have to get power and control, what they need, power and control, but we won't give them that."
Democracy has taken action "to oppose and stop", he says.
"And you can see what's been here in four days," he said, saying that democracy is "infuriated, bitter, bad attitudes and not to tell the truth."
He named Prime Minister Dianne Feinstein of the Committee of Law in the House of Commons, where the meeting was held.
"Do you remember his answers?
Have you published any comments?
And, and, how?
No, mmm, no, I'm expecting one – that's the worst thing I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer a free congregation.
A person who is eager to express his opinion is not a servant of God
It's no wonder that the Momentum opposition in our town party threw stones at me to pray for me.
In fact, I am the last of the Labour MP who said that I don't need my opinion – simply the reason: I insisted on expressing my opinion.
None else received my fellow MP Joan Ryan, because he could not stand up against the Jews' enemies.
For me personally, it was my opposition to Jeremy Corbyn's idea that a stone slammed against me.
With regard to the importance of a responsible economic policy, national security, with regard to Europe, which emphasizes why Jeremy spoke to previous leaders.
The report for the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday states: "We would like the meeting to be shared and seen."
For more than eight years I have been in the Labour Parliament, the GC's meeting on Friday night has been well filled with these measures.
Sadly, however, this is not the case at many meetings, and it has been heard for a long time, if even then the political promise is "better and weaker".
Disagreements were shown to be unacceptable in the Labour Party and the public opinion that the party's leader accepted was not accepted.
Shortly after Jeremy first met the leader, there were colleagues with me who I thought had a similar political attitude to me in the past who began waiting for me to turn into a stranger and accept a view I could not accept – either on national security or on the European Union's common market.
Every time I take a public speech — whatever my language — the criticisms of social networks calling for my name to be removed, criticizes the policy of the central party, saying that I should not be in the Labour party.
And that's not what I'm going through alone.
I know it's even easier to get me than to get some of my colleagues because I'm aware of politics.
I can only imagine the professional work and the harassment of fellow workers who face criticism of men or women every day but are never exasperated.
One of the most disturbing aspects of our political era is seeing what has become acceptable to all.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should create a culture of change.
In fact, we are no longer the free church of the past, and we extend the party every stone "trust rule" or change the rules on membership elections.
For the past two years, many people have suggested that I go easy and quiet, so "there will be no fear of me."
But I never got involved in politics.
Since I entered the Labour Party 32 years ago when I was still a student, since I was writing to the government of Thatcher that allowed the school I had learned to be a state-of-the-art, I have always fought to improve the supply business of those who need it most — whether city councillors or government ministers.
I have never hidden my policy, including during the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could say that I did not understand my political ideas and what I did not share with the authorities.
One thing I want to say to those who have encouraged the fall of Friday, when we see the country moving towards Brexit that will have a bad impact on many households, businesses and public affairs, I can't understand what it takes me to make time and effort to turn my back on the leader of the Labour Party.
But the truth is, not for Nottingham Momentum, but for the people I'm saving, whether I'm a member of the Labour Party or not: I'm proud of your ability to serve and I promise there will be no threat of persecution or political exploitation to prevent me from taking what I believe is best for all of you.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Ayr is above the top, which is never broken
The last two days may have changed a bit, but it is no doubt worth Ayr's winning this first game of Tennent for the Premiership this day, which has really been very disturbing.
They're on top now, because they're the only team that won't lose at least once in ten.
In fact, the winning team has gained the strength of its defense and its ability to use cases, and it is most fair for ordinary Peter Murchie to be happy.
"The way we play is still under control, but no one has touched us yet, so I must be happy," she says.
Robyn Christie from Melrose said: "Ayr is in love, because they've been able to use them more than our team."
Grant Anderson made a 14-minute campaign by Frazier Climo, which benefited Ayyr, but the Scottish captain Rory Hughes, who was released by the Warriors not to play before, was able by Melrose to use the number's disability and Jason Baggot caught an endless day.
Climo has spread the benefits of Ayr, and then, first of all, he lost only one ball and confirmed it and the number leading by Ayr on Wednesday is 17-5.
However, the second deadline for Melrose was a good start and after the day of Patrick Anderson, which Baggot insisted, was reduced to five others.
Then there was a long pause for the serious injury suffered by Ruaryh Knott, who had to be forced out of the field, and when the game was over again, Ayr disappeared through the rest of Stafford McDowall, supported by Climo.
This is where Blair Macpherson, a temporary captain for Ayyr, once again took advantage of his players' benefits and even Bruce Colvine failed to support, after a brief confrontation.
However, the city's citizens are still under siege, so when Struan Hutchinson gets a hard card because he hit Climo who didn't take a ball, from the character of the gun, MacPherson hits the ball line behind the line, behind the Ayr's circle that was approaching.
Climo picked up the backup program, as he did after the game returned, when Kyle Rowe took David Armstrong's stand off the line and offered to kill the fifth day of the city team.
The star of Still Game seems ready to start a new job in the dining room industry
Ford Kieran, a member of the Still Game, seems ready to start a new business in the reception industry when he is known to be appointed as head of a company that has received permission to build a restaurant.
He's 56 years old, and he plays Jack Jarvis' role in the famous BBC program, which he wrote and played with Greg Hemphil, a long-standing dancer.
He told the brothers that his ninth class would be the end of this program, and if Kiernan's vision is ready after Craiglang.
According to the official document, he is the head of the Apionymorn Limited.
The movie player didn't answer the question about this news, but a news source in Scottish Sun insisted Kiernan was trying to get into "the world that's going out for a restaurant" in Glasgow.
'We have the sea': Bolivia, which has no coast, hopes that the court will reopen its way to the Pacific Ocean
A ship patrolling the main marine army station in La Paz.
State office that sends blue flags like the sea.
Lake Titicaca continues to be in the Amazon: "We are familiar with the sea.
We're about to take it again."
The memories of the loss of Chile's fishing in the 19th century of the bloody war for wealth in Bolivia are still disturbing, and this does not lessen the desire to move on to the Pacific Ocean.
Perhaps that hope has not survived as it has now been in the past ten years, as Bolivia is now waiting for an international court ruling to be issued on October 1, when they have been released for five years.
"Bolivie has already taken good care of it, with both mind and heart, and is full of hope that it will be possible," says Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many of Bolivians will follow the International Court of Justice (ICJ)'s ruling on television across the country, hoping that Bolivia's request for a law in La Haye will be accepted by the court that, after a ten-year-old interview, Chile will have to discuss how to give Bolivia a way to the sea.
Evo Morales, a zealous Bolivian president, is also looking forward to this decision to issue this Monday – which is facing a difficult war to choose again next year.
"It's too late for us to return to the Pacific Ocean," he said at the end of August.
However, some experts feel that the court cannot be sure to give Bolivia justice - and even if it gives justice it will be too much for it to change.
This member of the United Nations working in the Netherlands has no authority to provide part of Chile for others, and he has already said that he can't be the final speaker as a result of the possible discussion.
The fact that the international court (ICJ) has issued a ruling only six months after a statement is delivered is already suspected that the case has not been "restrained", says Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert on international law.
Bolivia's demand will never be met four years ago, but it will be even worse.
"The current Bolivian government has blocked this issue on its way to the sea," Zárate says.
The way Morales talked about it may have made the remaining little slaughter in Chile permanent, he said.
Bolivia and Chile later had to reexamine each other, but it was difficult to exchange ideas after this incident.
Since 1962 both countries have failed to act as ambassadors.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltze, representing Bolivia in La Haye, rejected the announcement that the court's execution was not as common this time.
This Monday will lead "a good way to open a new relationship with Chile" for Bolivia, he says, and it is time to follow "the 139-year-old misunderstanding through the way it works."
Calzadilla also rejected the claim that Morales — one of the most popular presidents in Latin America — used the issue of sea policy as an example of sea management.
"Bolivia will never release her right to access the Pacific Ocean," she simply said.
"The decision to go out is what we will see what we need to change to the past."
North Korea will never destroy nuclear weapons if it can't trust the United States
On Ri Yong Ho, North Korea's Foreign Minister, said they would never destroy the first nuclear weapons if Washington was not trusted.
On Saturday, Ri took the floor in front of the United Nations Summit.
He urged the United States to fulfill the promise made during a summit in Singapore in the president of these developing countries.
That is what he noted if U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo seems to have recently reopened the nuclear diplomacy as it was, more than three months after the Singapore meeting with North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri stated that the idea that supporting the sanctions and opposition of the United States is a "dark dream" is to discourage North Korea from declaring that the war in Korea is over.
However, Pyongyang warns Washington to accept the statement but does not even take a direct step towards the destruction of weapons.
Neither Kim nor US President Donald Trump wants to hold a second summit.
But many do not believe that Pyongyang is really ready to launch a weapon that is sure to be taken by the country to protect his life.
Pompeo intends to visit Pyongyang in the upper month to prepare for the second summit at Today Kim and Trump.
The latest results of the major head-on-head tradition that will soon come to you from a nearby high-end retailer
Do not look far away if you want to help the number of your strokes or completely stop the sun from getting you.
Valentino and Thom Browne’s designers announced the lead lead ring, which appeared to be the biggest and most evil to include in their SS19 class, on the stage of the competition that marked the trend during the Paris Fashion Week.
Instagram has been able to use these in this year’s season, and these lead manufacturers have sent them to the lead media.
For example, Valentino’s most outstanding steel was another large - colored steel, a large - sized metal that covered the head of the miner’s head.
Among the large caves there are also stone - filled with stones, with mortars and even with mortars - but they were not even designed to break our heads.
There are also a number of strange faces shown by Thom Browne — very timely for Halloween.
Most of these images are full of holes, and they look like Hannibal Lecter.
There is an example that they have created a blend similar to that of an aquifers, including air conditioning and sunglasses, but one is similar to a dining room but has been leaked.
And if you're going on a different fashion show, you're having a lot of fun.
The supervisor suggests that these large stores may be available to high-end retailers near you.
The words 'La Bomba' were worn out by the big boots, which had already been made by the black boots of half an inch [half a meter] long, either Rihanna or Emily Ratajkowski.
Another major creation has also been shown by this most famous character, which has created these long-distance pillars if they can be used – a frozen box in the sea, made of black blossoms and needs to be equal to the weighted-weighted dresser.
It is an old-fashioned rosary box, a red-haired rosary, which is the most prominent creation in the results of Jacquemus in La Rivera SS19 shown during the Paris Fashion Week.
Luke Armitage, a fashion designer for famous people, wrote to the FCCC: 'I hope that a large sailor will come to the top of the shipyard for years – there have been a lot of things created by the designer alone so that it will be difficult not to see the demand for people to have a large sailor.'
John Edward: The people of the world really need foreign skills
The independent schools in Ecose were well-known for their success, and they continued in 2018 because the results were good, and this further strengthened the success of individuals and teams in sports, art, music and other public events.
Over 30,000 students throughout Ecose, these schools, which are represented by the Independent School Council (SCIS) themselves, are working hard to provide the best education for students and their parents.
The aim of the independent school is to support its students for higher and deeper education, their work and their place of world ownership.
Since each school is able to design and implement basic education programs, we now see that only modern languages are part of the great generation of voters and teachers in the school.
Nelson Mandela says: "If you speak to someone in his language, your word comes first.
If you speak to him in his speech, your words come to his heart."
That's a strong reminder that we can't just eat in English if we want to create relationships and trust with people from another country
As we look at the final test results for this year, it is found that foreign languages lead to the most advanced courses in independent schools.
Overall, 68 percent of foreign students received at least 19/20.
This information, available in 74 SCIS schools, shows that 72 percent of students received 19/20 in Mandarin, while 72 percent of those who studied German, 69 percent of French students and 63 percent of Spanish students received 19/20.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign learning because your skills are essential for children and young people later.
Now foreign languages, as an elected candidate, are equal to STEM (scientific, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent schools and elsewhere.
In a 2014 survey by the UK Commission for Work and Your Skills, the U.S. Commission found that given the reason the user said it would make it difficult for his employees to get involved, 17 percent because of the lack of foreign language skills.
As a result, foreign languages continue to be a constant force for good if young people are to be prepared for future assignments.
It is vital to do so in this world of global living, as the number of jobs seeking foreign skills is increasing.
Whatever a person chooses to do, if he learns a foreign language, he will benefit greatly from the future because he can be used in his later life.
He will continue to benefit his competitor who has a number of languages because he can communicate directly with another person.
According to a survey conducted by YouGov in the United Kingdom by 4,000 adults in 2013, 75 percent of them were unable to speak a simple language, and only 15 percent were French.
That is what is important in raising money to improve the teaching of foreign languages today, for today’s children.
A number of language-based children, especially the languages of developing countries, will benefit from finding suitable jobs for their lives.
Each school in Ecose will be different from its native language.
There will be a number of schools focusing on teaching modern languages, but some will teach what is considered to be the most important language for the United Kingdom when the year 2020 comes to an end, such as the Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever the outcome of your child’s interest, there are a number of foreign languages that can always be selected in an independent school, and teachers who are responsible for it are specialized in it.
The independent school in Ecose is willing to focus on creating a world of learning to prepare children and give them the skills they need to succeed, whatever happens in the future.
At present, in the world of global trade protection, foreign language still needs the important future of the country, so it must be seen in education.
It is true that foreign languages should be admitted that "the ability to do what is required by the international network"
Schools will continue to offer options, diversity and perfect working methods for young people in Ecosse.
You have to do it.
John Edward is the head of the Independent School Council
LeBron will play the first Lakers in San Diego this Sunday
Little remains to be expected for lovers who want to see LeBron James play first in Los Angeles Lakers.
Luke Walton, a Lakersian, announced that James will play this Sunday during the first game for the pre-legal period, to communicate with the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
Still, it is not known how long he will be playing.
"There must be more than one and less than 48," said Walton on Lakers' official website.
Lakers' own journalist Mike Trudell tweeted that James's playtime might be limited.
Journalist James asked about what he would do during the six-day game before the time of the game, after the start of the week was announced.
"I don't need a game to prepare the time to play again to be ready for my current job," she says.
A popular festival by Atoa Trump in West Virginia, Chayen YouTube
In Wheeling, West Virginia, President Donald Trump starts several public events every night.
This is the first public meeting of the five President Trump's plans to take place during this coming week, including a small stay in a nearby town like Tennessee and Mississippi.
When it was established that the resolution of his election to fill the gap in the Supreme Court had already been delayed, President Trump sent people to support our next election because Congress's control was likely to be in the hands of the Republic after the fall of November.
How many of President Trump's public meetings last night in West Virginia and how can we follow him on the Internet?
The President Trump's public meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia, at 7:00 p.m. tonight, September 29, 2018.
You can follow President Trump's public meeting on the Internet directly through YouTube.
Trump may be talking about today's arrest of Brett Kavanaugh, who is intended to enter the Supreme Court, which has become a cause for concern over the charges for self-defense and is expected to have a week-to-day silence of the House of Commons until the FBI's investigation is completed.
But the main reason for this public meeting is to help the Republicans get a little something to do with the November elections.
As a result, President Trump's campaign organizers said that this five-week public meeting was "to encourage volunteers and supporters because the Republicans are trying to keep and expand the majority of the House of Lords and House of Commons," says Reuters.
"The importance of its programme of work is crucial to the control of Congress and the President is taking over as many states as possible before entering the era of violent propaganda," said the organizer's spokesman for President Trump's propaganda, who did not mention it when he spoke to Reuters.
The evening meeting is planned at Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, so supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and journalists from Pittsburgh," says West Virginia Metro News.
This is the second day West Virginia visited Atua Trump last month, a state that won a victory over over 40 percent in 2016.
Trump's goal is to help today Patrick Morrisey, a Republican candidate for the President of West Virginia, who agrees to consider the simple investigation.
"It is not very good for Mr. Morrisey to see the president who has to try to force him to increase his number of trials," says Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: The U.S. Team showed that he has the power to fight without getting angry when faced with a private battle on Sunday
After these three very interesting games, Ryder Cup may be the most popular game on Saturday.
The claim of sports sports is a simple concept now, but players really believe it, especially in such competitions.
Who, then, is to blame if they are asked?
"They had six benefits here, but now four others, it may be said that we are the only ones who get a little something," Jordan Spieth said before he started the world on a small run.
Of course, Europe has its advantage, leading to four numbers and there are more than twelve numbers to fight.
The Americans, according to Spieth, seem to feel that there are only a few windmills helping their camp and there are many reasons for their encouragement, especially the land of Spieth and Justin Thomas who played around the world and got three out of four.
Spieth's play from tea to green is very destructive and is a good example.
The sound of his dance church continued to grow as his role progressed, so he died a great putt and won a clear victory in the fourth game and both he and Thomas were not enough after the two rounds of the game.
That's why they're calling for their 15th victory, the kind that says the American team isn't even far away.
"You really need to have a sense of control and don't care about your game alone," Spieth says.
The rest of them have two players today.
A total of 18 names have been written.
Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood are the only remaining players with numbers more than Spieth and Thomas in two days, the story of Ryder Cup.
They have four in four games that seem contradictory but deadly from Europe, and they don't seem to make any mistakes anymore.
Only "Moliwood" were two people who didn't smoke on Sundays, but they also missed on Saturday mornings, Friday afternoons and the back of Friday mornings.
This long effort, and seeing their energy depend on these proud spectators, seems to confirm that they are the players who need to play on Sunday, and there will be no more players than Fleetwood or Molinari who can win for Europeans if they're in the Le Golf National.
At first, they get it together but at the same time they lose each other.
However, it is still too early to talk about Europe's victory.
Bugba Watson and Webb Simpson are always short-lived Sergio Garcia, king of fourballs in the morning, after Alex Noren.
A blog and two doubles in front of the story pushed the Spanish and Swedish into an unexplained hole.
But on Sunday no one can expect you to leave the country.
It is very interesting to look at the fourballs and foursomes near because of cooperation between the two players, the advice they give each other, the advice they do not say, and what the struggle can be.
Until now, the European team has a good game and they have a great advantage when it comes to the last day but it is also seen in this foursome game that the US team has the power to fight despite the concerns, including those in the United States.
Europe leads 10-6 on the last day on Ryder Cup
Europe has a good chance of entering the last day of the ryder Cup if it won the US 10-6 after the Fourballs and Foursomes game this Saturday.
Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, a constantly-founded media player, led by two massive battles against Tiger Woods and raised his number to four in Le Golf National.
The European team led by Thomas Bjorn never left, which aimed at keeping their simple weight in their hands in Hazeltine two years ago, the American didn't see any impact during the fourballs in the morning, leading 3-1 in the game.
The Americans were more strongly opposed during the foursomes and won two games, but they were unable to reduce their injuries.
If Jim Furyk's team wants to keep up his business, he needs eight during the 12-person game on Sunday.
Fleetwood was the first European player to get four numbers missing, when he and Molinari were alone called "Molliwood" after the weekend of the surprise of many, the second two received four numbers in the four-digit opening game in the story of Ryder Cup.
When they threw Woods and Patrick Reed out of the fourballs, they appeared in a beautiful way to defeat the already hungry Woods and the American baby Bryson Dechambeau in an ever-increasing number of 57.4.
Woods, who had been completely out of play during the two games, seems to have been surprised at times by the words but had already played fourballs and foursomes 19 in 29 who had hit him and had already hit him seven times.
When Justin Rose took his life for the fourballs in the morning, he was reunited with Henrik Stenson during the foursomes and won 2&1 Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka – with the first and third numbers worldwide.
Not all that Europe has done has been successful, even though the days in the south of Paris are beautiful and full of wind.
Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who had already received the third major award, set the deadline for the United States when they received two numbers on Saturdays.
They were able to win 2&1 victorys in front of Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter from Spain in fourballs and were back and won Poulter and Rory McIllroy in 4&3 in foursomes even though they lost the first two.
Two of the Ryder Cup's stories had a team out of four shootings at the beginning of the private game, even though it was a game of war enough for Furyk's team to keep up.
Although they kept the second place for two days, they seemed to have no response to the war on Sunday.
'Santria' in North Korea is to destroy its own weapons without trust
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs in North Korea announced to the United Nations last Saturday that if the penalty continues, its trust in the United States will soon be reduced and it will be possible in that country to accept a single nuclear weapon if that is the case.
Today Ri Yong Ho announced before the annual meeting that North Korea has taken "a major measure of murder" during the past year, such as the suspension of nuclear and missile fires, the destruction of nuclear testing sites, and the provision of assurances not to distribute nuclear weapons and technology.
"But we can't see what he's up against from the United States," she says.
"If we can't trust the United States, we won't have any confidence in the protection of our country, so that's why we have to decide to destroy our first weapon alone."
Although North Korea's complaints about Washington's opposition have been repeated by Today Ri to the "progress" process for producing nuclear weapons that will be rewarded by North Korea every step, it seems that his statement is unique because he has no longer avoided the production of uncontrollable nuclear weapons, as Pyongyang did before.
Today Ri restored the statement made by today's Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump during the first high-ranking meeting of the US President and Northern Korea's Heads in Singapore on June 12, when Kim promised to try to achieve "the creation of nuclear weapons in the Korean Hemisphere", while President Trump promised to secure the protection of North Korea.
North Korea sought to officially end the Korean War in 1950-53, but the United States said Pyongyang had to agree to withdraw from the former nuclear weapons.
Washington also refused to accept the call to send a heavy international image to North Korea.
"The United States is constantly fighting for "the development of the former nuclear weapons" and is increasingly strengthening the push for sanctions to achieve its goal in the concentration, as long as it opposes the "declaration of the end of the war," says Ri.
"The idea that the punishment will distract us is a dream that people don't even know about us.
The only problem is that our mistrust increases according to the rate of punishment."
Today Ri has never discussed the format of the second summit at Today Kim and Trump as the US President highlighted earlier this week.
What the Minister said was the third meeting between Kim and South Korea's President Moon Jae-in in five months, and he added: "If South Korea is not talking about this nuclear weaponization, nuclear weapons are not going to be launched in the Korean Sakinos."
However, it is quite different in his speech when compared to last year, when he said before the United Nations Summit that the United States' appointment to fusées from North Korea is no longer possible after calling Kim's "Devil Eye" Trump "homme-fusée" which is like losing his life.
When President Trump met with the United Nations this year, who warned North Korea "to be completely defeated" last year, commended today Kim for our ability to take action to eliminate weapons, but announced that there was still much work to be done and that the punishment would not be maintained until North Korean nuclear weapons had ended.
Last Wednesday's Trump said he doesn't have a clear date to fix it, he said, "Maybe it takes two years, three or five months – no reason."
China and Russia stated that Pyongyang should respond to the UN Security Council for its progress.
However, State Secretary Mike Pompeo told the United Nations Security Council on Tuesday: "The implementation of the sanctions declared by the Security Council must be handled in a strict and consistent manner until we complete the full, complete and capable of verifying nuclear weapons."
The Northern Korea Security Council has been fully united since 2006 to try to curb the money laundering of nuclear and ballistic missiles in Pyongyang.
At the United Nations Summit, Ri Atua Pompeo met and then said that he would visit Pyongyang again the upper month to prepare for the second summit.
This year North Korea has been visiting three countries in Pompeo, but the last visit has not been very successful.
When he left Pyongyang in July, he said the interview had progressed, but a few hours later North Korea accused him of making "a demand similar to that of a criminal."
When North Koreans met on Monday this month, they said that they would destroy the site of missile construction and nuclear storage if the United States seemed to take "a countermeasure."
He said that his "consistent plan" was the security of the security promised by Atoa Trump in Singapore and that the relationship with Washington was to be restored to its roots.
Harvard’s students learn a lesson about sufficient relief
In this year's high school teacher's new lesson for Harvard University this year, students are increasing their sleep to try to fight the culture of self-injuriousness as a result of the school's ‘nighttime’ caffeine music.
One researcher found that students in this world’s highest university often do not know what is the most simple measure they should take to care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep therapy at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, has created this lesson, which is believed to have not yet been found in the United States.
He was thinking about creating the lesson after giving a speech about the impact of sleeplessness on learning.
'After the talk, a young woman approached and said: 'Why is it now that someone has spoken to me about it, in the third year?'
No one has ever told him how important the sleep is – and that's surprising to him,” he told The Telegraph.
In this lesson, which began this year, students are given a basic understanding of good sleep habits that contribute to learning and exercise, and improve their overall life.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and Tale, director of the university's health department, announced that the university decided to introduce the lesson when it found that students' sleep was not enough for the week.
The study of an hour’s study is one of the most encouraging subjects we have to contend with.
On the other hand, there is a picture of the student's room, the students need to click on a coffee cup of coffee, a glass of coffee, a teacher and a book and inform them of the consequences of caffeine, light and the effects of sleeplessness on sports events, and finally the practice of sleepiness is important.
On the other hand, participants are told that it may lead to a breakdown of the road, a breakdown of the narrow road, depression and a reduction in sleeplessness for a long time.
At this point there is a picture of the classroom, a small icon with a link, which encourages participants to consider their daily routine.
'We know that students will not change their way of life
But we believe that they have the right to know this – none other than your right to know the consequences of smoking in health," Professor Czeisler said.
The tendency to be proud when it is able to 'shrink through the night' is still there, he says, adding that the effects of modern technology and constant pressure on students have become a problem that does not increase sleeplessness.
To make sure that the reality is enough sleep, and good quality sleep, should be a 'secret weapon' that students should use to fight stress, fatigue and pain, he says – yes, until the door is closed, because the lack of sleep tells the brain that it is tired, and it keeps getting tired.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old man from California who studied chemistry and physics, helped Professor Czeisler design the lesson, as he had attended one of his studies last year in Harvard.
This lesson opened her eyes and moved her to do what she could for a whole school.
He hopes that the next step is to send the fourth-year students up for the same program before entering the competition.
According to Professor Czeisler's proposal, students should be alert to sleep hours and sleep hours, and should be warned of the consequences of the 'black iron' produced by electronic screens and LEDs, which could totally disrupt the interaction of the body's need for sleep and physical exercise, and could cause sleep problems.

The Rangers suffered as a result of the lack of access to the city itself and the team of Steven Gerard who seemed unable to play with him in Livingston, as a result of Dolly Menga's campaign.
The Ibrox team hoped that the first victory would take place outside the city since the great 4-1 victory in St. Johnstone in September, but the second lecture in the 18th game he held was given by Gary Holt, leader of the Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga was killed seven minutes before his release, and the Rangers team in the upper class seemed unintended and not expected to meet.
The Rangers, Livingston, has now returned to a smaller number and only the Hibernian in front of the dead ball.
And the disaster will not continue after the disaster hit by Calum Spence's head, a field player, if something outside the range seemed to have to be cured before.
Gerrard's change to his team, which led to Ayr's departure, was included in the Betfred Cup half-way process.
On the other hand, Holt hasn't changed the 11 Levi that received a number from Hearts last week and he'd probably be happy to see his team that is good for running the opponent on every move.
The Rangers may often have stolen the ball, but Livingston was able to use the ball safely.
They should have been killed two minutes after the game started, as Menga made her first offer and saw Scott Pittman near Allan McGregor's pool, but the ball hit by the middle of the field was very far away.
After that, Keaghan Jacobs lied to Cop-franc from a distance and saw Craig Halkett's network but his friend Alan Lithgow's cell phone rang in his backyard.
The game was controlled by Rangers only but it seemed to be more than the confidence they had in how they played in the last three years.
Alfredo Morelos was convinced that he and Steven Lawless should get a penalty if he and Steven were to fight within forty minutes, but Judge Steven Thomson had refused to leave Colombia and his complaint.
There were only two cases of rangers leaking from the Rangers during the first half but often when there was a danger of questioning Liam Kelly, former Ibrox's nurse, saw the offer from Lassana Coulibali and Ovie Ejaria's weak case.
It may be true that the first ball died in 34 minutes is not the result of a good game, but everyone agrees that it is just due to its creative ability.
Rangers are no longer able to meet Jacobs' full-fledged game.
Scott Arfield didn't act when Declan Gallagher offered Scott Robinson the ball, but then he never gave up on Menga, who simply killed a ball.
Gerrard changed little by half when he replaced Coulibaly, and nearly there was a hit by the player because Morelos was caught by this field player, but Kelly ran out of his spot and stopped him.
Livingston has continued to ban these foreign teams for his favorite game, so Lithgow and Halkett's winnings have not stopped.
Holt's team was almost able to help out in the last minute but McGregor's stand against Jacobs was correct before the ball from the beginning of Lithgow was fired away from the trunk of the tree.
Glenn Middleton, a Ranger's representative, also asked for a penance, if he was in conflict with Jacobs, but then Thomson didn't even look at him.
Left: The founder of Geiger Counter · Global Voices
So once again, the page from Our Lady Alhaddy: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago, and MBOLA MTOHY ... was born in Germany on that day, Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger, who later became a naturalist.
Geiger created a method of broadcasting and radioactivity, so his later creation produced a device called Geiger Counter.
So far, Geiger Counter has become a science-scientific tool, and then has become a pop-classed tool, as seen in a film titled "Bells of Coronado" in 1950, with unexpected cowboys as scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
The man said, "What is it?"
Rogers: "This is Geiger Counter, used in ancient times to find radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put these hearings, you really want to see the results of the atoms released by radioactivity in the rock."
Evans: "Oh, he's really grateful!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63th anniversary.
But the creature still exists that bears its name.
A new reader for peace may be able to teach the immune power 'to see' sick cells
A new reader for peace may be able to teach the protection force 'to see' which is sick cells and kill them.
In the medical process, this reader teaches the patient to identify the immune system
In this way the cell cuts from the patient include a small change in the lungs
They then ‘see’ a protein found in many types of minerals, then re-injected into the body.
He read a poem that had a positive effect on many patients who had a different sense of peace.
When a woman was treated for this reading, she was teaching the protective power to identify the patient's cell, and her childhood home was destroyed in more than 18 months.
In the process of operation, healthy cells are removed from the patient, with changes in the lungs so that the protein called HER2 is “ detectable” by several hormones, then the cells are re-inserted into the body.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, from the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, says: "If we look at the results, this vaccine is very promising."
HER2 "commands the growth of many types of peace," including the removal of beds, children's homes, fruit and vegetables, Professor Berzofsky explains.
There is a process similar to the current health cell in the patient is "teached" to focus on peace cells, which have their roots in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West gave a long speech in support of Trump, and launched a MAGA campaign after she left SNL.
It's a bad end.
The viewer built Kanye West in a photo showroom during the Saturday Night Live program when he gave a five-year speech to US President Donald Trump and said he would be elected in 2020.
After his third song for this night, the title Ghost Town, which he was singing in a small boxing Make America Great, he gave a long speech condemning democracy and re-declaring his support for Trump.
"I always talk to white people, and they say, "How do you love Trump, a man who's a racist?"
If racial discrimination is a problem for me, I've been away from America for so long," she says.
In order to launch the SNL program, a brief story found by Matt Damon, star of Hollywood, uses today's Brett Kavanaugh as a witness to the Parliament's Law Commission, about the charge of Christine Blasey Ford to act in a misleading manner.
Although it was not published during the program, the critic Chris Rock published the image file containing this extensive speech by West on the social network.
It is not clear whether Rock's goal is to take the lead in the West by publishing that image file.
West also complained before the audience that she was suffering from postpartum depression because of her violence.
"They tortured me behind the desk.
They say, 'Don't make this noise when you get out of the platform.'
They hurt me!
And they say I have a difficult place now," he says, according to a Washington Examiner report.
"Do you want to find this hard place?" he said, "I'll make Superman's suit, because that means you can't order what I'm going to do. Do you want to make the world better?
Try love."
At least two times the audience raised their voices and found that SNL providers seemed to be embarrassed, says the Variety report, and one person said to the newspaper: "And one house didn't speak."
Last minute West was invited to replace the singer Ariana Grande, his former friend Mac Miller, the rap singer who had been waiting a few days earlier.
The way West sings songs of the song Love It, and dress like Perrier.
West received support from TPUSA team manager Candace Turner, who said to Twitter: "For the most courageous person: YOU'RE STAYING THE PEOPLE."
But Karen Hunter, the organizer of the Talk-show show, also told Twitter that "that's what West does is very good."
"But I HAVE chosen TO support people (to buy their clothes or their music, or to support their "arts") when I find that I am speaking and disclosing, which I think I am damaging society.
He can do whatever he wants.
We too," he said.
The rapist said on Twitter, before the show, that he changed his name and "this is the official name Kanye West."
He's not the first artist to change his name, but he's following what Diddy did known as Puff Daddy, or Puffy and P Didy.
His rapist, Snoop Dogg, once again named Snoop Lion, and the famous artist Prince changed his name to make him famous.
Someone was arrested for killing people near the Belfast restaurant
A man was arrested on Friday at the east end of the Belfast restaurant, and a 45-year-old man was sentenced to death.
That happened in the Ballyhackmore language, says the police.
The man will rise to trial in Belfast on Monday.
The public ministry will consider the matter.
Kit Harrington, the famous movie player at Game of Thrones, in his sports
Jon Snow is the most popular of Kit Harington's, which he uses as a sword in the history of the game of Thrones, which was a history of violence in the past.
The 31-year-old movie player showed that violent people don't even know how to do it, he said that that's why young men think they need more violence and strength than people do.
Kit said on Sunday Times Culture that "there's something wrong with it", she wondered how men can be helped to break off the disturbing situation that has emerged during the era of #MeToo.
Kit recently married Rose Leslie, a woman playing with her in the game of Thrones, who was also 31 years old, and said she was "ready" to help solve the problem.
‘I’m surprised why we have been wrong about men now?’ he said.
"But what has taught boys when they grew up, causing the problems we see now?"
Kit believes that television is one of the reasons why people have such a wrong view of men when they look at the role of men in movies.
And he added: ‘What are men like, and what have they been taught?
What is it taught on television, and boys on the street see that they think they have to do this if they want to become real men?
Perhaps this is one of the most important questions we should answer: How can we change it?
But there's really a problem with men."
He said in the study that when the Game of Throne is over the next year, he will no longer play to do his homework or add a little more, but he will say 'wars and fights'.
Kit will begin to play a new movie in November of the next year, Sam Shepard's True West, who is talking about a man who's a movie producer and his brother who's a thief.
He said that his meeting with Rose, his wife, was one of the best things he had ever played with Game of Thrones.
"In this movie I saw my wife, which is why I got a family and began my life," she says.
Rose, the woman interested in Kit, played Ygrintte's role when she played Jon Snow's role, during Emmy Ward-winning.
They were married in the territory of Leslie's family in Scotland this June 2018.
HIV/AIDS: 14% of people said to be infected with the disease in China
China said that 14% of HIV-AIDS sufferers have increased.
More than 820,000 people were injured in the country, health officials say.
From May to July 2018 alone, it is said that it has killed 40,000 people.
Most of them have moved because of sexual activity, but they have never done so before.
Blood transfusions have been the main cause of the disease in some parts of China.
However, HIV is almost gone for blood transfusions, says health officials in China, during a meeting held in Yunnan.
In the year, however, more than 100,000 people have HIV and AIDS in China
The spread of HIV through sex is a major problem among men and women in China.
The cars of both men and women in China have also been legally accepted since 1997, but these are still very different.
Because of the culture in the country, a survey found that between 70 and 90 percent of men who have sex with men only marry women.
The protection of these sexes is not enough, so the disease is spreading.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has agreed to use HIV medicines from other countries to solve the problem.
Maxine Waters refuses that GOP employees have not issued a secret about the senator and says there is a "very dangerous liar" in "one project"
American Maxine Waters, said on Saturday that people working there had been criticized and said they had published the secret of U.S. senators on the Wikipedia page of lawmakers.
Democrats in Los Angeles also confirm that these secrets have been issued by right-wing and web-based people who reject the idea of "the last-right" thought.
"It's a lie, a lie and a most horrible lie," Waters said on Twitter.
Private addresses and phone numbers in the United States are said to include items from South Carolina, Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
These details were published on Thursday, and the person who sent them was unknown, but it was known that this occurred during a senatorial meeting in Capitol Hill, where a joint complaint was made about Brett Kavanaugh's behaviour, which was brought to a vote in the Supreme Court.
The brief explanations were published after the three senators of Kavanaugh's investigation.
Websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState said that the IP address sent the message was from the Waters office, and published information on water workers, The Hill says.
"There is no evidence and it's absolutely false," Waters said.
"The people who work with me - who are hidden behind these patterns - have never published an explanation.
There is no evidence and it's absolutely false."
What he said has made people online more critical of Waters, especially Maison Blanche, and Fleischer's journalist.
"He's worried about leaving," Fleischer said.
"It will never be found that he does not have the quality necessary to be a member of Congress.
A person should not be angry if he is judged but has not done it.
They should not.
He should not be concerned about why the person was thinking about him.
He should be warm and peaceful."
Fleischer compared Waters' reaction to the criticism of democracy about the Kavanaugh case, and his criticism of the fact that he was very angry on Thursday.
Omar Navarro, a representative of the Republican party who is planning to gather Waters' positions on the election, also commented on Twitter.
"It's really important if it's true," he said
Rtoa Waters said his office declared "the authorities and the authorities responsible for the application of the laws because of these restrictions".
"We do what we can to see the perpetrators," he said, "and they will be punished by law for the damage they spread about the people who work with me."
Johnny English is back again – A funny movie by actor Rowan Atkinson
People have become accustomed to thinking that there is a background of Brexit that always shows up with an English player, and that is exactly what happened to Johnny English - who first appeared in 2003, with the title Johnny English, and his poems that appeared in 2011 with the title Johnny English Reborn.
Will we laugh alone if people really do us talking and try to make a move?
In any case, we know that Johnny English has renewed his engagement to do the work, which makes him very well known for the funny films that were produced for English-speaking people.
He doesn't know, and he thinks he's very beautiful, but he's only going to go to Clouseau, and he's got a part to see his name, Mr. Bean. He did something special in the title song of Chariot du Feu that was played at the opening song of the Olympics in London in 2012.
The role of this player was taken as from the film about Atkinson, who is far away from the world. The film was sent to Barclaycards TV, which is now unknown to people.
There's one or two interesting thing about this JE to go out soon.
I like to see Johnny English approaching the helicopter and making old military clothes, and the helicopter's moving on is about to be protected.
Even atkinson's appearance is already funny, but it's not funny and it's like the movie was just forced to make fun of it, even if it's really funny in a movie like 007 and the Mission's impossible.
It's like it's done to entertain children rather than adults, and I think it's not much better than the funny movie she's doing as Bean's role as Johnny English.
But if you see what's going on in the past, Great Britain has a serious problem.
There were Internet smugglers who used people to see the British network, knowing who the British smuggler was, who was upset by the police working at the time — a small part played by Kevin Eldon.
This led a lot of stories for the famous and troubled prime minister, but there was no support. Emma Thompson tried to do what he could when Teresa May played, but he didn't play too much.
His advisers informed him that everyone knew about their customers, so he had to go to work for them.
This was done to glorify Johnny English, who became a teacher in a school for money-based people, and to train him to become a poet: a funny story, because English made him like a school of art.
English once landed in Whitehall and saw former friends, Bough, a role played by Ben Miller.
Bough is already married and works for people in the sea, a woman who shows self-respect: part played by Vicki Pepperdine.
So Batman and Robin are going back to work together, and they will do something wrong when the Queen's Rider is beating down, and they will meet with Ophelia Bulletova, play by Olga Kurylenko, a beautiful and powerful girl.
Meanwhile, however, the prime minister was imprisoned when a man grew rich and could solve the problem of the Internet bully, which was not Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
From that time on, English and Bough began their journey. They had a meal for food developers in the hotel, and they had French hotels. They found problems when they went to Volta's camp. English led a problem when they learned to use casque to give her a picture of Volta's home.
We will still see on the other side of the story. Although it is fun and fun, there is a television program for children that can do it.
It's just an old-fashioned place.
When I saw this Johnny English film, I thought: Atkinson should be given a role by the English to make sure that he is himself when he's playing a movie.
Workers refused to set up a war order so that Britishs could work four days a week but would take five days' wages.
Jeremy Corbyn's party is trying to implement the project to make Britain work four days a week but takes five-day staff.
The syndicate said that employers should transfer the money saved for technology developments by giving them a day off.
It'll give you three days without work at the end of the week but it'll be boring.
The source says the idea will be consistent with the syndicate's work to further benefit workers.
The Congress of Business Members agreed to allow workers to work only four days a week so that they can benefit from economic change.
A longtime member of The Sunday Times Worker's Syndrome said: "The news about how new management is expected before the end of the year.
‘It will not apply to night workers, but the requirement may be good, which is only four days a week, to introduce a percentage of the economic situation and to benefit workers and industrial strategies in a unique way.’
Not only did the Workers' Union have this idea, but the Red Party also promised that it would work only four days a week during its campaign campaign in 2017.
However, the request has not yet been submitted by the Full Workers' Censorship.
One employee's representative said: "It's not a single management system that works only four days a week and has not really been examined by the union."
Chancellor John McDonnell used the conference on work last week to explain how he saw the socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he was ready to join the "indirect potential" and "blessing benefits" of the firm.
The Chancellor project around the world also means that employees in water companies may not be able to recover all the money they have spent because the government can reduce the prices of the land if there is only a small amount of action that is not possible.
He also set up a plan to set up a clear position for employees in the company and to open full funds for the employer to give the same government to non-independent employees up to 10 percent, which includes more than £500 in cash.
"60 minutes," says Lindsey Graham, and John Kennedy to be able to change our mind of the FBI investigation about Kavanaugh.
At least one week, the last election on the appointment of Judge Brett Kavanaugh of the Supreme Court, the FBI's investigation of his case, raised questions as to whether what the office saw could affect the Republican senators no longer support him.
In a survey on Sunday, "60 minutes", journalist Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if there was anything the FBI could do to change their mind.
Kennedy spoke more than his colleague from South Carolina.
"Of course it is," I mean Kennedy.
"I will come from the court," I told him, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after the incident, and the announcement appeared, saying, ‘Did I do that?’
He's determined, ready, free of charge."
But Graham's choice is unstoppable.
"It doesn't change my mind if Brett Kavanaugh comes along and it'll be with serious accusations," she says.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but what I know is, "It's rejected by Brett in the dark," Graham helped, talking to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And the people he named could not confirm.
36 years ago.
I can't see what news and change."
What is the Civil War, and What has been the result of the Poverty Reduction?
New York will next Saturday, an annual event on music that will be attended by many artists to train and encourage; to reduce world poverty.
In his seventh year, the Civil War will see more than ten people on the Central Park scale, not only to enjoy watching a show like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to compete for the real goal of improving the deep poverty in 2030.
The 2012 Civil War is an extension of the Global Poverty Action Project, an international summit that is expected to end poverty by increasing the number of people involved in the war.
To get the free ticket to attend the event (if you don't want to buy tickets for the VIP), viewers need to do a lot of things, or work as volunteers, informing global leaders, implementing telephone calls or other ways to contribute to the campaign on their goal is the fight against poverty.
But why have the world's citizens been successful in 12 years to achieve their goal?
Is it really possible to give people a free ticket to believe in supporting the call for the movement, or is it just called "clickivism" - that people feel the difference when they write names for online demand and just send calls?
Since 2011, citizens have said that they have recorded some 19 million projects from their supporters, which has moved them to reach another goal.
These work has been said to have helped many world leaders to agree and raise nearly $37 million in order to save the lives of more than 2.25 million people from 2030.
In early 2018, the group called for 390 agreements and statements, showing the results of its work, at least 10 billion dollars had already gone back and forth.
The party pointed out that the financial aid had a direct impact on some 649 million people worldwide.
The Power of Nutrition was part of the agreement, the English money earners and executives agreed to work together to "help the child grow legally", and promised to give Rwanda $35 million to help combat malnutrition when more than 4700 people received a voice of acceptance.
"With the support of the English government, volunteers, governments, and citizens like you, we will be able to place "the suffering caused by malnutrition" as a footnote, says The Power of Nutrition Ambassador Tracey Ullman to the public during his exhibition in London in April 2018.
The party also said that after more than 5,000 U.K. efforts to improve food for mothers and children, the government said it would provide money for the "The Power of Nutrition" project, which would help many with food to allow about 5 million children and mothers.
The question on its website will be answered: "Why do you believe we can always be poor?"
Most of the citizens replied: This is going to be a bad and difficult way – we may sometimes fall down, perhaps fail.
However, like ethnic and anti-terrorist movements in our past, we will win because we will be stronger if we are united.
Janet Jackson, the Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monée, is one of those who will take part in this year's event in New York, preceded by Debora-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The U.S. could use the sea army as a "port" so that it would not be able to power - Secretary of State
"If necessary," Washington can call its seaport to prevent Russia's energy from being spread in the market, including in the Middle East, said US Secretary of State Ryan Zinke, according to Washington's Analyst.
Zinke stated that Russia's agreement with Syria - if it is noted, which took place during the call by the governments - is only a way to enter into a new energy market.
"I believe that the reason why they are in the Middle East is because they want to give up energy just as they did in Europe, the treasure of southern Europe," he just said.
And, according to the honourable man, there is good sense of how and how to have children.
"The United States is capable of doing this, with the Navy, can verify that maritime traffic is open and even if it is necessary to fight it so that they can not get out of the market."
Zinke invited the participants invited by the Energy Operators Association, an independent organization that maintains the "Energy Operator's voice" in the United States.
He went on to compare Washington's design with his relationship with Russia and Iran, and noted that both are exactly the same.
"The economic option, either Iran or Russia, is, of course, for financial support and oil transfer, he says, and compared Russia to a "a game bird" with a state of economy based on underground oil.
The announcement came when Trump's delegation was still in operation helping to push natural gas pipelines in Europe, as Russia's successor, to make it easier for European consumers.
Most importantly, President Donald Trump himself won Germany's confidence, including the authorities in Trump's regime, to get rid of the North Stream 2, which, according to Trump, made Berlin a slave to Moscow."
Moscow has confirmed that North Stream's 2-billion-dollar fans, designed to double increase the capacity of the already operating channels to 110 billion cubic metres, are a clean economic project.
The Kremlin explained that Washington's ongoing opposition to the project is only for economic reasons and sets a bad example in the fight against injustice.
"I believe that we all agree that energy should not be a pressure tool and that consumers should be able to choose who they like," Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said at his meeting with the Secretary of the Administration of American Energy Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. position has made Germany return and strengthen its commitment to join the project.
The leader of the German industrial organizations, the German Industry Federation (BDI), called on the US not to detect both the energy and the agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I had a serious problem when there was a third state that was involved in power-consuming in us," says Dieter Kempf, president of the German Industry Federation (BDI) after a meeting with Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will "focus on the move" in 2020, Massachusetts's Senator
Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren's Senator said that he would "focus on the move" to the next election.
At a meeting in Holyoke Massachusetts, Warren spoke about his speech.
"This is the time for women to go to Washington and save our government and include women on stage," says The Hill report.
"I will look closer to the presidential election after November 6th."
Warren even targeted Donald Trump during a meeting at the city hall and said that "his country is not on the road.
"I'm really worried about what Donald Trump will do about our democracy.
Warren is already well known for his criticism of Trump and the politician at Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh.
In a Friday call Warren said "it's clear to him that we need the FBI's investigation before the election."
However, a survey conducted on Thursday showed that most members of Warren's group did not agree to leave in 2020.
Eighty-eight percent of the "certainly" voters from Massachusetts said that they should not go to the Senate, according to the Institute of Political Research at the University of Suffolk/ Boston Globe poll.
Two-thirds of the respondents agree.
The survey showed that former Governor Deval Patrick's support was very much in support of the fight against 38 percent and 48 percent without support.
Many other democratic dignitaries have argued that President Joe Biden and Senator Vermont, Bernie Sanders, may compete in 2020.
Biden said he would make his public decision in January as reported by the Journalist Association.
Sarah Palin points to the East of Track Palin during Donald Trump's public meeting
Track Palin, 26 years old, spent a year in Iraq after entering the army in September.
He was arrested and charged with committing adultery at home on Monday night.
"All that my son has left, he will be able to recover again, I can tell to those families who remember the pain wounds and some of the wounds of our soldiers returned from the war," he said to the audience during Trump's campaign in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in the room" and said of his children and several other prisoners "they changed little from there, became very hard, and wondered if there were any respect for his friends and air carriers, and other members of the army, the country was offered."
She was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, charged with sexual violence against a woman with armed and criminal weapons as reported by Dan Bennett, head of the police department in Wasilla.
18 D.C. support for the elimination of new asylum policies
The 18-year-old state and Colombia's district require legal support for a new American national policy refusing to protect victims of crime or domestic violence.
The representative of 18 countries and the district asked the President's President's Office in Washington to support policy-results, according to the NBC News report.
The full name of the complainant in Grace v. The US ruling on American social freedom of federal policy has not been announced.
Women reported that people with her and her children who were violent killed her but the U.S. government denied her request to move on July 20
He was imprisoned in Texas.
Grace's lawyers have made it clear that El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which causes American asylum seekers, are like a country facing serious problems with domestic offenders and violence.
The US news policy has rejected the decision of the Council of Foreign Affairs which it adopted in 2014 that illegal immigrants have been able to escape domestic violence in order to apply protection.
Colombia's district, law lawyer Karl Racine, said in the Zoma statement that the new policy "is not a minimizing the ten-year rights of the state, federal and international."
"The federal law requires that all courts should conform to the facts and circumstances, and the system that opposes this format," the prosecutor said.
Lawyers have found that immigration policies threaten the economic situation in the United States, claiming that they may become businessmen and "give support to physical work."
Lawyer Jeff Sessions commissioned a refugee camp to stop supporting victims of domestic violence and violence related to the violence in June.
"Assila is for those who leave their country because of persecution or fear for differences in race, faith, nationality, or members of a private social group or political opinion," the secretary said in a declaration on June 11 on politics.
The refuge was not available to all – even the major problems – that people around the world are facing.
In Palu, it seems that the deaths in an attempt to find survivors have increased twice as much as they can.
For survivors, the situation was bad.
"It's very hard," says Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old family mother, who comforted her newborn daughter born in the city of Palu.
"There's always a patient car coming every minute, reporting death.
There is no clean water."
The residents returned to their empty houses, took the water containers, took what they needed.
Hundreds of people were injured and the hospital was hit by 7.5 earthquakes.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who was injured by malaria and tuberculosis, remained in front of the Palu Military Hospital, where patients were treated with severe diseases outside the hospital.
He lost his eyes when he related the terrible earthquake that shattered the fifth floor of his room with his wife and daughter.
"We didn't have time to save ourselves.
I thought I couldn't move on the wall," says Haris in the media gathering, he just went to town to save his family's marriage.
"I heard my wife calling for a break, but I immediately fell asleep.
I don’t know what happened to her and my son.
Let's not forget them."
The U.S. Ambassador accused China of being "torn" by "professive"
A week after the Chinese official newspaper, they published four pages of paper in an American newspaper showing the commercial advantage of China, accusing the US agency of China in Beijing of using the US press to spread ideas
Last Wednesday, U.S. President Donald Trump - the most famous newspaper in Iowa - spoke about China's support for the Congress elections on 6 November.
The trumpet claim that Beijing has been involved in American elections has noted what the US authorities have said to Reuters: a new step in the development of Washington's campaign to force China.
Although foreign governments are accustomed to put up trade to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently struggling with the economics of having equal rights to trade.
China's first campaign was to attack developing countries such as Iowa that supported the Republican Party of Trump, say Chinese and American scientists
Terry Branstad, former U.S. Ambassador to China and former Governor of Iowa, a major business manager of the Chinese agricultural sector, said Beijing had been affected by workers, farmers and businesses in the United States.
In an article published in the newspaper Des Moines on Monday, Branstad wrote to China: "The threat is now increasing twofold in the advertising of free news.
"In launching its campaign, the Chinese government uses the popular tradition of freedom of speech and freedom of the media by placing money-laundering documents on the Des Moines list," says Branstad.
"On the other hand, in Beijing's magazine, you will see the number of unlimited opponents and you will not see the confidence of the Chinese people in a different way about the economic crisis in China, to be severely controlled. The Chinese Communist Party," as it is written.
He also said that "one of the most famous newspapers in China rejected the post's offer," even though he did not directly say the newspaper.
Investigators warned the Republic to flee to voters nine years ago with the Kavanaugh case
Many Republicans support and protect voters to the Brett Kavanaugh tribunal, in front of many statements about sexual violence, one researcher warned that they will show a strong ethicality, especially for women, during the upcoming elections.
The consequences of this situation are very strong and most of the Republicans have already declared that they want to vote later.
Grant Reeher, a political scientist at Maxwell School, University of Syrakuse, released an article published on Saturday.
Reeher doubts whether the voter's efforts by Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) will end in the last minute for the FBI investigation
"The women will never forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget it tomorrow and even November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, the mayor and president of the country MoveOn, according to the Washington news agency, DC
On Friday morning, the protestors called "Went to November!" as they showed in the law of the National Assembly when the Republican ruling the Justices Committee chose to submit the appointment of Kavanaugh, despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's testimony, says I Mic.
"Democraticism and the reasons for democracy will not be included in the table," said Stu Rothenberg, a political researcher who has no support in the media.
"People say it's getting bigger; and that's true.
But it may be higher, especially for rural voters and 18 to 29-year-old voters, although the president does not like them, often do not.
Even before Ford's testimony to his case against the Supreme Court for sexual harassment, the prosecutor announced that if the Republic progressed with the strengthening.
"It has caused tension for GOP," said Michael Steele, president of the former National Committee of the Republic, at the beginning of the week, as told by NBC News.
"Not only the election of the committee or the last election, nor the establishment of Kavanaugh, but also the way the Republican did and how it did it, "Guy Cecil, head of the USA's priorities, a group that helps the elected democracy, said on television.
However, it seems that Americans divide by two who should believe in their stand as witnesses but Ford is more faithful than Kavanaugh
YouGov's study found that 41% of the respondents believed in the Ford testimony, while 35% said they did not believe in Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38% said Kavanaugh lied as a witness, and 30% said Ford was the same.
After Flake's interview, the FBI is investigating Ford's charges and other prosecutors, Deborah Ramirez, according to The Guardian.
Ford stood up as a witness before the Senate Justice Committee during his speech last week that Kavanaugh had attacked him at the age of 17.
Ramirez announced that the Supreme Court's candidate showed his attitude during his meeting with the party during the school in Yale in 1980.
The World Wide Web creator is trying to create new Internets used on Google and Facebook.
Tim Berners-Lee, the founder of the World Wide Web, launched a campaign against Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest innovation project, Inrupt, is a company based on the open-source platform of Berners-Lee, Solid.
Solid allows the user to choose the location where the archived file is stored and who can access the notification.
In a special interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that "inrupt" is the goal of "Inrupt".
"We have to do this now," he said to the new company.
"It's a special time."
The program uses thousands of technologies to allow people to create "special websites" or PODs for themselves.
There may be a list of players, a list of things done, a list of music and other special tools and skills.
Like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify, there are only one "navigator" and at the same time.
The distinctive feature of the website is the user's ability to access the type of media.
The company's commitment is "to give special attention through data."
According to the director general of the company John Bruce, Inrupt aims to provide a source of power, expertise and expertise to make it available to all.
The company is currently the company Berners-Lee, Bruce, in a security area purchased by IBM, has been contacted by volunteers to work on projects and societies.
Since this week, technology users around the world can create applications for themselves using the tools found on Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team are not talking about "Facebook and Google" in order to make a complete change that will completely change the model of their sales here.
"We do not ask permission from them."
In an article on the Media released here on Saturday, Berners-Lee said that "Worming is to give economic and environmental energy to protect the dignity and quality of the new news site."
In 1994, Berners-Lee changed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Over the past few months, Berners-Lee has participated in the discussion on the absence of the Internet.
Even at the beginning of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and head of the World Wide Web Consortium, building the site and the Open Data Institute.
"I am really looking forward to this new era of the site," says Bernards-Lee.
Bernard Vann: Victoria's Tower of First Great War Celebrates · Global Voices
The only church leader in the Church of England won the Victoria Prize during World War I as a warrior was celebrated in the city of his birth 100 years later.
Colonel Lithuania The Reverend Bernard Vann won a prize on September 29, 1918 against Bellenglishe and Lehacourt.
He didn't even know he had a reputation for being an English army but was shot four days later by a professional shooter.
A stone was displayed by her two little boys during the night, in Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
Michael Vann, one of his children, said that "his main point of history" was why the stone was shown 100 years after the war that his father was well-known.
According to London Gazette, Lieutenant Colonel Van led his military team on the Canal Saint-Quentin, in a "dangerous and bullet explosion across the battlefield", on September 29, 1918.
Then he used to speak at the shooting site, and he led his group first in "the most special and honorable way" and then himself shot and killed three people in the enemy group.
A German professional gunman killed Lieutenant-Colonel Vann on October 4, 1918, a month before the end of the war.
72-year-old Michael Vann said he "will never be able to imitate" what his father did, so that makes him "slow".
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also raised a reputation after the death, led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he "was happy to take part in the funeral", and he also said that "a person is very proud of having many supporters."
MMA's supporters called to see Bellator 206; but Peppa Pig appeared again
Imagine that you were preaching and enjoyed watching Bellator 206, but then you stopped looking at the program.
There were 13 wars in San Jose's program, and six of them were of great interest to the people and were sent all night to the United Kingdom, on Channel 5.
But at six o'clock in the morning, when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were ready to fight, British observers were shocked and surprised because the program suddenly changed Peppa Pig.
Some were surprised because they had just been talking to see the competition.
One viewer said on Twitter that the film was "real" for children.
"If the law of the state does not allow the program to be launched at 6:00 a.m., the program has to be replaced for children," said Dave Schwartz, vice president of Bellator's business and communication.
"Peppa the Pig," ie."
Bellator's president, Scott Cooker, said that he would warn British viewers about the next program.
Coker said he "thinks of going back to send it back" and "finding a solution."
"The day has already arrived at six o'clock in the morning, so we can't solve the problem unless Sunday comes at our place.
But we are looking for solutions.
We feel that there are so many shared messages, and most of those who wrote them are not happy.
We are trying to fix the problem. We thought it was a technical problem,
or the issue of sovereignty.
We hope that the following examples will no longer happen.
We're going to reduce the number of competitions rather than be six, for example, because we've tried to please the viewer, it's become a habit too much.
It is also very sad."
Disk Desert Island: Tom Daley felt "lower" than anyone else
The Olympic poet Tom Daley said he felt "low" to others when he grew up, because he loved men, but that made him determined to succeed.
The 24-year-old boy said he was in high school just feeling like "we didn't have anyone like him."
He commented on the program offered by Lauren Laverne on Radio 4 Desert, saying that people who love men or women also have rights, and he wants to give others "a hope."
He also said that when he was a child, it was no longer important for him to win the Olympic Games.
The program provider, Kirsty Young, has been unemployed for several months because he is ill.
It's like Daley was a shipman on his first show with Laverne, so he said he felt "low" compared to others when he grew up because "the society didn't agree that this is a man who loves men or women."
He said: "I have always felt inferior to others, but this today gives me strength and makes me determined to succeed."
He wants to show people that he's "performable", so people won't be very disappointed when they know he loves men.
He received two medals and wanted to support LGBT. He appeared in front of many people during the game of the Commonwealth in Australia this year, and he used to announce that all countries should be free and that LGBT should not be banned.
He said he took a speech because he knew that he was happy, because he was not accused of being allowed to join a free man, so he wanted to give others "a hope".
The winner of the three world events said he was a man's boss, not the US film producer Dustin Lance Black, who met him in 2013. "I didn't expect it."
Daley married the one who won Oscar at the age of 20.
"When you're going to get into all kinds of things when you're young - she's been involved in the first Olympic Games at the age of 14, and her father died three years later – it's hard to see people like you have suffered from something like what you've got."
He had two children in June, a child named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said he changed his "how he thinks and sees things."
"If I asked you a question last year, I would say, "I'll do what I can get the gold medal," she said.
"You see, there is something more important than gold medals.
Robbie's a medalist."
Her son bears the name of his father, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 when he was diagnosed with cancer.
Daley said he never agreed to his father's mind that he would die, and the last thing he asked was to get a ticket for London in 2012 because he wanted to sit on the first number to look at his son.
I couldn't tell him, "You won't look at me first."
"I held her hand when she was gone. When she was no longer alive, I thought she might be broken," she said.
The following year, 2012, Daley took part in the Olympic Games and won the medal.
"That's what I've been hoping for since I was a little boy, that I'm going to laugh in front of a lot of people in the Olympics. I'm really happy."
It also gave him inspiration when he chose his song – Proud de Heather Small – which gave him strength during the preparation of the Olympics. He was still very scared.
You'll have the Desert Island Discs on Radio BBC on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson was not allowed to participate in Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mikkelson will try to find the best he can do on Sunday, when he takes the 47th ryder Cup game, but he has to try to describe what he has done so that he doesn't make it a lot of fun for him.
Mickelson participated in the action every two years, but Captain Jim Furyk was removed for the four rounds of August.
Although many should focus on it, such as in the United States, she went with the pump-pom Girl for a whole day, and tried to correct her failure.
It's not easy to drive, even though it's already very popular. He's 48 years old but he's not allowed to play the National Golf, because if it's not possible to launch the ball, it's completely lost.
Although the place is difficult to play, it will be against the famous British, Francesco Molinari in the enemy game he will play on Sunday, which he joined with the team this week's winner, who is not Tommy Fleetwood.
This game will be very important for Mikkelson, especially if he is trying to start again, since the American team has already won four out of the 12 simple games.
Furyk says that his players are so confident that he won’t speak too much.
"He well knows what he's doing today is very important. He threw me out a little bit, then he picked me up and said he was ready for the game tomorrow," Furyk said.
"He is very confident.
He was one of the most famous players in the Temple, and has been very helpful to his team since this week.
I didn’t think he would play twice.
But I hoped he would play more than that, but we believe that this is what we should do.
He wants to be like everyone."
Mickelson will get more characters than Nick Faldo on the Ryder Cup on Sunday.
This may be the last time he plays with Ryder Cup, which will get the most character of all games he's ever done.
Mickelson, an intervention 20-year-old, won a 7-temps, although Furyk said that his arrival had caused the team to double.
"He smiles even though he smiles, he's very thoughtful, he loves to smile, he's happy to have him in the team," she says.
"I believe he and the young members of the team this week are very happy to see it.
He's not just playing but really giving."
European team captain Thomas Bjorn knows they can be defeated.
European Captain Thomas Bjorn, from his experience, knows that even though they are leading a little ahead of the two players' games on the last day of Ryder Cup, it is easy to turn around and turn around.
In 1997 the Dana was the first to play in Valderama. Seven Ballesteros' team won over five American teams at that time, but it just won. They won 1411⁄2-13 1⁄2
"You always remember that we led to Valderama, we led to Brooklyn, which hit us, and to Valderama which we won, but now," Bjorn, who could, after watching the 2018 Class of 2018, received 5-3 marks last Friday and evening, leading 10-6 at Le Golf National.
So the story of me and everyone in the team will show that it's not over yet.
You make the most of your efforts in the morning.
Go up to the platform and do all you can.
It's not yet possible that we're still looking for a sign on the table.
Our goal is: to get the job, that's what we focus on.
I've always said from the first time that I'm really interested in 12 players, but we also know that one of the world's most experienced is against us."
Bjorn enjoyed his players playing in the troubled golf field, and he added: "I shouldn't think I'm capable of this.
I don't know what tomorrow will bring.
Each morning, it becomes a different thing.
It's nice to play together when everything's okay, but when you're invited to play alone, you're actually seeing your golf skills.
This is the message you need to send to players, to give you your best tomorrow.
Don't think about your friend, but let him give you his best."
But Furyk is not like Bjorn, because he wants each one of them to make the best of it, just like they did when they were with his friends, but Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, because he got three in four games.
Furyk is still at the end of the great and unique days, from the winning team in Brooklyn before he was hit by the "Miracle at Medinah" in Europe.
"I remember all the games in it," he explained how Ben Crenshaw, captain of the game in 1999, caught up with the players on the final day of the game.
"There are 12 big games tomorrow, but you should be ready immediately to begin to take on the example you saw in Brooklyn, like you saw in Medinah.
It is an obstacle, when it comes to one of its needs, that puts a lot of pressure on the games in its hopes.
And we're wearing what we love about kids, you see, we're going to do something really weird tomorrow.
Thomas tried to lead the game against Rory McCllroy in the most extreme game, along with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, Europeans on his team.
"I chose this group after this order because I think it's possible for it to end," Bjorn explained his choice for two players' opposite games.
The arrival of new German warships is still underway
The new German army ship should have arrived in 2014 to take over the warship on the day of the Cold War, but it will not have been there for at least a year on the basis of the reason for its construction and price growth according to news reports.
Using "Rheinland-Pfalz," the arrival of the leadership of the Baden-Wuertemberg class was delayed for half of 2019 according to military commander Die Zeit newspaper.
The ship should have been used in the marine army in 2014, but because of its transport problems, the project was damaged.
The four vessels of Baden-Wuertemberg returned by the Navy in 2007 will replace Bremen ships that are already on board.
Of course, they will place heavy clouds, aircraft combatants, ships and technology inspectors, such as a small possible hidden radar, with sound and special alerts.
It is also one of the special features of the long-term maintenance of it, it may be possible to have these new ships released in the camp within two years.
However, the continued damage means that the final landing vessels are considered to have been exposed to German forces at sea again before the time of use, according to Die Zeit.
The F125 ship gained a victory last year when the German Navy officially refused to use it and returned it to the port of Bloom & Voss in Hamburg.
First of all, the marine army returned the ship to its manufacturer.
It is not very clear why it was returned, but German media said that "no cultural and physical integrity" did not allow the warship to be used in a peaceful way.
The lack of information is a major problem because 120 ships lead Baden-Wuertemberg's crews to less than one of the people who brought the former Bremen ship.
In addition, it is clear that the ship was too heavily loaded and reduced its speed and was limited by the special reforms made by the Navy.
It is believed that the "Rheinland-Pfalz" 7,000 tons is twice as heavy as the same vessel as Germany used in World War II.
In addition to physical disability, the cost of a whole project has also become a problem, including the training of vessels in its management.
It has been said that up to 3.1 billion euros (or 3.6 billion dollars), should be 2.2 billion euros at first.
The problems of the newest ships as soon as they are warned that Germany's maritime forces are sinking into the sea are particularly important.
In the early part of this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament Security Committee, admitted that the Navy is "no longer equipped with thousands and enough ships."
The honourableman said the problem was growing rapidly as the former ships were no longer used but no new ships were given to replace them.
He even complained that not one of the Baden-Wuertemberg ships could be used by the Navy.
National Trust identifies the secret of my father's life
A new study carried out in Scotland’s upper part of the country found how our brothers were doing when they were eating on the streets of the city.
It is hoped that the life - style of this amazing single animal will be better explained but the research will go on and will help protect the potential future of nature.
Research by scientists at the National Trust in Scotland will focus on the "pipistrelles" seen and "soprano", as well as the long-colored haircuts and the Daubington brothers in Inverwe Gardens, Western Ross.
A special person will be sent to the site to record the actions and lives of our relatives during the specified period.
NHS employees and several volunteers will also carry out a free investigation using oral contraceptives.
The experts will then use the available recordings, including a father's call and what kind of person he or she is doing.
There will be a photo of the home of relatives and reports to be taken to create pictures showing their actions in rural areas.
Rob Dewar, an NTS consultant and naturalist, is expected to find the answer to the search to find out where our parents really need and how they live in each of their species.
It will help to identify the benefits of the management of the habitats of these animals, such as the establishment of a dam and how forest sites can be preserved as far as possible for their parents and their species.
It appears that over the centuries, our brothers in Scotland and around Great Britain have been very close to each other.
Larger buildings and types of development work are dangerous to them.
However, lighting and electric motors can also be dangerous, such as other type of paint and chemical paints used in construction equipment, and the accompanying cane can be arrested.
However, my father was not an alcoholic.
However, because he is an animal hunter at night, his soup works more than his eyes when he captures his prey.
He uses a lot of techniques and me to see clearly the animals that are connected to him and the problems that may confront him on the screen.
The NTS, which manages more than 270 historical buildings, is a very important garden of 38 and in 76,000 hectares across the country, fully takes care of our father.
He has ten skilled workers, regularly researching, watching and sometimes even saving.
Scotland has even made a number of its capitals in the natural habitats of Drave in Dumfries and Galloway, eight of which are natives from Scotland.
The country’s leader, David Thompson, said that there was a real place for them.
"We have a place for our parents here in Three," he said.
"We have many buildings, lots of trees that have existed for so long and perhaps a good place to live.
But there are still many things we don't know about our parents, so our work here and elsewhere will help us to understand more about what they really need to grow faster."
He emphasized the importance of monitoring our parents before they take care of them because the risk of a single birth dog is likely to kill up to 400 sisters and their children, and the whole group of mothers is likely to be wiped out.
My father is a protected animal and the law prohibits killing him, tortures them, tortures them, or damages their skin.
Elizabeth Farrell, elected Special Representative for Bat Conservation Trust in Scotland, urged the public to do so.
He said: "There are still many things we need to know about our parents and, for most of our species, we just don't know what their class is doing."
Ronaldo rejected his accusations for trial and decided to preach a peaceful newspaper
Christian Ronaldo insisted that the charges against him were "inaccurate news", and said they were "to be known," using his name.
Her attorneys misjudged the German news reporter Der Spiegel who published the charge.
The player of Portugal and Juventus was accused of being a victim of an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel in Las Vegas in 2009.
It was said that she had raised $375,000 for the woman after that to avoid reporting what happened, as Der Spiegel said on Friday.
Kristian Ronaldo, 33 years old, spoke directly with the Instagram video to over 142 million fans and followers after the complaint was released, and it was repeated that it was "inaccurate news."
"Csy, csy, csy, csy, csy.
What they said today, a lie, says the winner who won his gold medal and turned to photographers.
"They want to know people, so they use my name.
It's legal.
They want to say my name, but it's part of the work.
I am very happy and not worried," said the player, and he laughed.
Ronaldo's spokesman prepared to accuse Der Spiegel for the false charge, they called it "a negative statement and a personal concern" according to Reuters report.
Lawyer Christian Scherts said he should ask for compensation for the "conformity of the event and its consequences" which is certain to be part of a violation of one's human rights, most important at present."
It was said that it occurred at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas in June 2009.
After they met at a concert hall, it was reported that Ronaldo and Mayorga returned to the player's room, where he was taken to his bed, according to a statement written at Clark County District Court in Nevada.
The Mayorga said Ronaldo refused after the incident and told him that he could be called a good person "99 percent" but was rejected by the "one hundredth."
The report said Ronaldo agreed that they both had sex but agreed."
Mayorga also said she went to the police and had photos of the injuries she had suffered in the hospital, but later she agreed not to raise the case because she "was afraid that the case would be based on her" and thought she might be "freedom."
The 34-year-old woman just said she was going back to the case and she was still afraid of what happened.
Ronaldo was already on his way to rescue Real Madrid from the Manchester United States at the time of the charges, and moved to the capitals of Juve Italia after a 100 million euros deal last year.
Brexit: 'For all eternity' is the fact that Great Britain's car manufacturers have disappeared
Great Britain "will be really hurt forever" if it loses its place in the production of cars around the world after its release, Secretary Greg Clark says.
As for Toyota, he added that if he leaves the European Union without any measures, the production of the office in Burnaston, near Derby, would not last long.
"We need an agreement," said Mr. Clark.
Japan's car manufacturer said the impact of the damage on the border with the result of Britain's unrestricted release could lead to much work.
The Burnaston factory enables Auris and Avensis of Toyota to produce about 150,000 cars a year which 90% have been transferred to all EU member countries.
"As far as I can see, if Britain leaves the European Union by the end of March we will see that the production in our news will stop," says Marvin Cooke, head of Toyota in Burnaston.
Other car manufacturers for Great Britain expressed concern about their release from the European Union, there was no agreement on how to carry out trade negotiations, such as Honda, BMW, and Jaguar and Land Rover.
For example, BMW said that it would close its production plant in Oxford within a month after Brexit.
What's really disturbing is what car drivers say about the burden that might be on Brexit's credit card.
Toyota's method of production is based on "time-consuming", with a payout coming every 37 minutes from UK and European Group for that vehicle only.
If the United Kingdom leaves no agreement with the European Union on March 29, there may be an earthquake on the border that can cause people to suffer and lack of assistance in this area.
Toyota will not be able to stay for more than one more day to monitor her production building in Derby, the manager of the company says, so production must be stopped.
Mr. Clark said that Theresa May's approach to the European Union's communication plan was "a clear sign to prevent changes on the border."
"We need to make an agreement We want to set the best possible measure, not just to live up to the success I have already said, but also to be able to use this event to benefit us, he says on a program on 4 BBC today.
"Toyota is still the only evidence that there are other producers that we still need to continue the independent way of action that has so far led to great success."
Toyota could not say that production would be fun, but he said that there would be a long-term problem, because of the uncertainty it might reduce competition with other producers and cause unemployment.
Peter Tsouvallaris, a 24-year-old worker in Burnaston and a member of the Society's meeting director at the factory, said that its members were deeply affected by "As far as I can see they're gone, they won't come back.
The government's spokesman also said: "We should put in place a carefully and successful dead scheme in the future of the European Union."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed by "Maison Blanche."
The meeting that might well be said of Donald Trump and the temporary President of the Roseenstein Supreme Court is "no longer than a week" because the war continues with Brett Kavanaugh in the Supreme Court, says Maison Blanche's newspaper this Sunday.
Roseinsten closely monitors the work of Special Representative Robert Muelle, who is conducting an investigation into Russia's anti-election, the relationship between Trump's and Russia's assistance and the potential threat of the court.
Either way, Trump sends the temporary president of the Supreme Court, and Mueller will no longer be able to leave, according to Washington's release for several months.
Rosenstein said he would listen to Trump's conversation and talked about how the president might be removed by law 25th, says New York Times' report earlier this month.
Roseinstein rejected the report.
But on Monday he went to Maison Blanche, and there was another report that he was about to leave.
But there was a meeting with Trump in the United States in New York, as announced on Thursday.
Trump said he should not leave Rosenstein but that the beginning of the meeting was postponed to prevent a defect during the hearing of the Senate Committee of Kavanaugh and a woman who accused him of being a self-conformity, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, who both confirmed it.
On Friday, Trump investigated the FBI for a week on the complaint about Kavanaugh, and your election to the Senate has been completely postponed.
Sarah Sanders, Trump's assistant secretary, appears on Fox News Sunday.
When she asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: "The date of this meeting has not yet been set, perhaps this week, I've seen all the other things happening in the Supreme Court.
But we'll see, I'll always tell the journalist."
Some journalists did not appreciate this apology: Sanders has never visited a journalist in Maison Blanche since September 10th.
The organizer, Chris Wallace, asked why.
Sanders replied that the update of the press meeting was not just because of the lack of love for the "newcomer's message" on television but said, "I don't refuse to sleep for them."
But he promised to increase the direct meeting of journalists and Trump.
"The president holds a more meeting with Questions and Answers than with previous presidents," he added, there is no evidence: "We have already looked at these figures."
A meeting is still going to be held, Sanders says, but "If journalists have the right to ask the US President directly questions, that's better than talking to me.
We will do as much as we can and you will see that we have done so many times over the last few weeks and that will replace the press meeting so you can talk to the President of the United States."
Trump always answers questions when leaving Maison Blanche or when attending free meetings or meetings of journalists when visiting authorities.
It's not just a conversation with journalists.
Perhaps the president in New York this week showed why he doesn't read his head and does a special job when the reporters come up.
The Health Secretary of the European Union of NHS Scoltand wrote to a staff member of the NHS Scoltand about the potential for Britain's release
The Health Secretariat wrote to members of the European Group working in the NHS in Scotland to express its appreciation and desire for their stay after Britain's release.
Jeane Freeman MSP sent a letter to go to the European Union in less than a month.
It has already agreed to pay tribute to the European People's Party working for the Ecose government.
Ramatoa Freeman, in his letter, says: "Over the past year, the agreement between Britain and the European Union on the liberation has continued to lead to a decision pending this end.
But the British government is already prepared for what may happen to the dispute.
I know that you're all a bunch of people.
That's why I say it's important for me to take part of each of them, not in terms of their background.
They share the experience and knowledge necessary to strengthen and develop health work and also benefit from our patients and organisations, working together across the European Union and abroad.
Scotland is your home and we really want you to stay here."

The Tigra team of Tennessee State faced a severe investigation after its head was injured on Saturday, winning Vanderbilt Commodores in numbers 31-27, according to the report by Mike Organ from Tennessee.
Rod Reed, a citizen of Tennessee State, told reporters that the accident had occurred shortly before the end of the first period.
"He came to the edge of the field and was like the dust here," Reed said.
Abercrombie was given by the usual and oxygen - health worker at the edge of the stage before she was taken to the hospital and brought back to visit.
An authority from Tennessee State told WSMV employee Chris Harris of Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie was released to the Vanderbilt Hospital.
Harris added that "he doesn't yet know about the damage he has suffered" and will try to help Tennessee State when the investigation is under way.
Abercrombie and her first play in Tennessee State after she moved from Illinois.
Five tackle matches he made on Saturday before he left the stadium, making his tackle matches up to 18 during this time of play.
Foreign buyers will need more taxes when buying houses in the United Kingdom
Foreign buyers will be required to pay more taxes when they get owned in Great Britain and will also contribute more money to help the homeless in the new Tory scheme
The protest will impede Corbyn's success in his campaign to capture voters' young people
The increase is due to those who do not pay taxes in Great Britain.
The State Council hopes it will rise to 120 million each year to help the homeless.
Foreign buyers will be asked for more taxes when they get owned in Great Britain and will still contribute more money to help the homeless, as Theresa May says today
To be seen as an effort to prevent Jeremy Corby's success in the process of visualizing young voters, he promised to provide housing for the public sector and the high pay.
Each and the non-compulsory companies in Great Britain are going to pay this high charge, contributing money to help the government's fight against legal fraud.
The current increase in debt, including the highest debt required from two years ago to have two houses and the purchase of housing for rent, can reach up to three percent.
The government budget expects it to rise to £120 million a year.
More than three percent of London-based new houses are estimated to have been purchased by non-residents in England, making it expensive and difficult for those who buy it.
Many of the wealthiest parts of the country in the capital have become "Catholic City" because many foreigners are owned by the world but spend most of their time abroad.
Apply the new policy, Boris Johnson has just called on the campaign to help young people to have a home for themselves.
He said that the land and houses had become too expensive because large construction companies were not using them, and he encouraged Rtoa May to set up house purchases to free the "British-deserved land on property."
Mr. Corbyn expressed some interesting ideas about the change in household affairs, including the monitoring of housing and the abolition of "no reason."
He also wanted to give more authority to the responsible to create new houses.
Ramatoa May says: "In the past year I said that the restoration of Britain's dream would be proud to have a better family life.
And that means our oil will be poured into the real estate market.
England is open for people who want to live, work and build life here.
However, it is not possible to buy a house similar to that of the British country that is very hard to live for anyone who does not live in Britain, such as a foreign company.
For many people, they just dreamed of having a house, and the freedom of access to roads is still visible and real."
Jack Ross: 'My main wish is to manage Scotland'
Sunderland's manager Jack Ross said his "most important wish" is to lead Scotland to the best.
Scott, 42 years old, will be happy and ready to resume the North-East club, which currently has the third number of First League, less than three of the first numbers.
He moved to the Light Tower a year after he led St. Mirren back to Scotland's Head in the final game.
"I want to play for my country as a player.
I got a B shot and that's it," Ross said in the BBC voice of Ekosy's Sparrow.
"I grew up looking at Ekosy in Hampden with my father as a child, and that was always what brought me back.
But I will be able to do it if the club manages."
These are the ones that Ross has played in the management of Sunderland: Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardice, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyt and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic manager said it was not difficult for him to follow the names of those named for such giant clubs, if the offer from Barnesley and Ipswich Town was rejected.
"My previous success is controlled by ‘Can I go back to the club with the First League?’
Because because of how it works and behaves in this club it is certain that it belongs to the First League," he simply said.
"It's not easy to get it here, but I think I'll be successful if I can get back to the club."
Ross managed for only three years, after working for a short time as assistant director in Dummarton and one of his most devoted trainees for 15 months.
Thus, he helped Alla to sing after his third birthday, and the next time St. Mirren was raised by the winner's Lord from the struggle for war.
And Ross said he's now more alive than ever during his performances in Cycle, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"It's certainly a service," he just said, about welcoming Allaa.
"I really believed that management was more possible to me than playing.
It's an odd example of hearing, but I'm not interested, it's built up in it, and I've tried to have some superior views.
But playing can be hard.
There are many things you can look forward to each week.
I still live in it when I work hard and work hard but management goes for it.
I've always wanted to control it and I've been doing it now, and I feel that it's really possible for me since my life."
The entire study, on Radio Scotland, will be held on Tuesday, 30 September, from 12 to 1 p.m. in England.
Good time to drink beer at 5:30 p.m., according to an investigation
The market did not start with these alcoholic beverages, but it is now full of people because of the increase in temperature, but the place of food is no longer available.
According to the study, the market value of alcoholic beverages increased by 2.7 per cent in July, but food prices decreased by 4.8 per cent.
When Peter Martin, an adviser to the CGA company, saw these figures, he said: "The day has always been hot and has been a longer part of the competition as a director of the Ballina Games, so the situation has continued since July. The cost of alcohol sales has increased by 2.8 percent since then, and there is no room for food.
The food station in June has reduced by 1.8 percent, and the market has not gone further in July.
The place of sale with alcohol has become the most popular and expensive since the restaurant has never been able to use it.
Traders have also not been able to increase these high temperatures, but to benefit from the same food station.
It's like people just want to get out to drink.
Over the months, sales increased to 6.6 percent in these wine-producing malls, and food stands down to 3 percent."
Paul Newman, an RSM's tax and hospitality analyst, said: "This thing has been starting since April, and is still going on.
The weather and sports competition have made the road traders more famous.
It is not surprising that food facilities are always difficult, which would be very expensive for them because the income has dropped by 4.8 percent during the year, but the prices of food are constantly rising and rising.
Food vendors are very confident about these high temperatures during these years, but we do not know if climate change has changed in August."
As the increase in the market value of these alcohol-consuming markets, including those that have recently been opened, increased by 2.7 percent in July, although there were no sales.
Coffer Peach Tracker's sales manager examined the results of 47 coffee shops, alcohol and food companies in the English country, and found that the money was worth $9 billion in cash, which led to the sale’s success.
One child in five has a hidden account on the Internet that his parents don't know
A study found that one child of every five — the smallest of 11 years of age — has a hidden account on a web site that he or she does not know about his parents or teachers.
A survey of 20,000 students at school said they had a "secret page in the Instagram"
The news reports that they share their share of pollutants is threatening to increase.
20 percent of the children said they had a "dedicated" account to inform their parents
1 child every 5 – the smallest of 11 years of age – or has a hidden account on a web site that does not know adults.
A survey of 20,000 students at school found that children with "secret accounts in Insta" were growing on Instagram’s photo-sharing website.
The news reports that they share their share of pollutants is threatening to increase.
20 percent of children say they have a "special" account to show their parents, but they also have a hidden account.
A pregnant mother saw her 13-year-old daughter's pregnant account and saw a young man telling people: "I'm leaving."
The study, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the HMC, found that 40 percent of 11 to 18 years olds have multiple accounts, and some of them admitted that they have a secret account.
HMC head Mike Buchanan said: "Singing that many young people want to open a hidden account without knowing their parents and teachers."
Elidh Doyle is "the voice of athletes" in the Scottish Athletics Council
Eliidh Doyle was appointed by the Scottish Athletics Board to be head at the annual meeting of the organization.
Doyle, the most famous athlete in Scotland, and President Ian Beattie, announced that this has been done to enable sports organizers to benefit from Doyle's skills and experience in the last ten years at the international level.
"Eildh has great respect for the sports organisation in Scotland, England and around the world, and we can be sure that it will benefit sportsmen in Scotland if it is included in the council," Beattie says.
I Doyle says: "I am happy to represent "the sound of athletes," and I hope that I will be able to move and help improve sports in Scotland."
The American who won the 200 - 400 - foot - long [200 - 400 m] race at the Olympic Games in Atlanta in 1996 – who received four of its gold medals — and often expresses a sports opinion in BBC, could not walk because blood in his brain had stopped bleeding for a short time.
He wrote on Twitter: "I'm on my way, one month today.
I can't go.
The doctor then said that I was not sure whether I would be willing or not, that it would depend on the passing of time and not how.
It’s so hard, I’m ready for it, I’m starting again and I’m getting a little tired!
Thank you for the encouraging message!"
The market for water pumps, which compares the mother’s mother to women’s
A company's sales of a water-producing company that compares believing mothers and females have led to a discussion on the Internet.
Elvie Company published a video showing family mothers who comment on the use of this device, when doing what is called "The first possible sound aid on earth."
This is part of the song that has four families dancing in a crowded village: "I only take water from me, but I don't have any shoes" and "If you don't see it well, I don't drink it but I do."
So it's going back: "I'm crying, I'm crying, I'm giving birth; I'm crying, I'm crying, I'm giving tears to these women."
However, when the sale was made, which was published on the Facebook page of the company, there was a lot of debate on the Internet.
The video was seen by 77,000 people, and hundreds of people commented on it. It was different from what people saw it, and many said it was a "bad story" for water-producing companies.
"The idea of using cattle did not come up with the idea of the trade.
These sheep, for example, need to bring forth fresh seeds, unless their young child is taken away from birth," said one person who commented.
Elvie (Elvie/Mother) can be hidden inside the soutien gorge
Another wrote: “It is likely that the mother and the child will not be able to think and fear them at all times.
But why is it that they are used to make popcorn for a mother who cares for her child?"
Others say, "It's a really new business document."
Others expressed a positive view of the trade, for example, when one woman said that the song was "beautiful".
"It's a good idea.
When I was still a believer, I bought an example
I even felt like a woman when I used poplars.
The shop's just a few minutes ago, but it's all I want.
The idea is very good," one person said.
Another wrote: "The shop is designed to make a smile to the mother of a family using a doll (in use or in the exit room) who feels like "abow".
The market has not been made to open up or criticize the producer company's water products."
At the end of the video, all the women who were dancing were showing each other the blow she made in the Soviets.
There are many women who feel like a bear when they use poplars. That's what they really want to show behind the shop.
The Elvie Poompy doesn't really sound, but it doesn't need a channel, but it's into the Soviets, so it's possible for the mother to move or hold her child and walk on the sidewalk when using the pump.
Ana Balarin, an ECD and a member of Mother's company, commented: "Pawpy Elvie is going to have a real change in people's lives and should do business to make it known.
We want to show everyone the feelings of our mother when we compare them to women in the store, and what everyone sees about the difficulties these women face, because of the fact that they are able to make women feel more comfortable using this pump.
The Elvie Poompy has not become an interesting news item yet.
A mother of two children used the instrument at the funeral for famous lawyer Marta Jakubowski during the Fashion Week in London.
Hundreds of children of migrants have been moved to a secret camp on the border of Texas
The number of children who have moved to live has increased, although the number of people who have moved abroad has not changed per month, and the reasons for such talks by Trump and his strong policies have become more difficult to accept and care for these children even if there are people who are willing to take care of them.
In the past, only those who moved out of the country were often cared for by people who had no legal letters, so they became afraid that they would not be able to stay in the country if they asked for a child home.
The fear has increased since June because federal authorities have announced that adults who host children and other adults should be given their allowance in the same way, and they will then be given the authorities to take care of migration.
Last week, Matthew Albence, head of the Finnish Immigration and Customs Force, told Congress that there were tens of thousands of people who had been asked to visit the organization’s children.
The organization then said 70 percent of the victims had not yet been protected from criminal offences.
"More than 80 percent of the people who ask for these homes, or their families, are immigrants who do not have a legal letter, and many of them are criminals in their country of origin.
We are still looking for these people," Atoa Albence says.
The organizers are eager to organize the case for their children and set up a new law that will allow their children to raise a tribunal 30 days after their arrival, rather than wait 60 days as usual, which is common among people working in detention camps.
Many use videos, but not directly when judges are supposed to judge residents.
Those who have been judged and have no right to vote will soon be returned to their country of origin.
Over the past few months, people working in the camp have said that children are becoming more frightened and frustrated when they are arrested for a long time, and some even try to escape.
Lawyers say they are getting more and more training from a larger organization such as the Tornillo.
They also said that if the children were taken to the camp but were not given enough time to prepare their minds and hearts when they left their friends, the pain and fear that they had received increased and they had spoken hard.
The American, French and Turkish military have asked Syria to leave their country immediately.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Walid al-Moulam, spoke directly to the United Nations summit and asked Syrian refugees to return to their homeland even though the war in the country had lasted for eight years.
Atoa Moualem, who is also Deputy Prime Minister, announced that the soldiers had joined the Syrian country but had not been allowed to, as they were growing up to fight terrorism, "a man who is punished according to what he has done."
"The military should leave immediately and be out of line" he said at his summit.
Atoa Moualem confirmed that "the war against terrorism is about to end" in Syria, and more than 366,000 people have died since 2011, and millions have had to flee for it.
He also said that Damascus "continues the holy war" to "clean the Syrian land" so that terrorists and other "unlawful buildings" on their land will be able to survive.
Some 2,000 soldiers from the United States are in Syria, who are invited to train and advise Kurdes and Syrian Arabs to fight the regime of President Bashar al-Assad.
The war was fought by more than 1,000 French soldiers in this routine country.
When Atoa Moualem spoke of refugees, he said they could move to their country and blamed "some of the Western countries" who "screamed and threatened" refugees and caused them to stay away from their country.
"We have already called on the International Family and human rights organizations to facilitate refugee camps," she says.
"They're trying to make politics about people."
The U.S. and the European Union said they would not help to overcome the damage in Syria if they didn't make an agreement with Assad to stop the war.
The UN diplomat said that the existence of an agreement with Russia and Turkey could open a political debate on establishing an area in the Idlib defence camps.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey has prevented Syria (the Russia-supported army) from attacking the area of three million inhabitants.
Moualem confirmed, however, that the agreement's endurance was limited and said that Jihadists hope to join the private army, to be "completely empty", including Al-Qaeda attackers related to Nusra-Front.
U.S. diplomat Staffan de Mistura said it is hoped that the first meeting of the new government committee and the opposition will be held soon to lay down laws for Syria to deal with the consequences of the war and lead to the elections.
Moualem laid down measures on the involvement of the Syrian government in the committee, including the need to carry out the trial "to re-examine the texts of the current law" and the warning on the prosecution of foreign affairs.
How to make sure that Trump wins again
According to the logic, Trump will still win the 2020 election if it is not possible to get rid of the waste or damage and leave the government as it is sure to be expected by the liberals.
And there is no doubt that this may be "the end of the reign to have the most history ever!"
If you're ever lost and alone in the woods, hug a tree
Since 2014, CNN television has increased by more than 1.05 million viewers and MSNBC has already risen to nearly 1.6 million.
For Fox News is 2.4 million viewers per cent, compared with 1.7 million over the last four years. According to Nielsen and MSNBC, "The Rachel Maddow Show" is the most prominent and most successful event because it has been viewed by some 3.5 million new followers at night.
"It's like a burning fire because we don't know anything," says Neal Baer, a reporter of ABC's continuing story "Designed Survivor", about a writer in a office who became president after the government collapsed.
Nell Scovell, an event writer and humorist and wrote "Just the Funny Parties: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys" Club, however, had another view.
He remembered the trip in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told him to choose Mr. Trump.
But why? He asks.
"The answer is, "She's so close to me," says Ms. Scovell's story.
In fact, bickering can cause us to lose our temper.
Of course, unlike all TV shows, the story from Washington describes the future of Roe v. Wade, the ability of immigrant families to meet again or the general health of the economy.
The TV program is very respectable, only the owner can get it.
However, more than knowing how to be a citizen of the news, you are following the six-hour discussions by Bob Woodwards based on the "deep research" he needed in his book "Fear," Paul Manfort's $15,000 Austrosian Red Dresser ("showing Pride", according to Washington Post) and a growing physical description of Stormy Daniel about Mr. Trump.
If I were myself, I would never think that Super Mario would be the same.
"One of the things he feels like he's doing now is seeing something you've got every day," said Brent Montgomery, director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and created the "Pown Stars," about the back-up of Trump's play and its daily hidden network (a fight against N.F.L., opened by Kim Jong-un).
You will not be able to avoid even an episode if it is not completely lost.
I saw Atoa Fleiss this week, at about 80 degrees outside her home north of Kauai lake, that she still looks at MSNBC and hears CNN.
He was never alone, especially when he saw Brett Kavcanough directly link the Senate Judges Committee and the future of the Supreme Court.
"I remember that we returned these stupid shows today and people said, "This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization," Atoa Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was like a joke, but it turned into a joke, their words were true."
Amy Chozick, one of the writers in The Times who wrote a lot about business, politics and media, wrote the story entitled "Chasing Hillary."
There was a lot of money from abroad focused on the popular election in the front of the president's work year
It is no wonder that there has been a large increase in the 17th district of Pennsylvania due to cooperation between the districts' congresses and that it has allowed two different competitors to fight one place.
This remote Pittsburgh rural district has moved Conor Lamb from the Democratic Republic to take place in other districts during the recent special election.
Lamb now competes with other authorities, not one but the Republican Keith Rothfus, who represents the 12th districts of the former Pennsylvania that are strongly competing in the new 17th district.
The map was rewritten after the ruling of the Supreme Court in Pennsylvania in January that the former districts were illegally distributed to benefit the Republic.
The competition to get the seventeenth district has resulted in a financial dispute between the money lenders and the DCCC Committee on Democracy (DCCC), and the National Committee on the Promotion (NCRC).
People in Pennsylvania became known as Lamb after all they could see at the special election of the 18th District Congress in Pennsylvania in March.
The Republicans have been holding this place for many years and President Donald Trump has received the district in number 20.
Democrats have given little advantage to politicians.
An expert from the U.S. Department of Justice gave El Salvador a severe punishment for his support of China, and then withdrew.
Many diplomats feel that Beijing has already been accepted by the Dominican Republic and Panama, adding a little hint from Washington.
Atoa Trump's meeting with Panama's president Juan Carlos Varela was successful in June 2017, and he had a hotel in Panama until the security forces of Trump's organization's board of directors.
According to a report gathered at the beginning of this month, representatives from the Department of State decided to call back on the US diplomatic mission from El Slvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama to consider "the decision to no longer agree with Taiwan" and Heather Nauertn and women to represent the department.
But El Salvador was the only one who received $140 million in US aid in 2017, including surveillance of drug use, development and financial assistance.
The penalties considered to be applicable, including the abolition of fees and the abolition of legal visas, will be very difficult for Central America to support the level of unemployment and mass murder.
According to the opening of its meeting, the major conference on peace and economic development has been launched by North and Central American authorities to allow for such a meeting as last year that it has become a major step towards preventing immigrants from going to the United States.
But at the end of September, the authorities showed that they wanted to attend the conference, in order to end all the sanctions that should be applied to El Salvador.
The Vice-President Mike Pence was appointed to attend the conference, which should be held on the part of October, when the manager held the meeting to highlight what was really important.
And the three American representatives returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic several times, giving a bitter message about the punishments of Washington.
Atoa Bolton, director of "Maison Blanche", discussed his details about the debate presented by three US authorities, two diplomats, and agreed to consider its internal decisions and the measures of namelessness.
A foreign analyst, all right in management and part of the discussion on the measures of namelessness, supported their story.
Learning History
The next possible objection is the report of Specialist Robert Mueller on Mr. Trump's threat to the court, which has clear evidence that the public has been exposed.
Atoa Mueller also returned to his polls about how much of Atoa Trump's condolences were in line with Russia's election.
Whether Congress should change its management, Atoa Trump must face its responsibility, just as he had prepared the public elections before, and perhaps his friends' judges.
If so, this does not mean that Atoa Trump's collapse is inevitable or that it is similar in Europe.
There are several options for each of us to make from both sides of the Atlantic and will have consequences for how much trouble can be endured.
In 1938, German officials were ready to attack Hitler, if the West agreed to oppose him and supported the Munich Sekoslovak.
We have failed, and have been unable to prevent people's deaths for years.
History is constantly surrounded by ideas that are destructive, and rapid or detrimental to democracy.
Americans are now living in conflicting and contradictory ideas.
What can we do if Atoa Trump doubles General Deputies Rod Rosenstein, monitors the Mueller Survey?
Roesenstein's location has been devastating since this report last year that he suggested that the president should record what he was doing and support the lack of respect for the place.
Atoa Rosenstein said the story of The Times was wrong.
"How can we answer if the F.B.A.'s new investigation of Brett Kavanaugh - or if the Supreme Court appears to be exaggerating despite a clear charge of sexual violence and false testimony?
But above all, will we choose Congress that can hold Atoa Trump as responsible when it comes to his work?
If we fail these efforts, democracy will remain in existence for a long time.
But I believe that we will succeed because of the lesson I learned in Prague.

Graham Dorrans of Rangers fully prepared to meet Rapid Vienna
The Rangers took Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that if they win the Austrians, after a war like in Spain with Villareal at the beginning of this month, they will benefit from the G class of the European Union.
Graham Dorrans couldn't get up because of his head injury after a game like 2-2 with Villareal but he believed that Rangers could use it better to start things.
"It's good for us because the 31-year-old man is a good place in Villareal.
"We entered the game and were confident that the results would be obtained came out with a number.
Maybe we can finally get it, but, anyway, the war is just like justice.
They were released in the first half of the first and we will also do better in the second half of the second.
It's coming to Thursday, another night for Europe.
It is very hoped that we will get three but the game will be boring because the results they get in the final game are good, although with the people who support us, I believe that we will continue to make progress and get good results.
It's very sad last year, before the damage I've suffered and the change in the club, but there's just got better.
The squad was good and the kids were happy to play it; the training was really successful.
We can continue to make progress, and full of hope, let the past rob us of success."
Women looking for ways to deal with their drinking day and night are not honest.
Although the survey found that members already have clear ideas on how to care for them, few people talked about it with their families.
Half of those surveyed said she had talked to her husband about the cost of sustained treatment.
Only 10% said she talked to her children about it.
"People like to take care of her family, but they try to talk about it," said Holly Snyder, vice president of life.
That's what we're gonna do.
Talk to your parents. You can’t be prepared to take care of your family if you’re sick if you don’t talk about it too much.
Work with counselors and your family, and discuss how to care for your health.
Include your consultant in the financial perspective: Your consultant can also teach you how to pay that money.
These may include money to care for your long-term health: a long-term health insurance, a life insurance that may provide it, or a special health insurance.
To emphasize the legal letter you will use: The same is true of the war on your trial.
Read about people who will take your place in health matters, so that someone you trust will be responsible for monitoring your choice of health workers if you are unable to talk.
Also, look for lawyers to take care of your month.
You will choose a trusted person to make your own decision about money, so you will be sure that your factors are first, if you become a peacemaker.
Do not forget its details: Think your parents are too old, and they need urgent treatment at the hospital.
Would you like to answer questions about their medicine or what they don't care about?
Write these items down in detail so you can be prepared.

A man who was shot several times by a plane in Ilfracombe.
A man was shot several times by a train, while he walked back and forth by night.
From Oxford Grove, Ilfracombe, Devon, the man, about 40 years old, was shot in his arms, arms and arms.
The police say the incident took place at 2.30 p.m. in England, and the man was "not specifically assigned" to the shooting.
The gunman didn't see the man who shot him.
He was mild - tempered, but his life was spared, and the police summoned him to testify.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people died of the worst earthquake and tsunami in Palu, Indonesia, on Friday, according to the authorities, this number may continue to increase.
The connection was completely broken, so the authorities didn't know the news from Dogharaa, north of Palu. This is a place near the center of the earthquake that reached 7.5 on the highway.
More than 16,000 people were taken away from Palu after the accident.
Here is what has been said about Palu and Doghara, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi, at the end of the hills on the Sulawesi River. The population is estimated to be 379,800 in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th year, when the earthquake and tsunami appeared.
Dodhaa is a commune up to 300 km north of the island of Sulawesi.
The municipality is smaller than its territory, and the population of Doghara is estimated to be 299,200 in 2017.
Swimming, farming and farming are the main livelihoods of the Central Sulawesi region, especially the river Dogharaa.
There are also many farmers there, but in Morowali, on the Sulawesi coast.
In the last 100 years, Palu and Doghaa have been hit by earthquakes, according to Indonesia's Disaster Management Office.
A tsunami struck Dogharaa in 1938, killed more than 200 people, and destroyed hundreds of homes.
There were also tsunamis that hit Dogharaa in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia has a huge earthquake in the Pacific, so it is often hit by an earthquake.
This is part of the recent major earthquake and tsunami:
2004: A major earthquake struck Aceh, northern Sumatra, on the west coast of Indonesia, on December 26, which caused a tsunami that reached 14 and killed 226,000 Indians who created the Indian Ocean. More than half of the dead were in Aceh.
2005: In late March and early April, there were a number of major earthquakes that swept the western coast of Sumatra.

The Last Child of Sarah Palin was arrested for domestic violence
Track Palin, sister-in-law of Sarah Palin, former government of Alaska, and candidate as vice president, was arrested for violence.
Palin, 29 years old, from Vasilla, Alaska, was suspected of being violent at home because someone told the police that he was violent. He also opposed his arrest, according to a report by the Alaska Police.
Police say a woman from Palin's family called the police to report the crime, and Palin put the phone in her mouth.
Palin was held in Mat-Su prison and was charged with paying 500 dollars, says KTUU.
He came to the court on Saturday, and said he was "certainly not guilty," according to news source.
Palin's three simple crimes are committed by Class A, which means he can be imprisoned for a year and pay $250,000 if he is convicted.
He was also sentenced to one day in prison for a simple crime in Class B, where he was sentenced to $2,000 if he was convicted.
This is not the first crime to be prosecuted by Palin.
He was accused of violence against Todd Palin, his father, also in December 2017.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report.
The Supreme Court of Alaska is now considering this case.
He was charged with domestic violence in January 2016, according to a joint report, with weapons and killings.
The woman with whom she accompanied her said she missed the key on her face.
In 2016 the paramilitary attacked Sarah Palin because they said this violent attitude was related to the military situation in Iraq.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia: Hundreds of deaths
At least 384 people were killed by the earthquake that struck Sulawesi, an island in Indonesia on Friday.
The 7.5 earthquake caused tsunamis, destroying thousands of homes.
The iron and the phone are broken, and the number of deaths may still increase.
The earthquake hit the center of Sulawesi, which is in the northeastern part of Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia.
There are videos on various websites, showing the earthquake.
Hundreds of people saved a seabed festival during the tsunamis of Palu.
Federal law prosecutors are looking for the death penalty for the alleged terrorist activity in New York.
The federal prosecutor of New York wanted Sayfuly Saipov to die, accused of terrorist activity in New York, and killed eight people.
Saipov, 30 years old, reportedly used a truck to attack people on the road on bicycles, on the West Road, in Manhattan Down. He hit many pedestrians and bicycle leaders in October.
Lawyers must prove why they have appealed for the death penalty, that Saipov "a spirit of faith" killed eight dead people, and "a spirit of faith" wounded people, according to a statement requesting the death penalty, placed in South New York District.
Both charges may lead to death, according to the court's letter.
The deputy judge accused Saipov of 22 cases, a few weeks after the attack, including eight charges of killing people by violence (crimes used by criminal prosecutors), violence and car damage.
The attack called for "good preparation and thought before", said the lawyer, and they explained how Saipov had done the attack "absolutely hated, cruel and very bad."
"Sayful Habibullaevic Saipov has done what to hurt, hurt, and threaten Diego Enrique Angelini's family and friends, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnucci," according to the statement.
Five of the dead are visitors from Argentina.
New York's Southern Court has been conducting the final case of the death penalty for more than ten years.
Khalid Barnes was then accused of killing two drug dealers, but he was finally sentenced to prison until his death in September 2009.
Juluis and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple, were already sentenced to death in New York in 1953 when they were accused of being a spy of the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
He and his wife were both killed in a power station on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, from Uzbekistan, has never shown any restraint after days and months after the attack, according to a court report.
He told the police that he was happy about what he did.
Saipov told the authorities that he was motivated to take the attack, after watching ISIS video on his phone, according to the letter of condemnation.
She also asked for ISIS to be held in her room at the hospital.
He said he was innocent of the 22 charges against him.
David Patton, one of Saipov's lawyers, said they were "mistrustful", in the decision of lawmakers.
Patton also said: "The case will be more prolonged and it will be more disturbing for everyone involved, since the lawyers have decided to seek an apology for death, not only because the person confessed his sin, but also because he was sentenced to death and could not be rescued.
Saipov's lawyers have asked lawyers not to apologize for their death.
NIGEL FARGE says the European Union's suspension should not be considered to lead to the European Union's exit agreement
Nigel Farage said in opposition to the European Union's stand-alone debate that he must today 'call the people'.
This former Ukip leader says that politicians should ‘feel great’ from those who don’t want to join the European group, one of those who are from Theresa May say he should lead the discussion on the European Union.
Traditionalist Peter Bone said the English demand for Birmingham would no longer exist if Farage was the author of the European Union's release.
But it is a major problem for DRtoa May to bring peace to its people, as some of them have joined opposition to the liberation of other European groups.
The Prime Minister is struggling hard to be balanced, as all who want to leave the European Union and those who want to stay there, and even the European Union, are pushing them away.
Her colleagues say she should always make arrangements with Brussels, even though she has already been arrested, so those who do not like the European group and the labour force will have to choose whether to accept their views or to find 'harmonizing'.
Atoa Bone told Miala when Miala, during the Solihull event, that she wanted to 'love the prime minister'.
He said he should have friends Toa Farage, and he would be asked to run the agreement with Brussels.
He said: 'We will be out of the European Union now, if I were to take charge of it.'
Wellingborough's spokesman also said: 'I will support the release of the European Union, but we should keep the refugees small.'
He said, against the European Union: 'We have never been born in the great wars.
We want only if we put the law in place for our country.
Today Bone has rejected the idea that people may have changed their mind after the 2016 election. 'It is not true that the British people have changed their mind, so they want to stay in the European Union.
In the same attack, Andrea Jenkyns, the European Union's stopover, said: 'I'm just saying: Listen to the people, Prime Minister.
'Most people don't like those who don't want to change, they don't choose the opponents, they don't like our party and our protesters, they go to the street, and they choose us first.
Don't follow those who don't want to change, but be late."
The message he said to dRtoa May: 'The prime minister is kept in his job when he keeps his word.'
Atoa Farage told politicians who protested that they should "feel the heat" if they want to reverse the decision in the 2016 referendum.
'This is a list of us—people—and politicians,' he said.
'They want to translate the issue into the European Union, but we're here to tell them 'we won't let you do it.'
He told the enthusiastic people: 'I want politicians to translate the issue into the European Union if you do 'feel the heat'.
"We call a lot of people here, because they have made us decide to leave the European Union. We will never stop unless we become a self-sufficient country, have a private leader, and are proud of Great Britain."
On the other hand, the European Union's arrest warrants visited Birmingham, before two hours of action in the middle of the city.
The protesters took flags, saying they wanted to stay in the European Union.
Atua Adonis, in the Workers' Party, has been accused of the consequences of the problem of security at the party's computer program, at the beginning of the discussion.
He said: 'These are the people who tell us that they can set up information programmes and technologies for Canada, and for the border war, and for Ireland's unlimited business.'
'This is really bad.
There is no way that it will benefit the European Union," he said.
Warren thinks he's going to be a "good student" of the candidate as a president
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says he "will carefully consider the entry into office as president," after the November elections.
The Boston Globe reports that Massachusetts Democrats spoke about the future, during their discussion at the city hall.
Warren, who is often criticised by President Donald Trump in November, will come in to compete with the Republic of Geoff Diehl, who was part of Trump's campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
Many have already thought he could compete with Trump in 2020.
The event on Saturday evening in Holyoke was its 36th meeting, using the city's main electoral method, following the adoption of Trump's authority.
One of those present asked him if he was trying to become a president.
Warren replied that this is the time "for women to go to Washington to fix the wrongs of our government, so there should be women in the head of the government."
Someone was arrested for shooting dead in Sims, LSU player
Police in Baton Rouge, Los Angeles, said on Saturday the suspect was arrested for shooting and killed Wade Sims, a LSU basketball player on Friday.
Baton Rouge Police report that Dayteon Simpson, 20, was arrested 11 hours a day.
They released a video of the shooting on Friday, and they called people to tell them who the man was on it.
Sims, 20 years old, died next to South University on Friday morning.
"Wyde Sims was hit on his head by the shooting, and it killed him," said Murphy Paul, the chief of police, to reporters, every 247 sports, on Saturday.
Wade protected his friend, so Simpson shot him.
Simpson was investigated, admitted to being there, had a gun, and admitted to shooting Wade Sims.
Simpson was arrested several times, and was detained in Baton Rouge Police.
Sims grew up in Baton Rouge, aged 1,83m, and participated in 32 games, and was one of the first 10 players in this game. He played 17.4 minutes on his feet, died 5.6, and played 2.9 rebond every time he played.
The Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton became the world's hero when the judge said he won Sebastian Vettel.
This was made clear when Valtteri Bottas got to play before Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, so Mercedes's team decided to take a lot of part in the race.
Bottas was very fast, and after Hamilton kept his seat protected during the first two trips, and invited Vettel to gather his friend.
Vettel was the first to stay in construction, and allowed Hamilton to leave, but it changed a lot.
Some of them came from the construction of Mercedes, and later after Vettel. However, Hamilton became the first to follow each other’s words. The Ferrari driver doubted the word, so he let himself out of the way, so that he could no longer protect his position on his third track.
Max Verstappen is from the end, and the seventh at the end of his first trip, at the age of 21.
But then he led most of the race, and kept it until the end, and gathered Kimi Raikkonen, who became four.
He went to construction on the 44th trip, but could not increase his speed during the last eight trips, so Raikkonen went on the fourth.
It was difficult because Valtteri fought hard at the end of this week, and she left me there, as the man said.
The team did a lot of good," Hamilton said.
It Was an Unfailing Move
President Donald Trump, during the protest on Saturday, insulted Senator Dianne Feinstein, because Feinstein confirmed that he did not issue a secret letter from Christine Blasey Ford, accusing Brett Kavanaugh, who may have been appointed high judge, of committing sexual crimes.
The president spoke during the event in West Virginia, but not directly about Ford's words in front of the Committee of Judges, but he said that some were "bad and lying" when he looked at what happened in the House of Commons.
"It's a beautiful and beautiful event in the House of Lords, when you see anger, when you see people angry, wicked and lying," she says.
"When you see what he's published and what he's secreted, but he usually says, "I didn't do it.
I didn't do that."
Do You Recall?
Did you publish a secret about Diane Feinstein?
Remember his answer... did you publish these letters? "Oh, how?"
Not at all.
I didn't do that."
How so?
Did we issue a secret... ah, we didn't do that," he said, about the senator.
Feinstein received a letter in July, explained ford's complaint to Kavanaugh, and published it in September, but Feinstein said that his office did not issue the secret.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's words, and I didn't publish his story," Feinstein told the committee, according to The Hill newspaper.
"He asked me to keep it secret, which I always did."
The president said that the ban was not fair, however, in his talk on Saturday night. "It was a really bad move.
He probably didn't do it, but that was the most negative reaction I've ever seen."
The president protects the person who may still be appointed as a high judge, even though three women accuse him of committing sexual crimes against them, the president said these charges are made by the Democrats.
"They are willing to support their ideas in all ways.
You see the spirit of mind, no matter what they have been hurt or killed to gain power and control," said the Mediaite president.
Ligy Head: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer, Giant's team, was killed twice against Dundee
Dundee's team defended his honour when the Belfast Giants won 5-3 games back to Dundee this Saturday.
The Giants first died by means of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie, who died third, led the Giants again.
Francois Bouchard renegotiated for Dundee, and Lukas Lundvald Nielsen died of both who led the victory.
Three of Adam Keefe's team won this elite League, but they won Dundee 2-1 on Friday night in Belfast.
That's why these teams fought this game, so the Giants won the first three games.
Dwyer died of a gun from Kendall McFaull at 3.35, while David Rutherford helped Beauvillier to drive them four minutes later.
Many balls were killed at the beginning, and Sullivan returned home to the game in 13.10 minutes, before Matt Marquardt met him for Crownie, at 15.16 minutes.
Dwyer did what would make the Giants lead to the first season, since he killed the second ball at the end of the first season of the night.
But the householder replied again, and Bouchard raised their number at 27.37 minutes.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran worked together to make Nielsen die, so that Dundee would be the first to go to the game, during the second season, doing what his team would win with five numbers, which was the final number.
The Giants are losing their five games, so on their land they will play next Friday, with Milton Keynes.
The Road Leader Is Dead to Help Hundreds of People Live in a Good Environment
It was praised that the train driver in Indonesia was brave because he had done something to help an air carrier who brought hundreds of people to a fair settlement.
More than 800 people died, and many are still missing, after the great earthquake on the island of Sulawesi on Friday, which caused tsunamis.
The earthquake continues in many places, and many are still plagued by earthquakes in Palu.
21-year-old Anthony Gunawan Agung escaped to save his life, but he did not leave his career at Mutira Sis Al Jufri Square in Palu, although he was severely depressed.
He stayed there to help the Batik Air Flight 6321 driver, who will be seated there, so the plane was well-beneficiary.
He then jumped out of his office when he thought it would break down.
He died in the hospital.
Johannes Sirait, head of Air Navigation Indonesia, says that this decision has saved hundreds of lives, according to ABC News Australia.
We have prepared helicopters from Balikipan, Kalimantan, to take him to the largest hospital in another city.
Sadly, though, that morning the helicopter had not yet arrived in Palu.
"We can hear it from our heart," he said.
However, authorities are also afraid that thousands of deaths may still be lost, as the way for survivors lost access to Doghara, Siggi and Butong is blocked.
"This number continues to grow, as many deaths are still under the debris there, but many are still missing," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a victim's spokesman, said.
There was an earthquake that destroyed Palu six meters, and many had to move together on Sunday.
The military and civilian aircraft now report assistance and equipment.
Risa Kusumuma, a 35-year-old mother, in Sky News, says: "There are always a car carrying a disease every minute, reporting death.
It is known as clean water.
The collapse of the labor market has affected the rest of the world.
Jan Gelfand, president of the International Croix Rouge in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Croix Rouge is running to help the living but we don't know what they'll see there.
It's too dangerous that it might get worse."
Indonesian President Joko Widododo came to Palu on Saturday and told the country's military: "I ask all of you to work for a day and a night for all work related to the release of people from danger.
Are you ready?" CNN reports say.
At the beginning of this year, Indonesia was struck by an earthquake that took place in Lombok, which killed 550 people.
From Micronesia's flight view: Air Niugini says there's a man who's not seen because of the crash of the plane to Rikasia (a ship related to the sea)
The airport operating on the railway that occurred on the Pacific coast of Micronesia at the time says there is a man who is not seen by the public, after saying that all 47 passengers and workers are out on the landline.
The Niugini airport said in its news that since Saturday afternoon he could not explain a man's life.
The airport said she worked with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the man.
The airport didn't come up with questions about the passenger section; it's like its age or its country of origin.
Local ships helped rescue other passengers and crews when the plane was approaching water if it was trying to sit on the Chuuk Island airport.
The authorities said on Friday there were seven people sent to a hospital.
The road said that six passengers were still in the hospital on Saturday and all their health was no longer concerned.
It is still unclear what caused the earthquake and what really happened.
The U.S. Navy and the U.S. Navy said they went into the race after they didn't get the piste.
Some of the witnesses thought that the plane was overpiste.
American traveler Bill Jaynes said the airport's entry was very low.
"That's a good thing," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said he and the others were able to walk into the water to rescue the exit if there was a danger of the plane crash.
He said he was scared and hit the gates, and he suffered a little head injury.
The U.S. Navy said that ships working near improving the ship's crew helped rescue through the use of boats to transport people to land, before the plane landed 30 feet (100 feet) below water.
The instructions from the Aviation Safety Network indicate that 111 people died in a plane crash on the road recorded in PNG over 20 years without including Air Niugini.
The experts show a night time when women are still alive
The publisher was able to prove all the evidence on Saturday in the second trial of the man who was accused of killing a woman from Mississippi in 2014.
An expert from the U.S. Department of Justice. Paul Rowlett has been witnessing for many hours as an expert witness in the field of investigation.
She explained to the jury how she used the prison term to declare the actions of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night she died.
Rowlett said that he received information about the location of many phones showing that Tellis was with Chambers on the night of his death, thus contradicting his previous statement, says The Clarion Ledger.
When he showed that his phone was with Chambers during the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to Sanford to talk to him.
Sanford stood in court on Saturday and proved that he was not in the village this day.
When the publisher asked if Tellis was right about that night in Sanford's truck, I said he lied, because my truck said he was in Nashville."
Tellis also said that he knew Chambers at the time he died about two weeks ago.
The cell phones are saying they met each other every week.
Rowlet said that it was time after Chambers died that Tellis decided to leave his cell phone to write letters and call and about Chambers.
"He was willing to leave his life," Hale said.
Saturday's defenders have got time to start the final support.
The judge said the war was expected to take place in the jury later that day.
The High Broad: What is a sensitive hip hop?
There is a three-song singer who makes a hip hop to watch the different way of thinking about this type, by filling their music with the good news.
The High Breed from Bristol says the hip hop has left its way of political message and talks about social problems.
They want to go back to their homes and restore the conscious hip hop to people's taste.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have seen a resurgence in ROYAUME-UNIS through such artists as Akala and Lowkey.
Are there other people in need?!
A carer from NEW YORK preached to a couple who left behind after writing "sees racial discrimination"
A child carer from New York is witnessing to a couple because of a full-fledged divorce when she received a wrong letter from the mother who complains she's "another black person."
The couple refuse to be discriminated against and the preaching is the same as the beating."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, who had two births, expressed disappointment at seeing that the new organizer named Giselle Maurice was black, on his first day in 2016.
"There's no way you can make it," wrote the post sent by Plasco-Flaxman to her husband.
Either way, if she should have sent it to her husband, she sent it to Maurice's TV twice.
When the "non-lifeless" Plasco-Flaxman felt his mistake, Maurice released a little dramatized, saying that the former child organizer who was African-American was unable to perform his work and he attracted the Philippines, according to New York Post.
Maurice's car took over one day of work and was sent back to it.
Maurice is now preaching to the couple to pay for her release and is expecting about 350 dollars a day during the week, the first job she was forced to do, even though there was no agreement.
"I want to show them that you don't do such things," he said to the Post on Friday, adding, "I know it's racial discrimination."
The couple responded to the claim that they were racist and said that the end of Maurice’s work was what they had been forced to do, as they were afraid they would not trust her after she was ill.
"My husband sent him something he didn't want to talk to."
He's not a racist.
We're not a racist person named Joel Plasco in Post.
"But will you place your children in the hands of people you don't respect, even if it's not a spirit of faith?
Your newborn child?
No."
Plasco, who compares the preaching with "fashioned", said that her husband had only two months to have children and in "hard place".
"Will you look for someone like that?
It's not very nice to do this," said the money-laundering bank worker.
While the case is still under way, the public court has been quick to criticize spouses on social networks, beating them because of their behavior and logic.
The authors of the Paddington book were concerned about the misunderstanding of the speakers, according to the new text
Bond’s daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said about the text: “It’s hard to sit in a person’s place when you first read it before publishing it.
It is very encouraging to know what we know now about Paddington's great success."
He says that his father, who worked as a BBC photographer before he was inspired to write the book for children by means of a playful little bag, may be shocked by his refusal, the 60th year of publishing the books was "a funeral" after his death last year, he added his words.
About Paddington, whose territory is "the most important part of the family," he added that his father was proud of his final success.
"He's a simple man who doesn't speak, and he's not a self-defense," she says.
"But because Paddington is real, it's like you have a child who can do things: you're proud of them even though you didn't do it.
I think that's how he saw Paddington's success.
Even though it's something he created and thought, Paddington has always mentioned it."
My daughter was gone and I had to live on the phone
On arrival his daughter was rushed to Nice Louis Pasteur 2 hospital, but the doctor did not just work to save her life.
"Nad always called out that it was really bad to go there, said he didn't expect it to happen," says Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then I received a call from Nad that he would die within two minutes and I had to live with him.
So I did.
I said to him, "Tashi, I really like you, sobini.
I will soon be with you.
I will be with you.
The medications that her doctor gave her to keep her going stopped her body and gave her a chance to leave her body.
It was before he died that way that everything ended.
I had to sit there and wait, and I knew it all worked out.
I didn't complain or cry because in a situation where there were many families and people.
I must have kept it all."
At the end of Ednan-Laperouse, when she was saddened by the loss of her daughter, the plane went up with other passengers — forgetting the difficult war she had experienced.
"No one knows."
"My head was raised and my eyes filled with tears all the time.
It's hard to explain that during the ride I've experienced this feeling of relief from Nad that touched me.
He needed my love and ability to live where he lived.
I know he really loves her."
A grieving woman prints a letter to prevent suicide on the street
Two women who lost their loved ones in death work to prevent others from killing themselves.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys sent letters to Welsh's website with encouraging messages and phone numbers that people can call for help.
The 13-year-old son of Davis, named Tyler, suffered from weakness and committed suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't want parents who don't want anyone to feel what I feel every day," she says.
Ramatoa Davis, 45 years old, who lives in Lydney, said his son was a full-fledged farmer who moved with a smile to speak to him.
"He knows everyone on his side."
They kept saying that his smile had been explained to all the rooms."
However, he resigned from his job before he died because he was in "a very dark place."
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, then 11 years old, was the only one who saw his brother after he committed suicide.
"I'm worried it'll affect me."
Davis has created the letters, "to let people know that there are people you can go and talk to even friends.
Don't sit in the dark – you need to talk."
Ramatoa Humphreys, who has been a friend of Davis for many years, lost Mark, his wife for 15 years, shortly after her mother's death.
"He didn't say he felt tired or tired or something," he said.
"We saw a change in her behaviour two days before Christmas.
She was very excited about Christmas days – she didn’t look at anyone, anything, when she opened up her gift to the children.”
He said their death was a serious injury to them but they had to do what they could to get out of it: "It has caused a gap in the neighborhood.
This set us apart.
But we must continue our lives and fight."
If you are struggling hard to get out of it, you can call Samaritans 116 123 (ANGLETERA and Ireland), e-mail jo@samaritans.org, or visit the Samaritan website.
Brett Kavanaugh's future is at stake because the FBI is beginning to investigate
"I thought that if we could get something like what we asked for -- a temporary, fixed settlement -- we might be able to bring unity together," Flake said on Saturday, he continued his statement that he was concerned about "the arrival" of a committee on the streets where there was no direction for supporters.
Why are Goddess Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not pleased with the FBI's investigation?
Their lack of motivation is a matter of time.
The current election is only five weeks left on November 6 - if the Republicans are not released, they will be ashamed of their efforts to get the man they want to be elected to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush received a phone to call the Senator, encouraging them to support the God of Kavanaugh who worked in the House for the God of Bush and saw his wife Ashley, the special secretary of the God of Bush.
What will happen after the FBI issues its tape?
There will be elections in the House of Commons with 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats at present.
It is still unclear whether at least 50 votes can be obtained in the Kavanaugh National Assembly Hall, which may allow the Vice-President Mike Pence to compete with him and put himself in the Supreme Court.
In North Korea, the number of protesters joined Kim was down below Kim.
The number of North Koreans who have moved to South Korea has increased since Kim Jong-un arrived in the last seven years of the regime, says one South Korean lawyer.
Park Byeong-seug, which quoted information from the Ministry of National Affairs of the South, said there was a shift to 1127 opposition a year - compared with 2706 in 2011.
Goddess Park said that the stronger surveillance of the border between North Korea and China and the higher proportions taken by the coal miners were the main reason why this was done.
Pyongyang has not made a public comment.
Most of the immigrants from the north were finally granted South Korean citizenship.
Seoul said that since the end of the Korean War in 1953, over 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed their borders.
Most of them are fleeing from China, which has the longest border between North Korea and is easier to cross than the DMZ zone between two Koreas.
China considers immigrants to be illegal migrants rather than refugees and often throw them away.
It has been noted that North and South relations have improved – still fighting in technical terms – over the past few months.
At the beginning of this month, the leaders of both countries met in Pyongyang to discuss a ban agreement on the termination of armed arms production.
This was after a historic meeting in June with US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they agreed with their general agreement to work towards a nuclear-free Korean economy.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed US sanctions for the lack of progress so far.
"If there is no trust in the United States, our country's peace will not be secure and in that case we have no intention of withdrawing our first weapon," said God Ri in his speech at the New York FRENCH Conference.
Nancy Pelosi says Brett Kavanaugh is "the example of a little fool," he says he can't work in the Supreme Court.
Deputy Chief of Parliament, Nancy Pelosi, called the "little girl", the voter of Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh, said he could not work in the Supreme Court if his condition was observed.
Pelosi made this comment during a Saturday meeting at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I can't imagine if a woman did so, they said "the example of the little fool," Pelosi said of his reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate's Justice Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh deliberately rejected the allegations that he had been sexually abused by Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were younger.
During his first speech, Kavanaugh was very excited, sometimes he was almost nervous and excited during discussions about his family and his studies at the third grade.
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats on the committee, calling them "a chance of killing people" that the Liberals were angry about Hillary Clinton's failure to vote as president in 2016.
Pelosi stated that he believed that he believed that Kavanaugh could not work in the Supreme Court, as this showed that he was fighting against democracy.
He said: "I think he did what he would not know about these statements, as well as how he punished Clinton's and the Democrats."
Pelosi questioned whether Kavanaugh's integrity was concerned if he was missing, and whether Democrats were getting more in the National Parliament.
"That's what I'm saying - if he doesn't tell Congress or the FBI the truth, he can't be in the Supreme Court only but he can't even stand in this trial right now," Pelosi says.
Kavanaugh is a D.C. judge at the time of the Court d'Appel Federale.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat he was concerned about Kavanaugh's decision against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade, because he was considered a judge of traditional law.
Listening to him to strengthen the situation, Kavanaugh rejected questions about the possibility of examining some of the Supreme Court's decisions.
"It's not time for stupid people to go to court and fight for justice and hope us to say, "is it not nice," Pelosi says.
And women need to use it.
This was a real cry, filled with anger for months and years, and we couldn’t bring her up without crying.
"We cry when we are angry," Steinem said to me 45 years later.
"I don't think that's unusual to me, and you?"
He continued: "A woman who said that she also cried when she was upset, but she devised a project that meant that when she was angry and started to cry, she said to the people she was saying: "You might think I'm sorry for crying.
I'm angry."
He kept walking
And I thought it was really nice."
The eyes can be triggered as a part of an outburst of anger, since people cannot control their roots.
One of the most memorable things I've ever had when I started working, at a man's office, where I was once hard on the result of an unexplained anger, to take my older wife to my arms — a always-warming bad manager — to the point.
"Don't let me see you crying," she said to me
"He doesn't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and happy because they're reaching their goal."
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic representative of the Colorado Congress, worked with Gary Hart on his accession as president.
In 1987, when she met a couple outside the ship called Monkey Business God Hart, Ramatoa Schroeder, when she was in great distress, she had no reason not to consider taking her place as president.
"It's not a well-adjusted decision," she laughed to me 30 years later.
"There are already seven voters to vote in the competition, and the last thing he needs is another candidate.
Someone called it "Blanche Neige and the Seven Men."
Because he's already on the campaign, he's stuck with the money collection, so he swears he won't get into the competition unless he's raised $2 million.
It was a war that had not been successful.
He found that some of his supporters who gave him $1,000 for men only gave him $250.
"Do they think I have a key?" he asked himself.
When he gave the speech that he would not make official propaganda, he was truly touched by the emotion - the gratitude of the people who supported him, the rejection of the system that made the collection and appointment of voters more difficult than the representative, and the anger of discrimination against men or women - he was indeed.
"You may have thought I was completely disappointed," said Rtoa Schroeder, who was reminded of his journalist's reaction.
"You may have thought Kleenex was my support company
Do I remember what they'll do on my desk?
"He cried?"
How the economic conflict in America and China can benefit Beijing
The release of arms in the US and China's trade war has been a challenge, and if the war is not over, Beijing may benefit from the long-term segregation of the countries, according to experts.
Donald Trump, who was president of the United States, sent first warnings at the beginning of this year through the tribute of China's huge Chinese movement, including the solar, wind and aluminium windows.
The most rapid adjustment this week with a new size of $200 billion (150 billion), is due to half of all goods from China entering the United States.
Beijing has responded to death every time, and here it has placed five to ten percent of US dollars.
China promised to connect US shoot-outs, and the world's second largest economy could not be expected soon.
Washington's humiliation means a humiliation before the demands, but America's surrender to Xi Jinping's president of China's.
However, experts have said that if Beijing's play is possible, China can support its economic pressures in a long-term way, by reducing the dependence on the two economies.
"The ability of a political decision in Washington or Beijing to bring about situations that start economic confrontations in one of these countries is even more dangerous than that of the authorities if it is true," says Abigail Grace, a researcher who focuses on Asia at the Center for New American Security, a group of researchers.
Syria's "ready" to restore refugees, the Foreign Ministry says
Syria says it is ready to return to refugee voluntarily and calls for help to rebuild the country that has been devastated for seven years.
When the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Walid al-Mouelem spoke to the United Nations Assembly, the country's situation improved.
"Today, the situation on the ground is safer and safer than the progress of the war on terrorism," she says.
The government continues to re-establish the place where terrorists are killed in order to restore the rule of law.
All the measures necessary for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they have left behind from terrorism and the economic measures that have ruined their daily lives and their lives are now under way.
It is estimated that over 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Six million people still living in the country need help from searchers to improve their human well-being.
Al-Mouelem said that the Syrian government would receive help to rebuild the country of destruction.
But he insisted that the aid would not be accepted by countries that supported the opposition.
Europe has won the ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the Ryder Cup in 2018 at the United States team at the latest 16.5 is 10.5 in Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The US is now six years old in Europe and has not been able to get Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe can regain its glory when it reaches the number 14.5 that they require to defeat the United States by Captain Thomas Bjorn's team.
The U.S. Star Phil Mickelson, who fought most of the contests, fired the shooting in the water at par-3, 16th floor, gave the game to Francesco Molinari's flag.
Italian golfer Molinari was admired during all his careers, he became a player 1 of 4 to 5-0-0 because the current theme of the game began in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was fired by the lowest player in the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark on 5 and 4.
The world's top player, Dustin Johnson, the first player, fell from 2 and 1 from Ian Poulter from England who may have played from the latest Cup Ryder.
Spanish Sergio Garcia, an old player of the eight Rider Cup, became the most winning player in Europe through 25.5.
"I’m not often crying but today I really don’t have my tears.
That was a very difficult year.
Thank you very much for choosing me and believing me.
I was so happy that I had a cup of coffee again.
This caused a team discussion, and I am glad I was able to help," Garcia responded after Europe's victory.
He transferred the threat to his fellow national brother John Ram, who banned a famous American golfer named Tiger Woods at 2&1 in a single Saturday game.
"I can't believe my heart beating Tiger Woods. I've always looked at that man until I'm older," said 23-year-old Rahman.
Woods has been hit by four games in France and has a record 13-21-3 on Ryder Cup.
It's a weird print with the most suitable player who gets 14 tickets after Jack Nicklaus alone.
The U.S. team fought hard at the end of the week looking for a football field in addition to Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau who played high-end golf during a whole contest.
Jim Furyk, who was captain of the United States after his team's defeating hopes, said, "I'm proud of these guys, they're really fighting.
There was a time when we had a little conversation with Europe this morning.
We lost contact with him.
Fire for Thomas.
He's a captain.
All 12 players are highly skilled.
We'll meet together, we'll work with the U.S. PGA on our Ryder Cup Committee and we'll be on our way.
I love these 12 bands and I'm happy to be my captain.
You must be active.
They're under their control.
