Novák helped Trabzonspor to the other side of the border, and Schkoda
The Defence Forces of Filip Novak helped in the last round of the Turkish Football League Trabzonspor to the title of Vice-Mister.
His team won 2:1 at the game of Kayserispor and kept behind him the third Besiktas.
Refugees Milan Škoda have already moved from Slavian ten branches for Rizespor, which has survived, even though at 1:3 on the game of Fenerbahce.
Novák confirmed the excellent productivity of the seventh round in this patient year.
In 63 minutes, the General of Kayserispor just fired a smart shot and a Czech footballer fired a ball into the network.
The household was assigned five minutes before the end, but Trabzonspor shot victory on his side in six minutes when he successfully finished four at one.
The damage at the beginning of the second season of contact with Fenerbahce was equal to 1:1.
The resistance of the net did not last long, but it did not take him to hate it, as the results of the contestants remained three points over the composite sand.
The competition ends the Sunday duel of the Master's Basaksehir at the game of Kasampas.
Well-equipped Jesky in the woods at the New Battle was not actually civilized
In the north of Chech in the foothills of the Lužic Mountains, near the New Battle in Czechoslovakia, in the woods that led the Hirabje road, there are a number of sand dunes.
Nature and art created.
And we're going to be behind that human hand created.
The place is called Jeskyna by the desert.
In fact, though, no deserter ever lived here and served as a hidden, more accurately hidden room apparently on the shore.
Jesky is squeezed from the side into the scale of caution and is available on the sides of the Shore.
Right away, but it's not actually seen in the last few minutes.
It produces it when narrow layers lead to a kind of rock gallery, from which it enters first into the rock.
Even though it seems that the room is far from human remains, at the time it could be on the top surface where it is today, the field.
"The fact that this object has no window and no traditional location located at the top of the top shows that no tourist here could ever survive the winter," explains historian Kamil Podruszek from the Philosophy Faculty of Jan Evangelist Purkyna in Ústí nad Labem.
A single-space object has only a stone-winning rear that is apparently useful for the decomposing of goods.
"I see it as a room to store some food or products from the field," adds Kamil Podrouzek.
On the walls, there's apparently a sharp foot behind the tools.
The lifting of the pen with the pen was dedicated to a very simple and fast one.
It was enough to use the sleeping and brush gently.
Depending on the length of the step after the tip and at least the method of cutting can be defined as a frame of reference.
According to history, it's probably about the end of the 18th century.
Jesky is freely available, and according to the disorder that appears in it, there is a time of sleep in today’s world.
If you approach the snow from one of the forest roads and we take you under the snowy current and near the steep road, then you will probably find the slope down there too.
And the road from the forest you still need to catch a small Haven Rock.
Zukkyi Minarík is following a severe fall in Germany in an art bed
"Filip is now in the best hand.
The Institute is in a similar situation, and we also have a family member in Hanover.
This greatly eases my situation and also my care for the daughter of Finju," quoted the server Jezdci.cz as saying Minarík's wife Katji.
"They're all doing maximum, Philip now needs time to reconnaissance.
It doesn't make any sense to give any prognosis.
Anyone who has ever had a problem with brain trauma and patients in an art bed knows that the situation can change.
Filip's a big fighter.
We all have to be patient now and give him time," said the woman of a 50-year-old joke.
In support of the injured Minarík, he called on the Twitter and star Frankie Dettori, who won in Ascot in his own King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stacks, which he had produced in August, compared Lester Piggotta's legend.
On the Gofundme server, nearly 70 thousand euros have been selected for today.
The target is 100 thousand euros (2.6 million kroner).
Video player took photos of Sassula's four goals, lost 0:2
The footballists Sassula set up on Saturday in Naples got four times a fight into the rival branch, but finally they had to fight with the defeat 0:2.
Not one of their heads will decide after consultation with the video because of abuse.
According to the Italian media, there is a record lack of technology, so many principles have never been met by the VAR on one team.
"The VAR was stronger than the road radar on Sassoolo and he stressed it as yet no team.
A new technology of market record," wrote in a comment on Gazzetta dello Sport.
"The Sassuola Festival of Undiscovered Heads.
The VAR has never been so strict on one team," added Corriere dello Sport.
Neapol took the lead on Saturday in 8 minutes, after half an hour of the game, but it seemed that Sassulo did the same.
Philip Djurichica's throat was not recognized after the video’s impact on the opposite sex.
For the same reason, no other Djurichic principles and encounters between Francesca Caputa and Domenica Berardi were paid gradually.
On the other hand, the domestics added one more hole.
Electromobiles are reporting a new record.
In the Czech Republic, they got the most out of history
"The growth was as much as 30% increase in the number of stations in our network and the trend of more frequent procurement at public stations, as well as the rapid development of the registration of new e-autos," said ČEZ Tomáš Chmélik, head of the clean technology framework.
Their market share is also reported by other major players, such as PRE and E.ON, Tesla electric cars manufacturers, but perhaps even Bill and Lidl supermarkets.
Operators of classical canal stations are represented by MOL.
But there's still no number.
"We started building our electricity network first," explained Jan Jusková's spokesman.
However, the edition of Deník exclusively obtained data from all 216 electric stations operated by the company ČEZ.
It appears that the station drivers were picked up in an average of 13.5 kWh.
This corresponds to a 100-kilometre drive of less-powered vehicles.
If we remember a small cut to 1 kWh, it takes an average supply of two and a half hours.
Then most of the tankers went into free tariffs.
If the motorists were already paid for the pickup, they would have moved around 330 kroner.
Electromobility will be removed mainly in the main city.
The territory of Prague is home to all five of the most difficult recipients of the ČEZ company, which stands for its popularity throughout the country.
Between the regions then leads Olomouc.
On the other hand, the least interest is about a remote station in the border, such as Bohumina or Prachatics, which often lasts for a whole day without use.
More than four thousand electric vehicles are currently registered in the Czech Republic.
In the first half of the year, 1274 new e-automs arrived.
In a comprehensive survey of Danika "Chesch in motion" eight percent of readers said that the purchase of an electric car into the family was considered.
However, only three thirds of respondents know where to look in their surroundings for the nearest supply station.
Not just for better water storage.
In Prague environmental activists protested
According to organizers, the efforts of governments to protect and heal the Czech country and address the climate crisis are insufficient, the speakers called for a more diverse approach.
Actions called the Last Cup were attended by representatives of large organisations such as the Spirit, Greenpeace or the Green Side, as well as smaller local companies.
"We have here, for example, people who are long-standing against the downturn of the Towers, there are people who are facing the difficulties of the Czech Republic in the Uhersk Ostrok, there are people who are going against the construction of mindless buildings," said Marika Wolfvá.
It stated that the main requirements of the protesting are the development of a water conservation plan in the country, the different changes in agricultural policy and the support system for sustainable agriculture and the fastest transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources.
"The government has to attract people's interests, not the least, and the most exciting business," she said.
In the Little Transit, a petitioning representative of the Czech State was placed to establish a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and the restoration of the Czech soil and land.
Neighbors were equipped with translucents with words such as "Finishes from fish" or "Lower Oil, More Men".
From South Moravia to Prague, Jan Škoda came from the company For the water for people who protesting against the plan of the heavy spell on Hodoninsk.
"The source of drinking water threatens 140 000 people," he said.
He added that the gardens represent the fifth most impressive source of drinking water in the Czech Republic.
The planned weight of a cheetah is only about 500 metres from the garden and the water quality is sure to be at risk.
He came from the village of Valeč in Karlovarsk Vojtěch Veselý for a so-called agro-ecological farmer.
He warned of small farms that are not married to profits and gains and that people are being attacked directly at the site.
"Little agricultural farms are able to normally feed the entire population, and the proposal does not make such a ban on foreign and living environments," he said.
Three people died on the plane at home in Germany
On the fall of an ultrasound plane on the apartment building in western Germany, three people died today and two others were injured.
Local savings were reported, according to which there are probably two members of the deceased and one resident of the house.
The plane landed on the roof of the building in Wesel, North Poríní-Vestfalsk.
The underground apartment, which was one of the five units in the house, then set fire.
The hassies have already been able to get the flames under control.
The representatives of local editors Robert Meyboo reported that they were apparently killed by both flight crews.
The third victim is according to the police of the woman who lived in the house.
Dník Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung (WAZ), referring to Wesel’s age, wrote that it was the mother of a suicide victim whose two-year-old daughter was rescued from the apartment with mild injuries.
In the vicinity of the accident, an emergency case was found that was clearly serving as a bridge at the time of arrest.
The police are coming from a bombed plane.
There was room for two people in the airport.
The engine started off from the airport in the nearby town of Marl.
Däník Rheinische Post, referring to the obvious witnesses, indicated that the plane was hit by an air balloon before the crash.
However, this information has not yet been confirmed.
THE WAZ, referring to other Witnesses, wrote that the plane had crashed into the air before the earthquake struck.
The Czech competitor on Saturday miscalculated some card payments twice.
Could not close temporary folder: %s
The Czech competitor to his customers on Saturday afternoon miscalculated some card payments twice.
According to Lukáše Kropik's spokesman bank, the problem could have been involving thousands of transactions.
The mistake has already been settled and the money has been returned to customers.
The problems with double-calculation accounts were reported on Saturday afternoon.
"More yesterday (Saturday) at night we carried out an update of the system and all these double payments immediately returned to customers.
At this point, everything works without problems," he said on Sunday afternoon, Cropik.
The exact number of customers that the bank has calculated money from card payments twice, the bank doesn't know, according to its estimate, were less than a thousand transactions.
The causes of problems are found in the community.
"It could have been about the combination of several factors," said Kropik.
The Czech company is the largest bank in the Czech Republic according to the number of customers.
At the end of March, they had 4.6 million.
The owners are the Erste Group Bank, which is a key player in the central and eastern European banking market.
The guides on Monday present a three-phase system against coronavir
"At the same time, they will be based on the strength of Community enlargement at regional level.
We are working on it together with epidemiology and the Institute of Medical Information and Statistics," Vojtéch said in the CT.
As regards semafor, individual regions will be marked by green, orange or red colour at risk of exposure to coronavir.
The Minister added that he would still talk to epidemiologists about organizing individual countries.
He admitted that the orange color would currently have only the Moravskoslesland country and that Praha would be close to him.
The map will also include individual measures for national health stations, hospitals, social facilities and employees.
"We want to solve this at regional level because the situation is not uniform," Voythe said.
Water and Karolinka
When I look at the waters of Jonah and the millions of Caroline's daughter, they don't even have a simple one.
Jonah lovingly defends his father, poor Hastrbuch, and Karolinka no longer has a sense that her dear Jonah is not a man.
Still there is a young Libor who will do everything to protect all of it, especially Carolinka, from this water shortage.
What about he's going to shock and lie?
The main thing he can do is that Karolini Jonas refused and gave priority to his loyal Libor.
Soon everything is clear in all who can take care of the midnight Konvicky, the damaged stomach, the fire of flour and other lotteries.
The difference between the surrounding tribes is that Jonah’s head is still affected by an incalculable water curse.
And now Convic's baby Caroline's advice!
How can you blind the old Hasterbucha, convince the neighbors of Jonah’s innocence, find Jonah and release him from the curse?
The event was recorded in September 2010 in the CT studies and abroad in the Brzynian fishermen, in the Sedlčansk Districts and in the beautiful historical molluscs in Hosloví.

The history of most disabilities is peaceful, only three percent of the patients must be instructed.
Whether the Czech Republic is developing a more peaceful form of coronavir or the annual dose of the sun has significantly improved our immunity.
Infectious departments are empty even though the number of indicated increases.
"This situation today and in depth is quite different and is given in particular by the number of hospitalised ones," confirmed Dr. Adam Vojtèch's Health Minister.
It is worth noting that on April 11, when the first wave of the epidemic hit us, all the Russians, the military conscripts, the Republic were closed, and Czechs used disinfection for the previous year.
Ten people died each day, though.
Now there are daily increases in the number of ordered higher, but every day with manvid-19, two people die at least.
The highest number for the population is still Karvinsko, similar numbers already have Jihla because of the fire in the local Alzheimer's center, where there are 57 registered - 40 clients and 17 employees.
Other homes for seniors were closed up in the Blacks at the Royal Palace.
The disease confirmed tests in one of the surgeons.
"We're looking for, we've missed the move, we've got all the hygienic measures," says house manager Martin Chanal.
According to him, none of the clients are at home with symptoms of illness.
A general test will begin to take place tomorrow and then decide on other measures.
Patients respond to an increase in the number of patients.
The Oncological Constitution in Brná today has launched an automatic camera system at the entrance, which knows if people have access to a found hole.
The record reports to the southern hygienics who recorded fifty cases of koronavir - most of them are made up of foreign employees of the law firm.
Totally came on Saturday 131 ordered - so half of the Friday number - on the weekend, but it's less tested.
Debutant champion!
Van den Bergh did my best, Andersona mmetl
The great surprise of the tournament called Dimitri van den Bergh has shown outstanding performance even in the game with the player who won the second most prestigious PDC company in 2018.
The introduction of the game was strictly balanced, the damage was due to condition 8:7 for the Belgian skipper.
Van den Bergh took a break from 13 chips, and since then he's had a proposal.
His opponent drew his game of text and a much more experienced "Flying Scot" just got hard to get to the doublings.
The way she had "Smoking Dreams" in her throat, she also testifies that divorced Anderson played his first maximum until 24th of August.
In addition, young Belgians have had great checks.
Last time he was lost in 11th league, in a state of non-violence, but he "had caught a big fish" and closed 170.
At the end of the game, Anderson saw a huge frustration.
The chips were just kicking off, and his triumphal racing opponent became quite subversive.
Van den Bergh immediately changed the first of three matches and got his name - he wrote his big dream.
The triumph of the trophies named after Phil Taylor is more valuable to the Belgian skipper than his first winning major.
He continues to pay that the last player who was able to win out of Bergha is Karel Sedláček.
In Nantes, the charges were dropped because of the fire of the cathedral, the man admitted
The cathedral of the Holy Peter and Paul in the heart of Nantes began to burn on the last Saturday and the fire seriously damaged the original viper window of the 16th century and destroyed the ruins.
The survey found that the fires were from three different places in the temple.
At the same time, the police didn't find any signs of anyone getting violent into the cathedral.
The defendant is a volunteer at the local diocese, a nine-year-old Rwandan refugee.
The police arrested him just after the fire, but then they let him go without a criminal arrest.
Now the prosecutor reported that on the basis of new evidence, the man was again arrested on Saturday, admitted and accused of jealousy.
In case he is found guilty, he is threatened with imprisonment for up to ten years and with a high sentence.
According to his lawyer, the husband is sorry and decided to cooperate fully with the investigator, Le Monde wrote.
Guides: On Monday we will present "semafor" for epidemiological measures
The new system has to play a role in the pandemic plan, which is why the government and the Ministry of Health are away from criticism.
"At the same time, they will be based on the strength of Community enlargement," the Minister explained.
He added that, at present, for example, the Moravian country or Prague would have reached an average orange level.
The system is designed as a regional one because the situation in individual countries is significantly different.
The Ministry worked with epidemiology and Health Information and Statistics Charter (UZIS).
Individually, specific measures will be introduced by the Minister whether it is already the obligation to carry rice or to organise special departments in hospitals.
In order to create an epidemiological plan in the Prima Party television series, Minister Jan Hamáček (ČSSD) called on people to have clear information on what measures they can expect if the epidemiological situation gets worse.
The daily increase in confirmed cases in the Czech Republic has grown in recent days, although the number of hospitalised persons remains low.
The leaders commented that there is no significant event in place to speak of a state of emergency or a state of crisis again.
In view of the growing number of orders from Saturday throughout the Czech Republic, the government has once again introduced the obligation to carry rice on domestic shares over 100 people.
From Monday, the capacity of these actions will be limited to 500 people, now 1,000 people.
The government's procedure, when it was not clear to the end, what measures and when they started to pay even when they were announced, were critical.
"I think that in a situation that is relatively heavy, the main factors should create a sense of security and that desire rather than the same," Senator Marek Hilscher said in Questions.
The measures can now be broken down by region, such as in Prague since Sunday, for example the obligation to carry rice in non-resident medical equipment, such as in medical or medical establishments.
The obligation to carry rice when visiting medical and social facilities or doctors also came from the fifth country of Liberia and Austria.
On the Highway in Jihlavsk it is necessary to wear clothes in internal public spaces, MHD and in medical facilities since 14 July.
On the other hand, the anti-piedemic measures have been released in the country of Morravskoslesz, as in the country of the Middle East in Kutnohorsk.
At the beginning of June, the Czech Government has also adopted a so-called Semafor for Europe, which in colour distinguishes the level of the risk of fines in individual European countries, and it also manages the rules applicable to access to the Czech Republic from these countries.
In a country with a low and medium risk, the authorities shall not require a negative test on or instead of a quarantine from the Czech citizens of the Coronavirus.
They're responsible for returning the Czechs from the country with a high risk.
At present, all EU Member States are in a low-risk category.
Technoparty in Benesevska continues.
Games on third-party capacity, she had to finish in the morning
Hlaváčkova Lhota (Benešovsko) Technoparty in Hlaváčký Lhoty in Benesevska continues on Sunday evening.

The police also solved 14 offenses in court.
At the request of the participants, the police carried out 300 preventive respiratory tests and four preventive tests for the presence of ammonia and psychotropic substances.
About 2,000 people were on the scene on Saturday morning.
If the number of participants had not been reduced, the police would have been there.
In the television series Prima Partie said this to Interior Minister Jan Hamáček (ČSSD).
However, the number of participants decreased by less than 1,000, the police assessed that the principle was unnecessary and did not require a health station or the Ministry of Health.
On Sunday, Czech television (CTT) indicated that technology parties were also expanding to environmental areas whose owners did not agree with the use of technology parties.
It is possible that the owners of the surrounding lands will demand compensation for damage.
The owners of the technology at Hlaváčký Lhoty's camp arrived on Friday night.
On Friday, the police were looking at the castle in Blajim in Benešov, where the technologists were taking off.
Please find a 30-kilometre hole from Hlaváčký Lhoty, where the technicians finally sat.
According to Novak, no one came to the beach.
Sneaking snake: The girl's done in the hospital!
"The first annual case was recorded in Jeleznorudsk.
The snake threw into the foot of a girl, the year 2010 that her parents brought her to the dark base of rescue services," Denika told her country’s medical nurse Maria Freebod’s services, after which the child was transferred to the hospital in Klatoves.
The snakes are the only breeding sheep in the Czech Republic and right on the forest these animals are being raised in a higher number, so it is good to take care of them on the way.
However, it is not as dangerous as these animals.
The chance that the snake will bite you isn't too high when they're in regular contact with each other.
And if he has room for it, he's happy to get out of there for a vote.
Only if you feel very threatened - for example if you're wrong about it.
Even her scarcity isn't a tragedy, her diet is very effective against small rats, but people don't die.
This can only happen if a person has a particularly weakened organism or suffers from allergy.
The risk of danger is therefore particularly for children, adults and allergens.
"A person often has a feeling of vomiting, sweating, increased fever, fever, chest pain and fever, in weakened units and in particular allergic reactions may even come to an anaphylactic shock," she wrote for Deník Miriam Gredvá from the Clatovian hospital.
The man threatened to get out of the window.
By the police, the wine and the house will be served
After 23:00, a crew unit came into the apartment and the man kept it.
The starters immediately took care of the hospital, introduced a press report by the national police of Markét Janovská.
The man didn't want to work with the police, after a police contractor, he bought a knife or a bottle of wine.
Several times during his encounter, he calmed out of the window with the child in his arms.
One time he even went out to the parapet of the window where he came back.
The man's police are still investigating.
He doesn't want to publish any more information.
Stosorva gives the daughter priority before the tennis season
Australian tennis player Samantha Stosour won't touch the cornovir this year.
Six-year-old US Open 2011 champion who became a mother in June but still doesn't want to finish the career.

The WTA Tour will be renewed from March to August 3rd by an anti-tournament tour in Palermo.
The Sapa Market: Razie removed the meat, fish and eggs of an unknown origin
"One of the vehicles flying into the area carried 1320 bags of chicken eggs of unknown origin, in addition to inappropriate conditions.
These eggs will also be disposed of in the assay company," the State Veterinary Administration said.
The control of the stock of live fish showed that the seller had no evidence of the origin of the goods and was not registered for the sale of live fish.
The market is considered to be long-term because of the problem of veterinary examination.
For example, on the south coast of it, the veterinarians discovered illegal food sales, with almost half a ton of unlabeled foods without proof of origin.
In most cases there was no indication of the date of consumption, some of the products had a history of sustainability and were damaged.
In five kilograms of semen, the date of duration was exceeded by three years.
In May the Loni kept their veterinarians with the police in the market area of 80 kilograms of food without evidence of origin, including other dried fish, oil or frozen coke, including parts of dance.
Putin phoned Zelenský before the start of the dock in Donbas, Kremlin criticises the planned elections
Russian President Vladimir Putin phoned with his Ukrainian opposition Volodymary Zelenski about the situation in Donbas, where he had to start paying new charges from midnight.
Putin, according to Kremla's statement, further criticised the Ukrainian Parliament's decision on the conduct of local elections; Kyev reported that Zelensky called for the release of the Ukrainians detained.
The new peace of arms was agreed on Wednesday evening by the Ukrainian and Russian counterparts for the support of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OBSE).
It should start at midnight on Monday, be "full and general" and open the way for other peace agreements to be fulfilled.
Putin, in his speech to Zelenskek, said that the decision of the Ukrainian Parliament to arrange local elections rejects the peace agreement from Minsk and threatens prospects for the settlement of the conflict in eastern Ukraine.
Last week, the Ukrainian Parliament decided that local elections were not effective on the territory of the Russian rebels.
The minority agreement assumes that Kyev will regain control of Ukraine's occupations of separatists with Russia after giving these regions broad autonomy and arrange local elections here.
According to the Zelensian Agency, both states agreed on the benefits of an emerging approach in Donbas and on the need to take further measures to support peace in this region, such as the abolition of war areas or the landing of part of the front.
Zelensky also called for the release of Ukrainians detained in eastern Ukraine, in the occupied part of Krym and in Russia alone.
The minority agreement has helped stop wars, but in both fronts people continue to die in times of shooting and gunfire.
The conflict in Donbas has required more than 14,000 dead since 2014.
Ukraine and the West accuse Russia of the military support of separatists, which Moscow supports.
Zelensky has made the end of the war in Donbas his priority, but he has not yet reached the most important part of the meeting.
The unexpected master in the tenet is Rykl, the seventh ruler of Novotná
The tenderer of the last two titles did not reach the end of the Saturday's four-year programme, Kopecký did not take the basis for it on Sunday.
Ten years ago, however, the Latvian representative Reinis Kregers, who is preparing to join Joseph Karase's team, resigned after the disc.
He had two bronze medals from the outside MZR, this time being the only teenager who got across the seven-year border.
Other medals followed him by Vilem Stráský and Petr Urbanek.
Reyklo recalled the absence of Adam Sebastian Helcelet and Jiři Sykor.
"I'm sorry there weren't any guys here and Kope didn't build because those results would look completely different.
But the title tastes very good, and I appreciate it mainly because I've given a person 30 inches away.
Then my uncle still made me happy, and most of the time he broke me off the disk, I was underweight," he admitted on his new facebook.
The first day of the week, she won more than a hundred moves by Katerina Cachov, although she was hit by an injured cat on her back.
In the long run, however, she wrote only 570 cm, did not pass 40 metres and did not reach the final osmosis.
Newly collected 5878 points and won 241 points before Katerín Dvorák.
She went out first, 631 cm is the best Czech performance of the year.
"I was really hoping it'd be around 630.
Yesterday I started to fly, but I'm very glad I didn't feel it at all and that it didn't even limit me," Novotna said on his new facebouk.
There was an LPG coming to the Czech Republic, promising environmental performance
Liquefied Petroleum Gas (Liquefied Petroleum Gas) is a very well-known alternative fuel in the Czech Republic.
In particular, it is preferred for its basic lower price of petrol or oil, which provides significantly lower consumption taxes, while its benefit is also in lower CO2 emissions per kilometre.
Like petrol and oil, it has its ecologically narrow variant -- "bio LPG".
It is, however, the whole of the news - the proposal first appeared on the European market and the Czech Association LPG arrived in the Czech Republic a few days ago, according to the press report.
"In these days we have received the first 15 tonnes of bio LPG, which will be distributed in combination with the classic fossil LPG at our cutting station," says Jiří Karlíka from Primagas.
The bio LPG could not be taken as bioethanol or bionapht.
According to the association, the chemical site is consistent with the classic rotary LPG that is currently in use in its cars by a number of motorists.
That's why it's also possible for both versions to move freely.
"The only difference between the classic LPG is the method of production," says LPG bio Ivan Indraček, the president of the association.
This has also been said to be one of the great benefits of the LPG against other alternative fuels.
It will be easy to transport and store, and also the distribution infrastructure is relatively good, for example, compared to water or electricity.
This gas is currently obtained as a by-product in the production of bioethanol from the residues of food and sugar.
In the future, it should also be designed to be targeted, e.g. from cellular biomass, thus from wood waste.
On the other hand, the classic rotary LPG is partly produced as a side product when refining oil, partly separated when the soil is heavy.
The result is, therefore, based on production technology and bio-LPG transport of 40-70% more environmentally friendly than crude LPG and up to 90% compared to oil.
However, it is not about CO2 emissions from the exhaust gas of the car, although it is about the environment of fuel production, i.e. the part "well-to-tank" (German "from source to storage").
One of the largest producers was the LPG currently owned by the petrochemical companies Eni, Total and Neste.
According to the recent update of the National Plan of Action on Clean Mobility (NAP CHM), the possibility of production and unitol in its Lithuanian refinery is examined.
According to the Czech Association estimates, some 170 thousand vehicles are driving on LPG; the Ministry of the Environment is reporting in NAP CHM on something higher, totaling 200 thousand.
According to the statistics of the Ministry of Transport, almost 6,000 car stops were carried out during the year alone.
Dating LPG is possible in the Czech Republic for up to 950 different stations of operators.
He reviewed the number of orders, the number of cases of 1775
Minister of Health Adam Vojtèch (for the United Nations) ordered the Ministry to revise the number assigned by the Coronavir virus.
New statistics have been published on its website by the Ministry of Health on Sunday.
The number of Saturday afternoons ranged from 5254 to 3479 cases, which is less than 1775.
There are currently 3422 patients in the Czech Republic.
"As a result of an increase in the number of cases treated, the review of data that have recently been unable to update hygiene," said the medical head Jaroslav Dušek.
By Sunday afternoon, Coronavir was arrested by 15 212 people in the Czech Republic, 11 419 were cured and 371 were injured by Covid-19.
Mobile choice units or correspondence.
Politology and sociologists were looking for options for the pandemic era
In order to allow people to vote in October national and senate elections in quarantine due to coronavir, the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of the Interior Jan Hamáčka (ČSSD) say that the law needs to be amended.
Parliament could arrange it either in August or in September in an accelerated regime.
He put it on Sunday at the Party TV Prima.
On Tuesday, he wants to ask the ministry for a possible solution to the representatives of Parliament.
"If we do anything, then it will have to mean a change of the law of choice," Hamácek said.
The Senate called on the government to find a solution within the framework of the existing legal rules.
However, the Minister pointed out that there would be a need to adjust the provisions of the law which would prevent people in quarantine from voting for the health status.
The prohibition of choice should be maintained for example for patients with open tuberculosis.
Daniel Prokop stated in the OVM order that the possibility of correspondence will be denied since 2004.
The current proposal of a law which is in a sequential manner is then calculated by its introduction for voting abroad, but not in Czech.
At the same time, the sample considers the concerns of ANO or ČSSD (because, according to experience from abroad, it would be better stored by other types of parties) from the correspondence option to be assessed.
Personally, then, it is against the possibility of electronic voting where there is a significant possibility of abuse.
Michal Klíma said that now there is a need for ad hoc to design mechanisms (voeb), which could be implemented this year and with at least the minimum health risk.
It is therefore considered primarily to be prepared for 2021 when parliamentary elections are held in Czech.
Correspondence (whether in foreign or also in Czech) is considered to be one of the functional methods.
As is further seen by the above-mentioned electoral units, or the possibility of a representative vote within the family.
He added that it is possible to learn how similar situations - elections in the time of Coronavir - were solved in Croatia, Poland or France.
As a result of the expansion of coronavir fines, various types of vote have been abandoned in 67 countries of the world this year.
Protests in Bulgaria: The deaf ears of the house-to-house demonstrators at the government building
The participants of the demonstration against Bulgarian Prime Minister Boyk Boris and his office were found on the building of the government's deaf ear.
Another of the series of protests against the "Mafian government style" that has been taking place in Sofia and other cities for almost three weeks.
The organizers are planning a national blockade, the DPA agency said.
Today's protest, which took place 18 days after itself, has had a lower share of freedom than before, according to Radio Free Europe/Radio.
At 20:00 a crowd of 300 people arrived, some streets had to be closed for transport.
Before the building, the demonstrators gathered a theatre scene, where they symbolicly shut down Prime Minister Borisov and Prosecutor General Ivan Gešev in connection with the arrest of two presidental advisers, Romania Radeva, who is a strong political opponent of the government.
The rejection of both is one of the fundamental requirements of the protesters.
They also called for the destruction of the announced health reform and the end of corruption in the construction of the Black Sea.
The organizer of the protest today, Nikolay Hadzigenov, in a public-law vote, pointed out that the middle of the "scalation summit" is like "the international demonstration in Sofia and the blockade across the country".
He repeated the request for Boris' resignation and his government, as well as for the release of earlier elections.
These fines should be carried out in March 2021.
Boris has already told me to stop agreeing.
In addition to other needs, it has given rise to the Bulgarian pandemic of 19 and from which the economic crisis is resulting.
On Friday, however, he changed five members of his government team so that he did not take the stand of the demonstrators.
At the beginning of this week, the government of Boris stopped voting in Parliament on confidence in Parliament.
Coach Boloni Mihajlović no longer wants to catch without a see.
The football coach Boloni Siniša Mihajlović already has enough Italian league without fans.
The Serbian poet hopes that from the new season the fans will return to the stadium.
"What we're currently doing here is not football.
I've got a full toothless without glasses.
It's a free football, it doesn't give me any emotion, no joy.
Those tapes are worse than training.
The game is so dangerous and I don't think I'm the only one who thinks it," Mihajlovic said before today's game against Lecce.
After the Coronavir break, they follow the series A events in quick succession, and although they play until evening, their actors are exposed to heat.
"We play every three days in a terrible war.
Under such conditions, he doesn't even know how they are on this team.
It's time for this season to end.
The measure had to come to terms with competition, but I hope there will be fans back from the season," said the poet who led Fiorentina or AC Milan in the past.
For Mihajlovice, this season is unusual and because four months on the vic were missing because of leukemia treatment.
"Despite my disability, the break-up of the league and everything else, our team has been moved to assume the level of higher.
We want to keep growing and we need to make players mentally stronger," he said.
We've become the target of cybercrime from foreign states, Iran says.
Since the end of June, several Iranian military, industrial and nuclear equipment have also been reported to fires and explosions.
Some Iranian manufacturers reported that the fire that exploded this month in the underground nuclear operation in Natanzu could have caused cybernetic sabotage.
The cause of a number of other incidents has not yet been explained.
Speaking by the Iranian Ministry of Foreign Affairs Abbas Musavi told Iranian media journalists that the Islamic Republic's infrastructure is headed by " thousands of cybernetic attacks" every day.
He added that it's not about a new rope and that most of them can be reflected.
In recent months, according to Musavi, several more cybernetic attacks have been recorded, which are being analysed by "the sincere governments and groups".
However, Reuters does not share any further details of possible asylum seekers.
He also added that fires in forests, refineries and other places are common in summer.
The Iranian State Agency's member INNA agreed this month that Iran's enemies, such as Israel and the United States, could be affected by recent incidents.
Not one of these countries was directly accused of any specific attacks in the article.
Iran and the United States broke diplomatic ties shortly after the 1979 revolution, when Iranian military students were forced into the U.S. embassy in Tehran and held hands on 52 Americans for 444 days.
Long-term strained relations between the two countries took place in 2018 after Washington withdrew from the 2015 nuclear agreement between Iran and the world powers and imposed sanctions on Iran that had a strong impact on its economy.
Another significant scale came this year after the American army killed Iranian General Kasama Solejman and leader of the Iraqi militia Abū Mahdí Muhanise on 3 January.
Iran then fired on January 8th on the basis in Iraq, where American rockets are being launched.
The U.S. admitted to being wounded by dozens of American soldiers.
Israel considers Iran its main enemy and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is the main supporter of the international nuclear agreement with Iran since 2015.
According to the Israeli Prime Minister, Iran is trying to develop an atomic bomb, which Iran fires.
The TPCA car extended its production distance by 25 May
The Colinic Car Toyota Peugeot Citroën Automobile (TPCA) has again prolonged production delay due to coronavir.
The production lines should be relaunched on Monday, 25 May.
The race will carry out dozens of hygienic measures, Tomáš Paroubek said.
The product is due to the pandemic Coronavir since evening 18 March.
The company originally planned to renew it on Monday 18 May.
The reason for the delay is according to Paroubka closed borders and closed dealership, so no one has to sell the car.
According to Paroubka, from the start, the company will produce 100 per cent, then two exchanges.
Coronavir is a key market for companies such as Italy, Great Britain or Spain.
Old Michael Kashpar said that the withdrawal of production in TPCA is not described in the city.
"From the beginning it was known that it was empty in the city.
But gradually the streets are filled, especially now from Monday when it's been very loose.
So the city is full," Kashpar said.
According to him, there are no complications or foreign workers who have remained in residences.
"For these two months we didn't want to solve almost any problem," Kashpar said.
For example, the young people's Skoda Auto, which also discontinued production due to the Coronavir crisis, renewed it on Monday 27th in all three of its production establishments in the Czech Republic.
Not one of the competitions works at 100% capacity.
The renewal of the product in the injury occurred in more than 80 hygiene measures.
On Monday night in the morning, there was a change of night first after the production was renewed in the Youth Boleslav and Kvasinach.
At TPCA, there are currently 2500 people working and the company represents one of the largest exporters in the Czech Republic and employees in Kolinska.
The cancer killed a young woman shortly after the wedding: She left a family message
For more than two years she's been fighting the toxic cancer of Gemma Sison, and once it seemed that she had conquered the cancer, the disease called again.
A nine-year-old woman who loved culture finally ended up at a hotel where she still had enough to take her life.
I can't believe it's happened.
A few hours after her death on the social network, Facebook revealed a shocking message to those closest.
Gemma Sisson, who came from the English Leeds, loved culture.
A friend of Ricky Moore, who lived with him for more than 16 years, traveled around the world for competition.
Nineteen-year-old woman was sporting and living healthy, although she was diagnosed with cancer in depth in 2018.
Gemma started taking an effective treatment, radiotherapy, in hopes of getting better.
After months of treatment, it really seemed that Gemma had committed cancer victims, but in July 2019 cancer returned and this time she attacked five.
According to British daily Daily Mirror, the cultural and personal trainer took part in the ten-hour operation of the patrol and then again started with drastic treatment.
Everything was important.
At the beginning of this year, at her ninth birthday, her doctors announced that she had been living a few months.
At the bottom of the depth, a brilliant blonde finally decided to go to the Leeds hospital, where her family visited her every minute, even arranged a wedding with her dear Ricky.
Marriage lasted for two months.
Ricky finally took Gemma to their two-month-old restaurant.
Four days later Gemma died in his arms.
Just a few hours after her death on the social network, the contribution that Gema wrote for her family was revealed on her account.
"If this was published, it means I finally died after weeks of too long a fight.
Although I'm going to have a broken heart that I leave my loved ones here, I'm so happy to get rid of what this terrible disease has done to me.
I can't thank Ricky enough for being on my side all the time and gave me a huge amount of love and support during that terrible time," she wrote on the social network with the fact that pain and suffering finally stopped and she found relief.
"I am also grateful for all the support I have received from all my social networks," she wrote, adding that everyone should consider their life and live it whole.

In the hundreds of crowns, it receives a cohesive work from most of the Czech manufacturers.
Images and other shapes are created directly for artmats, before they know that they have to go into size 8.5 to 5.5 cm.
Every corner is numbered and signed.
"In the package there is always curatoric text about the artist and then the work itself," explained the curator of the Petra Wijo project.

Payments in health next year will increase by up to five per cent.
The higher the increase by Vojtècha is unrealistic
Health payments could increase by up to five per cent next year, said Health Minister Adam Vojtèch (for UN) in Václava Moravce's Questions on Czech TV.
The demand of experts for an increase of up to 15 per cent is considered unrealistic.
He also said that the State should try to be cooperative in providing protection assistance.
According to him, the hospitals now have their resources.
"I think growth (payments) can be up to five percent somewhere," said the minister.
According to him, it is necessary to reflect the current situation when from March onwards the choice of a safe pandemic of coronavir and a government regulation against its expansion.
Let's get insurance at that time.
"I'm going to get an increase of 15 percent at this time unrealistic," Voythech said.
The average monthly doctoral training in acute hospital care according to the Data Health Information and Statistics Institute (UZIS) is likely to reach 88 312 kroner this year, sister 47 498 kroner.
The difference between the nurse’s plate in the state hospitals and the meddo in other designers will be up to seven thousand koruna.
According to the UZIS data, the death of medical sisters in hospitals has also been stopped.
According to the Czech Statistical Office, the average amount in the Czech Republic was 34 125 kroner in 2019.
Representatives of committees have already indicated in June that for 2021 they will require a minimum increase of 10 per cent, ideally 15 per cent.
They are critical of the long-term difference between the training of doctors and nurses in state hospitals, which must be managed by paytables and contractual courts in hospitals, countries or private hospitals.
They therefore also require that the health care tables be uniform.
In the health sisters this year, there will be up to seven thousand korunas per month.
For example, in doctors, lions may have grown faster than pay.
According to the President of the Czech Stomatological Chamber of Roman Šmuclera, the committees should take note of the current state of affairs.
The recent impact of the COVID has approved an increase in the annual state budget of 500 billion korunas, of which 1.75 billion is to be paid to patients in hospitals and social services.
The Board of Suppliers of Health Care according to Šmuclera does not agree with the flat increase in payments for the next year.
According to it, individual hospitals and medical facilities and money should also be taken over the financial statements.
The doctors also indicated that the hospitals currently have a lot of protective assistance.
The President of the State Reserves Department (SSHR) Paul Swagr said this week that the management has no current health assistance in its possession.
He's waiting for the election to be completed.
According to Vojtècha, suppliers in the world are now able to supply goods better than in March when they were purchased.
The state should try to be as friendly as possible and also buy from Czech companies.
The wearers of the smart quarantine would be able to take over the soldiers.
We're ready. They're showing us.
"Cythral quarantine works, it's something to improve of course.
We'll discuss this with the army tonight.
The army works perfectly and it's a question whether they shouldn't be running it again," the government president said on Sunday in his Facebook order.
According to it, IT systems and hygiene stations cannot be sufficiently developed, which must gradually switch to modern operating methods.
The problem was according to the prime minister in Morravskoslez, where they are one of the current signs of the epidemic.
The Ministry of Defence's spokesman Jan Pejšek told the CTK that the information on Sunday meetings is not available and that the government should take care of Monday.
The army is ready for this step.
The smart quarantine project took place by the Ministry of Health on 25 May.
By that time, the smart quarantine was led by a nine-year-old central team established under the military as the government's advisory body, which led by former minister of the town of Roman Prymula.
On Sunday, the draft was criticised by Minister of Interior Jan Hamáček (ČSSD).
And he insisted that he could be re-armed by the army.
The shortcomings in the project have also been attributed to the government's IT and the digitalisation of Vladimir Dzurilla, who cares about him.
"The system works, but it's still working.
It's been on its own for 20 years and it's not a system, we've been trying to get together for a few months.
It's not pressure.
People on the way, the poor on the hygiene on the way, adapt these new systems and actually make these mistakes," he said.
The Austrian Prime Minister Macura won't apply again, he doesn't want to "blow in politics"
The current island primator Tomáš Macura (ANO) will not apply in the next municipal elections.
For this reason, the effort is "not to interfere with politics," said the server Respectt.cz.
Macura, who is also a member of the UN's lead leader, is the recipient of Ostrava since November 2014.
In the municipal elections in 2018, they received a leading candidate for the UN strike in Ostrava almost three thirds of the vote.
Macura originally wanted to be in office for only four years.
"I said I'd have a functional period and with this business experience I can turn everything around and put it on my feet," said the Respect.
He added that during the second electoral period he was allowed to speak to a certain extent.
"But it's the maximum for me.
I don't want to be silly in this policy," Macura added, who in the conversation himself identified himself as a difficult introvert who does not have a common contact with people.
According to respect, there is already a longer period of speculation about the possible end of Macur in the UN.
The server recalls that Macura has repeatedly criticised the UN strike, such as the connection to the SPD strike or the support of Milose Zeman in presidential elections.
As one of the small UN personalities, he supported the Earth's resistance to Jiří Drahoš elections.
From the United Nations strike which he entered in 2017, Macura does not plan to leave.
"As long as I have the feeling that I can change something in the mood that it's not a completely important fight and that no one's in it, I don't have any immediate reason to end," said the Respect.
Sixteen-year-old Macura studied at the High School of Economics in Prague.
Before becoming an island recipient in 2014, Macura was acting as the director of the pharmaceutical company Walmark.
He also sat in other companies' organs.
Uber will return to Brna offering transport services
At the end of July, Uber will return to Brna, which offers transport services.
This is the result of the amendment of the law, which was introduced on Thursday in a press release by the Brna's Office for the Transport of Petr Kratochvil (ODS).
To Ubera in Brnä, taxi drivers protested, pointing out that Uber does not meet the conditions such as a taxi or taxi meter.
However, since July the conditions for the use of ordinary taxis and alternatives have changed.
In the last few weeks, he has completed several meetings with Uber's representatives.
"On their basis, this company decided to return to Brna at the end of July of the year.
This step is the result of a change of law which allows this company to carry out its activities legally.
The city was informed of this change and we believe that the company will carry out its services within the limits," Kratochwil said.
The murder took place in Brná in the past.
The taxi drivers protested against him because of not identifying vehicles as taxis or missing taxi meters.
The Court issued a preliminary measure which ordered Uber to drive in the city.
Brno initially supported the taxi driver, who was late in the year, but Markéta Vanková (ODS) received a notice that the city would want to take steps to make Uber work in Brná.
According to the later rulings, Uber was able to drive to Brno, but the company did not use it.
They will now return on the basis of a change of law.
From July it is paid that according to classic taxis with light and taximeter, transport service can be easier to operate with ordered and placed exclusively via mobile applications.
Too exciting celebration in Brná: the flight seat hits a meter from man to walk
From the fourth floor of the apartment she flew out on Saturday evening in Brná's office seat and came a few yards from the walker.
He was followed by a walker who immediately called the guards.
Immediately after arriving at that address in the western part of the city, the viewer looked at the open window under which she was still sitting and accompanied by several posters and nods.
"The movement that comes from the room in the fourth floor meant that there is a relatively delicious celebration within.
The guards went on their way to the apartment and asked for three young men from sixty to nine years of age to explain," told the officers' spokesman Jacob Ghanem.
Call request Rafaje testing Babish with ČSSD
Prime Minister Andrej Babish (ANO) plans to make a request to the head of the Anti-Monopol Office (UOHS) Petra Rafaje on Monday with coalitional social democracy.
In order to withdraw Rafaja, non-profit organizations called on the government's anti-corruption council and the Ustek country to meet.
Social Democrats say the change in the office's head is on the spot.
According to information from the ČTK Rafaj, the government was not invited on Monday.
The second mandate will end in the second half of the next year, the law cannot be appointed as a fourth.
His call is within the powers of President Miloše Zeman.
In response to the challenges of non-profit organisations, the Prime Minister received a letter from the Ousteck.
That's why they're supposed to be beyond other Rafa's causes since the last time.
In the last week, the prime minister refused to express his intention to make known the material and to the government to this effect "some opinion".
He also stated that the challenges he had not met with the President had not yet met with him in the near future.
According to the ÚOHS statement, there is no reason to call because Rafai was not charged with anything.
IHNED.cz and Current.cz servers wrote last week that the police were interested in Rafajo's meeting with the Heitman Jiři Chunek.
The meetings were linked together with the competition decision on the project of a new anti-trust new criminal hospital for eight billion, which Čunek is making firm progress.
The shadow of the meeting acknowledged that he was jointly resolved his "senial activity".
He's also talking about Rafay.
The representative of the Usteck region called the government at the end of June.
It also calls for the reform of the decision-making mechanisms of the Authority.
The decision of the EAGGF for public procurement by the Hajtman for the transport of Jaroslav Komínka is not transparent and has its signs of discretion.
In March, Loni was arrested by the Anti-Monopol Office because of the tendency to vote for a bribe.
This year in June, the server Current.cz warned that Rafaj enjoys being written to the company of powerful background player ČSSD Alexandra Čuba.
The loan of 3.5 million to live in Brne was paid from Rafa's account.
The President of the Authority for the Protection of Economic Competition, Rafaj, appointed the President of the former Social Democrat for a second term of office on 9 July 2009, in June 2015.
Within a few years, Rafa's second six-year term will be issued.
The Anti-Monopol Law states that the President may call the President of the Authority on a proposal from the government.
Only if it does not perform a function for a period of more than six months or seriously violates its function or independence and impartiality.
In the blannen library, the staff were codifying.
Helps air conditioning
The new technology will be 740 thousand and will be in operation in the second half of August.
"It's good news for me.
We're going to the library with three children in the center of Blanca regularly.
In the hot months, however, it was practically impossible to survive.
There was a terrible weather and a bad weather.
The wind didn't help.
That's why I like air conditioning," said one of the blannen readers Peter Novotny.
According to the book’s director Luke Dlapy, temperatures in the building were often above thirty degrees.
The south wall of the object is still cloudy, and in the sun's days it works as a locker.
"The sun is in addition to it because of the roofing building that's shuts down a lot of the day.
At the same time, it is a major problem for individual departments to issue because during the night it must be closed for safety reasons.
We often have this from the morning in the library to the thirty degrees," Dlapa said.
Most importantly, she was a student and a reader in a third floor.
And then on the floor up there's the exhibition rooms and the director.
The unacceptable climate was also in the children's section located under the roof of the building.
"Several times it happened that the libraries were working together and ended up in unemployment.
He also had a regular problem in the cultural rooms at lectures that visit dozens of people.
After a few minutes she couldn't breathe out there," Dlapa noted.
The city's representatives originally wanted to make this year's air-conditioning in all libraries.
There'll be only three rounds of five.
"Because of limited funding, climate will only have the most problematic areas.
Study and reading in the third floor.
Next, the cultural room and the children's department on the roof," Jíří Freeboda informed the blannen investment committee.
He added that in the first phase, the workers had already installed the air technology and installed the electrons in the south of the area.
About 360 thousand kroner.
The city library Blanco has at least three thousand registered readers.
That's about nine to fifteen years.
Opora Chicago avoided koronavirus.
Crawford is going back to the game
Not one of the scheduled athletes will come out with the truth.
In particular, when it comes to the NHL player who is silent about the health status of the players as a grave and does not publish anything.
As one of the little ones came out of Crawford's row.

Thousands protested in Israel against the prime minister
Thousands of Israelis in several places protested against unemployment, corruption and the way Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu resolves the Coronavir crisis.
The exhibitions were held in front of Netanyahu's private villa in the city of Caesarea near his official residence or in the park in Tel Aviv.
In Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, protests are ongoing for several weeks.
Their participants call for the rejection of Netanyahu because of the process in which it is accused of corruption and fraud, and also because of how the government resolves another wave of Coronavir epidemic.
"Bibi, go home," wrote one of the demonstrators at his transparent agency, referring to Netanjahu's generally known appearance.
"Everyone sees the Emperor losing his clothes," continued another.
Seventeen-year-old Netanyahu is Israel’s first prime minister to carry out its function.
He is accused of three causes of corruption, fraud and mistrust.
All charges are rejected and mark them for the witch.
According to local media, the process can last for up to three years, with over 300 Witnesses being called.
Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 confirmed itself in Israel, which has about nine million inhabitants, to a total of 60,500 people.
455 people were killed in connection with the accident.
In March, the Israeli government introduced quarantine measures that helped to reduce the daily growth of the affected.
After gradual release of the restrictions from the end of the deep but particularly at the end of June, the number of rebounds increased significantly.
Netanyahu’s criticism states that the government has not been able to help, for example, the farmers in the quarantine measures.
The protesting is also about the fact that the government in its fight against coronavir issues places of dispersion.
The driver broke the car over the tree and died.
The body must break out of the chest
The tragic accident took place about 23 hours ago in Neveklov on the narrow road leading from the Slapska castle.
The driver apparently rushed down to the forest at a slow pace and broke the car off the tree.
He's dead.
They had to release the body from the chest, except for the rest of the blast.
The neighborhoods are checking the police.

Pietro Philippi breaks down and stands for sustainability
The Czech flag of Pietro Filipi wants to focus on sustainability and will be allowed to change its basic strategy.
They're breaking down and they don't want to hide one collection behind another.
The fact that fashion industry is one of the biggest pollutants in the environment is no news.
In the kitchens and warehouses, it's going to end every year the billions of pieces of clothing.
A look at words fashion, sometimes delayed access to clothing, but over the last few years, relatively quickly changes.
About half of Pietro Philippi’s goods were sold at a full price.
The other half that sells thanks to me, they just don't buy.
The company does not want to hide one collection per second and at the end of each season the products are collected at their production price.
In addition, according to the owner of Michal Micky, they are far from the time of new and old collections and rapid follow-up with changing fashion trends.
"Most traders are already counted by discounts at the purchase of goods, at full price they are so covered by much higher margins.
So it's actually a little bit of a coincidence," says the owner of Pietro Filip Michal Mićka.
In addition to its access, the company wants to support the local business.
"Each of our products is made of carefully selected quality materials and designed by local designers.
We are concerned that most of our collection has been created called the base of taste - i.e. clothing that is temporary and over-sex.
Worldwide, there is a segment of premium signs of absence of any typical discount, the price of the product simply corresponds to its quality and the discount is not necessary," Mička adds.
The range of graffiti represents the RAF Kurta Tassiga flight
"The task was to create something until the end of the war.
And I remembered our flying pilot who fought in the ranks of the British Royal Air Force in World War II.
The city's management proposal was liked," said Vacek, who completed his work after fourteen days of intensive work.
He also needed 300 litres of color and 50 receptions.
Kurt Tasig was born in 1923 in Teplić-Shanov.
He left town when he was 15.
Because of his Jewish background, he was taken by the Nazis to an international camp where he was held for several weeks.
However, because of Nicholas Winton's organization, he and his brothers managed to avoid the concentration camp.
In 1939, Tassig arrived in Great Britain, where he volunteered to join the Royal Air Force (RAF), and then conducted pilot training in South Africa and Palestine.
He entered the war operations early in 1945.
After the end of the revolution, he visited Česko and his family Templica, which gave him a reputation for being honest.
Sixteen-year-old Kamil Vacek, known by people in the street art industry under the look of Camo, has been working in hot streets for over 20 years.
He started with graffiti on the surfaces for these purposes by the former Prime Minister Jaroslav Kubera (ODS).
Butre Hanna reached the coast of Texas
Hurikán Hanna arrived on the southwestern coast of Texas in the afternoon of the local time (before the end of the SELC on the night).
He invaded the Texas island of Padre Island, some 24 kilometers north of the town of Port Mansfield, and on his move he sank onto a tropical storm.
According to meteorologists, however, it poses a serious danger to coastal citizens.
He brought with him the same strong wind and intense shocks; along with local floods, electricity emissions and various material damages were reported by the AP agency, including other damaged ships.
Texas Governor Greg Abbott has already declared the state of natural disasters on the south-west of Texas on Saturday for 32 years and recommended voluntary evacuation.
The most powerful warnings were received by people from the coastal pass between Port Mansfield and the Mesquite Bay, but he had to live some 500 kilometers long before moving over northeastern Mexico.
"Even though Hanna is now a tropical storm, strong rain and wind, rise of cold, dangerous weather and a single storm may pose a threat," warned the American National Center for Hurikans (NHC).
This morning of the local time (SELČ Sunday), the storm moved in the area of the American-Mexico border and provided it with a wind speed of 85 kilometers an hour.
Hannah became the first hurricane of the year in the Atlantic.
Over the Gulf of Mexico, it was operated by a wind of up to 145 kilometers per hour, but it gradually decreased to 112 kilometers per hour, which Hann of the Hurikans category re-designed.
Local authorities have called for the storm to pass home and do not forget the hygiene measures associated with the prevention of the spread of coronavir.
Texas belongs to the United States, which the pandemic is unable to do 19 most.
In view of the ongoing security measures and the need to maintain derogations, there is a major challenge and a possible evacuation.
Provisional facilities were opened in hotels, schools and gymnasiums.
In the Texas period, Hidalgo was also affected by one of the buildings following evacuation, which had a positive test on coronavirus or were otherwise prescribed.
The local authorities have called on all evacuated persons to take rogue and disinfection gels with them in hiding if possible.
"We don't even have that far behind us yet.
We expect catastrophic floods," quoted AP Chris Birchfield, who works for the National Meteorological Service (NWS) in Brownsville.
The forecast suggests that in some places it could take up to 300 millimetres of rope within hours, in some cases without 500 millimetres, which, together with the rise of the cold, could sail a series of seats on the coast.
Land provides the general value of Colonel Lipkov
President Miloš Zeman, in the middle of his mission to Colonel Paul Lipk's generality.
This is due to a review of the expected developments of the defence ministry.
As a result of the award of the Brigadier General's value, Lipky is a Serbian move to the post of Deputy Head of the Alliance International Division of Northern Poland.
The July will still act as the representative of the Head of the Czech Army.
At the end of June, the government proposed an increase in Earth.
Since the beginning of July, the Brig-Gen Karla Réhku has been rewarded with the position of the Head of the International Division of the North East in the Polish Elblag, which is responsible for the international presence in Poland and Pobalt.
In March, the river became the head of the National Cybernetic and Information Security Agency (NUKIB).
The president's government has proposed that Lipk borrow the value of the Brigadier General.
According to the Law on Enlightenment Soldiers, higher value may be borrowed during the performance of the desired function or during the performance of the service task required by the higher value award.
The position of the representative of the Head of the Alliance Division shall correspond to the overall value.
The soldier to whom the value was borrowed has the same rights and obligations as if he had been appointed.
But there's no way to fix the fee that would satisfy the given value.
The acquisition of value takes up to a minimum of the reason for which it was granted.
"Dr. Lipka shows high professional readiness and is a model for equipment.
A significant way is to share in the performance of the tasks of the armed forces of the Czech Republic, including cooperation with foreign partners and the security of military participation in foreign operations," the Ministry of Defence pointed out in June to the proposal for an increase.
The mid-term increase will take place at 12:30 in Prague City, attended by the Minister of Defence Lubomír Metnar or Chief of General Staff Aleš Opata.
EU countries have coronavir standards for aviation
The European Union has agreed on common hygiene standards for air travel which will help to limit the spread of new coronavir.
This was announced by the German Transport Minister Andreas Scheuer.
Among the agreed standards is the maintenance of the departure or loading of roaches in aircraft and at airports, however, medium seats in aircraft will not have to remain unattended.
She reported to Tom Reuters.
"I am pleased that my colleagues have adopted a German proposal for Europe and that we have been able to comply with these uniform standards," Scheuer said at the European Aviation Conference.
The German Ministry of Transport then added that the agreement had been concluded by the officials and that it still had to be formally approved by the ministers.
The agreed measures shall include the requirement to cover the mouth and nose for passengers from six years of age, to keep the recommended departure from safety controls and airport supplies.
The aircraft must also have sufficient clean air and all information must be available in several languages.
Aerolinks will also be able to hold medium seats.
The common rules agreed by the authorities meet at least some of the requirements of air carriers.
Different standards have also caused shock.
At the Arctic Spicberkas, the heat record fell there at almost 22 degrees.
"In Longyearbyen fell 41 years old record," said the Norwegian Meteorological Institute on Twitter.
On Tuesday night, the temperature rose to 21.7 degrees Celsius, which had a record of 0.4 degrees above 1979.
Longyearbyen is the largest city on the Spicberkách, located about 1300 kilometres from the north.
Spicbers burn faster than almost any other place on Earth.
This fact highlights the dangers resulting from the invasion of other parts of the Arctic - from Aljašky to Sibiř - is mentioned in the Norwegian Centre for Climate Study in the long-term report.
The average temperature on the Spicberkás has grown from 70 to 5 degrees in the 20th century.
By the year 2100, it can even rise to 10 degrees if it does not reduce the release of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.
The increase in temperature may result in the Spicberkák as a result of this forever frozen soil, which threatens the stability of many buildings, railways or airports and may also cause a greater number of lions and seeds of the soil.
Climate warming also threatens the arctic fauna, such as the ice bears or tunnels that depend on the ice cover of the ocean.
Brits who return from Spain are waiting for the required two-week quarantine
The British public's office also called for the risk of the spread of poverty among 19 people to avoid all roads into Spain that are not necessary.
The Canary and Balearic Islands are not mentioned, however, after their return people must be isolated for two weeks.
The new rules enter into force on midnight.
"The protection of public health is our absolute priority.
We have taken this decision to prevent the possible spread of the virus in Britain," said the British diplomat in his statement.
"We have always made it clear that if this is necessary, we will immediately remove from the list of safe ones," he added.
As noted by the British Letter Metro, the latest announcement will cover thousands of British travel plans.
Spain is one of the most popular holiday destinations.
The British also have other concerns about whether they will be paid in cash if they have to end up after their return from the holiday for 14 days in isolation.
For example, Neil Hunter from Sittingbourne signed a ten-day leave on Lanzarote, and they had to leave on Tuesday.
The west has been ordered since December.
"We were supposed to go all over my family, my wife Amanda and daughter Bethany, but to be honest, after this announcement I don't know what's going to happen.
I work as a engineer and I don't think my employer will agree that I'll be back from my two weeks in quarantine," quoted Metro Hunter.
As regards Spain, there are concerns that the country is at the beginning of the second wave of epidemic.
In the last two days, more than 900 new ones have been assigned there every 24 hours.
In some areas, authorities have already introduced coronavir measures, for example, in Catalan they are trying to limit all night life and prevent people from getting into big trouble.
The Czech Ministry of Foreign Affairs has recently warned of the increased risk of fines in Catalan, Aragonia, Basque and the area of Madrid.
Model of electricity purchase from Dukvan per government
The government on Monday is a perennial model of electricity purchase from the planned new block Jader electricity Dukovan.
The proposal for a law is based on the difference between the price of the purchase price higher than the price of the electricity on the market, and the difference will be paid to all consumers by means of tariffs.
In the second case, when the price of the ransom is lower than the price on the market, it will have a negative impact on consumers.
Power is an irregular part of the final electricity price for the pickers.
Vicepremier and Minister of Industry Karel Havliček (for the United Nations) and the energy company ČEZ have already indicated that the most likely option is that people will be saved by electricity building.
However, analysts point out that the long-term view of electricity prices on the markets is always uncertain, which has been demonstrated several times in the past.
The intention was already criticised by environmental organisations.
"The purchase price can be as low as the market price of power electricity, so above it.
The final impact during the applicationability of the rules can be both negative and positive.
The impact will be spread between customers by the size of the security, either at lower consumption or at higher electricity consumption," said the Ministry of Industry and Commerce (MPO).
The Havliček said in May that it assumes that the wholesale price of electricity plants and people on the Dukovan building is being made.
Otherwise, it will affect tens of generations per year for the family, which, according to it, is far less than people pay for electricity invoices in support of so-called supported resources.
He previously estimated that the price of the ransom could be moved between 50 and 60 euros (about 1320 to 1600 Kč) per megawaterhodine (MWh).
The submitted material does not contain any proposal of the amount, shall be contained in the purchase contract.
The price of electricity at the Prague Energy Exchange for the year 2021, which is now the most expensive for traders, is currently around 45 euros (as much as 1190 Kč) per MWh.
"In the difference between the purchase price and the market price of electricity at a maximum of EUR 10 it could make an increase in average household consumption of 3.3 MWh per year - it could correspond to four-member households, standardly equipped by electric consumers, including electrical safe boards and pipes which, however, do not use electricity for heating and heating of hot water - less than 100 KC/year," wrote the MPO government.
"We are living in a turbulent turbulent time.
Pandemia told us how vulnerable the global economy is.
For this reason I consider the long-term market price advertising to be a very speculative matter," the Czech Executive Director of the Energy Financial Group told Tomáš Voltr.
The contested law shall be calculated by means of the purchase by the MPO, respectively, by a legal entity owned by the State at a pre-defined price.
The agreement between the investor and the State guaranteeing conditions for the purchase of electricity would be concluded at least for 30 years, with a possible extension of ten years, and this is repeated, however, not until the end of the production of low-carbon products.
The low-carbon production proposal defines electricity production as a nuclear reactor connected to an electrical system with installed capacity of 100 megabytes (MW) after 2030.
The Havlaček pointed out earlier that a new dukavan block should be operated 1200 MW and produce nine terawatthodin electricity annually, which would correspond to tens of thousands of expected Czech consumption.
The block should be introduced into operation in 2036.
The funding model for the new Duckovan block was approved by the government on Monday.
The facility should be funded annually by the State at the construction stage, which is calculated by a two-percent rate.
With the funding model, it does not agree with the opposition, and it also concerns the possibility that the Dukovans would set up Russian or Chinese companies.
The state should share 70 percent of the building.
The remainder should be paid to the company ČEZ, which will also collect all appropriate additional costs.
ČEZ Director General Daniel Benez said in the Czech Republic in April that the expected amount for building a block at current prices is six billion euros gross (about 162 billion koruna).
The contracts between the State and the Czech Republic on the construction of a new Dukovan block will be signed on Tuesday.
The Ministry for Local Development has stood up to support tourism in the media for two billion
According to the Ministry for Local Development (MMMR)'s plan to spend on the media, the Internet and billboards for advertising approved in the Czech Republic by two billion korunas, the agency stood out of the memoranda.
Minister Klara Dostal (for ANO) of the server ListReport.cz said the material is still working.
On the eKlep document (electronic library of the legislative process) he warned Ztransaly.cz on Friday.
The Ministry's plan led to the spread of road traffic due to coronavir.
During the Coronavir crisis, there was a loss of income and media.
The proposal called for the criticism of opposition and the representatives of the road movement.
According to the proposal that is now to be monitored on the hyldacstat.cz website, MMR has planned to provide public agencies with support for the CzechTourism travel money on television, radio, print, Internet, billboards or surfaces on the premises.
Most of the money, and it's 700 million koruna to get TV.
Most of them would get private TV Nova and Prima.
Printed dailys and weeks would get 400 million and the same share would provide MMR for PR articles, advertising banners and videos on websites.
The radio stations would have received 350 million for the media campaign, most of which would be the private station again.
The remaining 150 million would be used for outdoor advertising on billboards, LEDs and surfaces on buildings or in meters.
The campaign to support travel in Czech had to start in half of August and last for a year.
"The material is still working, which is certainly not in the form that should be presented," Dostal said without further details on the list of reports.
Material criticised opposition, according to TOP 09 Chief of the Markets of Pekar Adam, would benefit from the media from the trust funds of Prime Minister Andreje Babish (ANO).
"I firmly believe that this showdown will be achieved on the ground at the election of the wound between the eyes," she wrote on her Twitter.
He denies that it's actually about helping with the media crisis.
"It can be a coincidence, I don't know anything about media support," said D.N.
According to it, the budget is two billion orientations.
"Of course we're still counting it, it can be less and more.
It's a working material," she added.
Let's take the initiative to save tourism does not give a media campaign to support home tourism.
"We want two billion for travel companies, not the remaining advertising campaign," President Tomáš Barčík said on Sunday.
If there are two billion crowns in the state budget, they should be directed to companies, never mediated, write an initiative in an open letter to the government.
Life-threatening, boiling beer and death as a tree
The third album called Death is the stable of the Brnian Basin, an outstanding organizer of cultural activities and publisher Jaroslav Erika Friche, who left the same year, on May 24.
In Frič's discography, there are five positions and similar to those in previous titles and here is the main focus on Frič's poetry, which is itself an excellent interpreter.
Frič, 1949, was significantly influenced by the American beta generation, this inspiration was all over his own, personal experiences and also a great demonstration of faith.
There was, however, some aggression on them if he spoke or wrote about faith, about God, it was always very intimate, unaggressive, quite tolerant.
He attacks me in this connection with Bohuslav Reynek (in contrast to Jan Zahradníčk), the mystery of change.
Fričov's album offers record of author reading from 2006, but also shows with musicians who have always made it very sensitive, whether it's already a violinist Josef Klč or Honza Bartonë and Vítezslav Holata.
I am happy to help you - the words of the island bassnik Petra Hrušky on the long bass stocks of Frič.
"She sent from them pride and endless rage," Hruška writes, "to put our world at risk.
The world, which is increasingly falling into widespread consumerism and greed, is becoming increasingly alienated from what its soul has been created from - from the secret of faith, humility and human closeness.
He called them a set of people who know that the values for which he was created are of little interest, but who also knows that because of general non-interest, they cannot be spoken of.
They certainly reminded us that a person may have to come to terms with all the expensive things, but it's not inconceivable how it comes about.
If he sells himself into a general accident, he's sceptically giving up, he's afraid to shut up, or he's left to the last moment in calm and proud of what he believes and what he loves."
Paroubek is not my counselor, Hamácek said
The former Prime Minister and President of the ČSSD Jiři Paroubek is not a pleasant advisor to social democracy.
The Chair of the Party and the Minister of Interior Jan Hamáček only communicates with him and reads his views and articles.
The Hampocket said it on Prima Party TV today.
About the fact that Paroubek should be Hamáčk's adviser, the server informed the list of the reports.cz on Friday.
"From time to time we write an essay, he sometimes sent me some material and I read it," Hamaček said today.
He added, however, that there is no agreement on official and appropriate cooperation.
ČSSD considers that there is no means to pay for similar purposes.
"The fact that I sometimes read his opinion, so many such people," he said.
In the next discussion with ODS MP Janu Černoch said that many ODS members still "really listen to Václava Klaus's views".
It's okay, he says, because it's an experienced policy and former party president, which is also the case of Paroubka.
The fact that they're making an affair from this media has marked the annual harvest season.
Server ListReport.cz wrote on Friday that Paroubek plays a role in Hamáčk's informal consultant.
He also wrote that the fourth candidate place of the party in the port country was directed by the former President of the House of Lord Petr Benda, who is associated with Paroubk and acted as Vice-President of his party LEV 21.
The Hampocket said today that the composition of the candidate will not comment until it is ready and approved.
Duplantis has a nice smile, it's a bastard in the back, it's Swedish challenger
The 22-year-old American poet has ambition and the potential to become the most important competitors of the new ruler.
He already knows what it's like to win two years younger Duplantis, the Loney won it at the University of NCAA.
"We had a fight a year ago, then he won and I was second, then we passed it.
In both cases it was a very good fight," says Nilsen, who won a 5.95-foot performance.
Since that time, Duplantis has been shooting a lot higher and is currently found in the highest tidal regions of the world.
In just twenty years, he became a world recordr, and on February 8, in Toruni, he crossed the boat at a height of 6,17 metres, and a week later he added another centimetre in Glasgow.
"He jumped six meters already in 18 years when he finished high school," recalls his breeder Nilsen for World's web athletes.
"It was clear that as soon as he grew up from a boy in a man, all his potential and talent disappeared.
Twenty years is a good time to jump the world record," it is thought.
The fact that Nilsen's number of successes is more likely to be recognized than the one who is proud of Duplantis is a US-like target.
In July, Loni won a gold medal at the Pan American Games in Lima, and in 2017 he was on the American championship at the World Championship at the end of 13.
Then the closest lover to him is first to try Diamond's league.
"It is definitely my priority to get to the professional class and to run as much as possible in the Diamond League because there you can make a name," he says.
"If you can succeed at this level, you can no doubt carry on actions like Olympic games, world skills or Pan American games."
Because of the pandemic, however, these summits are reproducing what gives Nilesen and other fans time to improve.
But will this be enough to find Duplantis, which could easily turn the race under five rounds into a single silver file?
"Everyone's trying to reach him, but I don't think it'll be possible in the nearest time," Nilsen thinks.
"This guy's been jumping for 16 years and he's got over all the other nice kisses in his training."
And before Tokyo starts, 2021, she'll want to raise it again.
A woman lost statistics from the invalid son's pension.
She's waiting for her trial.
The money that a 33-year-old man receives from the state as a disability pension is intended in particular to improve the quality of his life.
A woman who's been in prison for eight years is in danger of betrayal.
Because of his poor health, the judge of the patient’s right to self - control and his mother set up a nursery that was to save his sons’ money.
"A woman from the middle of November 2013 to the spring of this year used part of the funds from the invalid son's pension for her needs and prepared it for 440 thousand crowns," stated police spokesman Dana Ladman, claiming that the accused woman was in particular obliged to cover the interests of the injured person.
According to the order of the Court of First Instance, the wife arranged an account for the son of Jesse that his debt was allowed to be sent to her account.
"After payment of the costs associated with the stay of the son in the medical facility and the compensation of the necessary medicines, the remaining financial resources for the purchase of vehicles, electricity and household goods have been used," they complain.
That he can't use his son's money for his own needs, the woman admitted.
But she was concerned about helping them pay for their family expenses.
"We had problems from our incomes to encourage homelessness.
We never bought anything over standard.
It was always on the things the son would approve of.
I thought it was family money.
I didn't hesitate to let that criminal act go," the woman explained to the police.
She promised her son's money would come back.
North America has been frozen for 30,000 years, claims scientists to find tools
Finds from the Chiquihuite lake in the Mexican state of Zacatecas include the 1930s instruments of steaming, including fine sharps that could be used for cutting meat, and sharp objects that could serve as cracks or cups.
Scientists have found that the oldest of the tools are from 33,000 to 31,000 years ago.
"There are only a few products of this age.
But they are here," Archeologist Ciprian Ardelean of the University of Zacatecas and the main author of one of the two studies that were published on this subject in the journal Nature.
The youngest tools reach the age of 12,500 years.
According to experts, the Chiquihuite sharks, located at the great sea level, lived for 20,000 years.
Last year, a generally accepted theory was that the first representatives of the Homo sapiens species crossed the railway bridge of Russia today in Alaska 13 500 years ago.
Archaeological evidence, including the unique caves used to kill mammals and other prehistoric animals, has shown that this cloning culture has subsequently spread to most North America.
This model, however, was obtained in recent decades when several ancient castes, which were about two to three thousand years old, were discovered.
In the second study published in the journal Nature, there are 42 different locations throughout North America that show human presence on the continent over the period from 26,000 to 19,000 years ago.
Scientists believe that small numbers of people could have come to North America before it was predicted.
Some of them were able to get ships to America.
"It is clear that people in America were long before the development of so-called Clovis culture," said the new anthropologist Ruth Gruhn of the University of Canada, Albert.
An interest in flights is already filling up an optimistic scenario, claims the seller.
The prices are gradually reduced.
He's selling a plane in the Czech Republic growing every week.
In contrast to the long summer, interest continues to grow half the time, but demand increases by up to 20 per cent every week.
The post-crisis development, according to salesmen, complements the most optimistic scenarios.
The prices of the flight are also gradually reduced.
Among the most sought-for destinations are, in particular, the South-European States.
According to the Kiwi.com data, Spain, Italy and Greece.
At the Portal of Letuska.cz the most are sold flights to the Croatian Split.
From other countries, then, Great Britain is the most sought-for-profit, which has always belonged to the most difficult destination.
The average price of the flight is also reduced.
At the Portal of Letuska.cz, the hole moved about 6250 kroner per month, at an average of 3000 kroner less.
This is due in particular to an increase in the demand for a European destination which is currently about 85 per cent of sales.
In addition, prices vary from one European place to another, such as Spain or Italy in the last few weeks, to about five.
The crisis has also affected the behaviour of customers who now buy planes with much less than before because they are afraid of further development of the coronavir situation.
According to previous information Kiwi.com, the buy-in period before the flight was reduced by an average of 10 days.
"It confirms this future trend when people order flights with much less advance, they will require greater flexibility, less risk," said Vice-President for Kiwi.com Šindelár.
Currently, the average booking time is 21 days before flight.
Along with the increase in sales, there are also the number of renewed flights from Česka.
At the Prague airport, regular lines are currently operating for more than 60 destinations.
About half of the destination is due to the long summer season.
Big finals already tonight!
Follow the climber battle of life on New Sport
The second most prestigious tournament within the PDC organisation led to a large final.
It presents an experienced 19-year-old Scottish poet Gary Anderson and the surprise of a tournament, the six-year-old Belgian Dimitri van den Berg.
Gary Anderson ordered Justin Pip in the first round, then found his neighbor in a table pocket.
However, James Wade and I were consulted, and on the fourth floor, he probably got sick with Simon Whitlock, who had previously sent the world unit home.
"Flying Scots" had a little in the semifinals when he hit Michael Smith.
But for the last time, he ran away from the dignitaries from the lopaties, which in the long run dominated and after 18:16 defeated a place in the final tournament that he had already ruled in 2018 when Mensura Surjevike was defeated in a great battle at 21:19.
The biggest surprise of the World Matchplay is Dimitri van den Bergh.
The Belgian talent is enjoying the tournament, and maybe knowing he has nothing to lose, helped him to play a really fantastic holiday.
Sixteen-year-old skipper first miraculously ordered the world's sixth Nathan Aspinall, and in a dramatic battle, Joa Cullen and in the fourth quarter final, Adrian Lewis also succeeded.
The big check was semi-final.
Glen Durrant immediately showed his strength at the start, but in the calmness of the Belgian player, then gained the excellent series, which then kept him mostly free of problems until the end.
Van den Berg showed his strength in high scoring, which caused temporary double uncertainty.
Coronavir has been reported at least since the beginning of the week, with a decrease in the number of tests
Since the beginning of March, when a new Coronavirus was first discovered in the Czech Republic, 15 212 people have been shown to be infected.
About 9,600 of them have already been treated, 368 patients have died.
At present there are 5,254 people.
This is based on data from the Ministry of Health's website.
The daily number of new confirmed cases this week exceeded four times twice as many as two hundred.
Maxim was a fifth 281 case.
On Thursday, there were 235 positive tests, on the day before 246 and on Tuesday 206.
On the first working day of this week, 169 were ordered.
In the Czech Republic, 9,590 people were already treated, and 63 per cent of all people were still infected.
In most cases, she had a mild transition.
According to the latest data from the Ministry of Health of 151 people with koronavir, condition 19 of these are considered to be important by the doctor.
In the Czech Republic there are a number of obstacles to human-19.
The most ordered in the last seven days in the budget of 100 thousand people is still in Karvinsko, which is almost 59.
It follows the period of Jihlava with 56 and Früdecko-City with 36 assigned to 100 thousand inhabitants in the last week.
As a result of an increase in the number of ordered payments in the Czech Republic since Saturday, new measures against the spread of coronavir have been taken.
People have to wear clothes on internal mass events over 100 people, it's cultural and sports actions, but it's also weddings and funerals inside buildings.
From Monday, then, the capacity of these actions will be limited to half a million people.
In the world, the number of people who have been exposed to a new cancer virus has already exceeded the limit of 16 million.
It was introduced by the U.S. University of Johns Hopkins, which is a global pandemic development.
The balance of the victims who died with the disability of 19 people is estimated at 645 thousand.
The latest million infected came to statistics in just three days; the limit of 15 million fell on 22 July.
Most of the rapid increase in the number of cases occurred in the United States in recent days, which already account for over 4.1 million infected people, Brazil with 2.4 million and India, where nearly 1.4 million people have been infected by the authorities.
The people who are affected are now getting a record rate.
The World Health Organization announced this week that from Thursday to Friday there were more than 284 thousand new cases worldwide, which is the highest daily balance since the beginning of the pandemic.
This development can be attributed to the fact that the spread of the ban is high in the countries of the United States, Brazil or India, according to the Reuters agency, but the number of new cases in recent weeks has grown in almost 40 countries around the world.
This applies, for example, to Australia, Japan, Bolivia, Sudan, Bulgaria, Belgium or Israel.
The ban has already appeared in almost all countries of the world, and the first case has been officially announced today by KLDR.
The air in the homes is up to five times worse than outside.
Healthy damage to fresh air and deodorants
Health threatens not only the bad quality of air in outer space, but also the home.
The Israeli public health expert Carol Abraham, quoted earlier in The Jerusalem Post, warned of this.
According to Abraham, who was responsible for creating the Israeli Ministry of the Protection of the Environment, it is necessary to focus on damages in homes right now when many people spend more time working from home.
